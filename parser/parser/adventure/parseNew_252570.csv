												I'm very impressed with this game so far.Considering it was built by one person, this is a lot of work that could have fooled me into thinking a larger studio was behind it! The concept of the labyrinth and all the terrifying enemies lurking within is a very strong idea for a game. The dev could have taken the easy way out and just made it a simple linear hack and slash game. But instead there are procedurally generated environments, a host of different enemies, a stealth option, and even a simple economy. The hard work really speaks for itself and I'm very happy to support it. Depths of Fear: Knossos is a fun experience that I can't wait to continue playing.			"

												I find it difficult to recommend this game because it's largely unchanged from early access. The concept is really great, you're navigating a series of randomly generated mazes as you avoid monsters from Greek mythology. It's a cool idea but the stealth doesn't always work and the levels are so dark you can barely see a thing.The sound and lighting is really good and there are some spooky sections, but the overall thing just feels unfinished and still like it's in development. This is not a full release as far as I'm concerned.Here's hoping they keep patching it and fixing things up.Full video review:

												I just started getting into it, but so far its great. for a less than $10 game, its amazing. The graphics have a cool retro-chic thing going on. They're not quite up-to-date (as you'd probably expect from a title like this) but the devs used some cool filters to give it a unique look which combined with somewhat decent dynamic lighting make a game that can have some impressive moments visually. The environments have some range and depth and most pull off a good spooky vibe. The monsters illicit proper ""Oh S***! A MONSTER!"" reactions. The historic/mythical setting is tastefully executed. If it interests you enough to be reading this, buy it. At the price, you can't go wrong.			"

												*UPDATE 5-15-14* (This game is a total blast and a steal for $5.99; Phil, the dev, and John, from publishing are consistently on the forums answering questions and keeping players updated on future patches; I have beat the game thrice, I've gotten all achievements, and I've played for almost 19 hrs)Depths of Fear Knossos is a randomly generated- immersive- atmospheric- horror- stealth- action- first person- dungeon crawler in which you play a Greek on a quest to defeat the great Minotaur in The Labyrinth.Surprisingly this game is VERY good. It provides a wonderful mix of genres and is a blast to play. You start out in a hub world with multiple different dungeons. Within each dungeon there are three levels where you can get weapons, coins (to buy weapons), and books (supplies the player with tips and lore) and you do platforming, combat, stealth, and light puzzles. And the main objective for those three levels is to get the gold key to progress to the next level. The fourth (and final) level is a boss fight with whatever creature (saytr, manticore, etc) is the ""mascot"" of that specific dungeon.The best part of the game has to be the absolutely phenomenal sound and music design. The sound is very atmospheric and scary. Everytime a boss spots you in one of the dungeons, techno-dubstep music starts playing which is very well made and very unique for a game that takes place in Ancient Greece. *there is no voice acting which may annoy some people but I like not having that*The graphics are pretty good: Bloom effect, lighting, vignetting, some textures, object models, architecture, etc.The story is pretty straightfoward- go into the labyrinth, kill things, defeat the minotaur, bang some hot Greek chicks (most likely :D) and the lore is surprisingly strong. All the lore in this game is acquired through books or pieces of parchment and is heavily inspired by surprise Ancient Greek mythology!And now for the not so good/ bad: It's got some bugs (clipping, animation problems, spawning of objects and enemies in some levels, etc) Also some textures and foliage doesnt look the greatest. And the stealth mechanics are very simplistc, barebones, and broken. (atm)Overall this game has great lore, atmosphere, combat, level design, and sound and music design. And on top of all that, the game never grows old. It consistently gives you great enterntainment. I can recommend this game to anyone who wants a thrilling gaming experience for the low low price of $5.99.*Review copy was provided by Dirigo Games and Digital Tribe; Thank you!*			"

												If you're anything like me you grew up with your father, uncle, or brother forcing you to watch classic Ray Harryhausen films with the dinosaurs and the mythological beasties and all that jazz. And if you continue to be eerily similar to me you didn't appreciate it at the time. ""BUT DAD, THIS IS CORNY AND TERRIBLE."" And if you continue, despite the NUMEROUS cease and desist orders, to be essentially me, you love those movies now. That janky, claymation silliness. It's a nostalgic gold mine, watching the Seventh Voyage of Sinbad and the old Clash of the Titans movie. If you aren't familiar with these classics, check them out. They're all probably on Youtube and Netflix. They're charming, epic, and they've aged surprisingly well. ""Depths of Fear: Knossos"" captures that Harryhausen spirit.You are young Theseus, patron badass of Athens. You've opted to join the unhappy sacrifices this year at Minotaurapalooza on Crete to finally end angsty cuckold king Minos' cruel subjugation of your people. You're tossed into the Labyrinth, Daedalus' engineering feat meant to contain the Minotaur. Minos' daughter gives you further incentive: defeat my gross half-brother and we can abscond and make kissy faces forever! That's the story. Fans of antiquity and mythology will have a blast as they head into each arena facing Greek beasts of legend and myth: the satyr, the centaur, and of course Minos' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bull son himself. You'll descend, roguelike, deeper and deeper into the Labyrinth, grabbing weapons and facing standard, killable foes while avoiding the main baddie until you reach the end, facing off in a lava arena death match.This game is not the prettiest. Lighting is pretty good... and the mosaics/columns really put you in the setting. But the enemies and combat are clunky and ugly. But it still works! It feels great to stealthily complete an area, grabbing loot and potions, praying to deities for assistance. It's also very tense. You'll walk slowly through each area, grabbing coins, finding books with clues, and lighting your torch ocassionally to better see and then BAM, you hear the telltale bleat of a satyr. Now you're hoofin' it, pun unintended.For fans of mythology, for fans Ray Harryhausen and bygone filmmaking techniques, pick this up. It's absurdly cheap and absurdly fun.The Minotaur awaits.			"

												Please note: at the time of writing this review, I have only played through the first set of levels, involving the satyr.Is it perfect? No.It has more than its fair share of problems - mostly minor things, like the sound of the satyr's hoofsteps not matching up with his actual animated hoofsteps - but a few fairly major things too. I personally haven't experienced anything totally game-breaking as of yet, but looking at some of the other reviews, it seems that past versions of the game had bugs which made it entirely unplayable.With that out of the way:Is it fun? Hell yes.The sneaking segments (i.e. most of the game) are randomly generated and have good variety, while the end-stages of each branch, wherein you must face head-on the monster you've, up until then, been skulking around in the shadows to avoid, feel like Quake with melee weapons. I gleefully await the day when I've gathered enough gold coins to buy the crossbow, so I can leap over railings and shoot zombies and skeletons in the head before whipping out my gladius as I land to finish off the rest.Other thoughts:At first I was confused by the old-timey grainy film filter, but I think it really adds to the aesthetic the game is trying to capture. The whole game feels like a top-down dungeon adventure game from the early 90s, but from a first-person perspective. The walls and floors look deceptively detailed and smooth from far off, but up close, many of the textures are almost Minecraft-esque in their pixelation. Every aspect of the game, from the retro, almost-8-bit soundtrack, to the score screens at the end of each level, to the somehow-always-there-to-sell-you-things shopkeeper at the beginning of each level, adds to this effect. And boy, does it work for me.That the whole game is based around Greek mythology only increases my enjoyment, having been a lover of mythology my whole life. You play as Theseus, for crying out loud. The shopkeeper? Daedalus. There are shrines scattered about the levels at which you can offer collected knowledge in exchange for divine powers, and the tooltip for the shrine of Poseidon reads (to paraphrase) ""Poseidon: King of the Waves, Your Father, God of the Ocean"". The fact that they just casually mention that Poseidon is Theseus' real father, and don't bother to offer any explanation? It made me squee.I am a huge nerd.At any rate, this game is worth far more than six dollars. If it goes on sale again, you'd be insane not to grab it.			"

												I don't know if to love this game or to hate it. It has a pretty badass concept of having to fight legendary monsters from Greek mythology in eerie dark dungeons, but it's just executed so badly that I am only left disappointed.The levels seem to be randomly generated, and your main goal is to slay 7 legendary creatures so that you can unlock a weapon that will let you defeat the final challenge - the Minotaur. The atmosphere is great. It really is spooky and keeps you on the edge of your seat. But it's also ridiculously dark and you can barely see anything, even with your torch fully lit. Switch off the torch and you might as well play with your eyes closed, because there won't be any difference.The creatures are all crazy overpowered. They all seem to have tonnes of health, some get backup from lesser creatures, and some can even 1-hit kill you. To add salt to the wound, even if you try to be stealthy and hide in the shadows, the creatures still spot you a lot of the time, from behind walls or far corners of the map. You can't hide from them and you can't beat them. You just keep dying over and over.There are some weapons you can buy before going into the dungeon areas, but those cost a lot of gold, and gold can only be found in the dungeon areas themselves, and you can't backtrack to the shop once you're in the dungeon. The only way out is to either complete the level or to die, and when you die, you lose all the gold you've found in that level. So you just end up having to face impossible odds with weak weapons over and over.The game also seems to lag a fair bit. I put all the settings to low and switched off camera fx, and the best I can do is to run it at a stable 12 FPS. I guess that makes those hard battles even harder.Overall, I kind of wish this game was streamlined a bit better, to let the player get better and be able to challenge stronger creatures with time and persistence. From the almost 2 hours I've played of this game, I've gotten nowhere. I did gain some fun out of getting killed in funny ways and recording it, but that eventually gets old and you just wish to be able to actually play the game as it was intended. Not a bad game, but try at your own risk. Unfortunately I can't recommend it in its current state.			"

												I bought this full price on a whim and I am glad I did.This is a first person game where you play as Theseus exploring the labyrinth of Minos. The Greek mythology was certainly a refreshing take for me. Instead of just having a generic beacon guiding you to the next objective (which your objectives are just defeating mythical beasts until you face a terrifying minotaur),the game instead explains that Apollo is guiding you. You can also pray to the gods for favors (spells), the labyrinth is designed to change randomly everytime you play, and Daedalus himself sells you weapons.The atmosphere of the game is done really well. The first message you get, tacked on to a wall, warns you to try to avoid the satyr. And it is pretty unnverving the first time you hear a satyr cry out for you as you inch towards the exit in the dark. This is not a visceral horror game, but rather this is more a game of terror: if you wander the corridors with the lights out, you might be able to keep the monsters from finding you, but without  a torch to guide you, you face uncertainty. Pits of spikes, pillars that spit fire, the undead grabbing at you, and the monsters of old. You might think you can find comfort in the dark, but you should know that they can find you. However, terror is only the flash and boom of a storm, and you will find that monsters can be killed and that death only means restarting.You can play the game just sneaking around or you can go in weapons swinging and there is also some platforming sections.You begin in a small hub area and then make your way to a room of the labyrinth each room is marked with the monster that awaits you on its door. During the levels you will face monsters in the dark, and the boss of that room will wander around trying to find you, and if you kill him he will just respawn a bit later.Your main goal is to grab a key hidden somewhere in the level and then unlock the door to the exit.Aside from your torch you can also pick up a ball of twine to help you through the labyrinth, or if you are lucky you can even get a potion that lets you see in the dark. After a certain amount of levels per room in the labyrinth  you will have to face the monster of that realm in an arena.This isn't the kind of game that you spend hundreds of hours unlocking items or grinding; it is fairly short with only a few weapons and spells to help you slay the mythical beasts that hide in the dark. It was a really enjoyable experience and this was a surprise hit for me.What is a bit of let down though is that I found the boss rooms to generally be easier than the levels preceding them. However, just when I think I have the game all figured there were some curve balls.So now it's time to let you know that this game isn't perfect. The graphics are probably the biggest elephant in the room, so yes the animation and quality are poor, but that's never bothered me in a game. Aside from that there are some definite bugs. Unfortunately the game crashes before it saves when I am near beating the last level before the minotaur, but this bug might have been fixed since it has been awhile and the developers are pretty responsive. So yes it definitely looks outdated, and sometimes the gameplay doesn't feel that solid.That being said, I feel like this game does more things right than wrong and I think it is worth checking out. I came in with no expectations and walked away satisfied. So, if you look behind the flaws this is a pretty neat game that probably won't win any awards, but it could give you some hours of entertainment.			"

												Ray Harryhausen was brought back from the dead and hired to reboot the Chess Master series. He instead took acid and gave them this.I loved the experience this game gave me for the first two hours. It's so different and frankly ""janky"". There were times where I was screaming ""What is going on ?"" for 10 to 15 minutes at a time.The game randomly generates levels for you to navigate through in the pitch black. It's one of the scariest first encounters I've ever had with a game but, it wears off fast. You figure out how everything works and move on.The issue I had with the game is how it goes about doing the ""random"" business.It seems like sometimes you can get a spawn with no loot, no mobs, no...anything, except for the creature your trying to avoid. I went through the last levels ( last four bosses with three levels each) with literally no mob spawns. This turns the game into run as fast as possible and get the key and leave the level...and also made the game extremely easy... It killed the original fun I had through the first two hours,The only reason why I'm not upset or on here crying about it is because, this was just my luck. Other players who've I've played along side with had 100% completely different experiences that sounded amazing...and that's what I love about Depths of Fear :: Knossos or at least what it's trying to do. The idea that was behind it.What makes this review even harder to write is the fact the things I loved about this game, I'm not entirely sure they were intentional from the dev.Such as these cattywampus events- Music not properly playing- Sounds not properly working- Lighting issues (so frigging dark you can't see anything to blinding rays of death)I'll put it like this. I never saw this game (lighting wise) as it's shown in the trailers or the screen shots. I checked the settings and maybe I'm just not bright enough to find where to fix or change it.My experiences was running through the dark with a somewhat useless torch and falling into pits of spikes, lava, ants, deadly gases, and all other manner of horrible business that I couldn't fully see.- Getting stuck in walls and the floor far too often- Beautiful graphics that sometimes look like you're playing Minecraft in a TF2 server    (you'll know what I mean if you've played it)All these things and more made my experience a blast and I don't mean this in a sarcastic way.This game and it's sole developer are totally worth your time. I do however, recommend you pick it up during a steam sale though.I hope the dev can learn from player feedback and improve upon what they've done with this title.I can't wait for the follow-up to this game that's planned for 2015.- A barely understandable review written by someone who has no idea how to make video games.TL;DR: That damn goat needs to buy some pants.

												I only had about an hour with this game, but my short experience with this game was not pleasant. I did not like this game, and will probably never pick it up again after this review.Good:I will say one good thing about this game:I really like the setting and feel it has. There is a depressing and dark mood it establishes right from the start. There aren't a lot of greek-themed games quite like this either, which is refreshing, and the adventure itself is uncomfortably tense. Dragged out of a cell, thrown into a dark maze, running through shadows avoiding traps and monsters to find the key to the next level of the maze. It does have a rather good feel about it.And the sound effects are alright. Nothing impressive, but that's not a bad thing so long as they work when they should.Bad:It didn't take me a long time for me to tell that this game was not going to be fun. I'm only going off my experience with the first few levels of the Satyr's dungeon, but first impressions are what matters, and despite this game's good mood there just isn't any good gameplay to match.Firstly, this game feels very easy. Regular enemies like zombies and skeletons die in one or two hits from the starting weapon, and the Satyr is ridiculously easy to escape from. It just feels all wrong. This game should be challenging, sudden, and frightening, but every attempt I made told me otherwise; sometimes I cleared floors running around with my torch lit and never got hit once. Finally, I also noticed your health regenerates when you are close to death, or at least appears to.And on the note of the Satyr, his walk animation looks ridiculous, and like most regular enemies his A.I. is just stupid. every other level he gets stuck on a corner, and his torch will clip through the wall; causing unsightly lighting glitches. Regular enemies also have a tendency to go through prop things and spawn on top of breakable props; which just looks silly for a game that is trying to be serious and tense.And a few things just don't seem to work at all. There are these spinning turrets that look like they are designed to shoot fire, but I jumped right in front of one once and it didn't do anything. Another time I found a book that warns that the Satyr has a charging attack, but he never used it on me whenever he found me, and would instead walk towards me as usual. The Satyr doesn't even have a change in stance when he finds you. He just howls once, and then proceeds to walk towards you at the exact same pace he does when he wanders around.This game isn't scary either. I didn't find a brightness setting in the menu, and it was easy to see through the darkness without ever using the torch. Most of the time I never did use the torch. And the slow response of the enemies kind of takes away any pressure the game attempts to give you. The music is also all wrong for a game that should be scarier than what it is. Regular enemies should be creepy and unexpected, but they are often stupid and easy to spot. The monsters should be quick to take advantage of the player, and a pain to confront; but they seem so plain.I also noticed this game has a lot less depth than it likes to think it has. You get gold to buy weapons, but there are only eight, and they don't seem to be all that special from each other. What potential variety and interest there would be to gathering gold to buy some of the nicer weapons is destroyed by the fact that weapons spawn randomly too; meaning I got a really nice axe on the second level of my first attempt on this game.There is also some 'lore' that you can obtain from books, but most books don't say anything at all and just give you 'lore points' to unlock magic abilities. For a game about mythical monsters, this game doesn't even take the time to include anything more than the most basic information about the enemy, such as ""the Satyr has poor vision in the dark"" and instead opts to include a bunch of nameless books to collect.I guess 'book is for magic, not reading' is an acceptable gaming theme, but I think there is a huge wasted potential in doing that for this particular game. I want to know more about the maze and the monsters and how they work!Everything else about this game is just awkward and poor. Exits have a glow that is actually a thin plane that you can sort of clip through; said glow also looking very strange in certain dark areas. You jump pretty high and fall slowly, and it almost feels like you are on the cusp of gliding. Weapon pickups are HUGE for some reason. You can pick up random potions that you identify by drinking, some of which are poison, but since you can't use poison for anything other than to hurt yourself its basically just an annoying to catch new players and nothing else.I never really considered newbie traps to be a good thing for a game. Maybe it is acceptable for a game that is supposed to be 'roguelike' but it feels cheap to me.Lastly, this game loves to crash on me, which is why I don't have more than an hour yet. But I won't hold that against the game either. that could just be me.Still, summing up my short experience, I can't say I was too fond of this.Overall:I like the setup. It looks really really good on the store page. But I just couldn't find anything that would redeem this game's shortcomings. Its not hard, its not scary, it is often clumsy, it lacks complexity, and, to be quite frank, I could barely stand it enough to get as far as I did in between all the crashes I had to deal with.For the hour I spent with it, maybe I am being a bit too harsh. I never even got to the end of the first area, mostly due to constant crashes. But to me none of that mattered. What I saw was not good, and it was quite clear to me that this game has made some poor design choices.I wouldn't recommend this game at all. There are better games for under ten dollars.			"

												Update:The reason we're returning to it is the fact that the game got patched shortly after we released our initial review, and found that they'd fixed the hiding mechanic! This, naturally, means that the game now functions as intended, so we decided to revisit our review.A few things did get borked in the process, but they're fairly minor, so we're bumping up our initial 6.5 to a much more respectable 7.5/10.Update Video Below:


YouTube™ Video: Depths of Fear Knossos Playthrough (Part 3 - Satyr, Kerberus) 

			Views: 51		

			Subscribe : http://bit.ly/1Jy17RR Depths of Fear :: Knossos is a Greek-themed 1st person adventure game with stealth, action and edge-of-your-seat elements within rogue-like procedurally generated...		

Original Review:A first person survival game, you play the role of someone who gets thrown into the ancient labyrinth of the Minotaur. There, the basic idea is supposedly to be ended by the minotaur, but annoyingly, you try to survive and kill the damned thing.As you traverse the labyrinth, a lot of interesting features make themselves known.For one, the labyrinth is randomly generated, so every time you enter a section, you havea new area to explore. This does appear to be the cause of some wonky pathfinding, but in general, the idea's quite nice. Also, the graphics, whilst not excessively good, set the themequite well, and they do a fair bit to enhance the gameplay.However, issues do occur. Alongside the wonky pathfinding, we found a problem with the stealthmechanics of the game. You're told to extinguish your torch and hide in the shadows to avoidhaving the Satyr slice your head off, but something went broke in patching, and it just makesa beeline for you regardless of your opinion on the matter. That, coupled with the fact thatyou can occasionally smack enemies out of the world, and some other issues, and the game isnot precisely flawless.Our opinion on the matter is that, despite the bugs, the game is quite compelling, so we're hoping for some patch-work on it. If that happens, the game deserves a higher score than we'recurrently giving it, but in it's current state, the game is worth a 6.5/10. Passable, but not brilliant.Still, keep an eye on this!http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=323538286 "

												I was very indecisive as to whether I should buy this or not... I am so glad I did... The game is excellent, but I'm experiencing FPS issues.. however, it is very scary(for me). I love the whole idea of Mythology being implemented in a Horror game. It really makes you able to feel what an actual Hero would feel when he'd be sent in a dungeon to berid it of monsters. It focuses on sneaking past all the monsters until you grab enough gold to buy good weapons to kill them with. All you got is a torch and the darkness. Go ahead, try it. It's pretty challenging as you'll die very quickly, very soon. If you're expecting a triple A title... don't... this is better. The stuff you get at this price is so much better than a 60$ game which is plain and boring.>I'd give it a 10/10>Pros: Very scary, intimidating, you feel threatened, legit feeling of a hero left to die, visually ok, retro feel with the music and the trailer>Cons: Frame issues, some graphical issues, smaller bugs			"

												For an indie game this is really good. It is a procedurally generated dungeon crawler within a Greek mythology setting with an emphasis on stealth rather than combat.The lighting in this game is really good, you get a feeling of actually being hidden when you think you should be, and when you do get in combat, there is a good feedback to your blows or projectiles hit.It is not up to standards of an AAA game, but that is to be expected given that it has one developer. There is no voice acting, the models are not as good as they could be, and there is little of a plot (granted, the source material does not have much either!).But this is a game that I feel is worth all €6 it currently retails for as it is a satisfying experience throughout.

												I bought this game on sale since I thought it looked a bit interesting. After playing for just over an hour I would have happily paid the full price or more. The synthesized music is wonderful, the creatures are designed very well, and the combat is tense (get the shield as soon as you can)!EDIT #1: Four hours in and still loving it. The difficulty ramps up after the first couple of minions, which I am glad for. There are a few clipping bugs that are a minor annoyance, but other than that it is still great!EDIT #2: Five hours in and the game breaks. Centaur boss bugged out and I can't complete the level. After descending the ladder on the fourth floor, instead of going to the normal boss level layout, it takes me to a square platform with a small pyramid in the center, surrounded by lava. The key is visible across the lava with no way to get to it. After two hits the centaur becomes invincible and I am stuck running around on the square platform surrounded by lava. I have tried killing all of the enemy spawning ghost-thingys and in the end, it's just me, the square platform surrounded by lava, and an invincible centaur.Edit #3: I learned the following tip on the Steam forums: Do not use the shield on the centaur or he will become invincible for the rest of that floor. I'm sure they'll fix that bug soon.			"

												Great concept in fact I love the concept. The problem is I don't think execution is the best. This is one of those ideas/games that I think a AAA publisher should look at and me like ""Hey I like this idea a lot so i'm gonna buy your idea let you have creative control and let a professional dev team work on it instead""I have to give it a no but that's just because I don't think its as good as it potentially could be and I hope someone with a lot more cash notices this and does something with it instead of ripping off your idea or something like that.

TL;DR:   It's an enjoyable game that I can actually reccomend trying out since it has a great concept and a lot of potential, but is a little to buggy and quite easy (which makes it quite short). So if you want to give it a try, wait for a sale.Pros/Cons/Long version:Pros:+ Good concept, like it!+ Neat diversity of the bosses with different sets of abilities and weapons!+ Procedurally generated maps that make every run of every level a new experience!+ You have weapons that are good for different types of situations.+ You don't get to keep weapons or usables that you find in the maps after you restart of die wich makes the game a little more chalanging and interesting!+ You're quite scared at the begining to get face to face with the bosses and are really trying to hide from them.+ OK music and sounds.Cons:- A little to easy to beat the game (which makes it quite short), except for the 'defeat 15 unknown dungeons in a row' acievemnt. This is hard mostly because of bugs and not that the game itself is hard. (NOTE: Most of my playtime is trying to beat this last acievement, but I've got to submit defeat due to the tideousness of buggs...)- Procedurally generated maps that you have to restart to beat since it spawned a wall that blocks the exit...- Procedurally generated maps that you have to restart to beat since you got stuck in the floor after getting a key!- Procedurally generated maps that the bosses get stuck in.- Procedurally generated content doesn't apply to key areas there seems to be... around 10 of em maybe?- Sometimes you don't seem to be able to hit the bosses/mobs with your weapon. Running around and/or even inside the boss whirling your sword straight at it... and then you die since you can't seem to land a single hit! ( tested using the sword that usually one-shots everything but the minotaur )- Somethimes the character gets truck in 'flying/jumping' mode, not that it really seemed to affects my gameplay that much and is usually resolved by jumping around a bunch of times trying to land on something.- When you have every weapon in the game, the shop can only offer bolts for your crossbow(and you already have 500+ of those to and the count only goes up even when not buying any new ones)... maybe add at least potions to the list?- If the game were a little harder/longer to beat, weapons a little pricier or in some other way not so easy to achieve this point wouldn't really be a problem to me. There aren't that many types of weapons and after you get to the minotaur there is really only one melee weapon that is even worth laying your eyes on.So I might have forgotten to mention something, but I think you get the point...It's an enjoyable game that I can actually reccomend trying out since it has a great concept and a lot of potential, but is a little to buggy and quite easy (which makes it quite short). So if you want to give it a try, wait for a sale.			"

												I must forewarn that this game is made by just one developer and basically exists in a state of permanent beta (not sure if he'd call it that, but functionally speaking). It's basically playable but there's still plenty of bugfixes to be done and the gameplay could still use tweaking in a few places.All that said, Depths of Fear is a proceedurally generated action/horror game about the Minotaur's Labyrinth. Taking rather obvious cues from old Ray Harryhausen films, it pits you against eight beasts from classical myth including the Minotaur itself (plus a few generic monsters to fill space, mostly undead). Each has their own unique abilities to harass you with.The game starts out with heavy emphasis on stealth, as you begin your way through the labyrinth armed with nothing but a torch and maybe a stick. The game's atmosphere is great here, somehow managing to make the angry bleating of a goatman the most terrifying sound in the world. To avoid the same confusion as I had, keep this in mind: you actually need to run each level three or four times in a row to reach the boss chamber and actually progress to the next segment.  Before I figured this out I'd run it once or twice between breaks, thinking the point was to scrouge for treasure so I could buy a better weapon.The game is pretty much a straight shot from there, running each level a few times, fighting the boss (who is present on every level but only permanently killable in their inner sanctum), grab the token and move on. By the time you reach the endgame you've evolved from a scared boy with a stick to a seasoned monster hunter, and if you can keep up with such Greek monster basics as  ""don't stare at Medusa,"" you should have no trouble pushing to the end with quick feet and a crossbow.All in all I had quite a bit of fun for how simple (and at times buggy) the game was, and while its not without flaws I'm still looking forward to the sequel I've heard the developer mumble about.

												I didn't put much time into this game when I picked it up a while ago because it was so effectively freaking me out, but seeing it on sale for two bucks, I have to stop and recommend it to anyone looking for an offbeat indie stealth-horror-fps-roguelike oozing with atmosphere. The other reviews comparing it to old movies are onto something. I personally get a strong fantastique and giallo vibe from it. Feels like it could have been adapted from Argento's heyday.As Theseus, you descend through the Labyrinth of Greek myth, hunting and being hunted by the Minotaur and other mythical creatures. The use of light and sound (or should I say darkness and quiet) make it extra creepy when you see something casting a long shadow in distant torchlight or hear a bloodcurdling shriek somewhere behind you. This is the kind of game I'd always easily recommend for the price, even the normal $6. Even though I personally didn't play so much my first time in, that's no fault of the game's, and writing all this has me wanting to play again.			"

												This is a good game. Even though it can be hard to take the Unity engine seriously at times, it does not detract from the appreciation I have for the one dev who made this worthwhile effort. Basically you play as this dude Theseus, a hero chosen and plopped into a Labrynth where many others have met their doom. This goes on with the real-life ancient Minoan story, and it has a nice narrative to it. Eventually the goal is clear: go through the different archways to discover a dungeon of different mythological beasts. This part is kind of like the world paintings in Super Mario 64. Eventually you work up to defeat the l33t Minotaur and save the greek damsel-n-distress.There may be times when you feel like it is getting kind of repetitive, especially when you start to get OP. I wouldn't say it's super replayable, but it does have an infinite dungeon that will give you random levels which get progressively harder...""Survive or die"" kind of deal to break your own record.Of the Unity games that have been coming out, this is good. Save up for a sale, it was (a well spent) 4-5 hours.			"

												Depths of Fear :: Knossos is a game I desperately want to love, because I honestly like the concept of running around in a dark dungeon escaping from creatures from the Greek mythology. Sadly, the game's way too wonky and crude to take seriously. Depths of Fear plays as a first person dungeon crawler, where every time you play the game, the dungeons are randomized for your exploring pleasures. You play as Theseus, being dropped by some guards down a huge♥♥♥♥♥pit in the middle of a colosseum to reach the dungeon where the minotaur was locked away. Along the way, you can find gold to buy bigger and better weapons (Or the weapons themselves, if you're lucky) ranging from a simple wooden club that burns when you're set on fire to a sword and a shield that are pretty much a necessity later on. There's a few levels that play pretty much under the same rules. Three floors, you go around trying to avoid direct confrontation with the big bad of said level, ranging from a satyr, to a centaur, a gryphon, a cerberus, Medusa, and a few other ones. Here, you collect weapons, food to restore health,gold for weapons, books and blessings from the gods, which is pretty much the magic in this game. Some levels contain a few extra minor enemies, too, and others are pretty much infested with these little ♥♥♥♥ers, dog sized ants, zombies, skeletons, little gremlin like things. Here's another mechanic of the game. If you turn off your torch (Pretty much your flashlight, and it works like one! I'm sick and tired of flashlights in horror games where they fail miserably to cut the thick darkness in front of you, only giving you a small radious of light around you. No ♥♥♥♥ing flashlight works like this in real life, I think the developers wanted to go for a torch or a lantern.) you can hide in the darkness, and the big bad will fail to find you in there unless you're moving around like a dumbass or you're unlucky enough to get close to their natural source of light. BUT, some random enemies will find you regardless, like the pesky ants, and this can be quite annoying when you don't have a weapon yet.The first two levels rely mostly on finding the key for the gate to the next level. When you pick the key on the final floor, though, the Minotaur will appear, and he's largely invincible by this point, so you better haul♥♥♥♥♥to the exit, because this just turned into a horror game! When you're done with that, you're dropped into a small arena where you fight the big bad of the area in a 1v1 match to the death. (Of course, it won't be a 1v1, common enemies will swarm the area and will surround you like ♥♥♥♥ing scumbags). Once you're done, congratulations, you've cleared the area, and you can go to the next one to face the next big bad, rinse and repeat' til you get to the Minotaur himself. Oh, and the levels are non linear, too, so you can pick the order in which you clear the areas and fight the bosses. I also love that even if some area bosses are relentless with their chase, the music is quite funky and doesn't fit, which makes it hilarious. Like I hear the gryphon's screeching, and then the music starts.....UNCE UNCE UNCE UNCE UNCE. ♥♥♥♥ing rave music. I love it. Well, the game is quite wonky by this point. Any kind of atmsphere is ruined as soon as you watch some of the ridiculous, unnatural animations that most of the enemies in this game possess, like the satyr with his incredibly dumb walk animation and the hoof sounds that fail to match his steps. The game is quite buggy, too, I've found myself stuck in various areas, but luckily, I have yet to fall through the floor....Yet. I got trapped inside a because I fell inside it and the lava never killed me. There was no way to climb out, either. Thank god for the ""return to main chamber"" option in the pause menu. I also got ♥♥♥♥ing stuck between a staircase and a pillar in the gryphon's level, ending my run right there because there was nothing I could do to un-stuck myself. Retry level. And immediatly afterwards, after starting restarting the level, I got ♥♥♥♥ing stuck again! In a different place! I restart the level yet again, and the gryphon's stuck walking against a wall. Not even the big bads can escape the wrath of bad programming.  The gameplay is quite crude, too, but the mix of exploration, combat (Albeit slightly plain and not intuitive), stealth, and I guess horror (It's quite tense being chased by some of the enemies, like the satyr and the minotaur) kinda make up for that. The game's also a lil bit too dark, which I understand taking in mind the setting of the game, but sometimes it's almost impossible to run away from an enemy because either you have your torch on and signal it your every move, or you turn it off and bump walls like a blind man. It's also poorly optimized, even with everything on low, I still get frame drops at times, anywhere from 20 FPS to 4 FPS. I wouldn't recommend this game to the average gamer, because it's largely hit and miss, it's still rather bare bones, and it might NOT be your cup of tea, even if I enjoyed it. I've got a high ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t tolerance, which lots of people lack when it comes to dealing with pontentially run-screwing bugs. I wish there was a ""maybe"" button, because this barely made it to a ""recommended"".			"

												This game is a work of greatness! (𝘜𝘕𝘐𝘙𝘖𝘕𝘐𝘊 𝘈𝘓𝘌𝘙𝘛)In all honesty, I've heard of this game before, and I bought it for the laughs. I expected this game to be absolute pond scum, and to a 𝘤𝘦𝘳𝘵𝘢𝘪𝘯 extent, I wasn't 𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘪𝘳𝘦𝘭𝘺 wrong. If you're expecting to be scared, lower your expectations. If you're expecting to have a terrible time, raise your expectations. This game really surprised me, and I found that I was actually having fun while playing it. Sure, it might not look the greatest, and the sneeking mechanics can really suck at times, and the all-encompassing darkness of the labyrinth might urge you to slam your head into a brick wall due to a lack of proper vision, and some of the monsters can be rediculously hard to deal with, but it has a 𝘨𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘵 soundtrack! In all seriousness, I beat this game in a single day, and I had fun the whole time. The graphics give the game an interesting feel that I haven't seen in too many games prior to playing this, and it fits the soundtrack surprisingly well. The models for the monsters and the sound effects actually really add to the game's 𝘤𝘳𝘦𝘦𝘱𝘺 (note the word choice there) atmosphere. The game can be creepy at times, but I can safely say that it really isn't all that scary. Anyway, that's about all I had to say. Dumb Personal Rating: 6.5/10. 𝘚𝘱𝘰𝘪𝘭𝘦𝘳 𝘚𝘵𝘶𝘧𝘧 𝘉𝘦𝘭𝘰𝘸  Satyr - Spawns a bunch of monsters everywhere.  Griffin - You'll never hear it coming, I know I didn't.  Cerberus - Loves to get stuck in walls.  Manticore - Just learn his attack pattern and he's easy.  Centaur - Hates it when you run in circles around him.  Medusa - Good ♥♥♥♥ing luck.  Hydra - Carries the key in around like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Minotaur - Bigger version of the Satyr that doesn't spawn monsters.  "

												Did you ever play Super Mario 64 when you were a kid? Remember Peach's Castle? That hub world was one of the most frightening things I've ever seen, and it wasn't even intentional. Anyone who played Mario 64 when they were little can back me up when I say Peach's Castle was so atmospheric and horrifying that it was hard to play the game without an adult in the room. The bizarrely upbeat music, a huge castle with like 5 people in it, mysteries and hidden stuff everywhere, and those horrible endless stairs. Remember when you first entered the courtyard and there was nothing there except a mysterious statue that seemed to imply you could unlock Luigi? Then, later on you go back to the courtyard and you see a ghost just floating at the door. For weeks you're too scared to even look at it, but eventually you muster up the courage to follow it, where it leads you to the now ghost infested courtyard. You then change your pants.What I'm saying is that old games, love 'em or hate 'em, had a feel to them. Something about the limited graphics and kind of crappy design gave them this weird atmopshere that new games just don't have. Old games didn't hold your hand, you just explored a huge castle that was constantly changing and scared a bunch of little kids to death. This is why I love Depths of Fear.Depths of Fear is not an old game, it's actually very new. But it has that weird ""old game"" vibe that I haven't felt since I entered Big Boo's Haunt so many years ago. Depths of Fear has this atmosphere that I really can't explain. It's not scary, but it just has this feel that got me sucked in. The graphics are dated, the music is bizarre, you're given little to no instruction, and I can't imagine it any other way. If this game had groundbreaking graphics and an orchestral score, it just wouldn't be the same. I know I haven't talked about the gameplay at all, but that's because, to me, the gameplay is somehow NOT what's important here. It's fun and enjoyable, yeah, but I urge everyone to buy Depths of Fear just to relive the surreal eeriness that modern games just don't have. Phil, I love ya.			"

												I'm really torn about Depths of Fear: KnossosObjectively speaking, this is not a good game: graphical presentation is bad, sound and music are minimalistic, combat system is floaty and imprecise and platforming sequences are annoying. All this should be enough to skip playing DoF:K.But there is something to this game that subjectively speaking, I find endearing.DoF:K has an interesting premise based on a Greek mythology - you are Theseus and you have to find a way out of King Minos' labyrinth, which is guarded by an undefeated monster Minotaur, along with seven lesser monsters that serve him. The game has the style and atmosphere from Greek mythologies and movies based on it, such as the Clash of the Titans from 1981, the good version. You are faced with series of challenges you have to overcome in order to meet face to face with the dreaded Minotaur.Graphics are unmistakingly low-poly with an annoying and tiresome film grain filter that can luckily be turned off. Music, what little there is, is simplistic and repetitive. Combat and jumping mechanics are wildly inconsistent: there is no weight to it, it's slow and won't react to controls all the time and some hits won't connect to the enemies that are standing right in front of your face.But despite all these shortcomings, some of the aspects of this game are truly memorable: music, although primitive, has a soundtrack feel from Italian horror movies, like Dario Argento's Suspiria, and the band Goblin who were experts on creating evocative music for Giallo movies. While common enemy grunts that you meet are one hit nuisances, all eight bosses you meet and hide from are well-designed, different and dangerous, thus making them always frightening. There is a bit of Thief in this game as well: a sizeable and well-implemented hide and seek system makes every randomly generated level intense and thrilling, with bosses reacting properly to your sight and sound that you make.Under any other circumstances, I would give this game a thumb down, but all of this was created by one person, which is no small feat. Hence, Depths of fear: Knossos gets a cautious recommendation from me. Check carefully what this game offers and what doesn't work before you buy it, and I think you'll have a grand ol' spooky time :)			"

												I really quite like Knossos.Knossos is a first person simulator (near) rogue-like, where you are trapped in the Minotaurs maze, fight various greek monsters in randomly generated levels.The random level generation is really good - everything felt built by hand but there was so much variation it must be random.The lighting model is superb, the models are fine (they are probably very basic, but things are not well lit, and the realtime lighting makes everything look better than it probably is). Textures are average.The monster AI is excellent - monsters path about and when they spot you they attack, if you lose them, they search for you, there is plenty of telegraphing of state.Death can come frequently, but its not terrible, you only lose progress on the current level, which might take up to a minute to recover, and because of the random level design, things feel fresh - in fact death felt less like a punishment, and more like an opportunity to play another map.You level up your avatar by buying weapons and collect gold, arrows etc which are not lost once you complete a level. Dont buy anything lower, just save up for the trident, and then enjoy :)It took me 3.5 hours to beat the minotaur, which felt like the right length. Plenty of progress was made, I started to master the game, and I wasnt bored of it. There is a proper random roguelike campaign as well, which theoretically has inifinte playability, but I suspect it would start to grind (havent tried).			"

												From my first impression as I started. I thought this would be like Dark Souls, which I have played a bit of. I found the textures really bright and graphics quite awkward to start with, like the lighting  was off, quite dark especially after being kicked down into the pit!""I am still unsure of the games plot but found that the main character is Theseus and was banished into the pit  I have been knocking at the idea that I did something bad and now I was doomed and had to do what I could to survive the fate I have been given!""As I enetered the dungeon I had no idea what to expect! Greeted by a nice note to be wary and then spotting a door to a NPC shop, mouse was a little buggy and I pressumed I had no cash to buy weapons so then I entered through the door to the first chamber.As I entered the dungeon I had no idea what to expect! Greeted by a nice note to be wary and then spotting a door to a NPC shop, mouse was a little buggy and I presumed I had no cash to buy weapons so then I entered through the door to the first chamber.At entering the first chamber I had really enjoyed the atmosphere as it kicked in, I thought the lighting might be bugged but then I quickly realised, I am in a dark labyrinth and a goat is running about somewhere, which I found out was  Satyr. After some quick realisation and finding the beast travelling through the dark chamber with a legion of ant like creatures I was really on my toes! Having to be careful when my torch is lit, being as out of site as possible which was a pain but a very good element to roaming through the chambers, I had both loved and hated it and also used the torches on the stands as much as possible and in some cases pushing them around with me for extra light that was safe to use!As I spent some time completing the labyrinths I really enjoyed I had really enjoyed how unique each one was and the final encounters with each beast, having to get the amulet and then standing on a stone while they were fooled into being defeated by lava was very releasing for me, especially once it came to the bird like creature! ""I found many different items, I thought the potion system was really good, not knowing what your going to be using for it's first use in each chamber can lead to some real ""Shall I use this?"" decisions but I spammed ach potion hoping for enhanced vision!  I did get to use all of the weapons, using the tourch along the way aswell which helped with killing the crazy creatures and zombies, aswell as set wooden furniture on fire for extra light! Battling is quite basic from first impression and maybe a few more animations would be great for attacking, I really enjoyed the axe tho! I think the basic battle combat suits the whole experience!Going against each creature within the chambers is near impossible, escaping can be really tough too! I wouldn't want encounters being easier tho I did notice that they closely guarded the key chamber mostly and staying with a proximity of it, I think that was great, getting the keys can be quite easy to find but most the time, getting to the key chamber, especially with Minotaur around could be a pain in the bum!Breaking open the vases for treasure was nice too, I found snakes in some vases but they were harmless, finding loot was a nice bonus as I travelled through the labyrinths!The utility twine was a very good item tho I never picked one up that often, having that with me made exploring a little easier around the chambers a bit, maybe finding a magic map would be a cool utility too as I found myself searching the same spots quite often for the key to leave which was frustrating sometimes!  Really enjoyed the potion of light, that's my favourite item! :) I did have a very enjoyable amount of time while playing, there are many interesting things, traps to watch out for, ghosts that endlessly troll and fiery traps contained within randomly generated levels and I certainly wanted more, the variation to all 8 Chambers is great! Personalised for each beast and unique!			"

												Depths of Fear Knossos gives you the feel of the old arcade style of being thrown into a dungeon and expected to survive. You play as a greek warrior Theseus while traveling you encounter various mythical bosses to defeat in order to progress to the next dungeon and so on until you reach the last boss (no spoilers, sorry). There was no real horror aspect of it which I was hoping for mainly because you can fight off you're pursuer(s) with weapons you buy from the store with the gold you acqure on the way. The shop albiet is a bit useless with the most expensive items being the best which you can easily skip the lower tier weapons to get to. By the time you reach the 3rd dungeon it gets rather repetitive besides the change in boss. The enviorment changes based on which place you go in but only slighty so giving it the same feel as before. The goals are all the same - find the key - dodge the boss - go to the next level 3 times until the boss fight. For achievement hunters/ trading card collectors you can rack up your achievements easily and fast (I got all mine in 3 hours). Overall its a nice  game to wind down to if your up to nothing, but has very little replay value once you beat it. That being said buy the game! It's cheap, you support the devs, and if you end up not liking old arcade dungeon crawler games you can take solace in the fact you didn't spend too much.			"

												Often I've found the sword-and-sandals genre of hack-and-slash to be tired and unimaginative. This game is a refreshing change. Not only is this a great take on the monsters of Greek mythology, but the procedurally generated environments (as is a staple of Rogue-like games) greatly increase replayability. And to discover that every aspect of the game was created by one person quite astonished me.I love it that the ""boss"" monsters actually search for you and hunt you down, rather than just sit in a room accessed at the end of linear rails. These creatures also have more than one method of attack, and these methods will fit the situation.This game is not bug-free and the jumping mechanic was often rather tricky to me. Also, the way of attaining the medallions is not immediately clear (especially to those relatively new to Rogue-like games). But, the learning curve is not extremely steep and there are multiple strategies you can use to beat a level (stealth, speed, patient attrition by missile weapons, melee, area spells, etc.). And, when you've beaten the ""main"" game, you have the endless dungeon to challenge you.SPOILER....I would have preferred the final fight against the Minotaur to be in an actual maze but, overall, I enjoyed the challenge.

												Depths of Fear: Knossos is a very intriguing game, to say the least. Why? you might ask, well bear with me and I shall reveal all. To begin with let’s talk about the overall gameplay. The game is more or a less a Greek themed, first person, stealth like game with several rogue-like elements thrown in as well. You take on the role of Theseus, a name many may recognize from the Greek story, Theseus and the Minotaur. DOF:K takes on a very similar premise to the story, being that you must fight your way through a labyrinth, or rather various ones in this case. There are eight different labyrinths altogether, all containing a variety of mythological Greek beasts, including manticores, gorgons, centaurs and Cerberus, to name just a few. You can either choose to fight these creatures, granted that you have a weapon which can be acquired once you have enough gold to afford one, or you can also avoid the creatures by using the, fairly simplistic, stealth mechanics the game provides. You can hide in the shadows, by turning off your torch or hide inside little cupboards, which are built into some of the walls. Once you’ve completed each of the labyrinth areas you have to battle against the boss of that area. The creature you have to fight is dependent on which doorway you went through to begin with. If there was a scorpion above the door, then it’s the manticore. If it was a snake, then it would be the hydra, and so on and so forth. Once you’ve defeated the boss, one of the eight symbols on the door of the main room will light. You need to light up all eight in order to advance to the main labyrinth.As previously mentioned there are a number of weapons that you can buy. However you will need to find gold, which is scattered around each labyrinth, in order to purchase them. You can get simple clubs, long swords, tridents and crossbow, alongside several other weapon too. These can be used to eliminate the dangerous creatures that inhabit the various labyrinths and defeat the bosses and the end.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Graphically the game look fairly simplistic. Basic stony textures and checkerboard patterns cover the walls and floors of practically every stage in the game. The creatures themselves also are very basic in design, although it clear what sort of creature you’re facing, the models themselves aren’t all that textual or physically impressive. However their attack patterns and their animations all seem fairly unique.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mechanically the game feels fairly simple. The stealth mechanics, although basic, do work very well when trying to evade the creatures. Turning off the torch and hiding behind objects or inside cupboards, makes it feel tense, especially when facing a minotaur than can one hit kill you. Finding the key and escaping each labyrinth feels fairly rewarding, particularly if you were successful in evading the creatures. Then there’s the combat, which feels like one of the weakest points of the game. Although stealth is a probably one of the more key ways to play DOF:K, combat does play a large part when at the boss stages. You simply spam the attack key until either you kill the beast or you die. There’s no real strategy to it, other than to simple jump about and avoid getting hit. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall though Depth of Fear: Knossos is an unusual rogue-like game. It fits the indie, rogue-like thematic well, much like The Binding of Issac and Eldritch, to name a couple. It does have a certain horror vibe to it and the general feeling you get when playing it is satisfying. The combat does let it down a bit, along with the graphics too, but those are more or less a couple of minor things that only affect the game a little bit. To end with, I’ll say that if you’re looking for a rogue-like game or something with a little bit of stealth, then DOF:K is a great buy. For the price though, it’s always worth having a look if you want something different to play or want something to pass the time. Good Day!			"

												I enjoyed my near 7 hours with Depths of Fear: Knossos, despite much of the experience being akin to playing pick-up stix in the pitch darkness after downing a fifth of Wild Turkey.  Good lord was this game dark.  In Fear you are the noble Theseus.  You get pushed into a pit Army of Darkness style to take on whatever evil that comes your way.  The majority of that evil comes in the form of legendary mythical monsters like Medusa, the Centaur, the Hydra, the Minotaur and more!   As a fan of Harryshausen movies I couldn't pass this one up.  Boy, it sure is flawed but it's fun too and horror game fans MIGHT have a decent time...depending on their patience of course.  The game starts you off in a hub area where you can purchase weapons, learn the ropes, travel to different dungeons and generally get your place in the world.  Right from the getgo the lightning in Knossos is pee poor.  In some of the dungeons it's rather exciting as you scramble to find an exit key, swinging blindly whatever weapon you have equipped while the Hydra nips at your heels all of the way to the exit.  Since there's a decent smattering of dungeons this does turn to tedium in a few instances.  Each dungeon had about 3 find the key levels before you face off against the boss on the bottom floor.  Some of these battles were quite a lot of fun and others were so easy you could beat with your eyes closed.  This wildly uneven mix between climactic and anticlimactic in some odd way services the game well.  As you spelunk the dungeons you'll find weapons, gold, statues that give special powers (provided you collect enough books of knowledge) and generally hazy, fuzzy Hexen/Heretic like graphics.  Knossos reminds me of these games quite a bit at times and since I was a huge fan of that whole series it was a point in this odd beast's favor.  Alot of the time the poor textures and decade old technology is disguised by the dark and the fact that you are moving so fast to grab the key without getting your a** handed to you that you could careless.  But when you're fighting some of lesser enemies in the game like the big angry buzzing flies, giant fire ants, crawly lizards, etc. the amateurish really can bring the score down.  Plus...these lesser enemies are generic and not that fun to fight...nowhere near the fun of dodging the boss in find the key levels or the big fight at the end of the level.  The sound are equally mundane as weapons clink wimpily, footsteps trod tappity and none of the action sound FX really live up to par.  Where the sound shines is with the footsteps of the beasts and their braying cries in the darkness.  That part comes off a charm and then some.  Buying weapons puts them in your arsenal and you can choose any two (plus a shield, and you always have a near useless torch) to pummel some ugly sods with.  Combat isn't spectacular but it does well enough that you'll enjoy the hack n' slash gameplay if that's your style.  Yeah...I mean, that's pretty much it.  Like somewhere else mentioned, this game is the equivalent of a fuzzy, off-brand Hammer horror movie that you stumble onto late at night and can't stop watching.  Mix in a little Argento with the Goblin/Tangerine Dream-esque keyboard soundtrack drone and man, it's EXACTLY like the aforementioned review called out.  I played through once and got 85% of the achievements.  I could traverse the endless dungeon and see how far I get but really, I'm good.  My 7 hours were a solid blast at their best parts and for me personally, this game would wear out it's welcome if I stayed with it any longer.  Pros:-Like watching a weird yet spellbinding horror movie at 3 a.m.-Serviceable hack n' slash gameplay with minor looting, collecting, equipping elements-Kinda cool 70s synth drone music soundtrack-Solid selection of weapons and armaments to buy and discover-Some boss fights and chases are alot of fun-Controls, plays and operates solidly for a no budget zone outCons:-Graphic nazis stay away-Weak sound FX-Regular enemies were pretty stupid and not entirely necessary-You die quickly...like 2-4 hits quick.  Not an unbeatable problem but prepare to die plenty!-Dark to the point off tension one minute and to the point of screen kicking anger the next.  -Torch is useless.  -Some boss battles blow the build-upOverall score:  7/10I'm giving Knossos a thumbs up because I enjoyed it and the price is right.  I could plunge the endless dungeon but I've unlocked a decent # of weapons and items, so I'd rather my memory of the game to be a positive one rather than a tedium grind.  I hope there's a sequel and that it fixes some nagging complaints from the first.  And even if it doesn't?  I'll probably play it anyway.			"

												This game is alright, it lasts long enough to not overstay its welcome and is engaging enough to keep you playing.Unless you are high or smashed, then this is one of the most intense games ever. The entirety of the games is so damn dark and the nature of the first person combat versus ♥♥♥♥ing monsters really keeps you on the edge of your seat. Just try not to fall off if you are actually drunk.			"

												Good stuff, scary as hell, nice animation, cool random dungeons!  Simply pick up if its on sale. Its very hard, but it does seem you get to keep some of your gold if you die. The main Satyr monster is so scary i can only play in brief stints- the horror is comparable to Amnesia the Dark Descent in parts.  Other monsters are around aswell- fled the satyr into a dark corridoor....something creeps in the shadows...suddenly a large cluster of ugh bugs start spewing forth and you panic, and run back, hoping that the satyr left! Pretty fine fps/stealth/roguelike... engine is a bit basic/rough , but it works terrific with the shadows and light/ambience. The stealth is functional but not annoying, which is good- ie. no creeping for 5 mins etc. The Monsters are varied and well animated, and the audio work is actually pretty impressive! you nearly♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself when you hear the wail of the satyr.

												The game has some rough edges, but is overall unique and enjoyable. To sum it up, the game has you taking on many Greek Mythological creatures, each boss has a series of levels before you can fight them. There is a geniune rush whenever you stumble onto the baddy before your ready.The visuals are simplistic but with an effect that makes it appealing.My only complaint is how the levels are generated, it's all random so the layout wavers between very hard and very easy. The actual boss battles leave something to be desired (Lava!)This is a video of my first impression! YouTube  "

												Do not judge a book by its cover perfect fits in this one.The first 10 minutes i wanted a refund and i felt so frustrated about my purchace...mediocre graphics...mediocre gameplay...i couldnt even get it to run until i figured out i had to force direct 9 in the launch options.So my first impressions were awful about this game then i invested some time and i decided to give it a second chance.The game's atmospere is so brilliant and well made that few other games achieve.It is really challenging and in many occasions forces you to think and use your brain.It's a feeling i cannot describe i only felt similar way while playing Dark souls in the past.Overall great game totally worth it give it some time you wont regret it.

												This game is far from perfect with simple combat and AI issues (e.g. getting caught on ledges or just acting strangely in general), but the glooming atmosphere, effective stealth mechanics, and ""punchy"" sound design (e.g. the soundtrack, the sound of footsteps, and that pot smashing sound) make this a whole lot better.  Even for the base price of $5.99, this game is definitely worth a shot.			"

												One good way I feel to describe this game is as follows: 'You've played more expensive games for shorter times'. It has a simple combat model but is kept fresh by the use of procedural level generation as you descend into the labyrinth. It's an entertaining adaptation of a great piece of Greek mythology which seems to have been overlooked as far as gaming forays go. For the price point you really can't go wrong if you enjoy first person fighting games like Dark Messiah of Might and Magic or Chivalry DW. It's a nice choice for those times you don't feel like committing to a multiplayer game and want to battle your way through some dungeons. All this with mild horror themes piled on top. It's all substance, so don't expect too much cinematic filler. Just think of the games you played when you were younger.			"

												Okay, this game is amazing. Next to no lag on a non-gaming laptop, and awesome gameplay. It's an amazing mix of stealth, horror, and (to quote Mr. Torgue) badassitude. The Stealth:You have to sneak through multiple levels of a labyrinth, avoiding enemies too strong for you, and being killed by anything else. You must learn to take advantage of the darkness.The Horror:I'm not a huge fan of horror things. In fact, I've never even seen a horror movie. But, this game is perfect for me.The fear that you'll be seen, mixed with the knowledge that you are hidden, and can possibly kill the monster hunting you is an amazing thing. It's like a horror movie, only the hunter and the hunted are on level ground.The Badassitude:Get a sword, kill zombies, satyrs, minotaurs, medusa, and hydras. Let's just leave it at that.I totally recommend this game.			"

												I will admit, when I saw the trailer, and read the description, I was intrigued.  A rogue-like that merged a First Person Perspective with a greco mythological setting.  Gameplay includes a stealth mechanic, frantic melee combat complete with explorative puzzle solving and collection.  Now with those highlights set in stone, lets move onto what the game actually provides you, where it could improve, and why the game is most assuridly worth looking at should you find that you can look past its failings.Graphics:The game does not look stelar by any stretch of the imagination.  While they are not bad, they are also not good.  What they do succeed in is providing a very interesting mood and setting through out the several themes of dungeon you get to delve into.  I unforunately found that I had to turn the settings to minimum in order to play the game at a stable frame-rate.  I am not sure why, but even with the settings turned to the lowest, I still pulled 15 to 20 fPS every now and again, mostly when some of the environments looked ""impressive"" or the action got intense.  The game fortunately remained playable (mostly given the not as intellegent as they could be monsters).  Some of the special effects seem to be more annoying than eye candy related, and the addition of a viewable hud (one that can be brought up like a menu / inventory) would have been appreciated.  As it stands, the HUD is very minimal, and that is not a bad thing.  Unfortunately, you are provided no information in regards to your characters capabilities.  Does the Axe really do as much damage as the Spear?  Does the Gladius really do more damage than the Dagger?  Those questions are answered visually, and mostly through base interpretation, I.E. it takes 2 hits to kill this with the dagger and one with the sword, so sword does more damage.Given that the game does not have any character development through out, this system does fulfill its purpose, but it still would be nice to see a representation of the items you can find and collect through out.  As it stands, there is no point to invest in the weaker stuff.  Period.Which brings us to, Gameplay:The game play suffers from being too simple, to an extreme, and having enemies that are either WAY to aggressively difficult to deal with, or enemies that are just rediculously easy to deal with.  The notes in the game talk the first boss type character up as unbeatable, but you can get him to run into pit traps (removing him from the floor all together), or can simply trade blows with him easy enough.  But the next boss monster, becomes so rediculously difficult to fight because he can hit you so much easier than his predicessor.  Which brings us to the way damage is interpreted in the game.  I am left feeling that it has the Call of Duty damage indicator via screen lighting.  It seems that after taking one hit, it becomes much easier to see the world as the lighting starts to minimize itself.  Then it progresses to greyscale and blurs progressively more as you take damage.  Unfortunately, there is no indicator as to wether you are actually healing, or if you require some of the several healing items you can find through out the dungeon.  With no health bar, or meter to find in a menu of sorts, you literaly have no idea if drinking a health potion will effect you or not unless your stcreen is blurry, same goes for picking up the food that is on the ground.I mentioned before, that the enemies are very base in their AI patterns.  Most seem to be very easily manipulated, or they are just easy to deal with period. You are supposed to be able to stealth around enemies, but I find that given the games tendency to force conflict on you, stealth really never works as an option.  I found it easier to beat the enemy till they had to respawn, than it was to hide from them.  Specially since the enemies REALLY don't need to be hid from. It would be nice to tweak the AI, or actually make it to where you can't actually kill the boss monsters without the special puzzle fight in the end of each of the dungeon sections.  It would be much more interesting to make it to where you HAVE to stealth around the boss monsters till you actually get to a point where you can kill them.  Just my suggestion.  The first bosses chamber was a neat idea involving a creative kill.  More thought and planning into the climatic showdown with your antagonistic boss monster would be greatly appreciated and would set the game up for some more polish and fun.Regarding the character development as a ""rogue-like"".  It really isn't there.  You find gold through out and books, but you spend the gold on a finite amount of weapons, like... 8 or so (most of which are useless), and spend books on various spell podiums that are considered ""gifts from the gods"".  Unfortunately, the gifts from gods are set to be one shot abilities that don't stay with you.  Finding potions, you can only carry one, and you HAVE to drink them  good and ill to find out what they do, no exceptions.  That is really about it.  It would have been nice to see character progression in a manner of speaking.  You gain experience at the end of each dungeon through kills and explorative findings.  The weapons should have better scaling in terms of worth so that it forces the players to ""work through"" improving their characters, rather than saving and affording the best melee weapon in the game before the first boss is even killed.  It would make for a more challenging and balanced game to either increase the cost, or make it to where you have to work through the game instaed of having everything available from the begining.  What is currently in place, works.  Don't get me wrong.  It does work, but the flaws that are a part of the current system, I would concider a bit of a flaw.  Most certainly not flawed enough to prevent me from enjoying what I am playing.Combat feels a bit odd.  While it is responsive, it doesn't really carry much weight with most of the weapons.  It is functional though.The randomly generated floors are functional, most definitely, but they do not push for more of what the basic game could provide.  It would be really sweet to see more than a simple, ""find the key"" and ""unlock the exit"" scenario.  If more objectives to solve each floor could be provided, it would add to the depth of the game, creating a MUCH more interesting play experience.Sound:It is most certainly a bizarre choice to pair electronic riffs with the atmosphere of the game.  I was initially turned off by it at first.  I rolled my eyes, and chuckled, but eventually it started to feel more in place than I was led to expect.  The ambient sounds actually work pretty well in regards to how smooth the transitions.  You hear the echoes as the hooves of a satyr explore the halls looking for you.  Initially it was pretty tense, at least till I realized I could totally punk the Satyre.All and all, this game is flawed, Amaturish, and rough around the edges in terms of presentation.  But what you get for the price is a game that stands as a fun game, that I found myself fully absorbed into.  Despite its short comings, I find it to be really fun.  I recommend the game.  for a 6 dollar price tag, you can have a bunch of fun if you can look past the faults.  Those of use who do enjoy the game, I am hoping share the voice that we would love to see this game refined.  Thanks a bunch for the Devs.  There are no regrets for my purchase.			"

												The most dissapointing thing about Knossos is the wasted potential. The high level weapons are far too easy to get, which results in the scares wearing out extremely quickly. In general, the utterly broken line of sight mechanics the bosses use makes it a game of ""turn off the torch when you see movement"" rather than ""sneaking around a deadly creature"". There are some serious bugs, that I hope will be ironed out.With a little more polish this could be a real gem, and yet I can't give it a thumbs down because I truly enjoyed the time I played it. Wait for a steam sale.			"

Okay its fair to say this game has some issues. The main ones being how dark it is, even with a torch, and also the AI. Although the game has pretensions of stealth the AI will still often swarm and mob you even when you supposed to be hidden. And finally there is the occaisional getting stuck in the floor forcing you to restart the dungeon.However those issues aside the game itself is actually fairly decent. Although the combat is basic, and the graphics are definitly 'indie dev' the atmosphere is good, the random gen of the dungeons keeps each playthrough fresh and the idea of fighting through greek mythology makes a decent change form the usual asylums. This is deffo one of those diamonds in the rough. If you can live with those rough edges, then there is a lot of game here to enjoy and it costs less than a fiver. If however you prefer a more polished experience you may want to look else where.			"

												If you like roguelikes then this is a definite pickup. It somehow manages to take the visual stylings of a movie like ""Clash of the Titans"" (the original) and enhance it with an unexpected soundtrack that uses 70's/early 80's synth music to create a mood that feels both retro and fresh at the same time. I'm not usually a fan of rougelike games but this one so far has managed to keep me engaged playing it in intervals. The visuals themselves, while not having all the newest bells and whistles, actually harken back to the high contrast, solid color Italo films before the turn of the century and really work together with the stylings and music to create something one of a kind. A definite grab for either long grinds or short play sessions.			"

												Unique fun!  I haven't played too many indie games, but so far this is pretty different from anything else i've tried.  At first the controls felt a little clunky, but soon after I was running for my life at full speed, and effectively.  So far my favorite aspects of the game are the atmosphere created by sound textures, and the great music, and also ancient legends slowly plodding close by.  As I start to play it more, the amount of depth that exists becomes apparent, and holds your interest.  I love the style of this game, and would love to see more than 1 person working on future projects from this company.  Amazing creavitivity and vision.			"

												DOFK presents an engaging gameplay that blends various mechanics such as platforming, combat, stealth, exploration and light puzzle solving.Each trial follows a similar formula which sees the player going through two levels and a boss level; in the first level the player must traverse the maze while grabbing whatever items and loot they can find whilst fighting lesser enemies, searching for the key to the next floor and avoiding the trial’s boss.The second floor is much the same with the addition of the deadly roaming Minotaur, and finally the third level will see you fighting the trial’s boss.Even once you start to gain a little gold and arm yourself properly the game will find ways to catch you off guard with various deadly traps, new bosses or and even the obstacle courses need to nab some of the keys all of which will be a different experience each time with procedurally generated levels adding rouge-like elements along with frantic gameplay.However combat does tend to be a bit messy as there is little to no kind of weight too most of the player’s and the enemies’ attacks which makes fighting really awkward at times which does hurt the overall experience Depths of Fear has to offer. Knossos’ visuals receive a very mixed reaction from me personally, models tend to look a bit basic and certain enemies tend to look like they’re sliding across the floor instead of actually moving on it (which effects combat as mentioned) and certain models aren’t the greatest to look at. However level design is a different matter entirely, Depths of Fear is a breath of fresh air with a long forgotten mythical Greece setting and a combination of smooth textures, clever lighting and surprisingly colourful backdrops (seems Poseidon liked his hues), Depths of Fear creates a really nice blend of atmosphere consisting of horror, fantasy and adventure.While some will criticize Depths of Fear: Knossos for its shortcomings such as the average combat or animations, I for one am incredibly pleased with this title as it holds some charm many other titles don’t with genuinely fun faced paced gameplay, impressive indie visuals and a fairly solid playtime depending on player skill and luck.While there is no multiplayer (Co Op would be pretty sweet, hint hint), there’s still plenty on offer for this title considering its price of a train ride; Dirigo Games (Phil) has shown some real creativity and I look forward to seeing what he brings to the table next.Pros: 		Great atmosphere,			Fun gameplay, 			Balanced difficulty,			C’mon it was made by one guy!Cons: 		Awkward combat,			Average models,			Poor animations.Final verdict,Depths of Fear: Knossos gets a 7/10 from me.

												A enjoyable dungeon crawl based around Greek mythology.Love the very minimal UI and lack of a inventory system (Hold one potion, 2 weapons, and have a single use power).Rogue like elements such as random floor layouts, item placement, and potions help add some replay. Death isn't permanent as in most rogue likes, but instead requires you to restart what ever level you're working on.The game does start feeling a little easy once you've got the hang of it and are more established. I'd like to of seen options for permadeath, increased difficulty, or maybe losing which ever weapons you had on death. (you do lose any weapons found in dungeon on death / area completion, the ones you buy at the store are always there to pick from at the start of a area.)This is a different type of game which is a mix of ""Adventure/Horror/Action"". It's a little on the easy side once you get the hang of it, I think this could be fixed later by adding some type of difficulty slider, basic enemies are just too easy to kill once you get a better weapons. I'd also like to see some minor puzzle solving (maybe I have't come to them yet?) to add more variety, and more menu options.In the end I say this game is worth playing, and one that I see myself coming back to. The fact that I've already put in 3 or 4 short sessions shows that the game is worth playing.3.5 out of 5 - Increased difficulty, better menu options, and more variety would easily knock this up to a 4.

												I think that for once the trailer honestly shows the appeal of this game: clunky, sometime rough-cornered, but good fun. Knossos throws you into the labyrinth of the Minotaur where you meet and fight numerous mythological creatures, and also some not-so-great beasties. I bet you don't remember Theseus fighting ants and really dumb and obnoxious zombies. These are all in the background, while you face each boss in their four level lair... every first three levels randomly created.It definitly has that one-developper facture: animations are clunky, there's a strange amagalm of textures between wall, floor, and celling and a few obvious traps which will get you. But it never stroke me as lazy. There's enough care to make each creature level distinct from one another, it shows you a heteroclite setting and then makes objectives very clear, and it's just fun fleeing a monster.As I more or less said, it's a one developper rogue dungeon-marathon ramdomly generated greeko-ruin level game. With all its short-comings of one guy project, but also its greatness: I've commented before on an update on the AI that I felt was detrimental on the gameplay, others players agreed, and eventually the developper was conveiced. He changed it in a few days. That made me jump into the labyrinth again.P.S.: I play it without trouble on XP.			"

												The positive traits of the game are an awesome, campy soundtrack and very good sound design. The encounters with the beasts are breathtaking as they should be.But the fun stops there. Everything is way too dark and the stealth mechanics are sub-par and barely work. It's another hide and seek type of game where you gather keys to open doors to the next level and so on. I just liked watching and listening to the mythical beings.If you've played one of this type of horror games, you've most likely already played something with better polish and overall gameplay. But there's some kind of novelty here that can be appreciated by fans of greek mythology and 70s style grimey epic horror music.			"

												This game is an absolute blast, and for the price there is literally no reason not pick it up if you're a fan of rogue-likes or old school games like Nosferatu: Wrath of Malachi. The graphics are deliciously retro with vibrant colors that suits the atmosphere, the sounds are creepy and the techno music adds to the games strange vibe, even though most of the time the game is fairly silent. The game play, while not innovative is rather unique, at least from what I have seen. The sneaking mechanic is interesting, and having to avoid an unkillable monster while you prowl through the levels hitting things with a club adds a bit more tension. The enemy ai does feel rather weak, they don't seem to notice your there untill your directly in front of them, and other monsters nearby won't be aggro'd if one notices you. This could get harder later on though. A map would be helpful in navigating the levels, but this could be an intentional choice on the part of the developers, and a bit more music would add more variety while you play. I haven't experienced any crashes except for when I tried to alt tab'd out of the game, and haven't seen any optimization issues others say they've had.  I'll update this review once i've experienced the whole game, including the endless mode, however I think people will know immediately if this is a game they would play.			"

												This is one of those games that has A LOT wrong with it, but is truely fun. Its an First Person rougelike, set in the famous Labyrinth in Greek mythology, which means you play as the classic hero Theseus attempting to slay the minotaur. Cool concept and one that surprisingly isnt capitalized on in gaming. But this game has a lot of problems. The combat sucks, the stealth mechanics fall apart when discovered, and enemies either dont spawn, or hallways are filled with them for no reason. But the game is worth a go, as its cheap, and pretty fun when you get the hang of it.			"

												I felt wrong after buying this game for only $1.97. It has a great concept; you're Theseus and you have to descend into the Labyrinth to slay the Minotaur. You can see the inspiration old games had on this modern dungeon crawler. It even features a merchant--with his own quirky music--to buy weapons from. The level layout is randomized; so each time you restart or enter a new area it's completely different. The creature and level design is good. The only problem this game has as far as I could see is the optimization. Even on a good PC it seems to run poorly. Lots of hiccups, especially when dealing with swarms of enemies, can ruin the game experience. I really hope these issues are fixed, because this can be a really good game.			"

												One word describes Depths of Fear: Unique.If you enjoy Greek Mythology and want to experience the feeling of running through a labyrinth being chased down by legendary creatures such as the Hydra, Griffin, or Medusa, then Depths of Fear is for you.Depths of Fear is not a great game by any standard, but I have literally never played a game quite like this before, and that alone got me on the originality factor. The fact that the entire game is randomly generated is pretty awesome. Depths of Fear takes about 5 hours to finish (it does have an infinite dungeon mode which adds to its replayability).  7/10Please upvote this review if you found it useful :)			"

												The game is actually enjoyable for few hours of time, even though it is bit buggy. I was able to beat the campaign in 4 hours blind. The best part of the game is that its very replayable. The levels are procedurally generated, so you won't get too bored with them. Each one takes a few minutes to play each so the penalty for death is very mild as well. It's also graphically pleasing, unlike most indie games I play.However, the gameplay could use a lot of polish. The lighting and AI specifically could use work. Sometimes you can be seen in pitch blackness while other times you can see decently but be hidden. The bigger and harder bosses in the game get stuck on walls and are kind of a joke. I would recommend playing the game if you are bored and have a couple bucks to spare.			"

												This is just a good game. This game is one of those games that is absolutely fantastic, but no one really knows about. The good things about this game is that it is great for anyone who likes geek mythology. Thats what its all about, obviously your going to like it. It has a good balance between fighting and the stealth aspect. Im definatley better at the fighting aspect, so thats ho i choose to go about things. Next, this game is a challenge. I have died and had to restart a level so many times, that it was almost frustrating. Its different every time so that keeps the game going and exiting, even i you do have to retry the same level. Some things that arent exactly great about this game is that there are a few bugs. The only bugs i have noticed are not game-breaking and are all problems with the level generator. Sometimes there willl be a little gap between the floor generations that you will get stuck in and be unable to get away from (unless an enemy throws you out) Once, both the minitaur and cerberaus were stuck on the exit, and i couldnt leave! This rarely happens, and is not really something to worry about. People may whine about how little weapons there are, but seriously how many do you need? The game is not all based on fighting, there is more to it than that. The game isnt really a horror game with jumpscares, it is more the horror of not knowing where anything is. There could be a zombie just out of reach of your torch, but you can hear him and it echos aound in this creepy kind of way. Definatley not scary at all (which is good....i hate horror games!) I know that this wasnt a great reveiw, just wanted to get my scrambled thoughts out there. Its a good game, buy it. I will say my overall sore on how much i personally enjoy the game is a solid:8/10			"

												Depths of Fear is a mix of stealth and combat-based gameplay, with elements of horror & Greek mythology, set in a labyrinth of procedurally-generated dungeons. It features a number of melee and ranged weapons which gradually become available to you as you collect more treasure and gold. You'll encounter a variety of monsters, including some very famous mythological creatures.Once the main questline has been finished, you'll be able to continue your adventures by exploring an endless number of procedurally-generated levels. Goals still remain for the player even at this stage, since Steam Achievements exist for making it to the deeper levels. Depths of Fear is by no means perfect, but it is quite good. Yes, it's very indie; the graphics are not bleeding edge and it is a bit rough around the edges in some spots. But the atmosphere, theme, setting, gameplay, and continued developer support are outstanding.			"

												Depths of Fear is just the right kind of janky. Twitchy controls, weird physics and darkness create a surreal, daunting atmosphere. Overpowering monsters have you constantly on the run through the randomly generated nightmare that is the Labyrinth.It's not as overall scary as it's suspenseful though because the basic structure is always the same - run from the monster, find a key, go to the next level. A few scripted set piece hazards would have been nice.You may also randomly find the strongest weapons early on, which are strong enough to remove the stress and challenge from combat.Randomly generated levels are the only roguelike feature by the way.

												As far as horror games go especially in the Indie market, you're going to be in for a lot of jump tactics and corridors, collecting things for no purpose and the same thing that's been seen way too much in the horror genre, it's sort of like the movies, isn't it?This game doesn't rely on that.Depths of Fear isn't a horror game per say, but the atmosphere and surroundings can certainly put it in that category.The idea of a Labyrinth sounds like it will be an ordeal, with trecking about in circles. DoF is laid out so well that it gives you motivation to carry on and to see what's around each bend, whilst hiding in the shadows from dire enemies.It does have it's cons though, but the pros outweigh them by a long shot.The stealth can be tricky and messy at times, making it pretty difficult, at times you'll like the challenge and then other times you'll be wondering how that even happened. But frankly that's all i've found bad about this so far.With an original story and some nice RPG elements to it, DoF delivers a great experience hard pressed to find and at a price (I got it on sale as well) you get a bang for your buck. If you like your games dripping with a dark atmosphere, then you won't be dissappointed.			"

												It's not finished, but there's no light at the end of the tunnel anyway.  This game is about as poorly made as it could be and still be beatable.  The AI is obnoxious, as is the combat.  The exploration of the pitch black single floor levels is non-existant, which is fine since there's no particular reason to look for the items occasionally sprinkled within.  There were points I genuinely thought the bosses were bugged to not take damage, but I was always overthinking.  There are no 'puzzle' bosses, just bosses with shoddy hit detection making the default tactic more difficult than usual.  Buy it anyway because I've never laughed harder than when I went to the shop.  The soundtrack for the entire game is so bizzare it has to be experienced live.			"

												Quite a fun Ancient Greece themed stealth dungeon crawler with randomly generated levels and rogue lite treatment of player death. You're trapped in the labyrinth of the Minotaur, and as you progress through you tresspass in portions of it patrolled by the most well known monsters of Greek mythology. The labyrinth is dark, so you need your torch and a keen eye to avoid stumbling into deadly traps or minor monsters. The thing is, while the torch is lit the main monster will stumble upon and notice you sooner or later, so the game becomes a nice balancing between avoiding these different types of hazards and you really feel the tension when a monster is patrolling right by you as its torch almos lits the corner you've crammed yourself into - or alternatively it does reach you and you try to make a run for it before being horribly mauled. Good times!I haven't had the time to play Knossos too much as of yet, but I could recommend this game for anyone who has played old 3D dungeon games and enjoys a bit of nostalgia, or for players who enjoyed Eldritch as the two titles have some similarities in gameplay (except every level of Knossos has a different type of Shoggoth making your life difficult). Alternatively, a stealth fan looking for an original indie title to sate their appetites will propably feel very much at home. The previous build had a problem with the monsters honing in on you a little too much but as of 08.10.2014 the problem has been fixed - don't be fooled by some older reviews dealing with the problems of that build.

												The game is buggy, in that I mean if you are behind a satyr and it says you're hidden the satyr magical sees you buggy. Maybe it grew an eye on the back of it's head? The combat system is the same get a weapon and smack the♥♥♥♥♥off the enemy but makes it feel even worse when the A.I is horrible for instance, The weaker A.I I have seen stack on each other, stop randomly during a chase or fight, or not even react. The graphics are bad which doesn't bother me but it lags my computer and I can play payday 2 at a high res and get over a solid 60 FPS so I turned down the graphics and when I did I almost noticed no difference. The levels are repetitive, I talking like you play it for 20 minutes and you will probably know all the satyr levels and they almost seem to last forever. The scary effect is good, the bleat of the satyr definitely made me jump a couple of times but it is also ruined by the abysmal stealth system because the weaker A.I always see you and like I said the satyr has a third eye. The soundtrack feels great on the game really giving it the mythological feeling and it really has some great mythological knowledge such as praying to certain gods to recive their power for that level. But in the end the game is really poorly executed, which disappoints me so much because I looked at the positive comments and bought the game because it looked interesting to me because of the new fresh idea so at this time I would give the game a 4/10 for being a promising game that misses the punch. I'll update my score if they fix the game.			"

												Oh noes. This is so disappointing. It looked so promising. :(I started the game, jumped down into the labyrinth, landed in the water puddle and fell trough the floor.This seems to happen every time. At least the menu gives you an option to reset your location to the main hall which is the room with the puddle I should have landed in.I went to the Satyr level and spotted him right away. He was stuck in a corner and couldn't move. I explored the level for a few seconds and went down to the next and deeper level. This time the Satyr didn't stuck... but I got stuck after I explored the level a bit further.On top of that the game looks rather dull. Pixelated shadows, lava doesn't emit light and textures, models and animations are as weak as the A.I.This game has so much potential! Is has such a great atmosphere and setting. I would love to see this improved.I'm going to invest more time into this. My hope is that my first impression was wrong.			"

												A very fun game, I bought it on sale was worth every penny but to be fair if it was not for the random bug here and there it would be worth the reg. listed price. Pros.1. a different kind of fps Adventure horror game.2. every area felt like it was randomly generated (not counting main area or boss areas)3. endless dungeon allowing for some replay value4. good choice of weapons to pick from (club, spiked club, 2 swords, dagger, axe, spear, cross bow, and pitch fork)5. some might mark this as a con. but i liked the music it went well with the game and texture style really made me feel it was a true late 90's gameCons.1. Could have more controls in setting menu (like for brightness cause it was extremly dark even with touch out)2. Awful textures (feels like a late 90's game)3. Buggy lamps that some time didn't light4. Not being able to carry more then 1 potion5. Not being able to carry extra food.6. AI for monsters felt slow 7. Boss areas felt extremely under done (very plane)8. Main area felt like it need more touches (say after you clear a area i felt like it should be lite up so that one knows its cleared9. Couldn't alt tab in and out of game mouse acted weird10. The sword I bought didn't show up in the main area (it was there but the model would not show on the wall but did in other areas)11. Jars some times made no sounds after being destroyed.12. Some areas would have no exit13. Hydra would respawn with heads still missing (dont know if it was meant to be like that)14. After you die from moster items picked up are lost but not bolts for cross bow15. Boss seemed not to take damage every so often16. Lack of informastion about potions17. Some times exit would be covered by the floor or have water / lava floating in it but it would vanish after using ket to unlock.But if you can get over it's minor issues it is a very fun game that makes you feel like you're back in the 90's, even with it's long list of bugs that I ran into I enjoyed every minute of it. In my eyes with a little more polishing it would be a great game, I would remmend it to any one to try out.			"

												UPDATED: The game hasn't changed that much from it's previous state, just some improvements and extra contents. I should say that i were excited the first time i started to play, and got into the atmosphere of the game pretty well too, but the longer i played, the more i disliked this.Game's concept it's applied pretty well to be a work of only one person, but badly optimized in it's complex:- the graphic options doesn't make that big of a change in performance or quality, and resolution choices are very limitated (wasn't a problem for me), and the music feel like to not blend well with the game's atmosphere; also the volume option of the game reaches 0 at every startup of the game, and you have to change it manually every time;- character's sprint has been capped now and is normal; when you take damage your camera will blur, that becomes more annoying than scaredy or terrifying, as supposed to be;- attack animations feel bad, both for the player's one and all of the monsters;- most enemies does the same damage to you (except for some bosses, that might have an extra trick to their normal attacks) and, in the same way, you do with particular weapons, that you can find around or buy with gold to keep those in your racket.I would say again that this game isn't that bad to be the work of only one, infact it has great ideas and a good application of those, but it's just too messy to ignore this, for me.

												No, just no. This is broken beyond hell. Mouse sensitivity at start was ludicrous spin million times around with slightest mouse movement. Buying an item caused the camera to  lock at 90 degrees angle up so lowest i could look was 45 degrees up from straight ahead, and highest was me looking backwards at an awkward upside down angle. Who knows what else this has, but how am I supposed to play such a broken game?Update (2017-01): Tried again after apparently 2+ years? Things are fixed surely by now, yes? So I get pushed down into the pit. Told to jump out of water to start the game proper. Instead I fall into the void below. No. I'm not going to change my review.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I love greek mythology, and have always loved the idea of the labyrinth. However, I can't recommend that anyone purchase this game... The game runs horribly slow on a pc that it should not be running slow on. Which immediately was a red-flag. Finally, after turning it to the lowest settings I was able to actually move around a bit. I went down in to my first run. I made it to what I presume is the final level of the Satyr area on my first go and noticed a pretty large amount of errors. First off, the satyr (which is the main thing you're to avoid in this segment of the game) would get stuck in random places, making it impossible to chase me even if it wanted. The satyr fell through the map on at least 2 occasions, and generally is just programmed poorly. All of the other creatures are so basic in their AI that it's almost upsetting.. They just move, and then attack if you're in range, and the way they attack doesn't change the gameplay, or how you react in any way. The stealth elements are pretty horrible too. You turn off your torch, and take 2 steps back, and immediately you're hidden! The game could have been good, it wants to be good, but it's bogged down by bad programming.			"

												I usually wait for a few more hours of gamepaly to write a more in depth review but, since I'm uninstalling it, I don't think my opinion will change any time soon.First of all, this is not a horrible game at all. It's got a lot of good ideas under its belt. It is extremely amateurish-looking, from graphics and sound to the implementation, but these things are easily overlooked when the game as a whole works well. However that is not the case, nothing really clicks they way it should (I'm assuming). The stealth mechanics doesn't work well, I never know when I'm really hidden, making the indicator completely useless. The game tries to set a mood of fear and tension but it never really succeeds. I tried using a few weapons to see if the game shines more from the action perspective but so far I haven't got much luck there too.As much as I like the general idea of non linear challenges, mixture of stealth and survival, greek mythology etc, the game is not fun.

												I will update this often (in the hope that my gameplay will be indicative of others' and, as such, a good log for the developer, should he find this)(because *shrug*). Comments meant specifically for the developer will be CAPITALIZED. Regardless of the content of this ("")review(""), I will record a recommendation until a time that I've found Depths of Fear :: Knossos to be undesirable (should a time arise)(but, the premise of the game and the fact that it's the product of one man; THUMBS UP). As of 1.4.4, the developer has addressed two of the issues I had recorded (whether because of this review or not): ""Fixed being able to hide in some torch lit areas... Vases shatter properly when struck in-level.""Update 1.4.3 (Blood Moon), 10/8/14:I fall into a cramped Dungeon. I root through 2 rooms, see the Satyr's torchlight, put mine out, hunker down, move while crouched to the next room as the Satyr turns to head towards me, I somehow alert him after having made it around the corner (I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥). I can't find a way out, other than a hole with what looks like lava underneath it, so I say ""*sigh* Guess I'll attack it again."" I get in a good 7 hits with the club that costs 1 Gold. Woah, how 7?! Well... THE SATYR KEPT WARPING INTO WALLS, allowing me to hit it until it finally won out in the endurance contest.Later: I made it to level 2 of the Satyr! Without being detected! Alas... I peeped the Satyr's lightsource so I avoided it. Made the rounds, found myself back where I started. Still, that light persists! I check it... *facepalm* THE SATYR IS MOONWALKING - IT'S STUCK IN PLACE! From The Update Notes: As of Update 1.4.1: GUI includes: health and energy indicators, sound meter, crouch/sneaking iconAs of Update 1.4.3: Health UI removed ...Forgive my ignorance but, as I understand Updates, each of them patches the game; unless altered by subsequent Updates, former Updates still impact the game.BY ""HEALTH UI REMOVED"" IS IT MEANT THAT ALL 4 ASPECTS OF THE HUD IMPLEMENTED IN 1.4.1 ARE REMOVED? OR, AS I THOUGHT, STRICTLY THE HEALTH METER? I DON'T HAVE ANY OF THESE HUD INDICATORS, UNLESS THE ""HIDDEN"" INDICATOR AT THE 12 O'CLOCK POSITION IS THE CROUCH/SNEAKING ICON.Notes (as opposed to logs): PERHAPS THE PATH BY WHICH THE BOSSES TRAVEL COULD BE MORE RANDOM? I've no idea what to expect throughout the game in terms of map sizes, but maybe the bosses could make one round in a certain path and then in the next round of scouting, take a different path? TWO WINDING TRAILS TO AVOID WOULD BE MORE STRESSFUL THAN THE ONE STRICT PATH.I'm not being snide: From the game, I can only assume that the basic vision is reflected, regardless of future Updates. Speaking as a critic (with none of the accolades pertaining to such a title, simply a player who wishes to give feedback), I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE LIGHT WHICH EMANATES FROM OBJECTS YOU CAN INTERACT WITH BE DULLED; perhaps have the light from objects grow as you get closer, dim as you go further from. Having updated the game so that static torches can only be lit once, requiring destruction of the torch to snuff it, you're still tweaking how much leniancy the game offers us. By dimming the light of Gold, Books, Keys, etc., further trepidatious exploration would be encouraged, thus immersion would increase.By the way, I didn't see in any Update notes anything refuting Health regeneration. I have none. I've read in other reviews that at one time, at least, there was health regeneration. I doubt such a significant change is a glitch on my part, I can only assume you have removed it or lessened it greatly. Please be sure to make notes of every change made.I'm absolutely ham-handed on the keyboard (""What're you doing playing games on PC then?!?!"" I gave away my PS3, have a laptop, there you go.) - I read elsewhere that apparently Controller Support is meant to be implemented eventually. Incredibly tense, I can only play Knossos for short spurts before panic overcomes (haha); currently, there is controller support in the sense that  actions can be mapped; there are no Controller Options. Having mapped all of the actions successfully, the camera is irrevocably inverted. As soon as Controller Support is actually implemented, I will be able to play this for hours on end, as I'll be wholly confident in my ability  to  play.			"

												This game is a fantastic work of art that should not be missed it would make any die hard console fans jealous of how the game is limited to only one platform. This game falls into the most unique genres I have ever seen. In conclusion I would have to say that the most appealing attribute of the game is that it is so terrible; it has terrible animations, bad grammer, broken physics, horrible looking monsters that look like they are from an early release title for the ps2. But with all that the game is still very fun to play because of its immense flaws.""It is so bad that it is good."" 11/5			"

												Ok...I did not know one man alone built the game....so KUDOS !!!The concept is wonderful....randomly generated levels (they look alike sometimes but they are not the same so don't let that fool you), random drops of weapons and items, good fights, scary environments. If this was with cry engine 3 or similar, would be some fantastic game, kind of Dark Souls in first person perspective. Luckily, the concept and gameplay are good enough to overcome the graphical aspect.BUTThere are too many bugs. Actually mainly one that recurs every 5 seconds...and that is enemies teleporting here and there clipping through walls and stuff. The main beasts (the ones you have to kill) will get stuck in the wall and after getting stuck, they will fly in some place you can't reach (ON the walls, for instance) making it impossible to kill them....not always a gamebreaker but be aware that the game doesn't feel polished enough, it is quite rough in animations and everything. But what can you ask from one man and 6 dollars ? :) recommended anyways.			"

												This game has such a great concept to it, but it is fundamentally flawed. I want to love this game, its like amensia with combat and based in my absolute favorite setting, but its completely marred with glitches, clipping issues, horrible AI and horrible combat.I hope the glitches and clipping issues will be fixed, but I highly doubt that they will do a complete combat overhaul, because thats what the game needs. The combat is poke thing, thing pokes you, repeat until one is dead. Speaking of enemies, the AI is just terrible. They get stuck on everything, they are beyond basic and make the game completely unfun.If they fix the AI, the combat, and the glitches they will have an absolutely amazing game on their hands. Until then, its not worth playing for anyone except the most patient person.			"

												I had high hopes for this game.  It has all of my praise for it's unique idea.  The idea of blending greek mythology with a rouge-like first-person stealth game, is fantastic.  If only they had spent more time, or money, or effort, or whatever it took, to make it look and play better.  The graphics look like the game should be running on Windows 98, and the combat consists of just click MOUSE1 until you die, or the thing you are fighting dies.  It does a decent job of atmosphere, but just like anything else (this game especially), once you see the monster you are so afraid of, the magic is lost.  I lost interest very quickly playing this due to poor combat design and poor graphics (and this is coming from a guy who loves games like Dungeons of Dredmor).  Do not waste you hard earned dollars buying this game.  While the idea is there, it was executed so poorly.  Maybe the minds that made it will get another shot at making something with a little more polish.			"

												A stealth roguelite themed around Ancient Greek mythology - it should be a divine triumvirate of excellence. It isn't. The stealth is absolute pants, and the combat, which I was told should be avoided in favour of crawling down the ill-made trouser leg of stealth, is actually an easier route, but nonetheless constitutes the other leg of these terrible pants.Typical gameplay: sneak around; get noticed by the monster(s) for no apparent reason; apply the nuclear-powered jetpack Zeus must have granted you to sprint at the speed of sound through this claustrophobic map totally devoid of landmarks; extinguish your flame to leave yourself in TOTAL darkness (I mean like, pitch black, your eyes have actually inverted into your skull darkness); wait a bit - perhaps using the time to do something more enjoyable and productive, like picking your nose; at some arbitrary moment elect to continue tediously searching for a key within this map of banality - often located in an area which requires first-person platforming, which I know most people will be very excited about; CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE! either: a) encounter the monster again, run, hide, run, die, whatever, or b) collect the key and resume searching for the exit in a fashion similar to your search for the key, which is to say one utterly devoid of fashionability; repeat this a few times in a row, eventually coming to an arena where you need to kill the area boss; engage in some forward-back-slash ballet with your braindead dance partner in Minos' Community Theatre; appreciate the enormity of your accomplishment. Don't you dare have the gall to quit the game before you get to the boss though, as it doesn't record the number of levels you've passed in any given dungeon - only whether it's been cleared in its entirety or not. Oh, and just to break things up, on occasion Theseus becomes so enamoured with the level geometry that he simply refuses to move through a passage's incomparable low-res beauty.With all that said, I cannot overstate just how dark, and just how samey this game is. With the torch on you can maybe see a body's length in front of you. When coupled with the repetition of objects and textures, this makes it near impossible to work out where you are in relation to anything else, leaving you to blindly fumble around until you stumble on the requisite locations. Abysmal AI and terrible combat aside, the darkness and half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥maps are easily DoF's worst elements.I appreciate that this is all the work of one guy and it's his first commercial effort etc. etc. but the game is just bad. It bears the musty stench of the amateur from wall to wall. DoF achieves graphical parity with Quake, musical parity with TRON (and not the Paft Dunk version), and applies a VHS-style filter to make it seem like it's achieved the whole retro thing, when it's really just trying to excuse/justify looking and sounding like absolute♥♥♥♥♥ Which is not to say that I don't appreciate a bit of♥♥♥♥♥on occasion, but if you're going to give me♥♥♥♥♥ at least make it interesting to play with - give it some bounce. DoF fails on absolutely every aesthetic and mechanical level, but more over, it just fails to be fun.			"

												YOU CAN WALK ON LAVA. 10/10.In all seriousness, out of the twenty minutes that I have played, I wasn't impressed at all. My expectations weren't exactly sky high; I did buy this game for 54 cents after all. Anyways, when I saw Depths of Fear: Knossos on the market, I was pretty intrigued by it. A stealth game based on Greek mythology? Sign me up. But when I first booted up the game, the first thing I noticed was how underwhelming the game was. You start off in some kind of room, then some dude leads you to the outside where you have to jump down into a hole. Once you hit the water, you're immediately consumed by darkness, and have to find a way out of the room. Then, you enter this massive cave-like area where you find a store, where you can buy weapons, and several paths leading in different directions. The first thing I did was buy a weapon. The only thing I could afford was a club. So I bought the club and made my way through one of the paths, (with the added difficulty of not being able to see 5 feet in front of me, even with a torch). I eventually found a door with a skull. This door was presumably an entrance to a dungeon. So, I entered, and I found a monster. I was honestly sick of the dungeon's darkness so I just ran up to it and was immediately struck down by the evil creature. (The monster looked funny as ♥♥♥♥ by the way). I respawned and found another door. However, this door was across a bridge with a lava pit under it. (A Shrek reference?) So I made my way across the bridge and found no way to open the door. (I assumed that there was some kind of puzzle involved and left the door alone). So I jumped into the lava pit. I didn't die by the way. I could literally walk across the lava. I was stuck and there was no way out. So I commandq'd the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I also nearly forgot to mention that the game looks like♥♥♥♥♥too. When I reached the menu, I could barely even move the mouse because of the really bad lag. So I just had to turn the graphics all the way down, and even then it still lagged.			"

												You start out in a small garden with 9 or so doorways that lead to 9 bosses you must defeat to unlock a sword to defeat the tenth one and ultimately beat the game.  You only have a dagger to aid you on your first journey into the laybrinth. You climb down some stairs, and you find yourself in a randomly generated level; it just so happens the key to unlock the next level was generated right in front of you. You pick up the key, look to your right; the exit. Wow, that was easy you say to yourself; I wonder if it will be like this the whole time? You beat 3 levels with equal amounts of effort. Now the boss battle. Your soo pumped right now, you collected all your awesome weapons and gold for this moment. The boss appears on the other end. In the middle of the room is a golden figure on top a pillar. You decide to pick it up. Lava begins rising; the boss dies. Hurray you beat, the boss by picking up some golden object from a pillar.Well you ask yourself, maybe since this was my first boss, they were easy on me?No. Every single boss, with the exception of the last boss is defeated the same way.You reach the last boss, you slap him 5 times and he dies. Credits roll.I bought this game expecting better graphics, as those shown on the thumbnails. I didn not get that I got♥♥♥♥♥♥poor animated monsters and clunky gameplay mechanics. There are these kinds of alters in the game you pray to, in order to gain some magic power. It is one use and you barely find yourself using it.I would close my eyes and forgive it for it's animation,gameplay, and graphics. But even the programming is♥♥♥♥♥♥poor.Frequent crasheswall clippingmonsters walk through wallsNow I understand this was made by  single person, proabably took him a while to finish this game, but it does not excuse the fact that this game is too short and not even slightly challenging.4/10			"

												It’s an OK game, and I guess It’s amusing enough to complete (took me around 5 hours), but I can’t recommend it because:It’s poorly balanced, especially when it comes to boss fights. The first boss, Satyr, was tough, I didn’t realize it was even possible to kill him at first. The second, Cerberus, was very tough, partly because the arena you have to fight him in is cramped and you also have to deal with minor monsters encroaching on you from two sides. I think it took me around 10 attempts, if not more. At one point Cerberus got stuck in the lava, but didn’t die there and kept making menacing sounds from beneath the surface. There was no way for me to get him, I had to restart the level. When I tried to trick him to jump into the lava in a different spot, the result was the same.But all the other bosses were ridiculously easy to kill (including the Minotaur), I got all of them on the first attempt without taking any hits from most of them (with the exception of Medusa, I got her on the second attempt). And I used the weapons I picked up on the same level: saving money for better weapons doesn’t make these fights easier.If the very first level in the game is significantly harder than the very last with the main boss, you didn’t get the balance right.The first few levels were scary, but once you realize that you can easily outrun all the enemies, and spike traps are a bigger threat, there’s no point trying to hide: it’s safer to light a torch and start running around the Labyrinth at full speed. Besides, even if you do get yourself cornered and die, you won’t lose much progress.It’s poorly optimized. Running on i5-2500 and Radeon HD6950 at 2560×1440, I had around 40 fps in most rooms, but it dropped to 26 in some (e.g. all the rooms with lava and platforms you have to jump across). In a couple of rooms it dropped all the way to 6-9 fps. Yes, I can turn off the post-processing effects and drop the graphical settings a bit to make it run better, but it doesn’t look that great to begin with, and having 6 fps in a small square room with a bunch of barrels as the only objects is just bad.The latest changelog states that the new version has “greatly reduced chance of becoming stuck on geometry”, but I still managed to get myself completely stuck on geometry 4 or 5 times (that’s like once per every hour of gameplay) Restarting the level is the only way out — very annoying.Most weapons kill any creature (except the bosses) in one hit, so your choice of weapon doesn’t make much of a difference. Collecting gold to buy new weapons isn’t important.Key rooms are very repetitive as they’re almost identical from level to level.The character animations and models look so rough they’re more comical than creepy.On the plus side, sound design is decent (monsters sound a lot scarier than they look), and lighting effects are neat (even though they kill the fps).Endless mode plays pretty much exactly like the main mode, but with permadeath. I might get back to it just to get 100% achievements, but it’s not hugely exciting.This game was gifted to me by Anderson. Thanks, it was interesting to check out.			"

												It isn't scary. More importantly, I doubt it's even a finished product. Enemies continuously spawn in everywhere, instantly. They then proceed to spin silently, and indefinitely on their respective axis. Also every single prop that came within a foot of me violently exploded across the room which is incredibly problematic when you're supposed to use them to hide from the afore mentioned ""rotating rivals"". I'm surprised this half finished game has been around since even before early access and greenlight came to steam.			"

												*COMPLETE UPDATE*Ok, considering the last update increased the quality of this game quite a bit, I still have some issues with it. I'm upgrading my review from ""bad"" to ""has potential."" There are still some irritating bugs/features (sometimes the game says you're hidden when you're not, the Satyr seems to constantly know where you are/follow you for no discernable reason, I accidentally completed the first Satyr's level by falling into a hole instead of consciously completing an objective, etc). But! I'm really excited to report that many things I had complained about before are greatly improved by this update! Better yet, there were moments where I did experience true shock/terror, so that's also really promising.So, I still cannot whole-heartedly recommend this one quite yet, but if another update or two rolls out, I think this could turn into a really fun game. Great work guys! Keep it comin!			"

TL;DR: HOW TO SCREW UP YOUR EYES SIMULATOR... THE GAME!Oh boy... how can you like a game that you can't see S H I T in-game!?!?Not only that, but each time I tried to really play the game, I kept being trapped in that hole that you fall into, when the game starts...After 5 tries, I managed to ""appear"" in the level that you're supposed to land on and well... the game is way too dark.No brightness settings too in the options.Nah, I'm not wasting more time for this thing!Sad, because the concept of the game is interesting, the ambiance can be spooky and the music is decent!What I managed to grasp of this game, you basically are sent to hunt down the big bad Minotaur, into this big labirynth, that seems randomly generated. The trick is, you can only kill that ""boss"" with a locked sword, which requires you to navigate and kill a few ""legendary"" monsters of the Greek Mythology in order to unlock (Pointer: I didn't managed to get there!). Stealth is greatly focused in this game however, the problem is the stealth is very broken. Even if you unlit the torch, hide in corner or other corridor (and literally blind yourself), the enemy will still find you, magically! So the A.I. is atrociously bad and the lack of lighting is my biggest thumb down. Your torch lit about a feet or two ahead of you... how can that be good? Monsters are also clearly overpowered. You barely inflict any damage! You just keep dying over and over.Bah, poor execution of the game and the developers clearly lacked vision to make the game more appealing... AND PLAYABLE!OVERALL:If only that game was better tuned in the options and add more brightness, I might have given it more chance! And the poor balance of the weapons vs monsters should be reworked! There should have been a progression system, that let's you get better and be able to challenge stronger creatures with time and persistence.RECOMMENDATION:Even at a great deal, stay away of this game and play something else... heck, even a Facebook game is better... and I hate Facebook games with a passion!RATING:TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK!

												This game is a fantastic work of art that should not be missed it would make any die hard console fans jealous of how the game is limited to only one platform. This game falls into the most unique genres I have ever seen. In conclusion I would have to say that the most appealing attribute of the game is that it is so terrible; it has terrible animations, bad grammer, broken physics, horrible looking monsters that look like they are from an early release title for the ps2. But with all that the game is still very fun to play because of its immense flaws.""It is so bad that it is good."" 11/5-kkRuse 2014			"

I like the whole idea of Centaurs, etc, but the whole Greek Mythology thing is hard to base a game around while keeping it original. The concept has been overused in video games/movies and only something amazing could rise to the top of the scene. I'd rate it 5/10, judging on storyline, map orientation, textures and Centaurs.			"

												I find it a bit hard to be harsh on an inexpensive indie game, and I praise them for a cool idea, but thats about as far as the compliments go.  The cons that overweight the pros in this game revolve around the repetitive nature of the gameplay.  Yes, the graphics and clipping of objects in the random generated world take me out of the immersion but those are slight and I can look over.  Basically you have a handful of realms that you have to fight certain mythological creatures.  Each creature's realm has a key you must find and the door to open the next which leads to another handful of levels you have to go through in order to reach the 'boss' of that particular creature.  The sad thing is, each level is really no different from the last, so you end up doing the same thing over, and over, and over.  If you didn't get bored with the first mythological creature, imagine doing this again for the next creature and the next.  Essentially you play the same level over 30 times probably with little variation.  A simple game for simple minded people.			"

												DON'T THINK I DON'T LIKE THIS GAME BECAUSE OF MY NEGATIVE REVIEW!!! IT'S ACTUALLY AN AMAZING TITLE!!!The only problem that I have is that the game runs poorly on my PC. And I guess it has nothing to do with my PC 'cause I can play other games (like SKYRIM) on my PC and they'll just run fine and fast. I texted the Dev of the game and he told me to change something in the graphic-options but that didn't help me either (the guy is a really nice and kind person by the way^^).I know that this game runs really well at the PC's from other people so i guess it's just my own problem >.<So enough with my problems let's talk about the gameplay ^^DOF:KNOSSOS is an first-person roguelike. You play as Theseus who gets thrown into the old labyrinth of the Minotaur. Now you have to defeat 8 greek monsters to form the sword which has the power to kill the Minotaur. Every creature has his own little dungeon. You have to fight sneak and run your way through those dungeons. At the end of those little ""caves"" you have to battle against the creature who inhabits the dungeon. And that's this game in a nutshell :D. Is it good?: Yeah it is a blast. Some of those creatures are really creepy and sneaking is a lot of fun. Collecting weapons like a club or a spear to fight the beings you encounter is great. And overall is the game an amazing experience. So if you think your PC can handle this game (:D) give it a try! You wont regret it!			"

												I just completed the game and I've got all but one achievement (the one where one has to beat 15 'random' dungeons in a row), so it's time for a quick review. So let's talk about the good, the bad and the obvious.The story is simple. You are placed into a labyrinth where you have to face multiple mythological creatures in order to unlock a sword, which you use to beat the final boss, the minotaur, and escape.Gameplay-wise, you have to beat 8 dungeons, each with a different mythological creature as its boss. For every dungeon, there're three levels, with the fourth level being a boss fight. During the first three levels, you walk in a dark labyrinth searching for a key and a gate that leads to the next level. Every level is randomly generated. Levels contain traps, like floor spikes and pit holes, and sometimes also enemy creatures, which you can easliy kill if you have a weapon. Every level also has the boss creature walk around. I believe these creatures are immortal (except in the boss levels). Sometimes, there's also a different mythological creature present (like a minotaur in the centaur levels). Some of these boss creatures hold a light (like the satyr), so you can easily see them, but others are completely dark except their eyes (liek the cerberus). When you die, you have to restart the level you died on, but don't have to redo any previous levels. The boss battles are pretty easy though. You do have to beat all the levels of a single boss creature in a row (you may die, but not leave the game or try the levels of a different boss creature). In between the levels, you get healed and can go to the trader. While exploring the levels, you may find coins, books and weapons. With the coins, you may buy weapons in between the levels. With the books, you may buy (temporary) bonusses, like a heal effect, speed boost, or smite attack, in the levels themselves. The weapons you pick up in the labyrinth disappear when you die, whereas the weapons you buy from the trader stay permanently.The game is not without faults. First of all, let's talk about the obvious, the graphics. The graphics are not the greatest. Although great graphics aren't always necessary, I think this game could benefit from some better graphics. The audio is could be improved as well. The game also has some bugs. There were a couple of times where I got stuck in the ground and had to restart the level. The game is also really dark. I get that that is a part of the game's atmosphere, but at times it just gets too dark that it's bothersome. Lastly, the game auto savese and doesn't allow you to save manually whenever you want. The menu says ""save and exit"", but when you do, it doesn't resume where you left. I really enjoyed playing this game. It's a simple game. I wouldn't really call it a horror, but there's some suspense.  It's a fun game and it's not expensive. I'd say, look at the screenshots and decide for yourself wether this game is something for you or not.			"

												Depths of Fear: Knossos is quite an interesting game. Certainly worth the two dollars I spent buying it on sale. The game is quite flawed though having been developed by only one person I believe. In fact before the recent patch it was literally unplayable, crashing to desktop often. The patch did squash many bugs and I was able to finish the game yesterday.The graphics are rough, the animation janky. The ambiance is very good though. Gameplay is serviceable but nothing special. However, the sound design is perhaps one of the best things about the game. The sounds of the various monsters are frightening and atmospheric. The music is great, reminiscent of 80's cult horror movies at least that is what it made me think of. It actually reminded me a bit of the Hotline Miami soundtrack. The developer is quite skilled at sound work I thought.Depths of Fear: Knossos is a rogue-like dungeon crawler. Or perhaps rogue-lite is a better term for it. You are the legendary Theseus thrown into the pits of Knossos and you must defeat the Minotaur and escape. There are several mythical monsters you must defeat including the Hydra, Medusa, and Cerebus. Each monster you defeat gives you a gold coin and when you have enough coins it unlocks a sword and you can then face the Minotaur.Before you can defeat the monsters you must first go through the randomly generated dungeons trying to find a key to escape. You find money you can use to buy various weapons and books used to by spells by worshiping at shrines of various gods. The monsters are stalking you and cannot be defeated. You can kill them but they just respawn. You must hide or run for you life. This is quite tense and enjoyable adding a bit of survival horror to the game. There are zombies and skeletons roaming around sometimes too. Escape from four of these levels and you move onto an arena level where you face the monster. It can then be defeated and you can retrieve the coin.I have a passion for greek mythology and this game really did the myths justice. Quite a unique game that I was glad to experience. "

												Depths of Fear :: Knossos is a weird game. You fall into the underground Greek labyrinth where you can enter many different areas of the labyrinth freely, each housing a different Greek mythological creature that you have to overcome. Essentially, it is a game of hide-and-seek that requires you find your way through multiple rooms (procedurally generated to an extent) until you get to the final boss fight room, and win, at which point you ""complete"" the area. There's also a strange Poseidon-looking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the wall that pops his head out and sells things to you. The objective is to complete all the areas. It's been a while since I've played it, so I don't remember much else.Overall it's a terribly made game. Technically, it is a disaster — awful animations and graphics, glitches all over the damn place, more or less the same AI used for everything, it's repetitive and short... and yet it's just offbeat enough that you might enjoy it. Still, I can't recommend it even if I do like the setting, because everything else about it is just bad.			"

												While this game has many persistant bugs (like A.I pathing gets stuck or getting stuck on the very edges of platforms), the game maintains this B-movie vibe similar to that of John Carpenter with the design direction of the enemies, the music, and the mindset the game wants you to have. This game is very good, the dev really knows how to set a great atmosphere comparable to Quake 1, but it does require you to really look over a lot of it's short comings.			"

												This might be all Ray Harryhausen and 70s Italian horror-esque, but this is probably the only game that's managed to make me feel fear since System Shock 2. Running in terror from goat noises just happens to be my jam, so this gets a thumbs up from me. I've only played it for a little bit, but however much I paid for it was worth it to actually feel like a real human being. Not a real hero though, unfortunately.			"

												An overlooked Greek-themed dungeon crawler that is presented in first-person with rogue-like gameplay and procedurally generated labyrinths.Sacrifice yourself to the Labyrinth and face your darkest fears.No, literally, the labyrinths are commonly almost 100% pitch black and you must light torches and other sources of light. Be careful where you step however, for there are traps littering the map. Oh, and each footstep makes noise that can alert the monstrosities waiting in the dark...On top of traps, loot and enemies to encounter in each Labyrinth, there is a Greek-themed Boss for each floor taken straight from the rich and terrifying Mythology. I won't list them because discovering them is part of the experience.You may get weapons to fight these monsters, but you must explore and find enough gold in order to buy them. Weapons include, but are not limited to: a wooden club, a spiked club, a trident, a bow & arrows, etc.Like I stated, each time you enter a Labyrinth it is procedurally generated. You are never ever playing the same game twice, let alone the same floor twice. It is truly refreshing.Highly recommended, especially for how underrated it is.PERSONAL RATING: 8.5/10 - A very challenging, yet rewarding, rogue-like ""labyrinth"" crawler.			"

												This game has potential, but at this state it totally sucks, you have collisions bugs, pathfinding bugs and several features to improve. It's quite unbalanced : without torch you can't see and with the torch enemies will rush at you, all you can do is running, hoping they will lose you, and hide in the dark again because they're too many of them. But you will probably not escape because they quickly surround you, you can't pass through them and your weapon barely caress them. Sometimes you spawn in the level right in front of a trap which instantly burn your weapon, so even if you achieve to earn enough money to buy a better weapon, well, ♥♥♥♥ you.Anyway, this game need their developers to work again on this, it is not clean enough to be put on sale, or it has to be marked as Beta Early Access.Oh and price of CSGO keys is a con compared to the chances you have to get a decent skin.

												You will run. You will hide. You will fight. You will die.  That is no lie!  I get a creepy feeling playing this game.  I haven't played it very long yet, but that is only because I play so many games!  Like I said, I get the creeps playing this game and not too many games or movies give me the creeps. It's very atmospheric with great sound effects that will have you cowering in a dark corner hiding from the beasties in the game.  So far, I have only seen a few monsters, but one of them will creep you out for sure!  With it's creepy sound effects and huge weapon!  I'm gonna kill that mother one day! lol  What's cool is you can hide in the shadows and they will hunt you relentlessly!  You can run and you can hide, but they will eventually find you and kill you! lol  Unless you find the key and exit the level that is! :-)  It's a great late night game to play with the lights out and headphones cranked! I recommend this game to anyone looking for a decent video game with a creepy atmosphere!  Horror survival fans will like it!  It's different in a good way.  It is worth the price of admission IMO!The game runs silky smooth for me at max settings.  Here are my system specifications: Apple iMac, i5 Quad-Core Intel processor 3.1GHZ, AMD Radeon HD 6970M with 1GB dedicated video RAM, 4GB system RAM, 1TB hard drive running OS X version 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard), Journaled HFS+ Extended file system, Logitech optical mouse.

												I got this game for free and I had a good feeling about this game as it looked like it had potential. I was right about it having potential but I was wrong about it being a good and entertaining game. I can't recommend this game because it was just bad. For 2014, the graphics are♥♥♥♥♥♥poor and noticeably so. The textures look pixelated and easily it could have been done better as well as the graphical bugs that are plentiful but not game breaking. The environments are fitting for the game and  with the randomly generated floors, it does make it fresh each time. Although, this can greatly work against you as the stealth system in this game does not work well at all since the AI is random and most of the time unfair. Even when hidden in the shadows, the monsters will see you if the game decides they can. Then the AI as a whole is just broken. A lot of times you will notice the floor boss is not around then you will find out they are stuck somewhere which is usually where you need to go to finish the level. Also, something that seems unfair is not an enemy can be found on the floor besides the boss monster before you are detected. Once detected, monsters will continue to spawn regardless of how many you kill. The common monsters are not necessarily unfair when you compare them to the boss monsters though. The Medusa is probably the worst until the Minotaur. The Medusa has a bow that has very good accuracy but her gaze is the thing to be wary of. With out the crossbow, she is impossible since she speeds towards you and if you are even looking at any part of her when she is close enough, you are stone. Now, the Minotaur is invincible until the final stage and has one of the previous bosses with him on the floor. Usually the other bosses will not give you trouble but with the Minotaur, he can charge you and hit you with his axe. The axe will rarely hit you because the game has bad hit detection but his charge can make him go in circles to hit you and it makes him go extremely fast. Not to mention, you die in one hit by it. Now that I have talked about the really frustrating AI, it is time to talk about the other aspects of the game that makes it so much worse. The music is forgettable and probably more annoying than intense since it sounds like it belongs in a game from the Playstation or something like it. The controls are functional and work well but the things that would be nice is a health bar and stamina bar. The story is nothing special because it basically does not exist. The whole story can be summarized to Theseus (you) are cast down into the Labyrinth to save the daughter of King Minos (the lord of the Labyrinth). Lastly, I think getting this game for free is not bad since it is free but I would not pay money for this unless you are a die hard mythology fan but still I would think you to be disappointed as it would not be what you would expect. So, there is better things to spend your money on than this game.			"

												I like this game, but I'm not sure why. As a game, it's a really interesting concept. You start in the ""hub"" of the labyrinth and visit major Greek mythical monsters sequentially (eventually working up to the Minotaur). Each level consists of several short randomized maze segments, where you have to find a key and the exit while the monster tries to hunt you down. This formula is very simple and can get repetitive after a while, but it serves its purpose for what the game is. After completing these, you are dropped into an arena level, where you must fight the monster and collect its gold medalion. It's described as a horror game, but the scares were at a minimum.The atmosphere strongly resembled Greek architecture (at least to me), but some places were a little bland or unmemorable. The major shortcomings with the appearance of this game were in the models. Most of the models were generic, or acceptable at best. One that specifically comes to mind is the Hydra. Not only is it far smaller than its popular depictions (in the game, it's a bit bigger than a bear), but it's best described as... lumpy.This is where the game falls short. Not only is the gameplay terribly repetitive, but the randomness of the levels causes glitches to occur fairly frequently. Several I've encountered include floor tiles spawning over the exit (the exits are holes in the floor), the exit spawning halfway into a wall, the monster becoming stuck on/in the exit, getting stuck IN the Hydra, getting stuck on a ledge while trying to walk off it, and falling through lava onto a random ledge under the level which somehow caused me to win the level. The amount and the frequency of these glitches caused me to get stuck on level 9 or 10 on ""endless mode"" on a regular basis.If you want a quick, simple game to keep you busy for a couple hours, or if you like Greek mythology, I think the Steam price of $6 is fair enough.

												Even considering the fact that this game was a one-man effort, it is desperately in need of polish.  My first impression was muddied by falling through the floor of the world shortly after the game started, and so was my second impression.  My third attempt lasted a bit longer, until I encountered my first enemy, which was stuck in place snarling and flailng at me but unable to cross an archway that was clearly larger than it.  Without any idea of how to progress and no apparent way to damage or move past the enemy, I gave up for the time being.  The atmosphere is nice and this game has potential, but so far it seems far from achieving it.			"

												Depths of Fear is an interesting game. For those of you that didn't even feel the need to read what the game is about because it didn't look COD-ish enough for you, here is the rundown:                                                                                You are a greek man name Thesius.  You wake up in a jailcell in an undisclosed location and are immeadiatly brought to King Minos by two guards. Minos chuckles a little and tells them to push you into the gaping hole you're standing in front of. You fall what I can assume is the equivalent of two stories into a giant pool of water. You climb out as a feeling of dread slaps you in the face. You're in the ♥♥♥♥ing Labyrinth. (Not the film starring David Bowie, which would be immensely scarier.) Your attention is brought towards the existence of the Minotaur, which is Minos' son, who can and will murder the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you once you have killed every other creature from greek mythology. Try reading that all in one breath.Anyway, the game plays like a dated fps game, but not in a bad way. It feels natural, given the gameplay isn't full of assault rifles and other ridiculous gadgets. Instead, the game encourages stealth as you traverse the many dungeons filled with satyrs and chimeras. Overall, the entire feel of the game is entirely B-movie based. The film grain effect should catch your eye right away, as will the synth powered soundtrack. (Anyone who watched the original Clash of the Titans will know what I mean.)The game itself feels dated, but don't let it stop you from buying it because it sounds unimpressive. It's actually all done well. Depths of Fear exists because the creator was passionate enough to make it in the first place. 9.5/10			"

TL;DR: A casual first-person rogue-lite with a somewhat uncommon setting. While this game has a number of flaws in terms of gameplay, it scores all the more points on atmosphere. Get it while it's on sale.If you have played Eldritch, you'll be very familiar with the concept; start in a hub, explore branching levels from there, collect items which are then used to unlock the final portion of the game. It's nothing particularly new or refreshing, but the atmosphere is what makes this game stand out from its peers.Set in the Cretan city of Knossos, you play as Theseus who is cast down into the labyrinth as an offering to the minotaur. Being Theseus, you decide to fight back. You are given written instructions by Queen Ariadne to retrieve the medallions from around the labyrinth, and use them to break the seal on a sword which you will need in order to slay the minotaur. So far, so good.The controls feel alright. Movement isn't slippery despite the rather fast walking speed, jumping feels pretty tight as well. You have a number of actions at your disposal, each assigned to rebindable keys. Mouse input is limited to one button for using your torch to light things on fire, and one button for attacking. All in all, no issues.Now, the gameplay leaves something to be desired. You start off with the mandatory introduction dungeon - in this case, the Satyr's domain. The routine is as follows: you pick a door (e.g. Satyr), begin the level, look for the key to the exit. Then you proceed to look for said exit. All this while the ruling creature is hunting you. Then the next level loads, and you do this again. And then one more time. And then you're placed in a level which functions as an arena, where you're supposed to kill the ruling monster in combat. Doing so unlocks the gate to the medallion, and upon retrieving it you're sent back to the hub, free to pick another door. Repeat until all medallions have been recovered.As stated earlier, if you have played Eldritch, this should be very familiar ground to you. In fact, many other roguelikes follow this very same pattern, and thus you will find many roguelike elements in there: shrines at which you can spend your Wisdom resource in return for a single use power, unidentified potions that you can drink and receive either a positive or negative effect, randomly generated levels, traps etc.While all these elements are welcome, occasionaly they feel bland. For example, while there is small selection of weapons available for use (sword, dagger, club, trident, throwing spear, crossbow, shield and a few more IIRC), enemies generally die in one or two hits, no matter what weapon you're using. The boss creature is generally avoided until the last level, since killing them has no effect on further progression.And that is likely where this game's biggest let-down lies: the boss fights are so unbelievably bland and involve either a hit & run tactic if you only have melee weapons, or kiting if you have the crossbow - with the occasional sprint to put more distance between you and the thing that's trying to kill you. I understand that this is a low budget game, but if you're gonna work with source material as rich as classical mythology, you really do have a fair number of options available to you.With that out of the way, let me tell you about this game's strongest point: atmosphere. The lighting, dungeons and sound design are all top-notch. Even with the ugly textures this game features (you can almost count the pixels, I'm not even joking.), everything works together in such a way that even low fidelity textures and models manage to create an immersive experience. The music occasionally sounds out of place, but even that fits into a larger aesthetic; this whole thing becomes an absorbing fever dream version of the popular myth.The sounds the monsters make in the dark, around the corners - out of sight - also add suspense and a heavy sense of dread, at times. I would go as far as to say that if this game did not have any combat at all, and relied solely on stealth and puzzles, it would be a very accomplished survival horror roguelike. A bit of a missed opportunity.To close, if you enjoyed Eldritch, you'll enjoy this. It's not a pretty game, it's not a polished game, but it's definitely an enjoyable game - just pop on your headphones, play this in the dark, and take in the atmosphere. That is after you buy it on sale.			"

												You are Theseus and you've been thrown in the minotaurs maze. In order to get out from the maze, you must defeat the minotaur. This is done by first defeating some lesser monsters from Greek mythology (Medusa, Hydra, Manticore and so on) and unlocking a special magical sword which you use to beat the snot out of the mintoaur. Doing all this takes about 2 hours, so don't expect to be playing this game for a whole weekend.Inititally the game is pretty much your average avoid detection, sneak in the dark and hide in the closet kind of monster game, but as soon as you unlock some proper weapons (trident), it all comes down to how good you are at strafing (or strifing according to the controls menu). Most of the monsters are pretty easy, but there are some harder ones like the Medusa which turns you into stone if you get too close and look it in the eyes.You complete a level by first finding a key and then running to the exit and opening it. Each monster has 4 levels where the first two are the same, on the third one after you found the key the minotaur also joins in and starts hunting you and the fourth one is a boss fight where you slay the lesser monster.In total the game is pretty repetative and after a while, you just basicly want to rush through each level just to get to the end. On the other hand, it takes only few hours so it is not that bad.The games has a bunch of minor bugs most of which just cause you alot of amusement, but getting stuck on the cracks in floor or if a random stone or something has been generated on top the exit is really annoying since you have to restart the whole level to fix it.This game was made by a one man, and it shows. The animation quality is not very convincing and the AI path finding is some times bit weird, but still this game is better than anything I could create alone.All in all, if this game is in sale and you want to have a few laughs and so on, I would recomend to try it out.

												You can't see♥♥♥♥♥♥ And by that I mean everything is basically pitch black, and there are no setting for gamma/brightness. It would be funny if the game actually looks like it does in the screenshots, but it doesn't. Your torch lights the way two feet in front of you and stops. There's a bit of moonlight, but just enough to make everything look like an absurd joke.Basically, your experience will come down to this: repeatedly running past the minotaur who is stuck on literally every damn wall, and then running right into medusa... because you can't see her... because you can hardly see any thing.Baddies home in on you from several rooms away, even when you are ""hidden"". Fighting is a joke, hiding is a joke, everything is a joke. Anyone who gave this game a positive review was either trying to be funny or cut the terrible devs a lot of slack. It's not worth a single dollar on sale price, and it's not even worth your time free. I gave up on this game so quickly because you can't see a damn thing, even for a rogue, stealth, or horror game, this is ridiculous. I might change my review if they finally add some relevent settings, but it's already been nearly a year since this game came out.			"

												Even considering the fact that this game was a one-man effort, it is desperately in need of polish.  My first impression was muddied by falling through the floor of the world shortly after the game started, and so was my second impression.  My third attempt lasted a bit longer, until I encountered my first enemy, which was stuck in place snarling and flailng at me but unable to cross an archway that was clearly larger than it.  Without any idea of how to progress and no apparent way to damage or move past the enemy, I gave up for the time being.  The atmosphere is nice and this game has potential, but so far it seems far from achieving it.			"

												this game is actually kind of fun i was really surprised. if you can get past the horrible graphics its a good game. the only problem i had was when you would jump in the space rooms i would get caught on the edge and i had to restart because there's nothing you can do to get out.it would be awesome if they made a game like this for a console i would play the crap out of it, as long as it was longer with better graphics. if you like old school horror survival games you'll like this one just don't have high hopes on a story or more complex game play. its a very simple game. I don't know if its worth 6 bucks but it is worth something. hopefully there will be a sequel. Egypt would be cool.			"

												I got enough fun out of this game to beat it and unlock everything, but my gosh...The lack of polish is astounding!- The level exit can spawn inside the ground.- Objects can spawn inside each other.- Enemies get caught on walls/corners/things all the time.- You can get permanently stuck on tiny gaps in the ground that you might not notice because the game is SO dark (Doom 3 has got nothing on this).- You can walk up rock walls like you can climb mountains in an Elder Scrolls game.- You can pass through some walls and ceilings.- Walls are often overlapping, causing flickering textures.This game is the epitome of cheap 3D indie game, but is at least playable...If you can't get enough of ""rogue-like"" games with random generation, and have the patience for countless little glitches and weirdnesses, maybe pick it up cheap like I did.Otherwise, this is a great concept and theme, unfortunately made into a mess of a game.

												Ok, I have decided to delete my previous review upon playing the second newst version of 1.4.5Lets just say my last review was ""Beta Testing.""ALL of my previous complaints have been adressed and I think now I can recomend this title to anyone with full confidence. Especially those looking for something a little different, and especially if you are familiar with the lore and enjoy stealth, dark, first person action. Also I think the Score is excellent despite what others may say. This was appearantly all developed by 1 man, so in that regard alone, its a tremendous amount of work and undertaking. I would like to thank him for sticking through it and continuing to roll out updates for us brats, The work really shows and now that game works as intended, dont hesitate to pick it up.			"

												Honestly this game isn't the greatest, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. Its a very unpolished game with a promising concept and a great atmosphere- until the combat begins. The combat system isn't satisfying enough and the combat animations are not that great but the stealth element is done suprisingly well for the size of the Dev team (not much of a team, more like ONE GUY). Looking at it in that context I respect this game. I wouldn't buy it for full price but the sale price of 1.50 USD is perfect and I really hope the game continues to be updated.			"

												Aaaaaah, that's better, I made a review of this about 6 months ago, and back then, it was an abismal mess of bad AI, poor lighting, and un polished mechanics. All that has gone poof, the game has been polished, the AI has been fixed, and the lighting has finally made the freaking torch neccesary. Last time i stated that I couldn't progress because the Ai for the first monster was so abismal, I still can't progress, but now it can be 100 percent put down to me sucking at stealth ;). I'd love to tell you about the next monsters, and I probably will at some point, but right now, it looks like they've got it in the bag.			"

												Depths of Fear :: Knossos is a weird game. You fall into the underground Greek labyrinth where you can enter many different areas of the labyrinth freely, each housing a different Greek mythological creature that you have to overcome. Essentially, it is a game of hide-and-seek that requires you find your way through multiple rooms (procedurally generated to an extent) until you get to the final boss fight room, and win, at which point you ""complete"" the area. There's also a strange Poseidon-looking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the wall that pops his head out and sells things to you. The objective is to complete all the areas. It's been a while since I've played it, so I don't remember much else.Overall it's a terribly made game. Technically, it is a disaster — awful animations and graphics, glitches all over the damn place, more or less the same AI used for everything, it's repetitive and short... and yet it's just offbeat enough that you might enjoy it. Still, I can't recommend it even if I do like the setting, because everything else about it is just bad.			"

												I like this game, but I'm not sure why. As a game, it's a really interesting concept. You start in the ""hub"" of the labyrinth and visit major Greek mythical monsters sequentially (eventually working up to the Minotaur). Each level consists of several short randomized maze segments, where you have to find a key and the exit while the monster tries to hunt you down. This formula is very simple and can get repetitive after a while, but it serves its purpose for what the game is. After completing these, you are dropped into an arena level, where you must fight the monster and collect its gold medalion. It's described as a horror game, but the scares were at a minimum.The atmosphere strongly resembled Greek architecture (at least to me), but some places were a little bland or unmemorable. The major shortcomings with the appearance of this game were in the models. Most of the models were generic, or acceptable at best. One that specifically comes to mind is the Hydra. Not only is it far smaller than its popular depictions (in the game, it's a bit bigger than a bear), but it's best described as... lumpy.This is where the game falls short. Not only is the gameplay terribly repetitive, but the randomness of the levels causes glitches to occur fairly frequently. Several I've encountered include floor tiles spawning over the exit (the exits are holes in the floor), the exit spawning halfway into a wall, the monster becoming stuck on/in the exit, getting stuck IN the Hydra, getting stuck on a ledge while trying to walk off it, and falling through lava onto a random ledge under the level which somehow caused me to win the level. The amount and the frequency of these glitches caused me to get stuck on level 9 or 10 on ""endless mode"" on a regular basis.If you want a quick, simple game to keep you busy for a couple hours, or if you like Greek mythology, I think the Steam price of $6 is fair enough.

												6/10A solid, simple, and short horror piece that'd be an 8 with a little help (mostly with bugs).You take the role of Theseus, with the goal of fighting your way out of the mythic labyrinth and slaying the minotaur.  You start with nothing, but it's intended that you immediately find a torch in the enemy-free hub of the game.  There's also a merchant there to help you out with weaponry, once you collect some dough from your explorations.  The hub is a bit of a maze, but the sun shining down will light up your current entrance to the labyrinth.Each tier of the labyrinth is run by a different fabled beast and is comprised of several randomly-generated levels that are all sorts of dark.  The rules by which they're generated vary depending on which tier you're exploring, which is a nice touch, and the fabled beast will always be on the prowl.  Many levels have minor beasties you'll have to contend with, and occasionally another boss beast (or several?) will be wandering around as well.  Each level features a locked door for which you must find the key in order to move on.  Up until the point that you can afford the more powerful weaponry, you're not much of a match for any of the major beasts, so running and hiding are your primary tools for advancing through the levels.The audio is fantastic.  Weird synth music kicks in when beasts notice your presence, and it does a great job of increasing the tension you were already feeling.  Hiding behind a pillar or in a cabinet while you listen for the CLOMP, CLOMP of some hooves to recede is great.  I love being creeped out by things that simple, and it only works when it's done right.(minor spoilers below)My complaints about the game are primarily that it just feels unfinished - as if it were fast-forwarded through the playtesting phase.  There were several occasions where the terrifying beast I was avoiding was AI-ing itself in a corner somewhere, giving me free reign over the entire level.  There were also occasional clipping issues that forced me to restart levels.  The battleaxe seems overpowered, as the double-swipe basically allowed me to cheese my way through any beast in the labyrinth, short of the minotaur himself.  And the minotaur...was a huge disappointment. Visually, it was wonderful - especially the trippy red beams.  But he couldn't hit me.  I didn't notice this for a while since I was just fleeing maniacally whenever he spotted me, but I eventually confirmed that the dude just missed me every single time.  Turns out if an enemy can't hurt you, it decimates any fear you might have felt.  So that sucks.			"

												I got this game during a sale, played it a bit and genuinely had fun playing it and think that the stealth portion of the game has a bit of tension buildup on the player going for it. However, I still can't entirely recommend this game for a few reasons. (See very bottom of review for explanation on why I actually do recommend this)-Bad animations:A lot of the enemies when performing certain animations look either robotic and unlife like or just flat out don't sync up with the actions they're doing (Walking animation not matching movespeed while moving and not even moving in the same direction as they're animated to be).-Stealth not all that important to gameplay:This is a horror themed game and as such encourages stealth instead of just loudly rushing through each level. The stealth mechanic isn't all that great in the game, however, The only way the monster's A.I can even find you is if you either get to close to them or have your torch lit, running or breaking objects such as pots attracts no attention to you at all. Even if you do get seen by one of the boss monsters they're relatively easy to lose by just putting out your torch and hiding for a few seconds or you can just run from them since only two of the boss monsters have ranged attacks and you outrun them.-Bare bones monster A.I:The boss monsters in the labyrinth portions have a set patrol path that they appear to never stray from unless they spot you. If you choose to fight the boss monster, with a good range melee weapon such as the axe or trident, they're pretty easy to kill with a ""poke and back off"" method. If you do manage to kill the boss monter they eventually respawn but there's also a chance when they do respawn that they can get stuck at their respawn point and practically stop being a threat at that point (This has happened quite often when I kill the boss monsters).So in short, I thought the game was fun despite it's problems, but, objectively, can't recommend due to how unpolished it is. If the game's on sale and you have some interest in buying it go ahead, but for it's full price? To get a better idea of what the game is like see my video on it.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3-UqjhMM-QEdit: Even though I've already stated the problems with this game, in a way I still recommend it on the grounds that it seriously does have some heart put into it.
