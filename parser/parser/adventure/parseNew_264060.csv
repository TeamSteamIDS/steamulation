												There are box-moving puzzles out there and then there is FullBore...I hope I won't sound very biased saying that FullBore stands a bit aside from most of such games. Granted, it did not invent absolute novelty in the old genre. Instead, it used a different approach to it. There is a quote floating out there, ""metroidvania with boars"". I guess you can say so, because FB features a lot of exploration aspects and freedom of movement. And more than that, a lot of puzzles with less platforming. You aren't forced to solve them (many of them are optional), but the way these placed and designed - simply attracts you like a butterfly to the light. What could be hard in simple box moving and dirt digging..?Don't even get me started on puzzles, these are simply fantastic. They make so much sense that by the end of figuring out another one you will feel like a pure genius. They deliver insane amount of feel of accomplishment. Soon you will realize it is not about the gem or a secret you want to get or discover, it is about solving the damn puzzle that taunts you. And the most interesting part is that none of the puzzles require from you any special ability or an item - it is all knowledge and experience. The way blocks and boxes work or interact with each other and your understanding of this mechanism is the key to solve all the puzzles.But hey, a fun gameplay is not the only thing FullBore can be proud of. Quite lovely and pretty 2D graphics with awesome lighting and ""fake"" 3D effect will catch your attention at once. They fit the game surprisingly well, just like an amazing soundtrack by ""The Adjective Plural Noun"". But this is something you'd better to experience yourself, rather then read about in in a sloppy review.Long story short - FullBore was quite pleasant surprise of 2013 for me (The First Dig, part 1 of the game, was released earlier; Steam version features full game). It came out of nowhere and since then I fell in love with it. Really, how could you not love these adorable little boars?You won't get bored with Full Bore.			"

												I got Full Bore as part of some bundle or other, and to be honest I wasn't really all that psyched to own it. From the images and video provided, it looked boring. Okay, you're a boar and you dig. Great.I'm more than pleased to report that Full Bore may have honestly been the best game I received in that bundle.Full Bore is a game that is both cute and dark. You have boars who are also miners and say cute boar miner things and are named things like Hamm. You also have experimentation, possession, and sacrifice. The dark stuff never gets overly dark, though, and the worst bits are described in historical texts and frozen computer monitors, and never in any horrific detail.The game begins with Hildi or Frederick (your choice) slumbering in a meadow. After chasing some butterflies into a minefield, they are blown up and fall many, many stories below ground. They are then revived by some strange technology, and spend some time getting acquainted with the controls and bashing their head into things. Then they're launched in a rocket, through the bottom of a vault.Your preferred swine arrives just after some mysterious masked boar runs off, leaving you behind to take the blame for the vault's missing contents. Turns out, this vault belongs to the owner of the Full Bore mining company, and he's not about to let you off the hook with his riches vanished. You're pushed into another pit and sent off to recover the gem hoard.There are two main aspects of this game: puzzle solving and exploration. If you're a fan of both, then this may be the game for you! Puzzles tend to consist primarily of the destruction and manipulation of blocks. All sorts of blocks. Dirt, sand, crates, levitating, weird colored blocks that all phase in or out of existence if you destroy any one of them... Gems are found inside blocks, and puzzles often revolve around finding ways to reach these gem blocks, and finding ways to destroy the gem blocks. Discovering and reaching doors is another huge part, as you'll have to first get to the rooms containing the gems. And you'll find that there are more than a few mysterious secrets buried beneath the world's crust.The puzzle difficulty varies as you go. Obviously the general difficulty raises some as you get further, but you'll find puzzles of all difficulties throughout. It's understandable if you get stuck and look up some help, though this is definitely the type of game where it helps to step away for a few hours, or overnight. As you delve further, it's natural to start burning out after several rooms. I had numerous occasions where I just couldn't find any possible solution, then came back the next day and solved it in seconds.Different areas have different gimmicks to their puzzles. The toughest area of the game is filled almost entirely with things that will break as you step off of them, leading to some very unique challenges. It's honestly pretty impressive how much variety this game's puzzles contain, considering that everything is just digging and pushing and stomping.There's a nice, rewarding feeling when you accomplish something, too. Even a simpler challenge leaves you pretty proud of yourself. Collecting a gem and seeing your PigBoar Color's gem counter tick up one is great, but honestly most everything you do gives you a satisfying feeling of progress. Part of this is due to the obviously Fez-inspired map system, which tells you if there are any gems, doors, lore, or mysteries left in any given room. As you collect gems, they'll stack up, 1:1, in the previously emptied vault. Lore fills in the pieces of the plot, if you're into that. The mysteries... do what they do. And often, when you do some puzzling to reach a new door, upon your return you'll find that the room has undergone a subtle change to facilitate future passage to the door. Scaffolding will appear, dirt will disappear, crates will shift, all because the devs understood that nobody wants to have to solve that darn thing again in order to get back to a room that they had difficulty with the first time.I mentioned Fez, there. The game has a few inspirations that aren't entirely obvious, at first. I am full-on bragging when I say that I noticed these three early on into the game. The first thing I noticed was a bit of a Metroid-esque feel (but without the upgrades), along with those Prime-style digital and ancient lore logs. Then the very clear Fez map and the pool puzzles (bonus points for the fox/dog that occupies the room where you learn how those work) and a certain room named ""Vision"" (which I actually think is slightly cleverer than Fez's counterpart). And I was thinking it was probably because I'd just recently replayed Escape Goat, but the game reminded me of that at times, as well. Lo and behold, then, when I stumbled upon direct references to each of the above! So if you're a fan of those three games/series, then once again, this may be the game for you!There are a few endgame-type-deals which will drop you back to the title screen. You can always continue your game after these, picking up after your credit-causing conquests. You should never find yourself in a position where 100% is impossible.I know it's a puzzle game, but there are times where you'll need to be quick. It never asks the impossible, but you will be thankful for the rewind feature when you find yourself racing the character you didn't pick at the beginning, or desperately running from exploding purple... stuff. Or fighting the final/only boss, which is tricky in its first part, rough in its second, and downright tedious and not very fun at all in its last.I understand if the visuals don't appeal to you right off the bat, but you'll enjoy them more and more as you go. The lighting is done well, and the game can be rather pretty when it wants to. The soundtrack is cool, too, providing something to dig on while you dig on. Lots of distorted guitars laying down fitting grooves to keep you focused and immersed.If I have to come up with a complaint that nagged at me over the course of the game, it's the camera. Generally it's centered on you, but you can also use the right analog stick (assuming you're using a controller) to look around. I assume this is just remapped keyboard keys, though, as the camera does not register the sensitivity of your tilt. This means that you can't just move the camera slightly to view an entire puzzle. The camera will shift as far as it can - up to something like a full screen's length away - and sit there. If I'm trying to see at a distance, that's fine. But when I want a better look at the puzzle I'm working on, I have to keep shifting the camera up and back and up and back instead of just looking slightly up and taking it all in. Also, on a few occasions the camera just wigged out on me. It didn't happen often, but on the few occasions that it did, it could be pretty screwy on the eyes.I really, really enjoyed Full Bore. Far more than I ever expected to. It has good design, enjoyable writing, and most of all it has heart. It's not stuffed with references, but there are a small handful, along with bits of inspiration seeped in from strong sources and in all the right ways. Plus, wow, I got around 20+ hours out of this, and I didn't get tired of the game once through all that (okay, maybe a little bit in the Scrapyard). That's excellent for a block-manipulation indie puzzle game. If all that sounds as delightful to you as it does to me, then this is definitely the game for you.I'll leave you with one piece of closing wisdom: remember that, in that moment before a block falls, when it's hovering Wile E. Coyote-style in the air, you can actually hop onto it and use it as a platform. Knowing this ahead of time would have spared me one big headache.			"

												After playing Toki Tori and Blocks That Matter I started to think that I dislike such games... but now I realize that Full Bore is simply the first good tile-based puzzler that I've played. And all the competition pales in comparison.Notice that I didn't use the word ""platformer"". Well, that's because I associate the word with jumping, action, reflexes, etc. And that's not what Full Bore is about, don't be fooled by the trailers. Sure, there are a few places that require quick action, but you don't need any of the qualities required by typical platformers. The stop time+rewind feature mitigates this even more. Oh, and... you actually can't jump.Full Bore is quite a pure puzzle game. Everything, including the character, is always aligned to the tile grid. And the puzzles... they are extremely well designed and all very different. It's just hard to imagine how someone could come up with such a variety of puzzles, while keeping the set of concepts limited and so elegant.To be clear here, Full Bore is a difficult game, but never too difficult. To me the difficulty always seemed just perfect. Every puzzle felt rewarding. And I never got stuck for too long (taking a break always helped).About the open world thing... The world map is a lot like the one you see in FEZ. But all the rooms also have ""thumbnails"", and connections between them are shown very clearly. Rooms where there is nothing left to do are indicated as well. A portal system prevents travel from being tedious.And since I started this whole FEZ topic... It is clear that some inspiration is drawn from it, and yes, there are secrets in Full Bore. But finding them, and eventually completing the game 100% is something actually doable. Without guides, that is. All the secrets have good hints for them, and there definitely are no obscure and outright impossible to find secrets (unlike in FEZ).Full Bore can easily give you 25 hours of gameplay (this is about the minimal time that you need to explore everything, if you don't look up solutions, of course). Since I knew right away that I was going for full completion, I don't really know how much time it would take to just complete the story, while mostly ignoring optional tasks. Maybe 5 hours, maybe 10. There is even a ""preliminary"" ending that may let you consider the game completed, if you so choose.What is also very nice, you can never lock yourself out of something; no location, secret, ending or achievement is missable (well, to be honest, one achievement does explicitly require a separate playthrough, but don't concern yourself with this). Explore freely without worry.Controls are simple. Redefinable. No problems with them.Soundtrack is great.Graphics are immaculate.Full Bore deserves so much more love than it gets. Really is a hidden gem (haha).★★★★★★★★★★			"

												This gaming is AMAZING. It's like the honor-roll love child of Cave Story, Castlevania SOTN, and Adventures of Lolo, with maybe a streak of Portal. Simply fantastic. I don't have enough good things to say about this game. If you are on the fence, just buy it. Even if you don't like it, the devs deserve your money. I feel like I need to spread the word about this game, so more people will buy it. This is a sleeper for sure, and it's a real tragedy it didn't sell like hotcakes. I guess I'll write a short summary about why I liked it so much. The game is an open world block puzzler. That may not sound like the greatest thing ever, but the world the devs have created oozes mystery and begs you to explore every nook and cranny to find both it's arcane secrets, and to find more puzzles to solve simply for the sake of solving more. The exploration has the same sense of wonder that SOTN or Dark Souls has, but without any real enemies to speak of. And without the stress of Dark Souls constant deaths. And when you finally do find all the pieces, the story is quite compelling, well thought out, and plotted at a masterful pace (despite the occasional typo or misspelling). The pixel art is sometimes amazing, and sometimes just ok, but they do some kind of 2D normal mapping or something to have this neat dynamic lighting. It looks great sometimes, but sometimes it looks like prerendered graphics from late 16bit early 32bit era stuff. The music is also amazing. Good tunes that are appropriate to the scene when they need to be, and entertaining when you are working out puzzles.Things I didn't like...Not much. The occasional puzzle stumped me, but that's cause I'm too dumb. I ended up having to look up 2 of the puzzles on Youtube, which I'm fine with. Most of the time when I got stuck I would put the game down and come back later and something would pop out at me. The time rewind mechanic was helpful, but it often didn't go where you wnated it to go, and that was annoying. The race can suck it, the control just isn't built for it, and I frankly didn't find it fun. But those are totally forgiveable complaints in the grand scheme of how amazing this is. Probably in my top 20 gmes of all-time.BUY IT!Devs: I liked Full Bore on FB, but you guys don't have a developer page. I'd love to be able to follow you so at least I can keep abreast of any new projects.			"

			Cosmic takes a look at indie 2D puzzle platformer Full Bore developed by Whole hog games. Like this review? make sure to subscribe!		

Full Bore is a indie 2D puzzle platformer developed by three man studio Whole Hog Games. The game was Kickstarted just over a year ago to the tune of $16,383.Full Bore has lovely 2d 16 bit pixelated graphics that not only add a retro feel, but add a degree of both humour and charm to the title. Environments look great with some really well designed levels, nice use of lighting. Levels are colourful and vibrant and the whole game is easy to look at. The soundtrack of the game is also wonderful created by Miguel Acuña and the Adjective Plural Noun. It boasts a great variety of tracks that range from happy go lucky to dark and atmospheric.The games controls are simple and easy to use, movement is controlled with WASD. The space bar is used to make the boar stomp, which is used for crumbling loose blocks of ground and for moving certain blocks. Sadly there’s no jump feature which on one hand is necessary for the way the game is designed but I personally would have liked one. One thing I like is that you get all the abilities you need in the game at the start, as levels increase in difficulty its all about using your brain rather than just using in game abilities. Full Bore has three main elements to it's gameplay, puzzles, platforming and exploration. Full Bore isn't just a level by level platformer, you have a world to explore. By entering different doors and entrances you can go to different locations. To manage where you are and find your way around you have the handy tool of having a world map so you can track you way back should you need to. As you explore you'll come across computer control panels, books and characters, all of which you can interact with which will progress the games story, offer information and some funny jokes.Full Bore is a highly polished indie title that is packed full of character, humour and a bloody good challenge. It brings back memories of playing Fez for the first time and I would certainly argue that its up there with Fez in terms of indie titles in the puzzle platforming genre. All in all if your a fan of puzzle platformers or just charming indie titles in general I would certainly recommend picking Full Bore up, there’s plenty here to get your monies worth and you'll get a laugh or two out of it.

												At first glance, Full Bore might look like a mix of Toki Tori and SteamWorld Dig. It is indeed a block puzzler with digging, but what really sets it apart from similar games is the exploration aspect, the non-linearity and the lore.The gameplay consists of solving puzzles to progress through a vast underground world. Since you can only move by running, falling or leaping diagonally, many puzzles revolve around clearing a path or building steps to reach exits. Because of the large variation in materials you can dig through, or make crumble or fall by stomping, and the many different kinds of crates, no two puzzles in the game feel the same. At least one puzzle even have an additional solution to uncover a secret passage. And as far as puzzle games go, I've played none other with such a huge amount of secrets and collectibles.Full Bore has a metroidvania-esque map, where collectible gems and lore, along with passages and mysteries are marked. The map is similar to that of FEZ, with lines connecting all the discovered passages and completed rooms being marked in yellow. New rooms are added to the map as you discover them and are displayed as a small preview, annotated with anything left to discover. This is handy both for figuring out which way you should take to progress the story and is great for completionists.The game is full of references to games that likely inspired the creators. I caught references to Metroid, Offspring Fling!, Escape Goat and FEZ, but I'm sure I also missed many. The Escape Goat and FEZ references are both elegantly incorporated into the game as puzzles that works well alongside its other puzzles, while still being true to their inspirations. The FEZ puzzle especially being a nice throwback to the more meta puzzles of the indie classic.This unique game already has a place among my absolute favourites. It says something about this game that I've played it almost compulsively for a total of more than 30 hours the past week without experiencing any of the fatigue that I normally associate with puzzle games.

												Cute, isn't it? Full bore has a charming and rather untalkative main character. You can either play as Frederick or Hildi through the story. It starts with your ""crash"" into the vault of Gullinbursti who then accuses you of theft and forces you to recollect his valued gems. Although this goal will be set aside after clearing the first of the five areas (Workings, Deep Dive, Bhudevi, Scrapyard and the sleepless sea all with different style and desgin) of the game and the real story will unfold from there.And here I will state the most important aspect of the game (as I see it). The game heavily relies on your urge to explore, to search, to figure out:- for the story: It tells you sometimes where you can find some story characters but gives you no explicit directions. You have to run around searching for them. To understand the story itself you need discover and read the various terminals spread through the different areas- for the gameplay: It tells you how to stomp, how to climb and that you can dig. But how the different blocks behave you have to figure out yourself.For you not to run around in circles too much and to reduce unnecessary backtracking a bit there are two ""systems"" implemented. The first one is that every puzzle is solvable the moment you discover it. If you can't solve it than only because you are unable to figure out the solution not because you are missing equipment. The second it that on the map at the bottom of every room there is listed if you can still discover something in said room.The difficulty in the puzzles differs from very very easy to hard where the harder puzzles are mostly related to the ""second ending"" of the game or obtaining gems. Also the puzzle change from area to area. So the scrapyard plays differently then Bhudevi for example. All of this is rounded up with a nice soundtrack. So if you have an explorative nature (up to 20+ hours of gameplay), you like the graphic style and you like puzzle platformers (and adore boars) I can only recommand  Full bore to you.PS: If you have any questions regarding the game, ask in the comments and I'll try to answer them.

												The action of Full Bore takes place in a post-apocalyptic world(?), where a new sentient race of boarkind (and a few more animals) is ruling. It's a puzzle platformer in which the player controls Hildi, a boar that is accused of stealing gems from a vault of a digging company owner. As a punishment, it's sent into the mines to retrieve all the stolen treasures.  Gameplay & Level Design The game is a puzzle platformer, which means the (almost) only gameplay is solving environmental puzzles with your own hands (hooves?). The player has the access to a map that allows to check, if there is still something left to explore in each location, which saves the time greatly and indicates the general direction of where should one proceed. To solve the puzzles, one usually needs to dig through or move some blocks. If mistakes were made, it's always possible to ""rewind time"" to specific moments, so that it's possible to take off where the last right step was made. On your way down (or up), more and more secrets are discovered that put the story into context. The game is an open-world one - there's no requirement to explore many of the maps, but they often hold some additional information about the past of the world or extra gems. Moving throughout the locations and maps takes some time, but a mechanism of fast travel makes it pretty convenient.The puzzle solving is actually really absorbing and fun. First puzzles are rather straightforward, but the game gets progressively harder with new locations. There seems to be a big spike in difficulty at one point towards the end, where puzzles get really challenging and it wasn't unusual for me to spend up to half an hour solving one problem. The controls are smooth and reactive, which is really important for a platformer. The only issue I had was with jumping down from blocks, where the boar is somewhat hesitant to do so, which costs some extra time, so much needed in many scenarios. Another thing that I found a bit disappointing is that, there seems to be no use for gems and most of the items. I mean, I wouldn't really like to see collecting those a requirement to finish the game, but an additional incentive would be ever so nice. Because of that, the last few maps, I just went straight to where I needed to go, without caring much about clearing the locations thoroughly.GraphicsI found the pixel graphics in the game very appealing. Surface is nice, cheerful and green, while digging deeper and exploring lower maps brings some darker and more volcanic colours into play. The main characters are made carefully and look really pretty (like the shaman), their animations and also animations in general are also nice and smooth. Overall, I found the graphical design really charming and detailed enough to be able to keep my attention, but not too crowded to obscure the view of the objectives. Story As I've already mentioned, at some point I've noticed that going for gems and collectibles is not too rewarding, however, I kept on exploring. The reason for that is the story or more like - the history. The story itself is pretty straightforward and could be probably written down on one page of paper. Still, throughout the game, it's possible to find notes and terminal data that introduces the player to what actually happened before the current game world existed. Maybe, it's just me being a fun of post-apocalyptic settings, but after completing the game, I've spent some time reading the other players' theories on the in-game history, just out of curiosity.Music and SoundThe background music is quite catchy and I never felt the urge to mute it, as I sometimes do in many games. It changes from location to location, each one has its own tune. Changing maps also changes the music sometimes to a different variation on a theme. It definitely wasn't a kind of a music I'd listen on a daily basis or while commuting to work, but it was really fitting to the game and just sounded nice and right.ContentIt took me almost 10h to beat the game, but if one wants to be really thorough and get all of the collectibles, I think there would be somewhat 20-30 hours of playing there. Shame that except for achievements there's little incentive to go for it all. Still, I believe this is a really decent amount of content and fun for a cheap little game. It kept me interested and it was always fun to try and solve the puzzles to get some more diamonds or reach more lore secrets and that's what's important to me.OverallFull Bore is a really solid indie game, all pieces just fall right into place. The puzzles are just challenging enough to keep one entertained and thinking, but not too hard, discovering the lore is actually quite interesting, the graphics are all nice and charming and the music just completes the image of a well-made game. I probably wouldn't pay the full price for it, but it's a great catch if it's bundled or on a discount. So, if it's discounted somewhere and you want to put your brain to some work, grab it - you won't regret it (probably).			"

												Every year around Christmastime I try and atone for my sins by helping out the less fortunate. 2016 kind of was s*** and I can't be bothered to actually stare my fellow man in the eye. Instead of, therefore, saving some orphans just so that they'll get burnt in the apocalyptic wildfire 2017 is sure to bring, I'm reviewing a game I really like, yet somehow never got off the ground. This is charity work, and I can declare it on my taxes.I think I got Full Bore in a bundle last year, and I played it more or less just to humor it. To my surprise, 25 hours later (I think around that timespan, this is a LONG game), I had 100%ed it. This happened for a few reasons.1) I have some form of mental illness that results in utter hatred of leaving a puzzle unsolved.This happens every time I get my hands on a well-designed puzzle game. I play it an unhealthy amount of time, to the point where I put off my real-life responsibilities as much as possible. It's probably indicative of some greater underlying mental health issue, likely having to do with that summer at camp I can't remember.2) The actual game I bought the bundle for SUCKED.I can't for the life of me recall what that game was, but I remember being upset enough to slip into a rage-induced coma, probably one that explains why I didn't review Full Bore when I actually played it.3) Full Bore is packed with Boar and Bore puns.In preparation for someday being a father, despite reason #1's clear indication that perhaps I shouldn't, I am attempting to construct an encyclopaedia of ghastly jokes to embarrass my offspring with, and this game helped.So, onto the game proper, and why I think I like it more than almost any other 2D puzzle game I can recall:Simply put, it has the same sort of elegant design eventually found in The Witness. Every puzzle is solvable from the moment you start the game. However, they are all reliant on a complex ruleset that will not, initially, make much sense. You must learn and explore to determine how to progress, and the knowledge gained applies to earlier puzzles that may have seemed impossible at the time. The game will never tell you how to solve a puzzle - it's entirely on you - and each solution requires its own little ah-ha moment.This results in a constant cycle of feeling stupid, and smart, in a way that I find more addictive than crack.This game is impeccably designed in that regard. It's not exactly a looker per se, but the design is so fundamentally good, I can't help but recommend.Right, now onto trying to find something else to scratch my moronic puzzle itch before I have to deal with celebrating the birth of some guy with a cute beard.

												Highly recommend this game. I enjoyed the puzzles, and the unfolding story. Reminds me of Toki Tori 2+ (though more similar graphics to the original toki tori), another game I have sunk many hours into.Initial gameplay can be a bit confusing - while the controls are easy and the puzzles are easy enough initially, growing in difficulty as you progress - the open worldness of the map tends to make you feel rather lost. If you can ignore the fact your digging randomly deeper into the unknown without a clue as to where you are heading, you eventually gain your bearings and the navigation isn't too bad after that. There is a teleport feature to help you get back to previous explored regions as well, which comes in handy when you are going back to solve those puzzles you couldn't figure out first time.The simple story of gathering gems and rescuing the miners can be done very fast avoiding most maps areas and puzzles but you can go back to regions and complete afterwards, with new conversations and a more complete ending (roll the credits a second time when you are done).Only complaint are the two 'boss' type levels. There is one race which takes quite a bit of skill to win (though you don't need to win for storyline), and the 'dark sun' level which is frustratingly difficult and requires a bit of rewinding to get it done. Also didn't feel the game was complete until I had managed this though, as it gave the full ending. Felt out of place with the rest of the puzzles you could stop and think about, rather than dashing around unable to stay still for more than 2 seconds!So anyone buying needs to be aware there is a high-speed element to the game, but mostly just logical puzzle solving that's heaps of fun! Almost didn't finish the boss levels, but with some determination I managed and was def worth it :)			"

												Never thought I would have so much fun playing as a pig in the dirt. Full Bore is an open world, puzzle adventure. I get a Fez, Steamworld Dig, and Legend of Zelda vibe from it. Notable about this game is how well it handles the puzzle/story balance. Want to ignore the story so that you can solve puzzles, no problem. There is a big open world with many levels of puzzles. Want to just play for the story, no problem. There is a way to skip most puzzles allowing you to progress through this game's interesting and well told story.TLDR: Full Bore is superb. Play it.			"

												I don't particularly enjoy giving this game a bad review, because it's evident so much effort went into it. But...""Full Bore"" is an open-world 2D puzzle-platformer where you assume the role of a boar that has to, well, bore around. There's no intro, you're just thrown into an adventure where you gradually discover the story as you explore. The game doesn't hold your hand. Beside the most basic of commands, you're given no explanations or hints, but are instead left to figure it all out for yourself. The visuals and audio are likewise very nice.However... the game was simply... boring. The core gameplay consists of digging through the Earth, solving a series of block puzzles in order to progress and collect gems. Each puzzle is solvable as soon as you chance upon it, and there are no hidden abilities, or power-ups, or unlockables of any kind. Your only ability is a time-rewind function, which is really just an implementation of an undo button. You can't run out of the rewind power, like with the sands of time in ""Prince of Persia"", for example. Not even enemies exist here, not in the usual form, at least. In ""Full Bore"" you just kind of go, and dig.So, why explore the world and solve puzzles as all? To collect gems and unravel the story. The story, while certainly promising, isn't THAT good. The gems themselves don't seem to give you anything tangible other than the satisfaction of having collected them. The visuals get a bit confusing here. Because of the 2D sometimes it's hard to distinguish what's the foreground and what's the background. With some timed puzzles and/or mini-games, it'll be a source of frustration.In the end, whether you like or dislike ""Full Bore"" all boils down to the the question of how much do you like puzzles for the sake of puzzles?Personally, I'm not much of a fan. If you're different in that regard, then ""Full Bore"" should be a no-brainer.			"

												Full Bore is awesome. Here's a few reasons why:It's challenging. In all the best ways.Seriously, there are some absolutely devilish brain teasers to be found in here. But they are incredibly fun to figure out, in large part probably due to the great rewind function that lets you undo and redo moves, helping you get to the solution. Plus, the puzzles in this game offer a big range of difficulty levels. There is no fixed progression here, and you can solve puzzles in whatever order you desire. Each area in the game comes with it's own set of blocks, and therefore it's own set of rules you'll need to figure out in order to succeed. There is a LOT of variety in the gameplay, and it's as impressive as it's fun.It's big. Wonderfully so.I'll be honest, the game didn't immediately click for me, and I think this is one of the reasons. The size of the game and the fact you are free to explore in whatever order you want (you ARE given loose objectives, but it's somewhat easy to lose track of them imo) can be daunting. There are warp hubs, but you can't get to specific rooms (they usually are fast and easy to get to from the warp area, though). But once you figure out how to work with the in-game map, the game's size becomes something wonderful. The atmospheric graphics and huge variety in puzzles make sure you're exploring for the sake of exploration, not just to complete every room (which is a satisfying feeling too, though).My one complaint would be that in some areas of the game, once you're trying to go for a 100% completion, you may have to solve certain puzzles again to get to where you want to go. This is a bit annoying, but rare enough to not be an issue. Still, it should be mentioned.It's adorable, and atmospheric.The character sprites? So freaking cute. The lighting effects and environments? So effective at truly making this world a joy to explore. It can be pretty creepy at times, and that's a great achievement. The artist did a truly wonderful job, and the music and sound design compliments the visuals nicely, too. (For what it's worth, at times the music feels a bit repetetive, but never to the point where it made me want to turn it off)Lastly, the story - it's mostly told through you finding logs and books and stuff, so it's not a very direct way of storytelling (which honestly, I think is a good thing here, the puzzles can take some time to solve, and this passive storytelling fits the gameplay's pace). It took a while for me to feel involved and really get a sense of curiosity for the world and it's characters, but once I did, I thought it was a really interesting and engaging tale.To sum it up, grab this if you like your puzzle platformers to be more puzzle than platformer. At it's core there is extremely fun and solid gameplay, and rounding everything out are gorgeous production values. Full Bore is a true gem deserving of way more attention.			"

												This game is absolutely incredible. There's a lot of depth hidden under the surface and it's a really big surprise on just how solid the game is. It's one of those games with simple mechanics and endless permutations on creating puzzles with them, throwing in new elements once in a while.Basically, the gist is, it's an open world puzzle platformer which is heavily reminiscent of La-Mulana and Fez, with gameplay similar to.. Blocks That Matter, in a way? If you liked any of those titles, I say there's a pretty good chance you'll like this one too. And not to turn this into a review for other games, but if you haven't played any of those titles, please do!Anyway, if a game is this reminiscent of the best parts of some of my favorite titles I've ever played, I can't help but give this a favorable review.

												This is a great, great little puzzle-platformer! It's just a joy to play.Things I particularly like about this game: Simple, smooth controls. There's not a whole lot you can do, but you can do all of it from the very beginning, and your boar handles very well, even in tight-timing precision situations (of which there are thankfully not too many). The puzzles are all totally discrete. There are never any puzzles that do not fit on a single screen, even within larger rooms, which allows both for easy visual review and contemplation and nice ""chunking"" of gameplay -- you get potential break or stopping points every 5-10 minutes, as opposed to a gotta-find-the-next-checkpoint urgency. The puzzles are good. I'm about halfway through (I think?), and I've been very impressed both with the difficulty level of each puzzle -- the vast majority make me feel stupid when I start and brilliant when I finish, thanks to being built around ""a ha!"" moments -- and with the difficulty curve, which raises smoothly and naturally, through harder puzzles rather than introducing new gimmicks. The art direction is really, really solid. The actual art assets aren't anything to write home about -- the visuals are simple, and the soundtrack is a bit repetitive if nicely funky -- but both are used to great effect, and work together to build a real sense of unease and mystery. The story is revealed nicely. It was obvious very early on that this is somehow a post-human society, and the humans vanished after doing something stupid with science, but the characterization of the scientists through their emails and computer logs is surprisingly full of personality, and also the story slowly but confidently gets weirder and creepier in unexpected ways... This is a great game to play for an hour or so at a time. Usually after that much time, my brain needs a break, but then tomorrow I'm eager to jump back in and explore more and solve more puzzles. I don't have time for big, story-heavy games right now, but this has been fantastic to get a little gaming and mental workout into my evenings. You're a boar. That's great. You meet a giant golden boar named Gullinbursti. That's fantastic. My one main quibble is that there clearly is (at least) one ability you have that is not explained, where you break bricks faster if you do a bunch in a row, eventually getting a cool blue aura around you -- I am completely mystified what the rules about that aura are, and there's a race against another boar early on that you clearly cannot win without mastering them/it. Generally, though, this is by far my favorite indie game that I've played this year, and it's a shame it's burrowed so far under the radar. Give it a shot!			"

												Full Bore is the kind of game where everything feels like it was really well thought out. The central concept of the game is solving puzzles while you explore the game's world. Along the way you collect gems and read about the lore of the events that happened leading up to the present time within the game. Because of some excellent puzzle design and well paced introduction of new puzzle mechanics the game never felt boring to me. Full Bore also features a time travel mechanic that lets you undo the last number of things you've done as well as soft resetting the current puzzle you are working on. This alone helped make what would have been frustrating and tedious puzzle solving into fun and difficult puzzle solving. Only major gripes with the game are that you have to re-solve a number of puzzles when you go through a previously explored area for some, but not all areas. This is exacerbated by the lack of a clear map and very conservative fast travel locations, which make traveling to certain locations to clear out the map a bit of a pain. Overall I quite enjoyed Full Bore.			"

												This game is pretty great. It's full of puzzles! Some of them are easy, some are very challenging. The control seemed weird to me but once I got used to it I couldn't stop playing. There's still a lot of the game left for me to complete but overall it's really good. I like the graphics, animation and MUSIC. It's very fitting! If you liked FEZ, you should like this game too. The only thing I don't like are levels where you have to race someone or something - the character movement is tile based and it feels like the moving animation is slightly longer than the actual movement. I keep moving further than I want and it takes time to go back. I usually have to switch to keyboard for these parts for a more precise control.However there is an amazing time warping system, very similar to the one in Braid. You can either stop time to think if you really need to save some of it, or reverse any action you've done back to the latest checkpoint or the beginning of current level.8/10 so far, I can't think of anything that would not deserve such rating in this game. It's very well done!			"

												I played the first part of the game outside Steam.The art design is overall good, picturing several distincted stages.Music is not bad. At least there is no music spoiling the atmosphere in game.The open world greatly resemble that in Fez with a detailed navigation system. No worry about missing any one of the numerous mysteries in game.The game machanism is innovative, combining platform and box puzzle, and it is really really well implemented. I would say that all the puzzles in game are well designed, whose quality doesn't drop over the large quantity.The open world map may first seem scattered, there is actually clear and careful arrangement in it. Teleports are few but can be easily accessed, which can be a great assistance in the huge open world. Finding hidden paths is of great challenge and fun.Storyline is plotted by message pieces scattered around the world. As you exploring the world you gradually unveil the history of the world, intriguing and humorous enough. And there is also a history viewing system, helping you arrange the whole story. So considerate.May not as good as Braid or Fez, but it is definitely a must play game for the lovers in puzzle platform games. Definitely worth it.			"

												I didn't even know what this game was when I got it on a humble bundle, but I can certainly say I've been pleasantly suprised.The game is a puzzler mix of Tetrobot and co. and Fez. You have to go through various linked caves and rooms made up of blocks to obtain plot related items (in this game, one of them is gems). The game, similar to the aforementioned games, does not have you obtaining upgrades (at least to where I am 50% in), and while you may at certain points need a key, the majority of the game is about learning about how to use what you are given from the start, and how to interact with the world to solve puzzles. An important note, is that you can't actually jump; only hop up diagonally. This makes getting around an important part of the puzzling, as you not only need to think about how to get a block someplace else, but also whether or not you'll still be able to get where you need to be. Of course, the meat of the game is the puzzling and the exploration, and both are done well. The puzzles have an appropriate difficulty curve, and there is a vast amount of gems and other items hidden throughout in secret rooms, which also have their own puzzles often times.Another positive note (in my opinion), there is no consequence to making a mistake, as not only does a room reset when you exit it, but you can rewind  to previous states to fix mistakes. You can go as many moves back as you need, whenever you need it, with no consequence, giving you full reign to try out whatever you can to solve a puzzle without frustration. Even better; when you solve a puzzle to access an area, the map changes the next time you enter it so that there is an easier way through to where you had to solve to (sometimes simply just leaving the puzzle as solved, and changing everything else back). As for the exploration, similarly to fez, the game will tell you when you have missed something in an area, but it is up to you to locate it.I haven't completed the game yet, but I'm only 50% of the way through (on total completion), and yet I've racked up about 9 hours (removing 1 for away time, that is still 8 hours). I'll likely edit this review later on once I've completed it, incase I've missed anything. I fully reccomend this game.			"

												Full Bore feels like a metroidvania game but it is more of a platform-puzzle game. You will not get any power-up (none that matters, anyhoof) and you will have to rely on simple mechanics to dig through the game. The gameplay is solid, the puzzles vary in difficulty and originality ; you will not get boared.The lenght of the game is simply astounding with ""only"" four worlds, you will have to rack your brain for hours just to realize you've done only half the game has to offer. The fact that the overall design and animations are top notch will make you go back for more.However, some puzzles rely more on experimentation than logic (which can get frustrating at times) and most of the ""hidden"" stuff is too cryptic with mechanics that are never explained, requiring external help or real patience in trying many different things until one works. Furthermore, the music is a tad bit on the repetitive side and sometimes doesn't work well when you need to think straight. Finally, the final boss fight (which can be accessed under certain conditions) may be a little unfair with a limited rewind function, making a single mistake costly.These are tiny flaws, easy to get by, and you should not let that prevent you from buying this great game.

												*Wish I could jump*But you can't ! It's a platformer where you can't jump ! And it's a good one, really.Instead of jumping, you have to climb over blocks and use your brains (a lot) to solve puzzles in order to continue.This game is also a lot of exploration, which feels like FEZ (it even has a reference to it), a few secrets to be found, and hidden locations to discover (but, like FEZ, you know if a room has been completed by looking at the map, which helps).+ Free exploration world+ A great variety of crates to climb over+ Many puzzles, with scaling difficulty (some at the end are really hard)+ Map helps a lot and is very precise in its details+ Possibility to go back in time if you made a mistake+ Boar character (and boar puns)- Rewinding time will sometimes work well, erasing your last move, and sometimes make you go back to the beginning of the level because no ""checkpoints"" have been set since (I don't know how checkpoints are set, though)All in all, it's a great game, worth its price			"

OverviewFull Bore is a story-driven puzzle-adventure game in which the player plays a boar.  The goal of the game is to complete the story and be the hero of boarkind, but exploration and treasure-hunting are other goals.  In order to progress through the game, the player must solve puzzles.  As one progresses farther into the game, the more complex and difficult the puzzles become.  The mysteries unfold as the player reads lore from many years ago, enters another dimension, and explores 5 different regions of the world.The game is usually paced at whatever speed the player wants, allowing for think time to figure out the puzzle.  A few levels are high-speed action levels, in which making a mistake can be deadly.  Thankfully, a handy rewind feature can help solve the trickier puzzles, and the world map keeps track of which areas have been completed and which areas have not.The world also contains a handful of non-player-characters that the player can chat with, gaining more information about the world of Full Bore.The levels themselves tell stories--blast marks, skeletons and broken trusses tell the stories of what people did long ago.  The background music is very catchy and I love hearing it over and over.  The game designers did a good job of giving levels atmosphere, some levels I feel at home in, others creep me out. The game map can be explored freely and at the player's pace, and a warp system allows the player to teleport from one region to another very quickly.  In most cases, if you get stuck on one puzzle, there are plenty more to figure out.Even after game completion, there is still stuff your boar can do--find hidden rooms, talk to NPCs, or try to solve the puzzles again!Good Game!I liked this game--a thinking game with a great story beneath it.   This game is good for people that like logic puzzles and working out their brain.  If you love good stories, this might also be the game for you.  Depending on how easily you solve puzzles, this game may take anywhere between a few hours to a few days or more to solve.I would recommend this game for anyone who wants to stretch their mind, learn a good story, wander aimlessly underground, race through a mineshaft, or just have fun in general.

												Pros:+Open-World Exploration with many secrets to find+Perfect Difficulty+Great Music+Detailed story with multiple endings+Perfect difficulty on virtually all the puzzlesCons:- I encountered one bug that would have prevented me from getting two achievements, but it randomly awarded credit for solving the puzzle (QR Code) after I reentered the room after beating the game.- In the beginning there's a character who tells you to go somewhere, and doesn't give directions how to get there.  I don't want a highlighted minimap or something, but it makes sense for him to say go through the top corner, etc.- There is one puzzle that involves a QR code.  It's a reference to Fez.I had a great time with Full Bore.  I bought it expecting just another puzzle platformer, but it's much more than that.  It's a free-roaming open world exploration game, like Metroid without the enemies.  This means it's probably closer to Fez than any other game, but I enjoyed it more because it generally avoids  esoteric puzzles that require out of game knowledge.  The main mechanic of the game is digging in unstable soil, which will be familiar to anyone who played Steamworld Dig.  It works just as well here, but unlike Steamworld Dig you're expected to backtrack if you want to explore and the whole map isn't digging.The music is great, the story is surprisingly complex, it has multiple endings but you can play after the two to three of them, and NPCs acknowledge your success.  All in all, I highly recommend for fans of 2D puzzle games.			"

OverviewFull Bore is a story-driven puzzle-adventure game in which the player plays a boar.  The goal of the game is to complete the story and be the hero of boarkind, but exploration and treasure-hunting are other goals.  In order to progress through the game, the player must solve puzzles.  As one progresses farther into the game, the more complex and difficult the puzzles become.  The mysteries unfold as the player reads lore from many years ago, enters another dimension, and explores 5 different regions of the world.The game is usually paced at whatever speed the player wants, allowing for think time to figure out the puzzle.  A few levels are high-speed action levels, in which making a mistake can be deadly.  Thankfully, a handy rewind feature can help solve the trickier puzzles, and the world map keeps track of which areas have been completed and which areas have not.The world also contains a handful of non-player-characters that the player can chat with, gaining more information about the world of Full Bore.The levels themselves tell stories--blast marks, skeletons and broken trusses tell the stories of what people did long ago.  The background music is very catchy and I love hearing it over and over.  The game designers did a good job of giving levels atmosphere, some levels I feel at home in, others creep me out. The game map can be explored freely and at the player's pace, and a warp system allows the player to teleport from one region to another very quickly.  In most cases, if you get stuck on one puzzle, there are plenty more to figure out.Even after game completion, there is still stuff your boar can do--find hidden rooms, talk to NPCs, or try to solve the puzzles again!Good Game!I liked this game--a thinking game with a great story beneath it.   This game is good for people that like logic puzzles and working out their brain.  If you love good stories, this might also be the game for you.  Depending on how easily you solve puzzles, this game may take anywhere between a few hours to a few days or more to solve.I would recommend this game for anyone who wants to stretch their mind, learn a good story, wander aimlessly underground, race through a mineshaft, or just have fun in general.

												Pros:+Open-World Exploration with many secrets to find+Perfect Difficulty+Great Music+Detailed story with multiple endings+Perfect difficulty on virtually all the puzzlesCons:- I encountered one bug that would have prevented me from getting two achievements, but it randomly awarded credit for solving the puzzle (QR Code) after I reentered the room after beating the game.- In the beginning there's a character who tells you to go somewhere, and doesn't give directions how to get there.  I don't want a highlighted minimap or something, but it makes sense for him to say go through the top corner, etc.- There is one puzzle that involves a QR code.  It's a reference to Fez.I had a great time with Full Bore.  I bought it expecting just another puzzle platformer, but it's much more than that.  It's a free-roaming open world exploration game, like Metroid without the enemies.  This means it's probably closer to Fez than any other game, but I enjoyed it more because it generally avoids  esoteric puzzles that require out of game knowledge.  The main mechanic of the game is digging in unstable soil, which will be familiar to anyone who played Steamworld Dig.  It works just as well here, but unlike Steamworld Dig you're expected to backtrack if you want to explore and the whole map isn't digging.The music is great, the story is surprisingly complex, it has multiple endings but you can play after the two to three of them, and NPCs acknowledge your success.  All in all, I highly recommend for fans of 2D puzzle games.			"

												I kickstarted this game waaaay back - and I'm still glad I did it. This is one of my ""zen games"" which I play to chill. Since you can't die it gives you time (in most cases) to think about your next steps. I won't spoil anything, but there's a good story hidden in there. Try to find everything and go everywhere :)			"

												Whatever fun there is to be had is constantly undermined (pun not intended but appropriate) but the incredibly frustrating, finnicky controls. The ""rewind"" function present in the game is probably intended to be used when you make mistakes while you're trying to correctly dig your way round, but you'll find yourself using it just as often to take back unintended actions caused by the disconnect between your button presses and what your avatar actually does. Perhaps a more patient player can stick with it but I'd prefer to spend my time mastering systems, not wrestling with input.			"

												I feel super bad that I got this game in a $1 bundle 'cause, damn, do the devs deserve way more than that for this game.Full Bore is, at heart, a puzzle/exploration game. Not a platformer, you see, as there is no platforming, and you cannot even jump. But a puzzle game with the occassional action-demanding section. And it's really, really good. Like, wow. The puzzle variety throughout the game is astounding, every puzzle felt unique and interesting. And the difficulty curve was smooth, too; as I got better at understanding the game's logic, the puzzles got more demanding themselves, so the entire way through, the game was certainly a challenge, but never an unfair one, and never too easy. The game world's design, as well, is really great; there are 5 main areas to the game, each pretty self-contained, but each is pretty expansive as well. The game is made up of puzzle rooms connected by doors, some rooms large with multiple puzzles, some rooms small with only a single puzzles, and plenty of rooms outright hidden by puzzles in other rooms. You can go through the entire game seeing less than 10% of what there is to see (if, well, you know exactly where to go, but yes) yet the game never feels too long because the puzzles remain enjoyable the whole way through.The presentation is also great, the game is pixelated, yes, but it has a distinctly modern look to it, one that makes every main area look different, one that almost never has any visual confusion, and one that's just a joy to look at. The soundtrack is also very interesting too, I don't know exactly how to describe it but it fits almost too well. The story is pretty interesting though mostly conveyed through logs (that you don't *have* to read, either, and many of them are hidden... but let's be honest, why are you playing this game if you aren't going to attempt to find everything there is to see?)I guess. There are a few puzzles that can be a bit tedious to solve, but they aren't common. The game's never too demanding action-wise, either, and the puzzles are tight and focused, maybe with the occasional red herring thrown in for good measure.I don't really have much to say against this game... I enjoyed it from beginning to end, it's just a really enjoyable experience and you should buy it.			"

												So what is Full Bore? It's a puzzle game, which was described by some as a ""metroidvania with boars"", but that is entirely incorrect. It has an open world with rooms full of puzzles, but there are no ability unlocks at all. Your abilities are moving, digging and stomping, and that's it, from start to end. You roam around, collect gems, search for secret rooms and advance the main quest at your leisure. All of it involves puzzles of the digging and timing kind, though the timing aspect is not critical. It's much more about understanding how the elements interact and planning ahead than the execution itself.So yeah, it's a semi-hardcore puzzle game about the cutest boar ever going on an adventure and you all should totally check it out. Really a hidden gem, I give it four out of four boars.			"

												Really wanted to like this.. but there are some fundamental design flaws that really prevent me from playing it anymore. It's virtually impossible to determine areas where you're able to drop down to lower areas, so you'll spend a lot of time frustrated in an area where there's no apparent way to proceed, only to accidentally press down and drop through the floor.Other irritations- the game doesn't really tell you what type of materials you can dig into.. dirt, okay. stone- apparently?? I spent way too much time stuck in one area only to find that I could dig through solid rock. Apparently not metal though, or thin beams. I just doesn't make any sense and the game doesn't help you understand whats going on (either through color coding, highlighting, or even a frickin tutorial).The last major flaw is the ham fisted time-rewind mechanic that seems to exist solely to correct other design flaws (the fact that you can get stuck in the first place). It's not like Braid where it's crucial to solving puzzles, it's just there as an ""undo button"" which is pretty lame.As a side note and unrelated to my overall experience of the game (because I turned it off), the music was god awful. sounded like a couple of kids 'jamming' in the garage. Just.. awful.Anyway, if it's on sale and you're curious go for it.. otherwise save your money.			"

												Is Full Bore a terrible game? Not by any means, no. There’s some moments of enjoyment in the game, but I could only find myself enjoying it in very small bursts. I can see what the developers over at Whole Hog Games tried to do with the title but frankly there’s similar games out there that offer more bang for your buck. That being said, if you’re one of those people who love collecting items and exploring dungeons and that’s a major appeal for you then you’ll no doubt have a blast with Full Bore, but for someone like me the game just sadly couldn’t capture my attention.

												Full Bore is a platformer/ digger with some small puzzle attached, style of game, with very limited low key story attached. The elements of platforming in this game are limited, and do not allow you to jump or try to get where you want as you want. They manged to make a game that is about jumping and digging feel liner in jumping and digging. Your choices in what you can do are already made for you when you enter a area. If you mess up in any way or die its easy to undo it with no consequence, your actions don't matter in any way. With how much depth this game is lacking I found it a bore to play, and while you may not, recommending this game that is going for $15 at time of this review is impossible. If you really want it then at least wait for it to go on sale under $10. Thanks for your time check out other reviews here.  https://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho

												I expected Full Bore to be a fun little puzzler, but I became engrossed in its mysterious world and by its devious puzzles.You begin as boar walking through a tranquil field, only to be caught in a sudden explosion and thrown into the mines of the Full Bore Mining Co. You make your way up to an empty fault, which you're accused of raiding and then charged with finding gems to compensate for those that you ""stole"" You'll explore the mines, talk to other boars and find out more about this strange place.The world and puzzle design are excellent. There's a vast network of caves to explore and plenty of secrets to find. It will take you many hours to find everything there is to find. The mechanics are simple: you can dig blocks, push blocks, climb blocks, and stomp on blocks, that's it. There are no upgrades to be found, so every puzzle can be solved immediately, but you'll need to understand how everything works to succeed. The challenges start out simple, but you'll tackle progessively trickier puzzles as you go along. There's a great rewind feature allowing you to undo any of your mistakes, which cuts the repetition to a minimum. You can always return to a difficult room later when you figure out how to solve it. The map does a great job of logging all the places you've traveled and all the collectibles and lore you've found or missed, so it's never hard to find your way around. The story is mostly told through logs and books you find as you go, but there are also events and characters to talk to as well. The writing is charming and engaging. You'll discover that the history of the boars goes much further than you initially think. The aesthetics are great as well. The pixel art, lighting and sound create a superb dark and sometimes forboding atmosphere. The rock soundtrack is a nice backdrop for puzzle-solving, never obtrusive to get in the way. Overall, I was really pleasantly surprised with Full Bore. There's a lot to love here for puzzle game fans. If you're a fan of games like FEZ or Antichamber, I highly recommend checking this out.

												Block-pushing, dirt-digging, gem-collecting puzzles with no jump button.I didn't do a lot of research before trying this game, so I was basically expecting a different flavor of Steamworld Dig.Full Bore is, at its core, a series of increasingly complex block puzzles, but the puzzles are strung together to form a somewhat open world. It's kinda like Fez in that several of the puzzles are actually your travel route between areas, and other puzzles are optional for collection of treasure. On the plus side, it provides a nice cohesive framework instead of just giving you a typical puzzle game menu where you choose your next puzzle from a list. The downside is that backtracking can be a pain, although there is a warp system.The actual puzzles generally involve a combination of digging and pushing. You can't jump. Different types of tiles behave differently: Some are suspended in place unless you dig through, some are unbreakable, some are fragile and will break just from the shock of you using the Stomp command from a close distance. Also, there's no jumping.Did I mention you can't jump? For the uninitiated, this is extremely disorienting. You can hop up one tile height increment at a time (like stairs) by holding down a particular button (It's actually the same button that causes you to dig out the tile directly above you, which was very confusing to me when I came back to play months after doing just the tutorial). There are no player ""lives"", but there are checkpoints in pretty much all of the active puzzle areas, and there is a somewhat Braid-esque rewind function. If you get stuck, you can rewind incrementally or all the way back to the checkpoint (or the door you came through, if you haven't touched a checkpoint since then). The downside to combining the open-world format and the checkpoint system is that if you get stuck on a puzzle [after touching a checkpoint] and you just can't figure it out, you pretty much have to quit to the main menu and reload your file in order to access a different route. With very few exceptions, you can follow any path you want. There are no incremental powerups that you need to unlock in order to access The Next Area. If you can find a puzzle or a secret, you have the means to solve it. I got stuck a lot in the early stages because I didn't understand the different tiles & their properties, but getting stuck in later stages led to a lot of ""a-ha!"" moments.Some of the puzzles have time-sensitive elements, but the majority of them are pretty generous about giving you plenty of time to make your moves. The rewind function is a great asset, especially during the more complex multi-stage puzzles. Using time controls feels a little clumsy at times, I guess due to how it decides which points to remember. It's not that it smoothly rewinds playback (a la Braid), but it jumps back from point to point based on when it decides you made a significant-enough movement or action.I'm going to talk about the racing segment now.There is an extremely frustrating race against an NPC. You're required to do it, but you don't have to win to progress. You don't have to win it at all, as long as you don't care about getting 100%. In order to win, you essentially have to have flawless control of your boar through a really long obstacle course. Since the majority of the game is a series of low-stakes thoughtful non-time-sensitive puzzle solving, a high-speed high-precision segment is extremely frustrating, and the hit-or-miss nature of the rewind system means you might do more harm than good by trying to rewind partway.There's a lot of atmosphere in this game, and I'll admit I was a little put off by the aesthetic in some areas, which is not to say that it isn't well-crafted! It's grungy, punky, and bluesy all at the same time. The sights and sounds definitely contribute to the mood and feeling in a major way. It's easy for me to imagine how different the game would feel if the exact same maps had been skinned and scored differently. The lore is interesting and ominous, and builds up very slowly. The other characters that you meet aren't especially deep, but I can easily forgive that since so much of the game involves being isolated.I definitely recommend Full Bore to anybody who likes tough-but-possible puzzle games, or who wants to have more games starring boars.Dark Sun / 10			"

												I can't continue playing, the boar smashing its little face into the floor is just too funny. I mean every time it cracks me up with the animation and that little squishy thud of its face hitting the floor. Oh also the puzzles so far are fun.But its worth it just to put something on the down key, and watch it face-plant the floor for a few hours.			"

												Not finished, but really enjoying the exploraion element of this game - as well as the lack of a jump mechanic. Interesting concept that makes this a pseudo-puzzle-platformer, starring warthogs. So far, worth my time.			"

												Very good exploration-puzzle-platformer where you mainly progress by gaining knowledge on how everything works. The puzzles vary in ideas and difficulty and while most of them are not obligatory to finish the main storyline, solving them all and getting 100% is challenging and very rewarding experience.I recommend this game especially to puzzle-loving completionists, as getting all achievements is demanding, but not to the point of frustration and can actually be done in finite time.

												Full Bore quickly became one of my favorite and most memorable games of all time. It's packed with charm, mystery, beauty, and of course many challenges. If you enjoy solving puzzles, exploring, and feeling a little nostalgic, it is a must-play. Many hours of gameplay, and time well-spent.			"

The puzzles are surprisingly challenging, the exploration has just the right amount of depth, and the soundtrack is awesome. Not to mention my little boar (Frederick!) is absolutely adorable.Definitely a great time killer, and I would gladly reccomend it to anyone who enjoys puzzles.			"

												I got Bore as part of a Humble Bundle. I don't stay interested in platformers for more than 20-30 minutes and this held my interest for twice that! You play as a boar roaming the wilds that gets thrown into a tech mishap. Some of the graphics and scenarios reminded me of The Lost Viking, minus multpile characters to play. The puzzles are sharp and the rewind feature helps in the solving of puzzles. The game is open world so roam to your delight.			"

												This looks like some sort of simple mining game at first glance, but the limits imposed by the character's body - he or she is just a boar, after all - make for a variety of challenging and not-so challenging puzzles out of the simple task of getting around.  Don't get this game if you're easily frustrated or boared... sorry, bored - otherwise, I think it's a fun way to pass some time.  As an added bonus, your boar will hit its head against the wall if it can't dig that kind of material, thus saving you the effort when you're stuck!			"

Arguably justifiable for computer logs, not so much for speech bubbles. Could have benefitted from one more proofreading sweep.			"

												I expected Full Bore to be a fun little puzzler, but I became engrossed in its mysterious world and by its devious puzzles.You begin as boar walking through a tranquil field, only to be caught in a sudden explosion and thrown into the mines of the Full Bore Mining Co. You make your way up to an empty fault, which you're accused of raiding and then charged with finding gems to compensate for those that you ""stole"" You'll explore the mines, talk to other boars and find out more about this strange place.The world and puzzle design are excellent. There's a vast network of caves to explore and plenty of secrets to find. It will take you many hours to find everything there is to find. The mechanics are simple: you can dig blocks, push blocks, climb blocks, and stomp on blocks, that's it. There are no upgrades to be found, so every puzzle can be solved immediately, but you'll need to understand how everything works to succeed. The challenges start out simple, but you'll tackle progessively trickier puzzles as you go along. There's a great rewind feature allowing you to undo any of your mistakes, which cuts the repetition to a minimum. You can always return to a difficult room later when you figure out how to solve it. The map does a great job of logging all the places you've traveled and all the collectibles and lore you've found or missed, so it's never hard to find your way around. The story is mostly told through logs and books you find as you go, but there are also events and characters to talk to as well. The writing is charming and engaging. You'll discover that the history of the boars goes much further than you initially think. The aesthetics are great as well. The pixel art, lighting and sound create a superb dark and sometimes forboding atmosphere. The rock soundtrack is a nice backdrop for puzzle-solving, never obtrusive to get in the way. Overall, I was really pleasantly surprised with Full Bore. There's a lot to love here for puzzle game fans. If you're a fan of games like FEZ or Antichamber, I highly recommend checking this out.

												An absolute treat to play!  Cool sci-fi storyline, interesting gameplay mechanics, awesome 8-bit graphics (with modern lighting!), and excellent soundtrack.  Also, the difficulty is very-well balanced; while a handful of the puzzles are fiendishly difficult and a few (but only a few) will test your reflexes, most of them just require straightforward application of the gameplay rules you've learned up to that point.  This is not to say they're easy... just that they're all solvable if you apply yourself.Hard to recommend highly enough!			"

												Full Bore probably isn't what you might think it is at first glance. It's a puzzle game and not a platformer. There's no jumping. Instead, puzzles are about pushing and climbing blocks (and occasionally stomping) to explore a suprisingly large world. It's clearly inspired by Fez in many ways, but there's a much greater focus on the main puzzle mechanics rather than the odd meta-puzzles of Fez. The puzzles are nicely designed and often have several solutions leading to different areas or secrets. It can be tricky at times, but the most difficult puzzles are saved for optional challenges.Overall, it's a nice puzzle game. If you like exploration and puzzles, you'll probably enjoy Full Bore.

												As the I believe I heard one of the devs describe it, a puzzle ""in-platformer"".  There is no jump button, instead you solve environmental puzzles through digging, bashing, climbing pushing, etc.  A few sections have some timing elements but you should be well prepared once you encounter them.  There is also a smartly implemented rewind system so you can correct any missteps you might have made.  Has a large map with varied environments.  Shortcuts eventually open up to alieve some backtracking issues.  Charming pixel art with only one character sprite I had a difficult time discerning what I was looking at.  Interesting game world and a story keeps things moving, with a few twists, but doesn't really get in the way of the gameplay.  Particularly good soundtrack as well.  Followed this all the way from Greenlight and is one of the best experiences out of that system.  Played on a shared account (close to 50 hrs for all but two achievements) for reference.			"

												This game is a hidden gem (pun not intended?). Controls are simple, but tight. Don't expect to get any special abilites or to level up. The variations in gameplay come from the levels, and there's way more variation than you'd think when you start. Except for a couple of optional puzzles, no puzzle is unfair. They're well thought out, some of them giving you face-palming epiphanies when you finally get how they work.The story though...oh man. You can finish the game in less than 10 hrs if you don't care for the story or to complete all the puzzles. But you'd be doing yourself a diservice, beyond the fact that it's worth it to actually play the puzzles. Without spoilers, this story of a mining boar goes deep. It deals with philosophy, religion, quantum physics... There's a neat mystery that you can put together if you take the time to do it.Definitely recommend it. One of the few games in recent memory that I felt compelled to complete to its true end.			"

												Overall: Pretty goodComments:- This is an exploration puzzle platformer where digging is the main mechanic.  It is not a digging game.- Reminiscent of FezLikes:- Non-linear exploration- Decent lore, enigmatic world- Some of the puzzles are quite challengingDislikes:- A lot of paths are downward with no way back up, so if you want to backtrack, you have to take a long, roundabout way back up- Longer than it needs to be; some rooms could be cut without losing much- Some of the more difficult puzzles did not feel worth it- I did not enjoy the few levels where you have to race- The secret to the shrines is cryptic and feels arbitrary.  I am not sure I would have figured it out.			"

												Full Bore is type of puzzle game I never thought I would have had so much fun playing. All the puzzles are based around box moving but in an open world style. Tons of block types keep the puzzles fresh and complex while plenty of collectibles and secrets make for tons to do. It's difficult at times but immensely satisfying.			"

												The individual puzzles are challenging, interesting, and vary quite a bit over the course of the game. Navigation from area to area can be quite tedious and confusing though. The lore is surprisingly deep for a block puzzle game about anthropomorphic pixel boars.			"
