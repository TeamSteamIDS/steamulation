												Resonance is a nice old style adventure with interesting and original game mechanics - like short / long term memories that you can use as inventory objects - plus four playable characters that start each with their own goals and then team up to solve a scientific and crime mystery. Puzzles are fresh and rather challenging in some cases, while 8 bit style graphics are really cool! The story conclusion should have been less rushed out, and the sound department is a bit poor, nevertheless I really liked this little gem. I recommend it to adventure fans who loved the '80s and '90s classics that want to breathe part of that atmosphere again!			"

												I have played quite a lot of point and click adventures, but I still think this one from 2012 beats them all.You can't help but care for the very well-written story and be caught in the thrill of the chase for the truth and the attempt to solve the clearly big problem that is going on.But I still think where Resonance shines the most is in its game design. Puzzles are logical, intuitive, and require critical thinking and paying attention to your context and options, not relying on trial and error like a surprisingly large amount of classics do.If you like other games from Wadjet Eye Games like Primordia, the Blackwell series, Gemini Rue, or another, I can almost assure you that you will like Resonance. The opposite is also true, WEG is a great developer/publisher and has a pretty good library of p&c adventures.			"

												Good story, relatable characters and motives, interesting locales and progression.So why can't I recommend this game?* No resolution configuration will make the game unable to alt+tab and will screw up with your desktop completely* The horrible 'Short term memory' gameplay feature is clunky and annoying, and is used heavily* Extremely slow and annoying drag-and-drop mechanism for using items / throughts / dialogs making gameplay an extreme chore* Switching between characters is nice in theory, but the implementation is horrible, forcing you to make the characters talk to eachother to get them to follow eachother around, not share items, and make your gameplay even more of a choreI really wanted to like the game, and it started pretty good when the team was seperate and you had no map to go around the city, but once they open up the destinations and bring the entire 'team' together, everything falls apart and becomes a huge annoying chore that makes you fight the interface much more then trying to solve puzzles.Unfortunatelly, I cannot recommend this.

												Really old school point and click adventure, decently written and scripted, quite challenging, multiple endings...Very solid, but watch out, when I say this game is retro, I mean it. A lot of the smaller things, which are hard to describe, about the overall asthetic could be a turnoff. But, if you're already a fan of classic 80s and early 90s adventure games you'll probably have a great time.And if you know what SCUMM is, you'll likely love it. : P "

												As I write my review this morning, my head is still hurting from beating this game the night before. This game is a challenge. A REAL challenge. First the brave and challenging stuff. This game is very very brave in my opinion. There are game mechanics that I have never seen before in a point-and-click. Long Term Memory (LTM) and Short Term Memory (STM) play a big role in this game. Not only do you have inventory items to talk about and give, but you can draw on your memory to piece puzzles together and solve the mystery. This was a very interesting idea, since it makes you really pay attention to every detail, and you have to pay attention to EVERYTHING. Plus, it makes you think about things that happened in the very beginning, especially at the end. Another strength is the idea of four protagonists. At the most I have only ever played with two protagonists. It's easy to keep track of their storylines and when working together, it isn't difficult to see how they should be used. Resonance is bold in making you play four different characters. Not only do you get to manage four different storylines (that is the easy part) but you have to maintain four different inventories, LTM's, and STM's. Thats where is can get kind of tricky, especially when you are expected to use all four protagonists at once. Certain characters can only go certain places and do certain puzzles. I went to a walkthrough a little more than I wished to, mainly because I wasn't patient enough to really sit down and figure it out. Don't get me wrong though, the puzzles can be difficult. This is the best looking Wadjet Eye game I think to date. It still has that wonderful retro pixel look,  but it is very smooth. The characters are all great and their storylines are easy to keep track of. Great voice acting all around. There is more than one way to solve puzzles and there is more than one ending, making in necessary to at least play through twice. This was a challenging game I am glad to have completed. I look forward to playing this again someday.			"

												Another day, another adventure game. The renaissance of the point & click is in full effect and, as a fan of such things, I couldn't be happier. Developed by XII Games, Resonance can be downloaded for just a few bucks; to find out if you, too, should jump in, read on... The Four Main Characters Resonance is set in the wake of a super-scientific disaster, and put us in a unique situation of guiding four separate main characters as they run around solving puzzles to get to the bottom of a mystery. These characters also cross paths, interact, and try to figure out each other's motives. The four: a doctor, a mathematician, a detective, and a reporter (who is frequently and humorously reminded that he's just a blogger). Each have their own secrets, and finding them out is every bit as entertaining as unraveling the core mystery. The really impressive thing about this game is that each of the four characters has an incredibly strong reason to be involved in the events of the story. Typically in adventure games, the hero does it ""just for a lark"" (the vast majority) or because they're a bit nosey, even though they're putting their life at serious risk. Don't get me wrong, I'm not knocking those games, but there's a real sense of forced participation on the part of the main characters. And this is where Resonance shines because of the various motivations, and how nuances and morally ambiguous they can be, that put this game ahead of the pack.Controlling each of these four separate characters also adds a cool spin to the flow of the adventure. From a storytelling perspective, it creates a fascinating teamwork dynamic between the different members of the group as they spread out across the city solving puzzles that push them closer to the truth of the story. Strong voice work and punchy dialogue brings the characters' distinct personalities right to the fore, making their connection all the more interesting. Gameplay One extra thing worth noting is Resonance takes a risk by altering the standard point-n-click gameplay ever so slightly. Instead of talking to a NPC and having a preset set of keywords, Resonance adds a dynamic keyword system of sorts. You can drag any item into your inventory and then re-drag it onto a NPC later on to ask them about it (they call it Short-Term memory). Kind of neat little feature and well implemented. Its not some drastic gameplay altering change, but it does gives Resonance its own little uniqueness in a point-n-click genre that is pretty set in stone in its ways. And of course whats a good point-n-click adventure game without some puzzles? Resonance has some excellent ones; not too hard not too easy and nearly all based on logical real world solutions so even if you cheat and peek at the solution you'll go, ""Why of course! Why didn't I think of that."" Also, the puzzles fit seamlessly right into the story rather than feeling like arbitrary sideshows, which is great. How do you log into the top secret computer? Well you hack into a regular PC, check the emails, get just enough info to get someone's username on the super computer, reset their password on it, then check the new password in their email account on the regular PC. You will find none of that ""tie a cat to a pogo stick and use it to catch a passing pigeon, which you then glue a microphone to so you can have it fly outside the window and record the man talking about his password"". Summary The story is fantastic, the characters are believable and well-written, the music and artwork is wonderful, and there are some tough choices and genuinely shocking twists. Like the rest of Wadjet's catalog, Resonance is an absolute must play for any classic adventure nut, and worth checking out for any more modern fan.P.S. - You can also read my previous review of Technobabylon in here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrRokuro-san/recommended/307580/ "

												One of the best adeventure games I have played in a while. I am going to have to check out some of Wadjet Eye's other games now. This game is an old school style adventure game but with some new innovations that make it feel more fresh. Theres a Short Term / Long Term Memory system, four controllable characters, a unique conversation system, and lots of brilliant and unique puzzles, some of them with a hard scientific edge. The savegame system has steam cloud support, and there are steam trading cards and an extensive list of achievements, anda  commentary mode that add some replayablity.Now for the bad, the game was a little buggy, I came across a dialog glitch where everthing sped up and dialog was skipped through several times, and characters got stuck a few times, but nothing game breaking. The overall sound felt dated, as did the graphics, but I think it was deliberate as they were going for that old school feel. The soundtrack was actually pretty decent though. There are no graphics options, you can only run the game in a window, but it still plays decently despite this.  Overall, the story felt modern and captivating. The game was challenging, but the story was intriguing enough I was compelled to keep plugging away. Will be playing through again to try and get 100% completion and some of the achievements I missed, I ended up 5 points away from 100% on my first playthrough! Pick this up at full price or on sale, either way you won't be dissapointed.			"

												Wadjet Eye Games asked me to provide feedback about Resonance late in its development process -- because our game Primordia was being published by WEG at the same time.  Ultimately, a game-blocking bug prevented me from finishing the game, and I haven't had the time or inclination to return to it.  So there are at least three reasons to take my review with a grain of salt: (1) I received the game for free; (2) I have a professional relationship with the publisher; and (3) I didn't finish the game.For reasons not clear to me, Resonance went from being a game that got a lot of attention -- much more than Primordia -- to a game that has basically fallen off the map.  That is unfortunate.  In my opinion, it is the only WEG title to seriously innovate when it comes to gameplay, specifically through the ""short-term memory"" dialogue mechanic.  STM operates as a kind of dialogue inventory, allowing you to ""take"" any hotspot in the game (up to five at a time) and use it as a topic of conversation with any NPC.This innovation was meant to solve a recurrent design challenge in adventure games (and, actually, RPGs), in which the dialogue options sometimes mistakenly presuppose that the player has noticed something (often a potential puzzle avenue) and realized that the NPC can help with it.  For example, the game might give the player the option of asking a maintenance man to help with a leaking faucet, but the player may not have made the (fairly obvious) connection between the maintenance man and the maintenance problem, such that the dialogue option solves the puzzle prematurely.  By requiring the player to ""take"" the leak into his STM and then ""give"" the leak memory to the maintenance man, the game ensures that it never gets ahead of the player.Ultimately, this innovation is great in theory but basically frustrating in execution -- the game ends up BEHIND the player many times, requiring tedious backtracking to gather the necessary and obvious memory ""items"" to advance conversations.  When this is coupled with having to individually control four characters and pass items among their inventories, the bread-and-butter aspects of adventure games (moving, collecting and using items, and talking) become extremely tedious. Ironically, the game's more elaborate puzzles are usually extremely well designed, such that the basic actions are grindingly slow but the complex ones are elegantly designed.Despite these drawbacks, I think Resonance's innovation makes it required playing as an example of a way in which ""retro"" adventure games are in fact advancing the art.  And the game has many other nice qualities, including the use of color and sprite design in the graphics, the high degree of polish, and a few genuinely clever puzzles. I think the game would've been much stronger if the management of memory were thematic -- as best I can tell, this major gameplay mechanic is almost entirely detached from the game's narrative, and in fact the scrupulous effort to make sure the character and player have identical knowledge is contrary to a major plot twist.  As it stands, the game's interface tells a story that is unrelated to the game's actual story: that people are oblivious to almost everything going on around them even when those things are unusual and important and that a small group of people is incapable of moving in tandem or cooperating in very basic tasks.  As best I could tell, the story was about science and evil conspiracies, and perhaps even about how people are very good at remembering things and working together.  But despite this dissonance, Resonance is still worth trying, especially when it's on sale for two bucks.			"

												Great game. The storyline was intriguing and well thought-out. It had engaging characters and witty dialogue. I like that you were able to play more than one character throughout the game. It was also interesting how their story-lines flowed well during the course of the story. (i could go into detail but that would spoil things) Art style of the backgrounds in the game were very detailed and the music keeps you immersed as well. I like how your decisions effect the story. I will probably play again in the future and alter my decisions and see how what that changes in the course of the story.			"

												Smart and funny, this 'point and click' adventure game is far more intuitive than most I have played. Rarely did I find myself clicking random objects until I found the answer. The puzzles are not always easy but they tend to rely on common sense, real world knowledge and paying attention to the story. The long term and short term memory mechanic is genius, and the characters are all rounded and well written. Speaking of the characters, at some points in the game you control multiple characters in the same area, and while the controls for that are a little unweildy at times it does work very well and adds another layer to the puzzles. This sci-fi adventure is in places witty, intelligent and sometimes a bit disturbing - Anna's nightmares come to mind, and I'd recommend it to anyone, not just point and click or sci-fi  fans.			"

												Resonance is a solid retro-style adventure game and a great story to experience. It's smart and has good puzzles and keeps fresh by moving between four intriguing characters and a number of explorable locations. However, about a third of the way in, at the moment when you are given the ability to switch between the four at will - when you can access their interchangeable inventories, use their short-term memories on virtually everything to recall things as conversation items, as well as calling on their respective long-term memories, and the ability to go to a slew of new locations, things get a bit overwhelming. This was where a friend and I called it quits. I eventually came back and followed a good community guide. This overwhelming bit actually doesn't last too long and then you return to a fairly linear but still quite open playstyle - totally manageable and more like other adventure games. It's got a great story that really picks up from that point on and the dynamic between the four works really well when the world is made more manageable. You might enjoy the complexity of the bit I found overwhelming but if not, and you too begin to play this great game and find yourself disheartened at the four-character exploration bit, just read that bit of a guide and then press on on your own again - it's worth it!

												Although i played this through until the end, i  can't honestly say that I recommend it. There are some novel ideas that i've not seen elsewhere in a point & click adventure (mostly to do with the interface), but unfortunately a lot of them seem a bit poorly thought out, and become a bit awkward quite early on.Controlling multiple characters, for instance, means that the usual amount of backtracking ('go there', 'try using that' etc) required whilst experimenting with puzzle solutions is now increased by four. And having to remind characters to follow each other quickly became a bit of a chore.Some of the story beats don't really work either, and i found my attention starting to wane as a result.			"

Sometimes you just gotta stop what you're doing, and think.Loved the detectived work, the hacking stuff etc.The ending is gold.Big yes for me. "

												I've said it before and I'll say it again; point-and-click adventures aren't a genre that I truly appreciate. I like to play them from time to time, but there's a great chance the game will have puzzles that just don't make any sense to me, or that the story just isn't compelling (enough).Resonance features a bit of my first problem with the genre, and practically none of the second. The story managed to keep me interested the whole way through. Despite the retro graphics (which I love and respect !) the voice acting is top notch. And there were a few levels that were also truly tense. Something I would never expect to see in an adventure game, let alone a game with 16 bit graphics.I have to be honest and say that I did use a walkthrough a couple of times (aye, I'm only human). But then again; I'd rather continue the story than be stuck doing -at times - frustrating puzzles.So, Resonance pleasantly surprised me. I hope it will do the same for you guys.[Rating: 77/100]			"

												Pretty surprised by this game. It had a cool ""Long Term Memory"" and ""Short Term Memory"" mechanic where you could drag anything highlightable into your thoughts and interact it with objects and people. This put a cool twist to how adventure games usually works and forced you to think more outside the box to progress the story.The story itself was very interesting and well thought out. You could choose between four main characters at any time which reminded me of Day of The Tentacle. They all had their strengths and weaknesses, so you had to make them work together to complete the puzzles and progress.The Puzzles was really good and didn't feel forced or illogical. I was stuck at some points, but I always figured it out in the end.I can really recommend this game for adventure fans! :)			"

												A hidden gem on Steam that deserves more attention. Resonance is a classic style point and click adventure game that adopts welcome changes for puzzles, such as the short-term memory dialogue options. Resonance is a seriously tremendous game, it nails everything right: good puzzles, amazing relatable characters with good character progression, music, sound effects, voice acting and atmosphere, good artstyle topped off with a good story.You can see how much hard work has went into this game, especially over multiple playthroughs, with easter eggs and attention to details, you get even more insight with the developer commentary option which so few games embrace, they also give a bonus of adding some bloopers from the voice over sessions, which add good comic relief.The only bad thing i can say about Resonance is that there is no resolution option, also what i think is a bug is when you shift tab to go into Steam it makes all conversation audio skip super fast, especially if you do not pause first, so careful if you are in Steam chat.

												It starts out well enough, but quickly gets tedious. You will have to do a lot of clicking for trying out simple solutions, and even if you think you know how to exactly solve a problem there is still much you have to do. Have the right character(s) there, have the correct thoughts in your short- and long-term-memory, interact correctly with everything... A lot of this game's length comes from these unnecessary clicking orgies, and it gets boring fast. The interface isn't rewarding enough for you to grind your way to the problems' solutions. And then the ""world"" gets opened up and you have a whole lot more places to cover, which sounds great at first, but then you realize you have to do more clicking with every single character.Graphics, story, voice acting... all great and d'accord with the other Wadjet Eye games, but if you boggle down the player with unnecessary and unfun gameplay elements it's not worth it. I came from Gemini Rue which avoided exactly those issues and managed to challenge me maybe not as long, but much more satisfyingly. So Resonance is - after the first two joyful hours - a disappointment. Wouldn't recommend.			"

												There's a really good story and some very nice ideas in here, unfortunately wrapped up in a game that trips itself with those same ideas.  Definitely a case where less would have been more.Starts off well enough, the introduction to the four central characters is well done with a couple of mini puzzles to work out and an introduction to the idea of timed segments.  Unfortunately the game goes awry shortly after as we meet the most annoying janitor ever and he actively gets in your way with his incompetence.This wouldn't be unusual for a game like this and would be forgivable were it not for the simultaneous introduction of ""short term memory"", which basically means dragging environmental cues into your memory so you can talk to people about them.  A nice idea, but it overcomplicates the game far more than it needs to as you work out that the item you need to talk about is 3 screens away for the fourth time.  The game would be much improved by dropping the STM idea (it largely gets forgotten later in the game anyway so maybe the devs worked that out for themselves) and just including the relevant option in conversation.  Other daft complications such as asking which way to turn a wrench when there is only one way it can turn at any time offer more pointless frustration for the player.On the more positive side a few nice puzzles (if you like cryptography and maths) are very satisfying, unfortunately they lead in to one f the most frustrating parts of the game in Anna’s second timed scene.  Not being happy to be a point and click game the devs saw fit to introduce the need for fast mouse wiggling, which wouldn’t be so bad if it were not for the fact that one slip sends you all the way bad to have to re-listen to Anna shrieking over and over again each time.  This is an annoyance that reappears at various times as the rewind sends you back way too far.Some more lovely little puzzles, including one that really makes the most of the teamwork between all four follows before the story really kicks into gear, I won’t spoil anything but suffice to say it is worth persevering this far for it.  Unfortunately the final notes are a few more frustrations born form the need to pixel-hunt and trial-and-error conversations round out the game.Overall the devs at XII would do well to look at the Blackwell series(from the same publishers) for cues on how to add a little innovation and variety into an adventure game without going overboard, more restraint next will definitely help to prevent the game from getting in the way of the story as it does here.I'm recommending it because there are some nice ideas and there is a good story in there, just be aware before you play it that you will get frustrated and you will question why on earth some design decisions were made that way as you play.

I am no fan of the pixel art style, I think it is overdone and also done badly most of the time. In this game however the art style is reasonably well made. The animations are quite smooth, the characters are distinctive enough so that you can see their expressions and glean their personality from them. And the backgrounds in the game are clear and not too busy, this makes sure that you won't be spending a lot of time pixel hunting for that one item you still need like in most adventure games.In the game you can control up to 4 characters. At the very start you control only one and you choose in which order you would like to play the beginning of the story of each of the characters, then the game starts opening up and gives you control of more characters. Controling multiple characters at the same time was actually quite interesting and created some nice interactions which aren't really seen that often in adventure games, especially not in the classic ones. However controlling mulitple characters can also become tedious as you have to manually control everything they do, you can order the other characters to follow you, but even doing that is tedious and not really all that helpful in the end. Controlling all 4 characters at the same time for a puzzle towards the end where you have to use all 4 is downright annoying and thankfully the game limits the number of characters you can control at the same time soon afterwards. Overall the multiple characters control feels like it was tacked on despite it being an integral part of the game.The story and the dialogue is where an adventure game is supposed to shine, and Resonance does just that. An interesting story and characters keep the game above water at all times. The game never becomes too dull to play, although I do have to mention that the last third of the game is definetly the weakest and potentially even disappointing, as the game is trying to wrap up the plot points. However most players will probably have already figured out the important parts of the story and will know how it's going to concluded, so it feels like you are just going through the motions at the end.Resonance is definitely worth playing if you like adventure games or you enjoy a good story. However I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else, it's not exceptional enough to bring over people to the genre.7 / 10			"

												As a whole, I think this is a pretty solid adventure game, but it's one of my least favorites from Wadjet Eye, which more speaks to the quality of their published games more than anything. The story here is very solid, the main characters are pretty interesting, the graphics and sound design are all pretty good, and some of the puzzles are pretty interesting and unique. I think the issues I have come down to the world itself being rather bland; the most out-there concept of the entire universe is the titular resonance itself, which for all I know could be real (probably not, but ehh.)As well, the game's flow is... well, it grinds to the halt for a section in the middle that feels reeeeally adventure game-y and the plot mostly comes to a halt for this section, too. As well, you have too many options and some of the puzzle solutions are obscure enough, plus the annoyance of having to constantly change characters, drag specific things into memory, give items to other characters because only certain characters can do certain things... it piles up into a rather unfun segment of the game that I pretty much gave up on and resorted to a walkthrough for, which I otherwise didn't use for the majority of the game.Other than that though it's enjoyable enough. The dream sequences are pretty unique and engaging, the timed puzzles are generally not too obscure as to require trial and error, and the game's length is pretty fine for the genre. It wasn't the most engaging or most memorable but it's a pretty enjoyable ride most of the way through with a pretty noticeable bump in the middle.			"

												This game is annoying.The ""Drag the Information"" mechanic is annoying.The characters recognise something need to be done? Good, let's go and do it. No! You need to drag the information first.You haven't done it? Go bad to the previous place and store the information. Why was this needed?Then, the story.This game start low, with a strange event and everything, which was interesting, and then put you quick enough into weapons of mass destruction, world domination and stuff. A ""big problem"" doesn't make the story epic. It makes it unbelievable and lame if you don't build into it.Ok, I can deal with it... except when you are about to discover the truth, well, there is another little thing. Yes, the motivations of the bad guys have something supernatural and completely inexplained. Right that, out of nowhere.There were no indication that was a thing in the setting. But yes.It's just feel really lazy.			"

												The game features a story that is so far quite interesting. I wouldn't say gripping, but certainly enough to want to find out what is going to happen next. The only thing that is really annoying about the game is how slow it is. You can't doubleclick to run as is customary in point-and-clicks, you can't abort an action once started, menus open and close slowly and the UI in general is a bit clunky. These problems only server to make it a bit slow and is not in the way of the game itself in any other way.It is quite difficult at times, so if you like simple games, either get another one or have a walkthrough at hand.

												Resonance is one of the better point & click adventure games I've ever encountered.It plays mostly like any other P&C, but it introduces some novel mechanics and follows through with them. On the familiar front, you've got multiple characters and an intuitive character switch panel. Dialog boxes are nothing new, and the player inventory is pretty common. What they've added are two inventory-like panels to the UI for long term memory (LTM) and short-term memory (STM).Both panels can be used similarly to the classic inventory. As events occur, a recap becomes available in certain character's LTM. By interacting with that directly, you can reply the event and remind yourself where you left off or what your current goals are. Or, you can drag the memory to a character (or into a conversation) to ask/mention that event. The short-term memory allows you to drag any object with a label into the STM panel where it becomes a similar memory that you can use to ask NPCs about.There are several puzzles designed into the game that require you to make use of these features, and they do it in clever ways that make these additions feel very natural. Your first ""aha"" moment solving one of those brings an extra buzz because of the way they integrate these new mechanics.The puzzle design is top notch and the story is quite compelling. Cast in the style of a 16-bit techno thriller, there's very little to its execution that you could accuse of descending into cheesy. It stays on top of the ball and its plot twists are well executed without a lot of TV-style telegraphing what's going to happen.If you're a fan of the adventure genre, you need to play this game.

												An adventure game of conspiracy and science run-amok! Take control of 4 characters of diverse backgrounds to solve a mystery that threatens the world. The puzzles here can be rather out of the box, some of them frustrating with with false leads and extra items that have nothing to do with the puzzle and others being a bit convoluted. The story and character interactions themselves are well worth the effort though (even if you have to cheat a little (like I did, but only on the hardest ones)).			"

												Wadget Eye adventure games have REALLY high quality stories. Their older adventure games go through a learning curve in puzzle design and UI but sticking through it is always worth it for the story. This game is no exception. I'm only 1.8 hours in and already entranced and sucked in. Even to people who normally dislike the adventure game mechanic, I highly recommend picking up a walkthrough and going through it just to experience the tale. (Not to say that their puzzles aren't fun. I think they're fun but it's not for everyone.) "

												This game is overlooked. It puts a new spin on the adventure game genre with a 4 character mechanic utilizing both long and short term memories. Basically you use the character's prior knowledge (memories( as tools in the environmental puzzles, as opposed to relying solely on contrived or forced inventory items that might be included in other games. It is highly innovative which deserves praise in itself, but one of the most amazing feats of this game, is in spite of having 4 characters with various memories, I used a walkthrough maybe a single time on this game. To say a little about me, i'm a fan of adventure games, many classics (too many to list, but to give you an idea: Gabriel Knight, Sam and Max, Day of the Tentacle, Broken Sword, The Longest Journey, Monkey Island and many, many more. However, most of thet ime I resort to a walkthrough to varying degrees when I get stuck.  The story was compelling all the way through and art style really captured the mood. I wanted to leave this review for long time adventure game fans, to not overlook this game.			"

												Resonance is an utterly fantastic example of the more serious, dramatic side of the Adventure genre - though it is not entirely without amusing moments. It's story is engaging, surprising; it's characters realistic and well-formed; the topics it tackles thought-provoking.The puzzles manage to be the perfect level of difficulty - they are challenging but logical. When stuck, you can ask other characters for hints, rather than clicking some actual ""Hint"" button, making the whole thing feel less like an admission of defeat.One of the best qualities about the games' puzzles was to me that often there are multiple ways to achieve your goal, ranging in difficulty. In fact, the only time I looked up a walkthrough was on a harder path I discovered while replaying a section of the game.Finally, the game's graphics, music and voice acting are all stellar.Give Resonance a try (there's a demo available on the developer's site). It'll get you hooked.			"

												A great story line point and click game starting with a shy lab assistant Ed who holds information on the device known as Resonance. What makes this game unique is the ability to play four different characters, and to view four different viewpoints all regarding the impact of this device; whether it be good or evil. What really stands out with most 2-D art is the storyline, and this one does not fail. Its a great story with multiple endings. I would say the puzzles in this games are probably on average more difficult than most I have played in the past. I had to look up a few in the walkthroughts. :/ But, overall, the game is a really good succinct playthrough. As you can see from my playtime, not more than about 10 hours. Although the price being lower, I think it is more than reasonable to pay that for the amount spent in play.			"

Yes. But not to someone new to ags adventure games, there are plenty of games I'd recommend first, such as Gemini Rue or perhaps Blackwell deception. But if you can get over its slightly clunky controls there's a brilliant piece of interactive fiction in Reasonance, with some real gut punching twists and turns.			"

What's truly amazing is that the author of the game put 5 years of his efforts to make this game while I finished it in a half a day.

It is hard to make games without a thick budget and a team. I can tell that the author was not doing this game for the money, it was just his passion. I take off my hat and thank you for the great experience. Hopefully this game will make some money, so you can create new amazing games in a shorter amount of time. Thanks. I recommend this game to the fans of good old fashion quest like Beneath Steel Sky, Space Quest, Monkey Island and so. The best India game I ever played.			"

												Resonance is yet another in a line of satisfying point and click adventure games from Wadjeteye. In it, you assume the role of a group of people whose destinies are intertwined with a mysterious yet destructive device. The game starts with you witnessing a series of terrorist attacks where large holes have been “punched out of” various cities of note around the world.Gameplay consists of you switching at-will between either of the four protagonists while using their various tools and abilities to solve whatever puzzles are thrown your way. An interesting addition to the typical PnC mechanic is the ‘memory system’ which allows for things to be automatically catalogued in long memory but also gives the player the option to drag objects from the surrounding world into short-term memory for use in advancing dialogue and solving other puzzles.Besides solving problems, your companions also serve as a source of information for what to do next and whenever you are stumped you can simply ask around until you have a decent idea of what to do next. Like other games by this studio, there are easter eggs and multiple endings available. I particularly liked the optional puzzles spread throughout the game that served as a little reward for putting in a little extra effort. You don’t HAVE to solve them, but it gives a little bit of insight into things or an alternate solution to a puzzle that would have been solved with a more direct approach.Overall, I enjoyed playing Resonance and would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice short adventure game to while away an afternoon on.

Not one of the best. Get's annoying 3rd scene in and fairly fast. I'm going for a Let's Play on Youtube so I can see if the story line was worth it.

												Everyone is saying how great the story is and I'm dissapointed that I won't experience it. I just couldn't deal with the memory interaction mecanics. And it didn't take long for me to realise that the game is too hard for me. I've played through tons of point and click games, but these puzzles were still out of my league. Assuming that you are into old style point and clicks and that you're up for a challenge and quite a different system for interactions then this might be your game. Otherwise I recommend Wadjet Eye's other excellent games such as Primordia and the Blackwell series.			"

												To be honest I was rather sceptical about this game at  the beginning: I thought it would be another point-and-click quest with tons of pixel-hunting. Well... It is actually one.But it is not a disadvantage! Not here. The game has much more interesting benefits then the average quests. First of all, it has somewhat unique mechanic of long-time and short-time memories. Saw a homeless in a subway? Why not to remember and talk about him with a neighbor on the car?  Was a witness of a blackout in a whole city? Well, that is worth remembering and discussing weeks after. And so on and so forth. Pretty much memory combinations you can make to proceed further.Secondly, you can operate four different characters at the same time. Not so surprising for a quest game of 2012? But how you unite the characters with their abilities - it affects the story. Much more impressive now, huh?And one last thing, the game has an amazing storyline and a wonderful voice acting that helps you to live a story of ""Resonance"" like you are an important part of it too.So, my opinion: ""Resonance"" is one of ""must have"" and ""must be played"" games.

Content over glitz, anyway.The gameplay style is also quite innovative and sufficiently challenging. Not a reaaaally long game, but a good length for an adventure game.

												I would say this is an excellent game, sometimes the puzzles can be a bit of a hassle because they are so unthinkable, however, if you've played point-and-click adventure games before, this is definitely on the tame side for ridculous amounts of time wasted on clicking everything. Good characters, good music, decent voice acting, and an interesting and intriguing story and an ending worth playing forThis is a video of my first time playing this game to give you an idea of the real gameplay:

												This game is amazing. It is unlike any point and click that I have played before.Before you start, you should probably change the resolution and make the game windowed. You can do that in the game's folder where there is an exe that has the game's set up option.After I did that, I had a great time. It was hard to put down and kept me up late.Some of the puzzles are hard, but most of them can be solved. It was nice to keep my brain working and I felt accomplished after completing them.The game has a memory feature that you can drag to characters to start dialogues. It is a cool feature.The story is original and the characters are realistic and might be relatable for some people. The plot twists are great and unpredictable The voice acting is excellent.Overall, one of the best point and click games that I have ever played.I even enjoyed playing it on my television screen.There are multiple endings.

												Resonance is like all those games you used to play as a kid, except even worse, because it just serves to remind you how much older you are now, and that you can't go back to the magic of your youth.  No more fairy floss on a hot Summer's night at the local carnival, watching the fireflies come out as the bonfires fade.  No more fireworks amidst a darkening horizon as little Emma Sue from down the street whispers sweet nothings in your ear.No more yesterday.  Only today, only tomorrow - Resonance fails to evoke anything but regret, despair and pessimism.Despair being the operative word in that sentence - how do I get out of the train?  I keep trying to go to the first car to drive it, because that's what you do in GTA, but wtf?			"

The game plays in away like a Tarantino film...how do te main characrers paths interact with each other?  Graphics are spot on retro '90s. The little bit of humor keeps me chuckling.  What's really innovative is the long and short term memory usage to remember things and instigate different conversation topics.  Really cool!  Pick this up if you are a fan of old adventure games!

												The plot is mildy interesting, but the dialog is painful to wait through.The controls are atrocious, it feels like they were build for a tablet. No keybord shortcuts, so you constantly have to click to bring up the menu, then click the action you want, then click where you want to interact. Accidently clicked the wrong thing? Too bad, the menu's gone now, and you've got to listen to a crappy canned response *again*. And being an adventure game, there's a lot of trial and error, trying to figure out the exact steps to get the thing you already know you want to happen to *actualy happen*, so you'll be doing the menu click shuffle A LOT.The game is really slow to boot. I could feel myself physically aging waiting on characters to walk across rooms, even when i got them to run.I couldn't stand it another second once the map opened up, as the aforementionned problems were at least tolerable when things were limited to 1 to 3 screen puzzles. Once I needed to do things across a dozen locations, moving back and forth, the pain of the interface and the slowness just sucked all of the enjoyment out.			"

												This game has its nice moments and it is unfortunate I have only thumb up or thumb down as a rating.  But after all in a game like this, without graphics, without much innovation, it is a plot I am mostly interested in. And this plot is very weak.Aside from one twist (that can be seen a mile in advance), it is as naive as a bad Hollywood movie. Characters are flat, setting is not really believable, and half of the problem they face felt like retelling of r/politics. I feel niche games need higher standards.			"

												I'm not really into retro-gaming, nor into point'n'click games, but I decided to give a try to Resonance and I must say it was a nice surprise! The lo-res style can be a turn off, but if you get pass the initial knee-jerk reaction, you'll enjoy a fun and smart game with good puzzles. A little bit too short but I enjoyed evey bit of it.pros:- the short term memory system is interesting and adds more options than just exploring dialogues lines.- the voice acting is very good, and the dialogues are well written, with a good dose of irony/humour.- the puzzles are challenging and sometimes forces the player to resort to the pen & paper bloc (old school gaming!).- there are many small details that makes the game re-playablecons:- the game engine is not playing nicely with wide (16:9) screens, and also doesn't support dual screens and screws up all the  windows positions... The first time you launch the game can be a shock.- there are a few goofs like Reggie giving his SIM card to Ray and then asking to call him and some - small - parts of the story which don't really come together.

												Other than the graphics, this is one of the best adventure games I have ever played. The story is fast paced and engaging. The puzzles were challenging and logical. The music and voice acting were good. There were some new and interesting game mechanics. The first is the short-term and long-term memory system. Second is switching between the four main characters in order to solve puzzles. The character animations are good, each character has their own set of expressions. Some animations like walking around are jumpy like old 16 bit games. The biggest negative to this game is the graphics resolution, about the same as an old fashioned Sierra title from the early 90's. Since some of the puzzles and game mechanics rely on visual cues, this detracts from the overall playing experience. What is most impressive about this game is that it provides a good experience in spite of this primitive graphics resolution.			"

My favorite thing about the game was the ability to play as several different characters at the same time (often in completely different places), and combine their abilities and inventories to use teamwork in solving problems.

												I loved Resonance! One of the best point and click adventures I've played in a really long time. The story is terrific. At the end of the 2nd act, there's a huge plot twist that hit me like a ton of bricks.The voice acting is really good. It's a long game. I got stuck in one part where I had to cheat multiple times to get through it. Except for that part in the middle of the game, it was a solid challenge, but not overwhelming. There's multiple endings and optional, hidden things to do. I really liked how any object in the evironment and even memories along with inventory items can be used as a topic of conversation with npc's. Also, there's some more hands on stuff besides all the point and clicky stuff. There's a part where some goon is climbing a rope to get to the chick and the mouse needs to be rapidly pushed up and down to simulate the cutting of the rope. Also, there're a couple of 'hacking' parts where a reporter needs to get information from computer systems that were really well done. Adventure fans should play this game immediately. I highly recommend. Resonance is awesome!			"

												Graphics? WowStory? InterestingMusic/sound/VA? All rightGameplay?There's no nice way to say it: this game is stupid. The rules it plays by (i.e. the gimmicks it uses) make solving puzzles tedious beyond belief, and the frustration is compounded by a lack of good direction (i.e. what the objective puzzle even is) and the clues necessary to solve the puzzles that you know exist.I'm not denying it had great potential, but the execution is all teh fails. Still, maybe you're more patient, more intelligent, or just plain motivated by a good challenge of your attention to detail. This is easily a game that can be loved by certain people, even though I am not one of them.			"

												Old style AND original. That should be enough for classic adventure games fans. This game plays with the clever idea of using items as conversation elements instead of the old-fashioned multi-choice dialogs. Well, it's a mix of both ideas actually. And it works well. The game is structured as a series of rather localized puzzles (specially at the beginning!) so it is easier to focus. Well balanced, interesting and fair (I almost didn't cheat at all, and I have so little patience!) The plot is also nice.As a negative point (for some) this game is perhaps short. An overall satisfying experience.			"

												Resonance is beautiful an adventure game with great story and music, where you can control up to four characters. Uncover a mystery, get surprised, and make your choice. It makes you think about the conspiracy theory of 9/11 as an inside job made to pass anti-terrorist laws that really aim at controlling people through vigilance. Nice puzzles, innovative playability, just minor bugs.			"

												I never would have thought that a Point&Click can be that compelling nowadays.Great arc of suspense and incredibly well paced!One minor flaw though:there was a point pretty early on in the game where it was not really obvious what to do next to advance. The info I had was even a little contradicting to the solution. Just one situation, though, and maybe it was me ignoring something obvious.Anyways, this game is very worth buying & playing - especially when bought in Sale!			"

												Another great game by Wadjet Eye. Where many traditional point and click games were linear in design and story, Resonance weaves a complex tale with many different ways of getting to the ending. Resonance demonstrates, at least to me, how deep a point and click experience can be, where the decisions have moral weight and haunt you. The game can be short, but it has elements of replayability. If you love the point and click genre, get this, you won't be disappointed.Just a word of warning, the ending is not for everyone.			"

												Resonance is a game that pays great tribute to the wonderful adventure games of the late 90s, while providing such a great story and experience that you never really think about that after the first hour. Sure, at first the pixellated graphics make you say ""oh wow, this is like Monkey Island all over again"" but by the time you're halfway in, Monkey Island is gone from your mind. The story is dramatic, occasionally funny, and keeps you on your toes. Interactive moments don't simply plug a tired puzzle formula into the mix every once in a while, but succeed in immersing you further into the world. As the climax is reached, things accelerate so that by the end, you feel drained - but that doesn't diminish your sense of accomplishment. Plus, there are some branching decisions - replay value! Now that's something most of those old adventure games didn't offer ;)			"

												I picked this game up for ~£2 on sale and, when i first booted it up and played for a bit, I wasn't too impressed...but the more I played, the more I enjoyed it. The point and click interaction feels a bit clunky at first (especially the Long Term Memory / Short Term Memory interaction), but after a while it becomes second nature and I began to appreciate it much more.The story  & characters are what really sells this game in the grand scheme of things. The story is very good and does a good job of engrossing you in the world. The charaters are also very well done, leaving you wanting to find out more about them & hearing more about what they have to say.A lot of the puzzle solving elements in this game really don't hold your hand. Assuming you don't use a walkthrough, they may take a while to solve if you haven't picked up the appropriate item along the way.... so you may end up having to re-visit earlier locations to find something that you previously missed.The graphics, although I'm assuming they were meant to look like a really old  retro point n' click game, do take a bit of getting used to though.Thoroughly enjoyed this one. If you liked / like the look of this, i'd also reccommed picking up Gemini Rue, which is also awesome.			"

												This is a cool retro-styled point and click adventure with a good plot that I would recommend to anyone who likes the genre. The puzzles are tricky in places but logical (none of that try using every item on everything else stuff). The 'Short Term Memory' mechanic is something I've not really seen before - it lets you 'remember' something in one area then bring it up in comversation later; generally has the effect of thinning down the conversation trees without leading you directly to the right line of questioning. Being able to shift between characters is also interesting and is used well in some of the later puzzles - worth a look!			"

												The story isn't bad, but you essentially have THREE inventories per character, which sometimes makes puzzles annoying to find, let alone engage with. Combine that with occasional real-time sequence that visibly rewinds and forces you to go through it again and again until you get it right, and an interesting game ends up turning its own interface into a laborious puzzle.

												This has been sitting in my games library for about 6 months. I finally got around to playing it and ended up finishing it in one sitting (It's pretty long, so that's meant as a testament toward quality, not a comment about length).Very nice game. I found the story intriguing and the atmosphere was great, particularly at certain points (one chase scene had me jumping and panicking more than most of the horror games I've played). The mechanics were nice as well. The four-playable-characters aspect was neat and I loved being able to instantly change between them (though trying to remember who was carrying what was sometimes annoying). I liked the implementation of Long and Short-term memory, and thus the ability to use things that you can't physically pick up as conversation prompts. There was some good humor mixed in, which I always appreciate in my point-n-clicks, and the art was lovely throughout.I did encounter a couple bugs along the way, but nothing too big, and nothing that I couldn't fix by loading (though if you didn't save a lot as I do they might have been more of a problem). My main gripe about the game is that some of the puzzles are VERY overly complicated. Don't get me wrong, I like difficult puzzles, but I do NOT like tedious puzzles and leaps of logic, and unfortunately Resonance has its fair share of those. I'm willing to look past them, though, because not all of the puzzles were that way, and because I liked the story and characters so much.All in all, it's a game I really enjoyed and will play again someday. Reccommend it to any adventure game fan, especially on sale.			"

												I picked this game up for ~£2 on sale and, when i first booted it up and played for a bit, I wasn't too impressed...but the more I played, the more I enjoyed it. The point and click interaction feels a bit clunky at first (especially the Long Term Memory / Short Term Memory interaction), but after a while it becomes second nature and I began to appreciate it much more.The story  & characters are what really sells this game in the grand scheme of things. The story is very good and does a good job of engrossing you in the world. The charaters are also very well done, leaving you wanting to find out more about them & hearing more about what they have to say.A lot of the puzzle solving elements in this game really don't hold your hand. Assuming you don't use a walkthrough, they may take a while to solve if you haven't picked up the appropriate item along the way.... so you may end up having to re-visit earlier locations to find something that you previously missed.The graphics, although I'm assuming they were meant to look like a really old  retro point n' click game, do take a bit of getting used to though.Thoroughly enjoyed this one. If you liked / like the look of this, i'd also reccommed picking up Gemini Rue, which is also awesome.			"

												Resonance is a game that pays great tribute to the wonderful adventure games of the late 90s, while providing such a great story and experience that you never really think about that after the first hour. Sure, at first the pixellated graphics make you say ""oh wow, this is like Monkey Island all over again"" but by the time you're halfway in, Monkey Island is gone from your mind. The story is dramatic, occasionally funny, and keeps you on your toes. Interactive moments don't simply plug a tired puzzle formula into the mix every once in a while, but succeed in immersing you further into the world. As the climax is reached, things accelerate so that by the end, you feel drained - but that doesn't diminish your sense of accomplishment. Plus, there are some branching decisions - replay value! Now that's something most of those old adventure games didn't offer ;)			"

												Resonance is a fantastic game. Although the mechanics will not be anything new or different to anyone who's played 90's adventure games, the story and character interactions are great. Also, if your background with adventure games involves comical, colourful fare like Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle, you may find the dark, sometimes bleak setting of Resonance to be an interesting twist.For me, having a retro adventure game set in a story where the characters face conspiracies, betrayals, and the threat of atomic annihilation was pretty compelling. True, there is a fair share of pixel hunting and the occasional stumper of a puzzle, but overall the flow of gameplay is quite smooth. Don't read any spoilers if you're interested in this game at all! It will be worth it.			"

												I loved Resonance! One of the best point and click adventures I've played in a really long time. The story is terrific. At the end of the 2nd act, there's a huge plot twist that hit me like a ton of bricks.The voice acting is really good. It's a long game. I got stuck in one part where I had to cheat multiple times to get through it. Except for that part in the middle of the game, it was a solid challenge, but not overwhelming. There's multiple endings and optional, hidden things to do. I really liked how any object in the evironment and even memories along with inventory items can be used as a topic of conversation with npc's. Also, there's some more hands on stuff besides all the point and clicky stuff. There's a part where some goon is climbing a rope to get to the chick and the mouse needs to be rapidly pushed up and down to simulate the cutting of the rope. Also, there're a couple of 'hacking' parts where a reporter needs to get information from computer systems that were really well done. Adventure fans should play this game immediately. I highly recommend. Resonance is awesome!			"

Chi ama le avventure grafiche vecchio stile, un po' pixellose e ricche di contenuti piuttosto che grafiche pompate... deve necessariamente giocare a Resonance e Gemini Rue.Enigmi incrociati visto che si usano quattro personaggi, cooperazione tra di loro, intrighi e segreti, il tutto in un gioco che saprà tenervi incollati per almeno 10/12 ore.Unico neo è la lingua inglese che per alcuni potrebbe risultare uno scoglio insormontabile, ma si tratta di un inglese abbastanza facile e poi ci sono sempre i dizionari! Voto 8.5/10 considerando che a Gemini Rue si merita un bel 9.5/10.			"

												It's a nice game, but it's not always clear what you have to do, even with the clues. The storyline is great and the characters are interesting. To have four simultaneous playable characters is sometimes enjoyable and some other times tedious.			"

												This game is for anyone that likes Thrillers and Sci-Fis. You play through 4 different characters and... Oh the plot twists... I can still remember the moment when I almost fell from my chair. The story is really awesome, like any of the point and click should have. It is totally worth it's money. If I could forget it, discover it, buy it and play it again, without a single doubt! 9,5 / 10			"

												Very nice game with good gameplay and characters, although some story elements were brought out of the blue (at least that's what I think). Long story short, if steam had more accurate rating system - I would rate it 7.5 out of 10.			"

												Probably the most well made point and click adventure game I've played. Great story with a really good ending. Good control and awesome voice acting. Also doesn't have too many of those stupid puzzles that only make sense in point and click adventure games. Great game			"

												* No resolution configuration.* Gameplay and puzzles are rather obscure and strange. Why would I not recognise the ring tone of my own cell phone, and why does it take so many repeat attempts at retreiving it from the hamper? IRL I'd say '♥♥♥♥, I left my cell phone in my pants'. Then I'd just grab it from the hamper. Done. Same with the cell phone. Another annoying set of poorly explained tasks right off the start, just to answer my damned phone. * Drag and drop very rapidly becomes an annoying chore.* Character management is a chore. Overall, this game is just way to clunky and obtuse. It plays like a make-work project. "
