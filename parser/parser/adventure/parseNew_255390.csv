												Max: The Curse of Brotherhood is essentially a puzzle platformer with some brief precision platforming sections.It's got great cartoonish animated visuals, but don't let that make you think this is a children's game.It starts off easy enough, but towards the end of world 2 I can feel it getting tougher. I've played the game for about 2 hours now and am about 25% in, with exploring the areas and getting most collectively. Can't speak about the overall length or difficulty for now as such.The platforming is really slick though. Max is agile and moves quickly. This is something I really like about the game.The puzzle element meanwhile is novel for me. Your magic marker gains new powers, and you can draw vines, branches, pull up earth from the ground etc. initially they may be very direct since there are visual cues but as you go on there is some thinking required. So far, there is one notable performance issue. The game occasionally has it's frame rate set to 15 or 20fps and I need to Alt Tab out and back into the game to get 60fps. Nothing major and this usually happens only after loading screens, and that too not always.Overall, I'm enjoying the game. Nothing out of the world extraordinary, but slow paced and well made.			"

												Max is your basic side-scrolling platformer game with a bunch of great stuff in it. The controls are simple enough to learn, and much of the game is merely setting up your next move: figuring out how to get from point A to point B with as little dying as possible. While much is possible to go slow and steady, there are many points in the game that requrire precise timing and vine-laying and otherwise to ensure that your enemies die or are trapped, and that you don't fall down a sudden hole that opened up underneath you.For those that are story oriented, Max has a nice storyline that progresses kinda predictably (ish), but its a great story that'll be relateable for anyone with siblings who have at times wished they would disappear. . . who weren't aware that they might actually be taken into another world. For those not sure whether the game would be worth it or not, here's the basic premise: You play as a kid named Max trying to save his brother from an old magician named Mostacho, who like his name entails, boasts a moustache. You take him down using a magic marker, in both senses of the word (its a literal magic marker, who doesn't wanna play with that?),  that has been imbibed with the soul of an old woman (the guide of the story, gotta have one of those). So yeah, I'd recommend trying this game out and seeing what you think!			"

												SO. MUCH. FUN! One of the reviews here said that if one enjoyed Tomb Raider, one would enjoy this title as well. I bought this game based on that review and I have to say, this has got to be one of the my favourite platformer games. The gameplay is fun, unique and exciting. You have a magic pen that you can use to transform your environment into a platform for you to interact with and to help you on your journey to find your brother. I thought it would be awkward to try and draw things on screen with the controller, but I was wrong. It was easy and intuitive, one element that I enjoyed about the game.+ Fun little puzzle-platformer.+ Pretty graphics (like watching a cartoon).+ Predictable but still enjoyable story.+ Puzzles are mostly not too easy (though this could be a con for a kid).+ Great voice acting.+ Very forgiving checkpoints.+ Tight controls.+ Very well paced.- Final boss fight is too short and too easy.- Linear (though for this type of game, it is sort of expected).I seriously hope there's a sequel. Would buy it in a heartbeat.My Rating: 9/10			"

Max: The Curse of Brotherhood (Platformer-Puzzle)We have some basic options:  Vibration (if you're using a controller), Sound Effects, Music, Subtitles (NOT on unless you turn them on), and Use Arrow keys (if you prefer not to use or don't have a controller), and then there are settings for the grapics, low, medium, and high.  There are also six languages to choose from.  The game automatically adjusted for my widescreen, but it can be played Windowed by hitting Alt-Enter, if you wish.The game begins in a very Labyrinth[www.imdb.com]-esque way, and it's up to you to save your brother from the trouble you caused for him. ;p  Gameplay starts out as a very basic platformer, but it's not long until you start gaining some powers, and that's where the true charm of the game starts shining through.  The puzzle mechanics are brilliantly realized, ranging anywhere from easy to perplexing, but not to the point of frustration.I was enjoying the puzzle aspect of the game so much that I was actually a bit disappointed when, in latter levels, we started needing to depend on quick decision-making, and at times, good reflexes!  It wasn't until the final sequence of the game that I remembered -- Oh yeah, this is what platformers used to be all about! (ie. Donkey Kong Country, etc.)  The beauty of these sections is that, while they may be difficult, they are still doable!  It may take a dozen tries, but it CAN be done, AND you don't have to keep starting the level over again to achieve it, as the automatic save-points are well-spaced.Something I truly love about the game is the graphics.  Sure, they're pretty, but the devs did an amazing job making a side-scrolling platformer *feel* like a 3D game by periodically changing up the perspective.  Beautifully done, devs, I'm very impressed! :DThe music was nicely-chosen, and I enjoyed the voices, as well -- especially some of Max's ""YEEES!"" moments. lol~Points to remember: - You can attach vines to a myraid of objects, ranging from branches to boulders and more. - Items can be cut at the base OR the tip! - Be creative and don't give up!  The devs give us a lot of freedom with our powers, and sometimes it's going to be trial-and-error figuring things out.There are a couple of things to be on the lookout for whilst you're running around.  They are beholders (plants with eyeballs at the end of a stalk that allow the user to spy on the world) and pieces of an amulet.  These collectibles are not *needed* to complete the game, but they sure do add an extra bit of fun. XD  You can replay a chapter at any time (even after you've completed the game) from via the menu, and looking at the menu during gameplay will show you how many you have left to find on your current level.  In addition, there are 27 Achievements for you to earn, another plus in my books.Overall, I found Max: The Curse of Brotherhood to be a delightful game, full of beauty, danger, excitement... and tempered with just a splash of good old fashioned platformer-frustration.  I would say that it's OK to play with older kids, but perhaps not little ones.  There's a big scary monster in there (whom I find to be absolutely fabulous!), but it might upset younger children.Highly recommended!			"

												Max.  You little pleasing title you.  Sometimes, during a steam sale, I grab something that looks interesting and just hope it pans out.  This game looked nice. Puzzley platformifisizing and all that.  Figured, why not it's only $3.75.  What a fantastic surprise.If you are like me and tend to gravitate to action platforming a la Prince of Persia and Tomb Raider as well some some puzzling going on then this very well might fit in your library quite snuggly.Max's brother is abducted by an evil villain named Mustachio - WARNING:  This title is very anti-mustache and any facial hair aficionados might be offended.  His lil bro is then sucked into a netherworld from which only Max can save him.  I don't know why.  If it was *my* little brother I would be turning his room into a new play room and stealing all his legos.  But I suppose brotherly love must overcome and all that.Off the bat you'll encounter some tutorials on drawing with your mouse or controller.  Yep, I know it sounds bad, right?  But it's actually pretty easy. I even did it entirely with my controller.  You solve puzzles by drawing vines, branches, water spouts, exploding fire, earth columns, and probably some other stuff I have totally forgotten by now.  These things you draw not only to solve puzzles but also to make up the framework for the platforming.  The puzzles are good, some even causing me to say ""what the.."".  While being somewhat casual a few  will actually stump you for awhile.  Now, the  platforming is on the medium level until level 6 where is bumps up to a bit-more-than-medium, the majority of the tougher bits towards levels 5 and 6.  And it's done well, usually with a giant monster chasing you.  Very action oriented and guess what?...you have to solve puzzles on the fly while being chased by an evil monster and timing the platforming.  YES.  It's that type of game.Is it hard?  Before level 5 it is fairly casual gamer friendly.  Level 5 requires more brain activity and Level 6 requires some quick maneuvering.  The final boss is hardish, but once you figure out what to do it's a piece of cake.  Hardness...7/10.  For an extra challenge there are some artifacts and eyeball spy camera plants to uproot.  I got some of those, but frankly my steam library is too damn big to try to 100% a lot of games. Time management yo.Graphics are sorta kinda Pixar looking. They look great and run well.  I would not say it was stunning, but definitely pretty.  Had zero crashes using a few PC's and ran pretty well overall at 60 FPS with a mediorce system.  Sounds are well done and the menus are easy to navigate.  Save spots are set in good places, and I have to say it was a wonderful produced game all in all.If you like action puzzle platformers, then give this a go.  Wonderful title and quite enjoyable. "

												A quick-paced, simple sidescrolling puzzle game. The graphics are great and so is the art style, all the landscapes are beautiful and vibrant and the characters are distinctive and interesting to look at.The puzzles aren't particularly difficult, at least at the beginning, but they're satisfying and fun to do so it preserves replay value and, since you respawn pretty close to where you die, they don't get frustrating.Lots of fun and very cool!

Posted: November 2, 2014
												Having grown up with two younger brothers, I can empathize to Max’s annoyance at his younger brother Felix fiddling with his stuff, making a mess of his room, and seeming to exist only to get on his nerves. I might not have gone so far as to enact an occult rite and banish my brothers to an unknown fantasy world (though I might have wanted to at times), but at least Max realizes the gravity of what he unintentionally did pretty fast and sets off to save his brother from a creepy old man who intends to steal his youth, Gruntilda the Witch style.A sequel mostly in name and lead character only to Max and the Magic Marker, The Curse of Brotherhood almost entirely ditches the free form drawing that made up the core of its predecessor, opting instead to streamline its mechanics and add a significant amount of cinematic flair, coming together in a far more focused, inspired, and varied experience.Though it is still referred to as a marker, Max’s tool of choice has been reworked into a powerful instrument with which you can now control various elements in order to help Max traverse through levels. The implementation of this still bares a resemblance to Max’s marker of old, allowing you a small amount of freedom to direct elements into specific shapes and paths, but it’s far more natural and embedded in the experience than before and works well within the constraints of a controllers precision, rarely requiring a great deal of precision and only occasionally imposing any sort of time limit.The Curse of Brotherhood has rather obviously been designed so as to rarely frustrate the player, or tax them with tricky platforming segments or puzzles, and this simplicity and hand holding is in some ways a bit tedious when the answer is almost always immediately apparent, but overall I actually found the breezy pace rather refreshing. It allowed me to appreciate the gorgeous environments and enjoyably cliched story without many threats or pauses as I got stuck. It provides just enough stimulation to remain engaging, but is accessible enough that it’s a game I could feel confident recommending to a younger player or a parent wanting to play with their child (which is a disappointingly low number of games).At around 4-5 hours it’s a fairly brisk adventure, but I never felt as if something was cut or missing, nor did any moment feel like needless filler. Every segment is interesting and important to the game, and this consistency and constant variety makes it easy to wind up playing through the entire thing in but a few sittings. That’s not a slight against the game by any means, but a complement to its excellent pacing and inspired level design.The handful of moments that stand out as poor in my mind are actually those near the end which begin to ask more of the player than before, and the slightly awkward controls have a bit of trouble keeping up. The end boss fight also proved the most disappointing part of the game, with an uninspired encounter that ups the difficulty just enough to be frustrating and would have ended the game on a rather lackluster note had it not been for the charming cutscene immediately following.It’s probably an understatement to say I was rather taken aback by how much I ended up enjoying The Curse of Brotherhood. Its beautiful scenery pulled me in, and the leisurely platforming and puzzle solving kept me there throughout an experience that continued to surprise me the further I got in. Some may scoff at the low difficulty, but in terms of simple fun and creativity I haven’t played something quite as nice for too long.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. "

												Max: The Curse of Brotherhood has been a pleasing experience on the eyes. I got sick over the weekend and wanted something childish to entertain myself. And this game has ""children game"" screaming all over it.That being said, it reminded me of the days when I was young, and we were stuck infront of the TV trying to solve donkey kong levels and crash bandicoots. This game is like a mixture of those old games and Trine where you need to ""draw"" things to help solve the different levels.I was a little intimidated by having to jump around and draw at the same time, however any moment where you're in action. (Like running from a giant child-eating monster) and have to draw a rope, or a bridge, or something the time slows down. It's still challenging enough that I mess up and die a few times, but easy enough that I could easily see this being one of the first games a child tries to play.I had quite a few good laughs on Max's behalf, his animations were lovely. You could crawl through narrow spaces, but if you didn't do it soon enough you'd hit Max's big head. I giggled. Several times. As Max hit his head, fell down, got stuff thrown ontop of him as he moaned, complained and cried.Pick this up on the next sale! It's worth the few hours :) Only a pity the developing company got bought by another company that isn't focusing on PC games. I'd love to see more stuff from these guys!			"

												A game that will make you smile, one of those 'feel good' games.The game is about two brothers, Felix is the one that gets pulled into a mysterious world after his brother cast a spell to get rid of him. Max(you) in disbelieve as to what happened quickly decides to follow his brother in an attempt to rescue him.  The game starts of slowly introducing each mechanic one at the time, the pacing is excellent. You can control natural elements(on fixed positions) within the game world with your magic marker. This is required to get to the end of the level, which are designed very well and look very good in terms of graphics. The puzzles that you need to solve are also well done... though they are not that challenging, but remain fun for players of all skill levels. I like the super hard ones but found myself enjoying this and even getting stuck on some. Having me say to myself when i find the solution ""why did i not see that earlier"" ,which actually makes me feel dumb instead of smart when i solve it... There are also hidden items with levels and ""eyes"" that you can collect. All your character can do is jump and use the magic marker, so be aware that there is no combat is this game. Though there are ways to kill creatures. It has high quality cinematics and excellent voice acting to go along with it. If you like adventure platformers with some lite puzzles definitely consider this one.+High quality cinematics+Voice acting+Puzzles+Fun for all ages+Interesting platforming+Just the right length (6-7 hours gameplay) +Great visuals			"

												As a fan of the puzzle platformer genre, I couldn't figure out what rubbed me the wrong way about this game. Many major design elements are well done. There are optional puzzles requiring more innovative solutions that result in their own achievements. There's also a steady build in your abilities as you advance. Yet I stopped playing about a third of the way through, and I didn't have much of a desire to continue.The missing element is player ingenuity. I'm not personally a fan of entirely linear puzzles. I like games where I can develop a strategy on the fly. Some of my favorites in this genre are Mark of the Ninja, Trine 1/2 and Gunpoint. Those games are characterized by an ability of the player character which the game does not guide you in how to use. It only makes opportunities to use it available. I like the lego set mentality of game design. ""Here's a really cool thing with something you could build, but do whatever you want with it.""To me, a magic marker that changes the play environment promises a whole lot of player experimentation, but there isn't any. Every puzzle, every movement you make, is completely linear. It's pre-determined, and there's no alternate way to solve it. The abilities can only be used on pre-marked 'ability areas' that provide the solution to the puzzle. The puzzles are not difficult. I found myself fighting the controls more often than an intellectual challenge. In the end, it's like playing an FPS where every really cool kill you get automatically switched your weapon, highlighted your target, and all you had to do was click. The rest of the time you just proceed where the directional arrow tells you to.I think the game doesn't deliver on its promise of a magic marker in that respect. There's still quite a bit to be enjoyed here if the completely linear aspect doesn't bother you. The animation is great. I found the controls a little clunky but hardly unusable. Some of the puzzles are entertaining even if not hard, and the story is almost worth playing through in itself. Gameplay is king though, and I wanted something that would beg for a second playthrough just so I could change things a different way the next time.			"

												Unless you were a younger sibling you are going to deny it. Those pesky younger siblings just get in the way of your fun time always wanting to be in your way. So some of us can relate to poor Max when he types into Giggle …” how to make my brother go away”! Since this is a videogame and not real life it ACTUALLY happens and Felix gets sucked into another world. It up to Max to save him. It is his fault after all…..Artwork and Voice Acting This game look gorgeous even on my laptop which has poor specifications. On a better powered system this game would look amazing. The voice work was a treat to the ears and had a lot of personality to it. Max sounds like a cocky young kid and some of his lines are funny. Felix sounds…. whiny, our villain sounds campy and old lady sounds… old and wise.

GameplayThe game mechanic is the use of a marker to solve many puzzles over several chapters to save Felix. I didn’t have this issue but I feel I should mention it. Some players may prefer keyboard and mouse controls as the puzzles get complex to draw for better accuracy. The checkpoints in this game are generous. For the longer time based sections, the slow motion transitions give the player more than enough time to get drawing.For the most part, especially in earlier stages, the solution seems easy. However, your success at progressing is going to depend on several things: getting your drawings right, angles, precision and speed which becomes more obvious with game progression. What this puzzle platformer gets right, which some games fail at, is getting the difficulty spike just right. It introduces more elements and intricate puzzles at an even pace so you don’t feel frustrated and overwhelmed at any point.After a long journey to get to the big boss the final fight left me feeling “is that it?”. However, on reflection I remembered that this is a family friendly puzzle platformer and if it was too hard it might be a problem. And I also realised he’s called mustacho…. MUSTACHO!! Ultimately I decided this is all about the journey so I decided to let this one go in the end.ConclusionFor the gamers who like to collect or gain achievements there is some extended play in this. I consider this an essential  purchase if you like cute family puzzle platformer This game is on frequent sale  at the 75% mark which having played this is criminal. After playing this I would of payed a lot more. Make sure to grab it in a sale if it’s your cup of tea or at least try the demo out…. "

												Dear Potential Buyer, do you have a sibling? If yes, GET THIS GAME. JUST BUY IT. Ask questions later. If no, GET THIS GAME ANYWAY JUST BECAUSE.Max is a wonderful game. I cannot recommend it enough. Its exhilarating and absolutely fun. I cannot stress enough how fun this game is.It starts off pretty chill and mellow, allowing you to get a handle on things. You have an infinite about of chances to carry on from your previous self-saving checkpoint (which is throughout several places in the game) so you don't ever have to go back and redo and entire portion of the game itself, this also applies when you exit and re-enter the game. Once you get further into the game, your item (a marker) gets better and the puzzles become a lot more complex, but not too much that its frustrating. There's no 'one' way to solve a particular puzzle, sometimes you can just get really creative with it and see how far that gets you.YOU HAVE A MAGIC MARKER WHICH AIDS YOUR QUEST. A MAGICAL MAGIC MARKER! DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THE HIDDEN PUN IN THIS GAME? Bloody hell. I love this idea of an actual magic marker. You're going to love it as well, it gets the neatest little upgrades as your progress and you even use it as a flashlight ._.The controls are simple af, its so simple that you can actually play this on your laptop, with your touchpad and you'd still manage through this game without much of a sweat. Additionally, the graphics are amazing and it flows so well. Its like you're in a little cartoon with such an interesting plot!That's not to say that this game is easy peasy. Going through this, the game makes having fun more important than the difficulty of challenges. Most you will find easy af while others will take some time (and dying) to get through.I could go on forever about this game, but fear not! I won't. I snagged this game while it was on sale and its something I will never regret (and I am picky af when it comes to games). Its definitely worth getting. Even if you're not into platformers, I can guarantee that this game will leave you feeling satisfied. Give it shot. You won't regret it.			"

												This was a fun platformer with a cool draw/erase mechanic to help you overcome some of the physics puzzles in the game. It also reminds me very much of the style of cartoon animation used in such shows as Jimmy Neutron. Looks very much like shows such as that.The game itself features you, Max, trying to save your little brother from an evil scientist-y guy while avoiding his massive monster henchman, various obstacles, and so on along the way.The gameplay was fairly seamless and this game was very well done in my opinion. The backdrops/scenery was beautifully rendered, and the animations were spot on. The puzzles, whether run and jump, draw and erase, or whatever, were not too challenging, but also never were boring. I really cant find any flaws with this game, except that maybe the story was a bit lite, but then again, it is set up like a cartoon, so that really isnt surprising necessarily.All told, I give this game an 8 out of 10. It wasnt amazing, but it was really well done regardless.			"

I no doubt spent many more hours than most, but I obtained all achievements today. Spending time searching for all of Mustacho's eyes and pieces of the amulet was well spent. Overall, the game is extremely fun, with great cartoony graphics and platforming and puzzles that won't drive you crazy.

												Max: The Curse of Brotherhood is the sequel and Max & the Magic Marker.  This time around it's a 2.5D experience of Max trying to rescue the brother he accidentally wished would disappear.  This time the magic marker can only be used in specific locations and can only draw specific types of aids for Max to accomplish his goals (i.e. water, vines, raise platforms, etc...).  There is less freedom than in the last game, but that doesn't stop this game from being a great game.  The levels are well set up to allow for good puzzles to be solved and for the platforming portion of the game to be somewhat difficult at times where timing is everything.  The graphics are beautiful and the sounds and voice acting is perfect for this type of game.  Great fun for kids and adults.			"

7.5/10""Jumpin' Max with the MagicMarker.""Max is a 3D side-scrolling puzzle jump'n'run with a great variety and very nice graphics. The story starts that Max is angry with his little brother & therefor decides to try a little spell on him - which actually works. The quest is to rescue your little brother from the monsters of an imagination world. At first you have the feeling this is a cute platformer with easy known puzzles for children (age 6+)...BUT as the puzzle learning curve climbs fast, Max has something new to offer for everyone at every age.  =>Don't be fooled by the 1st chapter! (It's like the easy tutorial...)Pros:+ great variety (slow&fast scenes)+ great checkpoint/auto-saves+ good gameplay+ good atmosphere+ good graphics+ good controls+ good sound&ost+ good puzzles (learning curve)+ good difficulty (starting @2nd chapter)+ okay story+ cut scenes+ no TRINE clone+ X360 controller support+ a lot controller rumbleNote: only at the 1st chapter ""too familiar puzzler"" feeling!Cons:- none- no trading cards(- no coop feature)A very good, slow&fast puzzle platformer with a story about the responsibilities of brotherhood.

												Relaxing and enchanting, with excellent controls.  (And occasional moments of frantic timing).Max is beautifully animated, with a stronger focus on puzzles than platforming;  in most areas you're constructing your own ""platforms"" made of earth, branches, vines or (the most fun) water, in order to progress.The world has fixed points where you can spawn the different items by ""drawing"" them with your magic marker.  This does mean that typically there's only a single approach to a problem, but it keeps the game flowing nicely; you're unlikely to be stuck for too long on an area, and if you are the checkpoints are very forgiving.  (Getting the optional collectible amulet parts  can involve a little more head scratching).An extra element is added as  branches and vines can be detached from their spawn point and then dragged (or rolled if you managed to draw a circle) around.As a platformer, it's naturally made for the gamepad.  However, I'm playing it with both gamepad and mouse - the mouse really helps when drawing platforms to get the right shape/curve. As you can't move when drawing in any case, the switching between mouse and gamepad is seamless - great work by the devs.			"

												It's rare, but sometimes it happens to stumble upon a little known game and then discover that it's a proper hidden gem.The title is a platform game with mild puzzles which tastes and smells like a pixar cartoon, very neat, polished and funny, very good entertainment.Nothing here is astonishing, it is no masterpiece, it's just a lovely game to play.Enjoy			"

												8/10 -One of the best platformers out there. This one drew me in from it's art style to it's way of solving puzzles. You get this marker which you can raise platforms, create vines, branches, water waves and more. Not only can you create these things but you can actually draw, cut, pull and push them...like if you wanted to make a circle out of a branch, cut it and then let it roll down a hill you can. It makes really unique and interesting puzzles you won't see anywhere else. This game may seem like a kids game because of it's story but don't let that turn you off from playing it.			"

												Very enjoyable physics-based puzzle platformer. The graphics are well done and the puzzles can be downright tricky at times. Ingenuity and timing are both important--neither of which I possess in great quantities, but I still find the game playable. I play with an Xbox One controller--I imagine using a keyboard would be much more difficult.Collecting all of the items and secrets is much more challenging than I had anticipated as well, giving this game a nice layer of added (optional) difficulty.I rarely play platformers through to the end, but this is one of the few games I'll play to completion. Very enjoyable game. If you're debating this one, I recommend purchasing it!			"

												This game in a word is... fun. The story is charming and brilliantly narrated. It has  imaginative levels & Max has some very creative specail abilities.  It's atmospheric, and the game feels very well produced and polished...as if Pixar has been working on it.  Of course, it's not Dark Souls when it comes to difficulty, but so what. This is a different game. It's not designed to frustrate you. It has good puzzles, some deaths, and plenty of suprises, but not to the point where you'll throw you're gamepad away.  I played this game with my eight year old daughter and we both loved it. It's an excellent choice for a family friendly game, but not by any means saccharine.  If you're looking for some good classic gaming fun in a modern 2D platformer go for this. At the price they are selling it for it's an absolute bargain.			"

												♥♥♥♥ing epic, man. The♥♥♥♥♥♥you will pull off in this game is exhilarating. The levels have great verticality, and the vine swinging, oh man that vine swinging. So much of it! And over many vast, vast expanses of open air. Whether it be climbing up the side of towers or plummeting over massive waterfalls, you will have lots and lots of fun. The magic marker mechanic is fun, the highlight being branch+vine creation (and destruction - you can chop off branches/vines from their source to reach higher/lower places). It's the most flexible, figure-it-out-yourself of all the elements you can manipulate, versus the earth pillars, which are fun, but very specific and limited. The player movement controls are precise. You won't find yourself overstepping platforms very often. The dynamic camera definitely carries some of the epicness of the game, and it's still very effective in letting you see what you need to see. There were two moments when I wish, after zooming out to get a large view of a room, it would zoom in a little sooner so I could control my character with more precision, but it never caused any problems. Overall a great feature.The tone of the game is silly and childish. The characters are very stock, but that doesn't detract from the experience at all. The tone (plus the enemies in particular) remind me a lot of Rayman 2. The voice acting and music are all good, and the art/scenery is nice. Not sure how long it took me to beat the campaign the first time, but overall it took me 14 hours to complete the story, grab all the collectibles, get all the achievements, and then go back and complete every level without dying (a really fun challenge - you even get little badges to show for it). The puzzles aren't exactly hard, but there were a couple that had me scratching my head for a couple minutes. It's definitely more constant satisfaction than frequent perplexity. You could argue that the game is shallow, in a ""little investment of skill or emotion"" kind of way, and that would be true for the most part, but there's nothing wrong with that, if you don't mind that kind of thing. It's an Indiana Jones, not a Moby♥♥♥♥♥♥ and that's ok. Max: The Curse of Brotherhood is great fun, epic, and satisfying. I look forward to replaying the game (and hopefully a sequel) in the future.

												Max: The Curse of the Brotherhood is a pretty slick puzzle platformer. It's well animated with good cut scenes, the graphics look good, and it's very nicely voiced too. The first Max and the Magic Marker game was pretty good, but this is a vast improvement. Instead of drawing items while making sure you have enough ink to do so, all marker actions are context specific and ink management is no longer a concern, which makes the puzzles a lot tighter with a specific solution, but also more enjoyable because you'll always have the right amount of ink to find the correct solution to each puzzle/obstacle.You don't need to play the first game at all to enjoy the Curse of the Brotherhood, so feel free to skip the first game entirely. The plot of this game doesn't tie in with the first much at all, and closely resembles the 1986 David Bowie film ""Labyrinth"", in which an older sibling asks the goblin king (in the case of Max, he goes on the internet and asks an old man with a mustache... creepy) to take his/her younger brother away, and when it actually works he/she has to go into a fantasy land to save him.I played Max on a laptop and tried a number of input methods, the best by far I found to be using an Xinput compatible controller (I used an FC30 Pro, but any Xbox style controller should do the job). Touch screen wasn't usable which was pretty disappointing, and though the mouse trackpad did work, some time-sensitive actions were impossible to carry out using the trackpad. A regular mouse would probably be fine, but the controller has the advantage of the magic marker snapping-to on the nearest interactive object, and continuous direction by holding down the analogue stick, which is important in the later levels where you have to raise yourself up on high platforms quite quickly.8/10 - Worth marking in your wishlist if you like puzzle platformers "

												I'm suprised Max: The Curse of Brotherhood is not widely mentioned, as it is fun little game.It's supposed to be a sequel to Max and the Magic Marker, which I didn't play. But it is not a big loss. Out of couriosity I checked the other game on YouTube and my conclusion is, that developers where toying with the idea before delivering the real deal which is Curse of Brotherhood. And I'm suprised it didn't get the hype and reach as wide as Ori and the Blind Forest, as both are released by Microsoft studios.The kid named Max, who got rid of his brother via magic spell that he found on the internet. His brother Felix is captured through portal into another wolrd and Max jumps right after him realizing the consequences of his action. From now on you control Max, who get to use a magic marker. A simple item that let's you solve the puzzles throughout the game mixed with platforming. The marker allows you draw rock pillars, branches, lianes, water geysers at certain spots leaving you to figure out how to do it to proceed further or solve the puzzles. Not all of it will be available from the beginning, but as it is straight-forward side-scroller, there won't be any backtracking.Now, I need to mention that I play with my X360 controller and I have no idea how the game works with keyboard control. As for the gamepad it felt very smooth, both for controling Max and drawing stuff with the marker. Smooth and nice graphic won't obscure anything and light tutorial won't leave you clueless as to how to interact with objects. You will be able to draw Os from branches, cut them by the base and use it as an object you can climb onto. Some enemies apart from hazzards also serve as a solution to the puzzle. You also have to combine marker's abilities. All of that is explained in the game so you know how, but thankfully doesn't serve as a guide. The difficulty of the puzzles is various however. Normaly you'll be able to go through with very brief moments of reflection. Sometimes you may be stuck for longer, but never long enough to make you frustrated. Colorful and childish theme of the game may suggest it is for younger players and I encourage them to try it.There are collectibles in the game, but they serve no other purpose, than to chill your eventual OCD. There are evil eyes to collect and these may be placed in the areas that will take you longer to figure acces to. There are also pieces of the amulet of the Old Lady (she's kinda guiding you through the magic land), much harder to get. The main problem with it, is that the camera is very stiff and concetrated on Max. Sometimes you may be able to spot evil eye somewhere on the corner of the screen, but getting some of them requies leap of faith. The artstyle is simple but gorgeous, there is also superb voice-acting, a bit unexpected from a small game. Normally I play on my PC connected to 32"" LED TV so I can enjoy the graphics of such colorful games. However, considering the overall quality of the graphics it shouldn't struggle on older gear, but it does. I own 8GB RAM Laptop with 1GB RAM graphics card and quad core processor and had huge problem with cutscenes. I got the sound without visuals or got it with miserable framerate. No struggles on a PC, though.As Max: The Curse of Brotherhood is puzzle-platformer, have in mind it will play different than a straight-forward platformer. It is not very demanding game, there's a free demo available on Steam, that I would reccomend to try out first before buying the full game. It was fun for me.7/10			"

												This game is a whole lot of fun... a fast paced platformer game that works best with a controller (Xbox or Logitech). I use my Logitech F310 and I find it works excellent with this game. The only downside is the marker is a bit cumbersome and a bit of a downside in this game. So what I find myself doing is using the controller and my mouse (to use the marker). At any rate, the graphics are nicely done and well rendered. The pace is good... at times it can be fast and others you'll slow down just to think about what to do. One moment drawing out branches, and the next trying to run from an enemy. A real well detailed platformer with good music, soundeffects and a nice atmosphere. The marker feature can be cumbersome for some, but it isn't an issue for me. Even if I use both a controller and a mouse for this game (that just seems easier and quicker for me when I need to do so). So far I've just made it to the 2nd stage, and from what I've read it gets a lot more difficult. Definitely a game I would recommend... the price point at $14.99 isn't high for a game like this (though I did buy it 75% off). So a definite recommend from me if you like well paced platformers.

												Such a cool game. I'm not a huge fan of the drawing, but, this game looks great, has hella tight controls, and is just a joy to play. It's a platformer, with superb control, nice grafics, and a really weird element, where you solve puzzle-like sections, by using a marker, to draw or undraw things. I have mixed feelings on that part, but, ultimatly, it's what set's this game apart from so many other similar games. However, the spot-on control, alone, was enough to sell me straight away. Unlikely you will be dissapointed by this game. I made 2 Let's play videos (maybe more by now?) Of levels 1-1 though 1-5. Feel free to have a look! :)

												Max: The Curse of Brotherhood is a truly enjoyable platformer.  The artwork is stunning; as are the model designs, textures, and animation.  The ambient audio, music, and voice acting are all wonderful.  The level design is, for the most part, innovative and challenging; occasionally erring on the side of either too difficult or too easy.  The story is interesting, even if simple, and the main character is quite likable.The game isn't perfect, however.  First, the story and world are shamelessly similar in concept to Limbo.  The oracle and villain characters are as generic and unsophisticated as can be and, aside from the one boss, the game has only one baddie.  Also, the control mechanics are extremely challenging; whether you go with a keyboard and mouse or brave the controller.Even with its problems, Max is worth every penny I spent on it and every moment I spent playing it.  I recommend it highly.			"

If you finish the game, you'll be like ""wow I completed the game and collected all the stuff now what? "" Uninstall it is. Anyways, best platform game I've ever played, yes better than Super Mario.			"

 Max: Curse of the Brotherhood is a puzzle platform adventure, which is heavy on a cinematic style, action-rich sequences and gives you a little bit of freedom on how to solve the puzzles. A good and enjoyable game overall, the overly simplistic story and minor technical flaws prevent it from being anything greater. What I liked:+ action-rich and cinematic opening+ beautiful 2.5 D level design+ awesome world and monsters+ animations very well done+ good music+ decent savepoints, but sometimes unfairly BEFORE an unskippable cutscene+ marker not only for puzzles, but as a flashlight+ physic puzzles of sweeping away bug+ fancy slow-motion puzzles+ use of cage to solve puzzles+ 6 hours playtime, just rightWhat I didn't like:- puzzle solutions obvious, I wish I could draw whatever, wherever- no rebindable keys!- the marker is way too big- alt+tab lead to instabilities- no sensitivity adjustment- pillars can't be adjusted, have to be redrawn- exploding tiny creates annoying and unnecessary- cutscene not triggered- puzzles sometimes very fiddly- most of the puzzles are very obvious- story foreseeable and very stereotypicalVerdict: Wait for a sale. Max: Curse of the Brotherhood is a puzzle adventure plattformer I liked most for its very cinematic 2.5 D artstyle and it's heavy cinematic style. However, the supposed freedom you had for solving the puzzles only lead to minor variances in solving the puzzles. Rarely you get the chance to come up with truly something of your own. Additionally technical annoyances like the inability to adjust the mouse sensitivity in the options and non-skippable cutscenes in addition to the stereotypical story of ""bad guy captures person you love, find and defeat him"" prevent this game from being anything exceptional.6 hours			"

												Do you remember when Andy lost his dog Whiskey 1998. in ""Heart of darkness""? If you do you're probably not a kid any more. The time has come to take on another similar quest. This time you are going to save your annoying brother Felix. Max the curse of brotherhood is fantastic looking puzzle platformer for everyone from 6 to 106 years. It may look like a kids game but it is actually for everyone because of nicely dosed difficulty. Reminds me also of another game I adore -"" Limbo"". In the beginning it is a bit on a easy side and at the end it gets little bit hard. Most of the game is just right. It will take about 11 hours to complete 20 levels and that too is just right. Your only weapon (beside your wits) is magic marker with 5 magic abilities: ground elevation, branches, wines, air flow and flame balls. You use magic marker to resolve greatly conceived platform puzzles. Puzzles are just challenging enough for maximum joy without much frustration. As I come from 20 years of console gaming my default setup on Steam is Xbox 360 controller. It held it's own until the last segments of the game when it became impossible to control magic marker with speed and precision needed. Not to worry. When this occurs you grab your mouse for marker control and all is well again.You'll feel omnipotent with controller in one and mouse in another hand :-) Or just play on keyboard and mouse - maybe that is even better, I haven't tried. If you have any interest in this type of games buy this and enjoy. It is just as good as ""Limbo"" or ""Heart of darkness"".			"

												Max: The Curse of Brotherhood is a truly enjoyable platformer.  The artwork is stunning; as are the model designs, textures, and animation.  The ambient audio, music, and voice acting are all wonderful.  The level design is, for the most part, innovative and challenging; occasionally erring on the side of either too difficult or too easy.  The story is interesting, even if simple, and the main character is quite likable.The game isn't perfect, however.  First, the story and world are shamelessly similar in concept to Limbo.  The oracle and villain characters are as generic and unsophisticated as can be and, aside from the one boss, the game has only one baddie.  Also, the control mechanics are extremely challenging; whether you go with a keyboard and mouse or brave the controller.Even with its problems, Max is worth every penny I spent on it and every moment I spent playing it.  I recommend it highly.			"

												Very nice game. I love how it's so similar to Trine. The beautiful graphics really makes you appreciate the game a lot. At $3.75, I think it was worth okay. It took me 5 hours to complete the game so it didn't really hit the $0.50 per hour mark.PROS1. GraphicsFantastic. I love the foreground/background effects. E.g. The Monster carrying Felix away.2. Water StreamsLoved it. Like a water log ride at the amusement park except in all directions. I would have loved more long water stream combos.3. PuzzlesSome of puzzles got me stumped for a while or made me assume it was supposed to be done some other way. It was extremely fun and funny to pause on a kid's game.4. The MonsterI don't know why. It seems to resemble the monsters from Critters, yet I loved it. Too bad it died in the lava.CONS1. Missing Reappearing MarkerThe marker automatically disappears the moment you start moving and reappears the moment you pause. This on and off behaviour is very annoying as it makes it hard to gauge the marker's appearance.2. Collecting Amulet/Eyes is WorthlessIt's just an achievement. You don't even get anything impressive. It's not even for more fun.3. Incomplete Story?When the game ended and I saw the concept ideas, I was surprised to see dragons, underground lairs, gear movements, Smile Town residents and even strange forest critters. They looked great and I was hoping to see them within the game. Not having them gave me a feeling of missing out on so many interesting things that the developer could be doing.			"

												Bought this yesterday and played it once it was downloaded.Fabulous game: gorgeous, colourful graphics, super-smooth and reactive gameplay, controls that are simple to master quickly, a fun storyline... and enormous fun. It's an incredibly 3D platform game that has everything you could want. Death-defying leaps, swinging on ropes, collapsing platforms, rope-bridges, puzzles, monsters that try to eat you, attack you or explode on you... And there's a fresh element: you can magically alter some parts of the environment. Raise a platform up higher to reach another level. Raise three platforms to create a bridge. And more...Can't wait to play some more.10/10			"

												This game is SO. MUCH. FUN. When I started playing it, I just kept going for hours. For some reason I stopped, then I came back to it about a year later and I just finished it. I had a blast playing this game. It is an interesting and beautiful platformer.  Some of the puzzles make you think, but its not frustratingly difficult. Yes children could probably play this game, but I did not find it 'too easy'. I reccommend it to all ages. The levels are very well designed and there can be replayability if your memory doesnt work like mine and you come back to it a few years later ! There are also 'evil eyes' and 'amulet pieces' to find in the levels so it keeps you on your toes. Very lovely game, I know I will be coming back to play it in the future.			"

												This will be a mixed review; by one side I am enjoying it (currently going through the second chapter) but by the other I cannot recommend it except for a very specific public, and at a discount price (about 5€, 14€ are excessive)TL;DR: It can be summarized as a tablet game with superb graphics. Oddly enough, it seems that it would be best suited for touchscreens (you ""draw"" columns of rock, branches, etc. to advance) yet it appears it has always been a PC/Console game.Pros:* Graphics are very good for a platformer, both for character movements and for cutscenes.* Movements are swift.* Plot is simple, but ok.Cons:* Too simple: just keep moving, everywhere where you need to ""draw"" something is clearly visible in the game so you need almost no thinking.* Control: you move with keyboard and, when you get to a place where you have to ""draw"" something, you have to position your mouse again. Not an issue when you are not in a hurry, but sometimes the baddies are pursuing you. As I said, this game would have made lots more of sense in a touchscreen.So? If you find it discounted (5€-6€) and you sometimes like simple games to have some relaxing playtime, it may be a good purchase. If not, probably it is not what you are looking for.			"

												Max: The Curse of Brotherhood was an extraordinarily enjoyable puzzle platformer. I had relatively high expectations going in due to the number of positive reviews on steam, and I'm glad those expectations were met and then some. I hardly knew anything about this game going in, and I assume that helped.Pros:- Awesome, solid gameplay! I enjoyed all the puzzle solving you had to do in this game. The mechanics were so simple but gratifying and fun. I never got bored playing this. You grow what you need and in what shape.- Straightforward, innocent plot. The game didn't take itself too seriously or too over the board ridiculous. It was a happy medium involving a story about a boy going to save his brother.- Length. It ran about 7 hours, which I think is a wonderful length for this type of game.- The look of everything was pleasing to the eye.Cons:- I'm really having a hard time thinking of a con for this game. It really was everything I expected! I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys solving puzzles and fun side scroller platforming!The closest thing to a jump scare you'll find in this game is the occasional tentacle thing popping out that you don't expect. This game isn't scary at all.			"

												The game LOOKS fantastic. The basic platforming is adequate. The real attraction of this game is the magic marker, which works SORT OF (very big emphasis on ""sort of"") like Okami in that it lets you draw things into reality that you can use to overcome obstacles.The magic marker is an interesting idea that is not very interesting in execution. You can only draw lines when and where the game has predetermined that you are able to draw lines. And you have no control over the kind of thing that you draw, because the game decides that too. It is literally like the game saying, ""Now you will draw a vine right here."" And you do, because that's all you CAN do. That, in a nutshell, is how the magic marker works. Sometimes there are situations that are somewhat puzzling, but the game always gives away the solution by having the blabbermouth protagonist just flat out tell you how to do it.The thing that really turned me off on it, though, and decide that I wasn't going to play it anymore, is the way the game spams the abitrary ""think fast"" type situations. I would have been fine playing it to completion if it were just a sort of platforming adventure with some magic marker puzzles. But as you are making your way through a level, the game likes to suddenly throw a random ""think fast"" hazard at you, where you have to figure out what you need to do to avoid the hazard in just a few seconds or die and go back to the previous checkpoint. These are made worse by the way the game hijacks and repositions the camera to show you the incoming hazard, so you are also disoriented in addition to needing to think fast. And there is an element of these ""think fast"" hazards being completely arbitrary, because sometimes the glowing objects you can use via your magic marker don't even APPEAR until the instant the ""think fast"" hazard appears. This results in most of these moments feeling ill-considered and frustratingly punitive. You know the kind. The trial-and-error, die-repeatedly-until-you-guess-what-the-developer-wants-you-to-right-here type of rigamarole. Apparently most players who picked up this title are cool with it, but it is a HUGE pet peeve of mine. I have very little tolerance for it.In the end it is a beautiful looking game with adequate platforming, a draw mechanic that is an interesting idea but not very interesting in execution, and (in this player's opinion) a sorry overuse of arbitrary ""think fast"" moments and chase/forced-momentum sequences.There is some good to be found here, but it just tends to overuse too many things that are not to my taste and completely turn me off, so I probably will not finish it.Final verdict:7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.6) A good game that is worth the full price.5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.4) A fairly good game, but I'd recommend buying it discounted.3) Not great, but a few redeeming qualities. Only buy if heavily discounted.2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.1) Avoid at all costs.			"

												The game has the exact same artstyle as a pixar movie which is kind of... awkward... but anyway, the game is a fun and enjoyable platformer with a magic marker added in as a unique element. For a indie game this has far better graphics and sounds than the usual, or so I thought until I did some research and discovered that the studio has been bought by microsoft. As such, this is not an indie game and cannot be compared with indie games. Taking this into consideration, I have to evaulate this game as being an unpopular and underrated platformer AAA game.			"

												Starts off fine, then the rubbish control system becomes unfair and frustrating.  You get killed because your magic pen has to be located first and then placed in the correct position to work, giving your enemy plenty of time to reach you.  When split second timing is everything the controls have to be flawless.  The stupid devs who wrote the code forgot the number one rule of gaming - when we fail it should be our fault, not their clumsy unintuitive gameplay system.			"

												Other than game not unlocking  and having to look on forums to find a fix, once that was fixed i played it even more i got sucked into the game. The last time i really enjoyed a side scroll game like this was back when I 1st starting playing the Commander Keen series back in the 90's which yet i haven't had a chance to get on steam. This game at some points do become a little challenging where you have to act fast and sometimes do it over a couple of times. The graphics are pretty good using the Unity3d engine which I know from creating 3d objects for a 3d VR chat/build environment called ActiveWorlds. If you are looking for a fun game to play than this game is for you. Game seems to run smooth, game seems to be well balanced as well. Also wouldn't be a bad idea for the developers to add modding for custom levels and put in a workshop so others can download other's levels,etc. that would bring this game to a higher level. Would I pay full price for this? well yes if I had the money all the time to buy things full price. I bought this game on the last sale that was running. Even the wife thinks this game is pretty cool with the magic marker.			"

												An entertaining little puzzle-platformer of the kind that doesn't seem to get made much anymore. This reminded me in particular of the Playstation game Heart of Darkness, not that I expect anybody to recognize that name. The game has simple physics-based puzzles and gets a lot of mileage out of this concept, but wisely stops before the concept becomes tedious. Hidden items to find in each level and badges for completing each level without dying give a little replay value.			"

												 As you progress through the game you will gain abilities to interact with your enviroment via a magic marker. Unfortunatelly you are very limited to what and where you can create those, and there is pretty much only one way to solve the puzzles. To make things worse, the solutions are usually obvious. Which is all too bad because it is a pretty looking game. Rating: heard about sharpies that went to magical places before, but this is the first time I hear about a marker that is magic itself. Recommendation: for casual and younger players. http://pixelloot.com "

												Any downvotes I get are probably deserved because this is not a bad game overall, but I don't care because I just can't force myself to endure much more because it is just pure 100% trial and error, so it's basically just like watching a boring adventure game. There is no challenge, once you die then see how something is done then you should get it nearly 100% of the time on your second try. Also, checkpointing is some of the worst I've ever seen mainly because I don't think there is any. I had to exit the game to leave home then later came back and started up the game and had to redo an entire tedious level that personally I never wanted to see again, ever. It was just not fun in the slightest bit to have to do it again and I just felt super p-ssed off, and neither is a automated trial and error journey. If there is checkpointing in later levels, you would never know it because the game never shows a saving checkpoint icon like all other games do, so it's one of those ""well I better not exit the game or quit until I finish the entire tedious level"" type of games. I'm pretty sure levels have no checkpointing, but who cares.If it weren't like a Disney kids movie, I might play it some more. Then again probably not because of no checkpointing. Levels aren't horribly long, but with boring, automatic-win tedious levels with a seen it done before already drawing mechanic, I just can't force myself to care because it keeps putting me to sleep. Much more fun platformers exist if you look. They are more fun because they are infinitely more rewarding than this.I gave it a thumbs up because like I said at the beginning it is not a bad game mechanically, just mind numbingly tedious. I can't wait for each level to be over. zzzZZZzzzZZZ...			"

												Another of these somewhat buried platformers from a couple years back. This one happens to be exceptional. The nice thing on PC, compared to the consoles, is that we have native 4K here. Along with injected SMAA the image quality is two or three tiers better than anything I saw on the consoles, which were very jaggy and blurry.Don't get me wrong the visuals are still basic, but they are also on point and nicely detailed for the world that Max inhabits. This game has a tremendously old school vibe akin to Heart of Darkness from ages ago. I think people into platformers, and more or less that style of game, will dig this one too. It might turn off some people not quite used to the leisurely pace and childish exterior. The game picks up, though, and before you know it you will be finishing it as the later stages usually have two levels per world. Still, it's a decent 6-10 hour game.Thematically, it fits in perfectly with a slightly stylized realism that builds itself around somewhat realistic physics. The big draw here is obviously the marker, and you can do a decent variety of things throughout in your quest to save your brother. Drawing vines and branches along with raising rock platforms will be the major concepts in play. The puzzles range from easy to tough and the checkpoints are frequent enough so as to not ♥♥♥♥ you off too much.MGS and Press Play created a great game here, and it deserves to be played if you have the time. And even if you don't, this game lends itself to extremely short play sessions. There isn't anything out there quite like it so give it a try when you can.			"

												Nice little platformer which I very much enjoyed. The game reminded me about the cartoons that I used to watch as a kid, and I was actually quite impressed with how well the developers managed to carry this theme through. The game basicly nailed it, everything from the very basic storyline, the hero and the villain, the dumb evil forces, the big monsters, along with some very convicing voice acting, cartoony graphics, and its very fitting music.The game itself wasn't super hard, but it wasn't easy either. I am by no means a expert at platformers, and I am sure a lot of people would manage to get through the game with less deaths than I did. The game can be enjoyed by people of all ages, although younger kids might have a hard time at certain points in the game. I personally played the game with a controller, so I can't really speak for how it plays on a keyboard, but I found the controls easy to learn, and even the magic marker was easy getting used to.Pros:+ The magic marker added some very interesting mechanics to the game, that certainly made me think.+ Good pacing of game, with new mechanics being introduced through out the entire game.+ Lots of checkpoints, which is nice for people who are horrible at platformers like me.+ Achievements, and in-game collectables, which adds some replayability to the game.+ Most cinematics can be skipped, which is nice for a second playthrough+ The art style, the music, the cinematics, and the voice acting, all matched each other and was very well carried through. Which made for a very good experience. Cons:- The game has certain parts that require some fast thinking, and change of controls. This means that the game wont be playable for everybody, and that younger kids might not have a fun time. The many checkpoints however helps a great deal with this, so you will rarely have to start all over again, in case you die.			"

												Kind of reminds me of the good old PS1 platformers. Really pleasing aesthetic, beautiful views, comfy controls and really not much to argue about, except that the FPS sometimes visibly drops, though the game shows a steady 60. But that's the smallest complaint I could find. You buy a kids' platformer - you get a polished kids' platformer. That's the whole deal with this game.			"

												it's a 2.9D puzzle platformer, and the best-looking environments that I have ever played in. 2.9D? Well, it's a 2D platformer, rendered in full 3D, wiht a rotating camera the changes angle slightly depending on the scene, and it renders beautifully. I genuinely wish I had a 3D Screen of some kind to try this out with. Often times you will see a path leading off here or there, and you feel like you should be able to follow them, but they are no in the 2D space, and are purely cosmetic... awwww.It's a great looking game, it has a fairly simplistic, yet entertaining story line, it is just long enough that you can enjoy the immersion, yet don't get bored of the game or it's mechanics, and it has a few secrets that temp you to replay levels to find them.None of the puzzles are so difficult that you will need to look upa guide - at least I ddin't have to, I just had to sit there and think about it for a minute. I think there were about 5 puzzles that wern't immediately obvious, and 2 of them actually had boxes that you could use, but they looked like part of the environment. (just a quick heads-up). Also, a couple of the secrets you only realise are there because you fall/die and see them on the way down. There are many 'no return' areas, too - where once you go through this door, it slams behind you, or a moster wrecks the path, or you slide/fall and can't go back. So make sure an area is clear before you carry on.Voice acting is well done, story is simple, cute, but servicable. the magic marker can be a little hard to control on th eodd occasion, and it got me killed once or twice, but nothign that I would shoot the Dev's grandmother over :- ) Checkpoints are very forgiving.Great little game to burn a  few hours in.

The depth of details that the dev has put into the background is outstanding.The puzzle aspect of it. You have your easy moments. But you will come across one that you will scratch your head. But when you figure it out, you will see the genius minds that was put together for that puzzle. I was surprised how smart it was put together. This game is a must play.

The graphics are so smooth and playful! I would say that the checkpoint system is weird and that it lags here and there (mostly when you pull the marker out while moving at the same time). This is way too cool to see something so random evolve into a wonderful creation!			"

												This is a fun little game! You play as Max, who is trying to find his brother, wielding a magic marker with the power to create and manipulate objects in this puzzle-platformer. It's a mix of untimed puzzles, plus ones you have to do (sometimes literally) on the fly. Some of the puzzles require split-second timing where you're being chased, but parts that are super time-sensitive go into a slow-motion for a few seconds to allow you to quickly analyze the situation and act appropriately. They are (usually) very generous with checkpoints, so even if you're not so good at the platforming aspects (like me), you won't have far to go when you have to repeat a level. The magic marker mechanic is really well done, with you being able to adjust the height of pillars for jumping on, create different shapes out of branches for either jumping on or chopping down and using for other purposes, vines for swinging and climbing, water jets where you get to decide their path, and goodness, gracious great balls of fire for blowing up enemies and barriers.Pros:+ Good Music+ Good voice acting (I seriously felt bad for Max when he jumps into lava and screams in genuine agony)+ Good art (it has characters with a Jimmy Neutron feel but with great backgrounds)+ Novel mechanic (drawing/manipulating objects)+ Collectibles for added challenge+ Puzzles took thought but were not brain-breakingNeutral:~ Decent length, though I would have liked more. I got 11 hours out of it, including my bad platforming skills and a lot of redos, and finding all the collectibles. So, not super short, but I would have loved more.Cons:- The marker is not always at the ready, making it feel sluggish sometimes as you have to wait for it to appear for use. This doesn't affect the actual game play, since it's created with the sluggishness in mind, but it's a tad annoying at times. Likewise, the effect of your marker (e.g. lifting up a platform) doesn't always keep up with how fast you make it, with a similarly sluggish feel. Not a deal-breaker, since I still played the game to completion, including collectibles, but it was annoying.- This is not a con for me, but maybe for others: The puzzles aren't maddeningly difficult, as some people may prefer. A lot of the difficulty comes from the split-second timing, but the untimed puzzles take at most a few minutes to puzzle out.Overall: 9/10. Would replay. "

												A very pretty game, with a colorful and enticing universe. It's a platformer with a good atmosphere and some imagination. It's rather on the 'casual' side: it's very varied and not too difficult, which will make you feel like you're good at this game.Graphics: Great. Sometimes you feel like you're into an animation movie.Physics: Great. All objects behave, move and fall like you'd expect: boulders, vines, branches, roots, water and jets, ...Game mechanics: Good. You change objects from the scenery with your magical pen to reach your objectives (progress through a level, block enemies, succeed in an impossible jump, ...) You can only do so starting at a few select spots in every level.Gameplay: Good. It's dynamic, the setting changes often, so you'll have to find new ways to deal with the new challenges, and it's never feels repetitive or boring.Story/Dialogue/Voice acting: Good (nothing to write home about, but good)Level design: good to great (some good ideas, lots of imagination in some areas).Difficulty: never too difficult (At most you'll retry a couple of times before overcoming an obstacle, when you die you lose less than a minute of progression).Length: Short (about 7 hours to reach the end, a bit more to find all secrets in all levels). The progression is rather fast, so you'd have traveled a long way at the end of the game.All in all, a good game that kept me wanting for more to the very end.			"

												Wow.  I have to say, for a simple game it was quite complex.  The levels were well thought out and the puzzles were easy to medium in difficulty.  While there were no brain stumpers, the puzzles did require a bit of logical thinking to progress. The story was quite good considering there wasnt much of it.  The graphics were pleasant despite the lack of graphical options in the menu.  I enjoyed this game more than I thought that I would.  I originally downloaded the demo version to get a grasp on the difficulty of the puzzles before I purchased this for my kids.  After playing the first couple of levels, I was hooked.  So, I bought a copy for myself and one for my kids.  Hopefully they will enjoy it as much as I did.Overall I would give this game an 8.5/10...taking off points for graphic options and controls that were just a tad clunky during the timed sequences.  I would recommend this title to gamers of all ages.			"

												This game is a very good choice, if you like plattformer/puzzle genre.It is neither boring nor cloudy, however on some parts its freakin' difficult. Every riddle is solvable. Some of them are easier to get but others can be annoying. I started the game and after ~25% of the progress, the game unfolded its full nature. First of all, you can see the lovely graphics and surroundings, the brave hero named Max, who tries to free his little brother. Simple Story, reminds me a bit of ""Heart of Darkness"". Nevertheless, it is not just a copy. Every chapter has new Challanges and the game itself develops. You'll get a magic pen as a wepon and from chapter to chapter you will learn new abilitys concering to this pen.I did not play in one go, because I needed a break to prevent insanity. This game is awesome, but sometimes you will be very frustrated. Some Ideas may be the right ones, but thinking and doing is not the same progress. Technical aspects: I played it with a xbox controller, very good and accurate control. Ingame sound is okay, you'll hear screams of death quite a lot, so maybe you wont use ingame sound ;-) Simple settings, no problems with crashs/install etc.All in all, it is a very good game, beautiful and scary at once. Nice optic, good riddles and the best thing is to resist your frustration and solve everything without checking a let's play. That's the real challange!I bought it during the last sale, but full price is also worth it.Have fun!			"

												The VerdictA bright platformer is just what we needed on Xbox One and PC  Max: The Curse of Brotherhood’s vibrant setting and terrain-altering puzzles deliver. But the adventure doesn’t quite feel next-gen. With unintuitive controls, puzzle mechanics that’ve been done better elsewhere, and a story with the depth of a coloring book, it’s hard to stay invested in this short adventure.Using a giant marker to color your way through the puzzles of Max: The Curse of Brotherhood offers a great-looking and clever twist to the platforming genre. Well, it would if it weren’t so frustrating half the time. Once the novelty of drawing wears off, the curse we’re left with isn’t brotherhood, but awkward controls.I generally like the idea that I can make drawings to help solve platforming puzzles, even though it’s not as freeform as the concept implies. You get the marker early on, but before you do, climbing ladders and jumping over endless gaps as Max in the beautiful 2.5D environment gives you your first taste of the floaty controls. Cruelly, our little hero is a complete platforming pansy who can't even double-jump; one long-ish fall or hit from just about anything and he'll go down faster than that kid in Limbo. And he went down a lot. This game isn't as cuddly as it appears.New marker powers come at a nice pace though, and each one has its own vibrant chapter full of briefly interesting ways to use the mechanic. The water temple is dripping with clever puzzles that had me drawing spouts of water to create paths and making boats out of vines. The fire temple, on the other hand, is more of a thrilling race, where the marker helped me to quickly find an escape route from a fiery lava beast. Discovering new ways to utilize the power of the marker is entertaining, and each area offers some fun surprises.When I could get the marker working, successfully navigating Max through areas using vines, branches, and water spouts together to create a sort of mousetrap sequence was seriously satisfying. Some high-pressure levels towards the end where you’re outrunning lava are particularly epic as well.			"

												This is probably the best platformer game I've ever played.  You play Max, the big brother of Felix, who gets whisked away by a monster.  You have to find your way through several kinds of obstacles and environments to save him with the help of the powers in a magic marker.  Your marker gets new and different ""powers"" as you progress.The graphics, atmosphere, music and voice acting are superb.  Skill is required to use the controls but my favorite part of the game is having to think about how to solve the puzzles by using the powers in the right way.  The game has several levels and the replay value is enormous.  I'm in my third playthrough and I'm sure I'll be playing it many times in the future.			"

												Nice little platformer which I very much enjoyed. The game reminded me about the cartoons that I used to watch as a kid, and I was actually quite impressed with how well the developers managed to carry this theme through. The game basicly nailed it, everything from the very basic storyline, the hero and the villain, the dumb evil forces, the big monsters, along with some very convicing voice acting, cartoony graphics, and its very fitting music.The game itself wasn't super hard, but it wasn't easy either. I am by no means a expert at platformers, and I am sure a lot of people would manage to get through the game with less deaths than I did. The game can be enjoyed by people of all ages, although younger kids might have a hard time at certain points in the game. I personally played the game with a controller, so I can't really speak for how it plays on a keyboard, but I found the controls easy to learn, and even the magic marker was easy getting used to.Pros:+ The magic marker added some very interesting mechanics to the game, that certainly made me think.+ Good pacing of game, with new mechanics being introduced through out the entire game.+ Lots of checkpoints, which is nice for people who are horrible at platformers like me.+ Achievements, and in-game collectables, which adds some replayability to the game.+ Most cinematics can be skipped, which is nice for a second playthrough+ The art style, the music, the cinematics, and the voice acting, all matched each other and was very well carried through. Which made for a very good experience. Cons:- The game has certain parts that require some fast thinking, and change of controls. This means that the game wont be playable for everybody, and that younger kids might not have a fun time. The many checkpoints however helps a great deal with this, so you will rarely have to start all over again, in case you die.			"

This game isn't as cuddly as it appears.New marker powers come at a nice pace though, and each one has its own vibrant chapter full of briefly interesting ways to use the mechanic. The water temple is dripping with clever puzzles that had me drawing spouts of water to create paths and making boats out of vines. The fire temple, on the other hand, is more of a thrilling race, where the marker helped me to quickly find an escape route from a fiery lava beast. Discovering new ways to utilize the power of the marker is entertaining, and each area offers some fun surprises.When I could get the marker working, successfully navigating Max through areas using vines, branches, and water spouts together to create a sort of mousetrap sequence was seriously satisfying. Some high-pressure levels towards the end where you’re outrunning lava are particularly epic as well.			"

												Even though I think the story is very childish and fairytale-like, I still find it very entertaining aswell as the leveldesign, atmosphere. Levels are easily replayed within a selection screen, and achievements are fairly easy to complete. I really enjoyed this game.			"

												woooooow, what a fun game!! i'm glad i bought him on the sale but anyway it worth every penny, at first i was afraid that the marker thing won't work well with controller, then i download the demo and get cought by the beauty of this sweet game, very clever but-not-too-hard puzzles, breath-taking wild views, exellent graphics, maybe little scary too play with my little kids, but it's allright...a must buy...

												This is probably the best platformer game I've ever played.  You play Max, the big brother of Felix, who gets whisked away by a monster.  You have to find your way through several kinds of obstacles and environments to save him with the help of the powers in a magic marker.  Your marker gets new and different ""powers"" as you progress.The graphics, atmosphere, music and voice acting are superb.  Skill is required to use the controls but my favorite part of the game is having to think about how to solve the puzzles by using the powers in the right way.  The game has several levels and the replay value is enormous.  I'm in my third playthrough and I'm sure I'll be playing it many times in the future.			"

I got it at 3.99 and it was well worth the price.  This game is mostly easy with a few puzzling puzzles and challaging chases.  The only con I can think of is the main character Max was a tad annoying.			"

												I'm only half way though so far but I am in absolute awe every second I am playing this game. The graphics are amazing and the cut scenes look like a real animated movie. I picked this up on sale and I nearly didn't because I was spending too much money on a load of games but I'm so glad I picked this one up because it's quickly become one of my favourite games ever. I wanted a break from playing open world games and wanted a little puzzle platformer and this is EXACTLY what I wanted. This game is absolutely perfect and I highly reccomend.10/10. Though my review could change by the time I finish it but I doubt it. 4 hours in and I'm still in complete awe.			"

												Fun game. Starts a little slow with the simplistic puzzles, but after awhile I gets a bit more challenging and it really starts to pick up and give you more enjoyment. Graphics are splendid, and the cutscenes were very eclectic and reminded me of pixar style animation which is not a bad thing! I wouldn't be surprised if the animators for Max worked there in the future honestly. All in all this is a great game with a big fun factor. Definitely worth the $2.99 I bought it for and much much more! :D10/10 would pull more mushstupidos eyeballs. "

												THE PLATFORMINGI'm no Super Mario pro and I'm no casual gamer so this game was perfect for me. It's probably considered easy by platform addicts, I dunno. It had only one or two action/platforming moments which were really hard to the point I thought they were just bad by design (one of them was indeed as I saw Xbox and PS videos which showed how much easier it was on consoles).THE PUZZLESThe puzzles are all really nice with varying difficulties. You get a lot of easy ones, a good amount of medium ones and the eventual hard ones just before the checkpoints. Which by the way are generously well spread. I loved that as I'm a gamer with a life (and kids and multiple jobs).GREAT WITH KIDSOh yeah talking about kids. This game is great to play with your kids and teach them about physics and logic.

Her last gaming experience had been Aladdin on the SEGA Mega Drive. I loved watching her playing. The difficulty was just right, the story entertaining and straight to the point, and the mechanics familiar enough to what she remembrered.I'd recommend it to anyone whose looking for uncommited fun, from experient gamers to people who neve really gamed before.

I thought the puzzles were fun and they allowed you to be creative in your solutions.  DON'T BE AFRAID OF THIS GAME BECAUSE OF THE ""MAGIC MARKER"".  It's very simple to use (especially with a controller) and you get used to it quickly.  If I had to compare Max to other games, I would say that it's a well-executed mix Ori and the Blind Forest and (a refined version of) Nihilumbra.			"

												Get it! It's on sale! I haven't even finished this game yet and it's already sooo worth it.There's some other review saying this game has a ""Heart of Darkness"" feel to it. Indeed, it has.			"

												a puzzle solving game involving max trying to save his brother felix. Its a fun, cute game(did i really just say cute), for anyone to enjoy its a short game however at around $10 when its on sale is well worth it. i consider $2/hr good, the lesser the dollar the better the value.			"

												bringsback the old days whenhaving a Playstation was the best thing=^..^=* 2D gameplay with great animations and     3D observation angles* very good level design !   not repetetive, puzzles getting integrated well,   a cute story* polished menues, checkpoints get saved,  levels can be selected to complete side missions* playable for children (still not too easy)GREAT GAME- some parts can be difficult, taking the ""drawing""  specials too seriously			"

												An amazing puzzle platformer which is well worth the full price. I've been playing it for ages, haven't completed it yet and sill feel like it's great value (disclosure: I did actually get it on sale, but in hindsight, I'd have been happy either way).It's really well presented, with some fiendish tantrum-inducing puzzles and stands up there as one of the best puzzle platform games.In my opinion, playing it on keyboard and mouse is better than controller (you get better control of the magic marker).

												I wanted a simple game to ""let off some steam"" (pun not intended :) ) from extensively playing Witcher 3.  Bought this game for 3 Euros on winter sales and could not have done better. Simple yet fun platform game taking about five hours to complete (if you don't care playing again to collect all the ""secrets""). Minor hiccups when trying to push a branch here and there but that could not be listed as a con as it happens rarely. Totally  recommended!			"

												Max: The Curse of Brotherhood is a well-narrated platformer with quite nice gameplay features. However it's a little fairytale-y, I'm not quite sure it's suitable for lower ages.			"

												I almost stopped playing this because I thought it was going to be too jeuvenile.  I'm glad I persisted, as the game gets much better/harder the further in you get.  Overall it's a great platformer.			"

												I'm amazed I'd never heard of this game before I bought it. It's a lot like Limbo, but with more colors than black and very dark gray. Interesting and unique puzzles, fun and exciting action sequences, and pretty graphics are all here. Highly recommended.			"

												Its page master with a marker replacing the books. Great game! Fluid controls (sometimes clunky) great artwork and is just fun to play. Only problem is it crashes every once in a while on Windows 10. Not sure what thats about.			"

												First of all this game is splendid! Fantastic Art style, cut-scenes, story, all linked with a fluid game play; with fun simplistic puzzles plus a unique thoughtfulness. It is 2.5D yet feels 3D because it has great production value and CGI!A game for ALL age groups!This game beats 'Brothers: A tale of two sons' in my opinion.Get this game especially on sale. 9/10 Maxxxxx!

												This is a beatiful platformer. It reminds me of Abe's Oddworld, but this is more forgiving.The puzzles consist mostly of physics puzzles that you solve by using a magic marker. The marker extends rocks, grows branches and vines, or shoots water or fire, all from color coded anchor points in the game world. These elements combine beautifully, and you fix the puzzles by being clever and agile. Most levels end in an epic chase / boss / climax. At about 70% through I dropped the gamepad and started using the kb / mouse, which allows for finer control.I wish it were longer.			"
