												Entertaining modern adventure game focused on investigation. Rating: 8.5/10.+ Visually stunning. One of the most realistic environments I've seen so far.+ Great soundtrack that ties in quite well with the environment. Music gets gloomy when walking in dark parts of the wood, become more optimistic and light when entering a clearing, etc. The transitions are quite well done as well (i.e. it doesn't just jump from gloomy to cheerful).+ Interesting storyline and puzzles. The puzzle-difficulty is suitable for the average gamer. Game mechanics such as your psychic powers, were a nice touch as well.+/- Playthrough is about 6 hours (plus or minus one or two hours depending on whether you take the time to walk around and just enjoy the scenery). Relatively short, but it didn't feel too short.My main problem with the [old version of the] game was the lack of a player-controlled saving option [EDIT: apparently, this issue is fixed in the Redux Version]. This made me feel rushed; trying to run through the story to reach the next save-point, rather than enticing you to explore and just enjoy the game. Well done for fixing this!			"

												The older I get, the more I like my games short and sweet. And this game is ever so sweet. Do yourself a favour: read or watch nothing more than you already have, but just dive in and allow the world and story to enchant you. Take your time with it. Short as it is, this is not a game to be rushed through. A second look and thought pay huge dividend.I took some high resolution shots while exploring Red Creek Valley (~20MP and up). No spoilers, but if you haven't seen anything yet, don't look at them and just play it.http://flic.kr/s/aHsk4eTkcu "

												I'll echo what many, many have already said: visually stunning, great music, short. The very first thing the game tells you when you enter the world is that it will not hold your hand. It's very true. At first you may wonder what you are even supposed to do. I kept a guide handy because after glancing at it later in the game for the first time, I realized I had missed SO much in the beginning. So much so that I restarted a new game. The story is beautiful, tragic, and extremely gripping. The ending is a satisfying surprise. Because the game is short, however, I can not recommend paying full price. Definitely add this one to your wishlist though and snap it up as soon as you find it on sale.			"

												Play Time: Approximately 4+ HoursQuick Review: The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a stunningly beautiful game that shows off what a developer can do if they focus on PC graphics. The story is engaging and mysterious and keeps you hooked until the very end as you explore the relatively large island. There are dozens of interesting corners of the island to discover that include some light puzzling and side stories. Overall it was a beautiful game worth its asking price of $20.Meaningless Score: 8/10			"

												Maybe for a 5 hours long game you won't be willing to pay 19€, but for 10€ it's worth every cent, even though it's among the shortest games I've played.If I have to categorize this game I'd say this is a lovecraftian game, it's a detective story with paranormal and horror features all perfectly encased in the most beautiful and realistic environment ever seen in a videogame, not to mention the absolutely perfect music that will give you goose bumps.***GAMEPLAY 8/10: Investigative, slow paced. You won't be running around guns blazing in this game, you have to look for hints or you'll be missing something for sure. You can complete everything or nothing in any order. You won't see any kind of log book, map or quest marker. I really liked it, but unfortunately the game is a bit too short to enjoy the investigative experience. Another great thing about the gameplay is that you will never experience any interruption because the game needs to load areas, you start from the beginning and reach the end in one single walk. This is probably the reason why this game is so short, a longer and a bigger game environment might have required a loading screen or two.***STORY 8/10: That's all this game is about, story. As you are told at the beginning of the game ""This game is a narrative experience that does not hold your hand"". Step by step you'll discover the truth about the mysterious events that happened in Red Creek Valley until you reach the end where the ultimate truth will be revealed. I can't tell anything without spoiling something, so I'll just say it's really enjoyable.***GRAPHICS 10/10: I have never, NEVER, seen such beautiful environment. I grew up near the Alps and I can see that exact scenery in this game; rocks, trees, bushes, and even the undergrowth look absolutely real. The textures are high quality photos of actual, real life environment. I suggest you read this to learn more about this spectacular creation. http://www.theastronauts.com/2014/03/visual-revolution-vanishing-ethan-carter/ ***SOUND 9/10: Beautiful music completes the game, it goes hand in hand with the environment. I could stay hours looking at the landscape listening to the music... and maybe i did.Overall score 9/10Grab it when it's around 10€, you won't regret it.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is an adventure game which was released on PC in mid 2014, and then later released on the PS4 in the summer of 2015. This is an open world style environment where you have very little guidance on where to go or what to do. You are left to your own devices and to progress in the game. There are a number of puzzles which you must find yourself and pretty much solve with no aid at all. Some of the puzzles are pretty hard to even locate. All of the puzzles are solved by using paranormal abilities such as sensing where objects are in the world or assembling a time line of events of the past.  This was my favourite gameplay mechanic in The Vanishing of Ethan Cater, you essentially have to work out the order of events that led up to the murder of a character. This is done by seeing small memories throughout the world and then just ordering them by assigning them a number by walking up to the memory. This really makes you think about the events which have taken place, and some of them can be quite shocking!The graphics in The Vanishing of Ethan Cater are absolutely gorgeous, easily one of the best looking games out there at the moment. The game runs in the Unreal engine 3, and the developers have really pushed it to it’s limits here. There is a wide array of graphical options in the menu, allowing you to customize it how you want. All of the graphical elements are perfectly designed. Sunsets, water reflections, foliage, all of it looks almost has a photographic realism to it. Plot wise, this game has a very interesting tale to tell; I have to admit, it took me at least 15 minutes or so for me to really understand what was happening but after that I was fully immersed and engaged in the story. You will see plenty of twists and turns right until the final credits. The Vanishing of Ethan Cater is fully voice acted to an extremely high standard; all of the sound effects are really well made too, such as the sounds of the forest, lakeside noises and other ambient sounds that go unnoticed, unless you actually listen out for them. As this game has some moments in it where you have no idea where to go or how to progress, I had to resort to the use of a walkthrough, many people who read my reviews will know that it is something I have to do on a regular basis for this genre of game. Saying that, even with the use of a walkthrough, there are still moments where you have to put a lot of thought into the puzzles. There is also only one  “enemy” in The Vanishing of Ethan Cater throughout the whole story, and I was a little disappointed that it wasn’t made to be a more challenging encounter than it was,  since you could easily navigate your way around it with ease. The open world in which The Vanishing of Ethan Cater is set in, is giant, and you can find something interesting to look at everywhere you turn; there are tons of different letters, journals, books and signs to interact with to get even more depth from the story. You won’t really encounter any other characters in real time though, all of the other NPCs you find will be when you are using your paranormal abilities, so there isn’t any real character interaction going on.This game took me just under three and a half hours to complete; I feel that to be a perfect length for any adventure game like this, as it allows for a plot to be formed, fleshed out and resolved in a timely manner.  Bear in mind, this was with a walkthrough for the majority of it; if you are going in blind, I would estimate you are looking at a five or six hour game.I started out playing The Vanishing of Ethan Cater on a 4K resolution, and whilst it was playable with the majority of the settings on full, I still had the odd frame rate drop when I was looking in a direction which had a lot to render, such as over the dam. When dropping the resolution down to 1080p, the frame drops stopped and I was able to continue playing at a smooth 60 FPS.  The game does have full controller compatibility, however I would recommend you use a keyboard and mouse for this game, just because it’s first person and a mouse makes controlling so much easier.  In conclusion, The Vanishing of Ethan Cater is a very nicely presented adventure game; whilst it doesn’t have any really fast paced action moments, it does have some intriguing puzzles and well throughout story behind it. You will also get to see one of the best looking games to date, and that is something which you should not miss out on.  I won’t go as far to say The Vanishing of Ethan Cater is a must play for a PC game, but I will highly recommend it, just because the game has very little, if any negative points, and everything else is done to an exceptionally high standard.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended 4) Highly recommended 5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												There are good Lovecraft games and bad versions. This is nearly a perfect ""H.P. Lovecraft is my hero"" game. From the pretty graphics, the sounds, the voices, the story, the clues, even the way the game feels.. perfect. If you enjoy slow subtle horror, get this. It plays just like you are walking around within a Lovecraft story. Good stuff!			"

												When I was about 9 years old I dug through my brother's locker while he was away at college.  It was an old brown wooden locker with large hotdog shaped handles and the lock had finally given way after years of pulling on it when no one was looking.  It popped open with a quiet squeak, and inside was a giant tangle of tennis rackets, socks, a few ribbons, a couple of  award plaques, old t-shirts, some stinky cologne shaped like a turn of the century automobile, and an old rusty tin.  The rusty tin caught my eye.  I secreted it away in my room and shut the locker.  The lid gave way with a bit of rust and inside were items that I still find fascinating to this day.  Old comic books.  Really old.  Older than he was, dating from the 30's, 40's, and 50's.  It must have been handed down to him from my grandpa or grand uncle, I never found out.  They were aged and nearly falling apart.  Inside them were stories of horror, alien attacks, secret people under the sea awaiting to attack, detective stories, ghost stories, and a distinctly remember a giant sea monster attacking a guy in an old diving suit that looked like something out of Bioshock.It was with that type of fascination for discovery that I felt completely taken in by The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.You are Paul Prospero, a detective looking for young Ethan Carter.  From the moment you step out of the tunnel, the graphics pull you in and narration starts.  It's not frivolous.  The dialogue has a will of it own and the mystery keeps you in the dark about what is really going on.  You start out finding clues and small side stories.  Each story takes you on a mini journey.  There are puzzles involved and clues to be sorted out in chronological order.  Generally, these fairly are straightforward and the hardest part really is figuring out how to get to the next clue sorting mini game.  Followed by those are cut scenes of your clues in order blending into the game quite well about a very devious evil that pressures Ethan's family.Among all this are some of the best graphics I've seen in a game.  And I found myself taking more and more screenshots.  Stared at some trees for almost 5 minutes.  Leftthe river running in game and just sat back to enjoy the environment with my eyes closed for the sound experience.  It's serene. The backdrop to all these dark missions, is the most relaxing background I've come upon.And the missions are a reasonable difficulty level.  Nothing is right in front of you, yet not hidden from sight.  I'd say it's just right.  Ok, well that crow did take me ages to find, but besides that I thought *pacing* was set very tightly to a good groove.Gameplay is straightforward with clicking on certain items that glow with inviting text, but you *do* need to complete certain events in order to move forward.  If you get stuck, you might have overlooked something that has to be done first.   You won't need to combine many items or keep an inventory, it's elegantly simple in it's design.  The ending does come a little quick.  Yet, I had no feelings of ""aww, that's it??!!"".  If anything I felt like it came to a very satisfying end.  And I played the ending a few times just to see it again.  You'll get about 3-5 hrs out of it depending if you go quickly or search every nook and cranny like I did.  And sometimes I'd just let it run for the hell of it as background scenery.When I was done I found I was missing a few achievements.  Those are not easy to locate without a guide.  However, I do not advise looking at a guide until you have finished the game.  You will get so much more out of it that way.  This is a wonderful story, or rather set of stories.  Hidden away in a secret locker inside a tin.  Waiting for the lock to give way. 9/10. "

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: The Vanishing of Ethan Carter Original Release: 2014 Genre Tags: Exploration; Walking-Simulator; Detective; Great Graphics; Atmospheric My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 3-8 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Casual gamers REVIEWThe Vanishing of Ethan Carter is an interesting and highly atmospheric game that boasts a mixture of exploration and detective game elements. The detective scenes are well done and never become overly confusing, but they make up less than half of the gameplay. A majority of the gameplay involves walking around, (and probably getting lost), searching for the next scene. This isn’t a bad thing, though, as the ambiance and graphics are absolutely stellar; and the gameworld is a joy to explore. That said, if you aren’t really a fan of slow-paced games without action, colloquially dubbed: “walking-simulators,” then you may find this boring. But if you can appreciate its beauty and take solace in the fact it isn’t a pure walking-simulator and has a number of puzzle-solving scenes, you will probably enjoy  The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.Without a doubt, the best feature of this game is the gorgeous gameworld and atmosphere. But it is more than just beautiful graphics that create this exceptional experience. The soundscape and overall ambiance are also leading contributors. Shortly after first beginning to play this game I found myself crossing a long railway bridge over a lake and I was immediately sucked in by the aesthetics. But I quickly realized that I was captivated by more than the visual view, and that the creaking and groaning effects of the bridge were reinforcing the immersive experience at an exceptional level. This aesthetic and atmospheric experience is established early and maintains its integrity throughout the game.The actual narrative is interesting and mysterious. The onus is on the player to piece together the narrative and make sense of it. Depending on how much you bother to read and listen, the story becomes more clear or convoluted. I enjoyed the experience; however I do feel like some of the elements of the storyline could have been more fleshed out and explained more clearly. The gameplay is comprised of mostly exploration, but also has a strong aspect of puzzle-solving elements. As you wander the gameworld you will come across several mysteries, in the form of both murder scenes and supernatural enigmas, which need to be solved through detective work. The mechanics of the puzzle-solving involve discovering the necessary clues in the gameworld and performing the necessary deductions.There isn’t any action whatsoever throughout the whole game, save for one small area where you may get a jump-scare and sent back to a checkpoint. But even that area is extremely easy to navigate and never really amounts to much action. This is a good thing, as forcing combat or action into the game would have probably only ruined the atmosphere.One gripe with the game that I have, and also many others have, is that there is no manual saving. I have said it a number of times in my reviews before and I will continue to say it: there is no reason for a PC game in the current generation and beyond to not allow manual saving. I don’t care what kind of game it is, I personally believe people should be able to choose if they want to use manual saves or not. And besides, in The Vanishing of Ethan Carter there is no combat and there are no decision trees, so “save-scumming” (as it is so eloquently called) isn’t even a factor here. Compounding the issue, the checkpoint system isn’t very well-crafted and the distance between checkpoints can be ridiculously far. You need to solve a puzzle or discover the next area in order to prompt the game to save, so if you are stuck and want to stop playing, you will either have to check a guide to finish your current objective or accept the fact you will have to start over when you return. And of course, there is also a possibility of a power outage or system crash. Fortunately, this issue was somewhat alleviated in the Redux version of the game by significantly increasing the frequency of checkpoints. Yet I still find the lack of manual saving to be a serious fault.As for the Redux version, if your computer can handle it, you should probably play that version. You get both versions together with the purchase of the game. Besides having higher quality graphics from UE4, there are also some subtle changes and improvements (like the aforementioned increase in checkpoints). I personally opted to play the original version, because I’m weird like that, but I will probably come back and play the Redux version in a few years when the story has faded from my memory.The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is definitely a very enjoyable experience, if not a peaceful one. You won’t find any action, but you can find mystery and intrigue. And the atmosphere and aesthetic beauty of the game are superb. It felt, to me, like some beautiful lovechild of Dear Esther and MURDERED: SOUL SUSPECT. If you like relaxing and investigative games, or are curious about them, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is absolutely a good one to consider.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												I had been following this game for a while and had decided to wait until it was on sale before I bought it.  The more I read, the more I wanted to try it out so finally I just said screw it and picked it up.Gotta say, $20 well spent!Sure, the game is only 4-5 hours long, depending on how much exploring and running around you do, but the whole package is so interesting that it feels much deeper than it really is.GRAPHICS: Everyone talks about how pretty this game is.  Well, it's no lie.  I found myself taking constant screenshots like I was on some sort of nature hike.  You know, those shots that everyone takes when they go on outdoor trips.  Trees, rocks, water, old buildings. All of it looks great in this game and I was a real shutterbug.  I just left the settings alone, but with my system it was at max by default.  Smooth animations too!SOUND: The voice overs, the music, the ambient sound effects.  All very authentic.  Similar to the above comments on graphics, the sound can realy draw you in.  Just put on some headphones, go stand by the water and just listen.  Wind, water flow, bugs, birds.  Nature.  It is very peacful.GAMEPLAY: This is another part of this game I really enjoyed.  The whole discovery mechanic for finding objects and solving puzzles is refreshing.  I could do without time stamping events, but thankfully those are few and far between.  If anything, I wish there were MORE puzzles.  This game makes me want a full blown ""Sherlock Holmes"" style mystery adventure with similar mechanics in place.  Would be awesome!STORY: This will be my only knock on the game.  Don't get me wrong, the story is really good, but it became a little obvious too soon (for me at least) what was going on.  So a few times in the game I found myself rushing a bit.  So when I say it's a negative, I mean like when an actor in a movie does a bad accent.  It doesn't make the movie bad, it just is someting that bugs you if you pay too much attention.VALUE: I just wanted to touch on this one more time.  Some might say $20 for such a short game is too much.  And maybe you are right, but the overall package is really what is worth every penny.So in the end, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who just wants a refreshingly new adventure in a beautiful world.  Just dive in, and enjoy!Hope they make another like this soon :)			"

												Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!As I stumble through the overgrowth outside of Red Creek Valley I suspect I'm not a welcome visitor. Within five minutes of getting off the train tracks I've stumbled upon a series of gruesome traps, and not the sort you'd leave for any wild game. Flails and springs and pits. No, these traps are for curious outsiders. And intuition tells me it's claimed more than a few of the less observant ones... intuition and the shattered bones that litter the forest floor. This little hamlet has a dark secret, one tied directly to the disappearance of one Ethan Carter. And I intend to uncover the truth.After a few (seemingly) close calls I stop in a clearing to appreciate the sheer beauty of this pristine place. The trees sway lazily; some have made the transition into their fall colors, and some remain stubbornly verdant. The grass has grown high and unruly, claiming patches of neglected road, working in tandem with a blanket of primeval ferns. Freight cars sit unused, decaying on the tracks. It's at that moment I realize I've encountered no people, no wildlife. And the world around me suddenly grows still, anxiously waiting for me to move, to stop dawdling, to leave. But I can't. I may not be able to see it, but I know something is watching me, this clumsy outsider. Something malevolent, old, and hungry.“The Vanishing of Ethan Carter” can best be described as a mystery horror exploration narrative. While it isn't overtly frightening, it has an overwhelming atmosphere. The community of Red Creek Valley is a lot like iconic Silent Hill - except with an older, more sinister vibe. The decrepit setting slowly being swallowed by nature, the eerie crime scenes, the soft music, and excellent, grumbly narration all marry together to form a very unsettling, hypnotic surrounding. This is a town where Lovecraft's ancient, twisted gods rule. You are most certainly unwelcome. And you will feel that from beginning to end.But like any good paranormal detective you'll press onward in spite of traps, murder scenes, and inexplicable, disembodied narration. You're Paul Prospero (Shakespeare's “The Tempest” anyone?), and this is your last case (you're roughly two weeks from retirement!). And this kid Ethan, with his special gift... he's relying on you. To find him. To save him. And to find out what's happened to this place and its colorful denizens.As you explore you'll find clues and piece together what happened at certain locations. You'll spot abnormalities, anomalies, and the like. Sometimes something will be missing and there's a mechanic in which the item, for instance a crank, will show up as scattered text. If you look in the right direction the text will come together and you'll be able to see where item is located using your occult powers. Finally, if there's a victim in the vicinity and you've gathered enough clues, you'll have the opportunity to piece together what happened by “communicating” with the dead and reliving their final moments. And when you gather evidence and set the chronology of actions in order, man does it feel rewarding. And there's enough variety to keep these paranormal encounters fresh. And while the game is linear you'll have the freedom to explore and solve puzzles in whatever order you like.This is a slow, methodical, meticulous sort of game. The sort of game you should play by yourself with your favorite comfort drink and no distractions. Really immerse yourself. It's one of the best looking games I've ever played – near photo realistic. The story is riveting, bizarre, and unflinchingly violent. This is an exploration game done right, with gameplay that challenges you to be observant and thoughtful. It's short, sure, but every hour is worthwhile and it doesn't overstay its welcome. “Ethan Carter” is a love letter; to Lovecraft and all things weird, and to classic detective stories. This is easily one of the best indie titles released in 2014.So what are you waiting for? You mustn't keep the old ones waiting too long. Sure, they have time. Time means nothing to them. But for you... that's a precious commodity you're fast running out of.			"

												I absolutely loved playing this! To make the review short and simple I'll stick with the pros and cons of it.PROS:+ Graphics - it's one of the best looking games I've ever played, incredibly well polished.+ Immersion - there's no HUD, no hints,  nothing on the screen to distract you from this immersive experience (I can only hope to replay it in a few years with oculus rift support).+ Soundtrack - one of my favourite things about this game! It can be beautiful and yet, at the same time, bitter. It really helps to set the tone.+ Story - it's not the game's strongest point and it ends in a bit of a cliché way, but it still manages to be very enjoyable and interesting.CONS:x Playtime - sadly this game is very short, you can finish it after around 4-6 hours. It might help extend it's duration if you just walk around in the woods, the scenery is beautiful and perfect to expand your screenshot library.x Low Replay Value - pratically nonexistent. No achievements, no side stories. After you finish it, it basically becomes the best walking simulator in your game library (which might be fine for some).Playing ""The Vanishing of Ethan Carter"" was like going to a really good restaurant - you pay for the quality, not the quantity - because even though it's quite short, everything about it is close to being perfect. 9/10			"

												Have you ever asked yourself how a particular video game has made you FEEL? I am going to attempt to explain that vague underlining feeling that occurs from playing a game like this. I have not wanted to revisit this game as it left such an imprint on me at an emotional level. I have lately been forced to revisit it, however, as the world of Ethan Carter has somehow mingled with my dreams to form nightmares despite not having played the game since it first came out. Ethan's world leaves a bitter emptiness and darkness that I soon found I wanted to escape. As I walked through this beautiful forested land I soon began to notice the deadly silence. Is there anyone here? When is the last time that I have felt so alone in a place? I began to seek out the comfort of human voices. I craved for Paul Prospero to say something, anything. I didn't want to play the game anymore. I wanted to forget about it.... but I had to find Ethan... I had to know what happened here. I had to know what happened to this world drowning in quiet desperation, to this place that feels lost, alone, and afraid. It felt like it was hanging on for dear life like a fading memory... It felt like I was not supposed to be there..... I think that the atmosphere itself is brilliantly crafted and I would recommend playing it simply to have the experience. Just be prepared... We don't get to escape our experiences in the video game world just because they are not ""real"" life.			"

												It got praised -- and also awarded by BAFTA in 2015 -- for the innovative photo-scanning technology the developers used in creating realistic 3D models for the objects present in the game, which made Red Creek Valley one of the most beautiful places to visit on Steam, but, personally, I think its greatest accomplishment is the subtle approach to storytelling, placing its story in an intertext cleverly situated at the intersection of several literary styles and genres: we have the typical detective story, the space-era pulpy science-fiction, the witch-in-the-woods fairy tale, the gothic novel and the lovecraftian horror -- to name only the most important ones --, all meaningfuly combined into a touching story about the power of creativity, which reminded me of Ambrose Bierce's An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.And after Ice-pick Lodge (The Void, Knock Knock), The Chinese Room (Dear Esther, A Machine for Pigs), Cardboard Computer (Kentucky Route Zero) or Simogo (Year Walk), it's refreshing to see The Astronauts as yet another developer aptly making use of literary conventions in developing their videogames, effectively and meaningfuly blurring the thin line between the two media.

												I will make this very simple. The save system cripples this game.The game is absolutely stunning to look at and a joy to walk around in and play. I don't care about the price, because even if it's only 5 hours or so the atmosphere is so well done and it's so pretty to look at that I feel it's worth more than $5 or $10.The deal breaker is the save system where you can play for 30 minutes or even a whole hour or more... and you need to go out or go to sleep... and you return to the game and nothing you've done has saved. I can't tell you how frustrating it is to 1) have no idea when something has saved,  and 2) Not be able to save when I need to take a break.Why? What reason would they have for making you lose all your hard earned progress pretty much every time you quit? And make no mistake, it will happen pretty much every time you quit because you never have any idea when the game is saving or where.Were it not for that one thing I would whole heartedly, 100% recommend this game... but the save system really, really sucks!

												9/10+ awesome presentation, graphics are breathtaking, photorealistic at times, the art behind the graphics is fantastic+ runs great maxed out (reduce AA if you have fps drops)+ nice soft music throughout the game, good voice acting+ interesting story, trying to solve the mystery of the vanishing of ethan carter!+ gameplay wise this game brings the adventure genre to a new level, you move in 1st person mode, conrtols are fluid and movement is perfect (i was amazed by the fact that you don't get stuck in the environment unless there is indeed a huge obstacle or a dead end ahead), no endless dialogues and texts to read, many things are said by the environment, puzzles are limited though, i can think of 2 puzzles in total that were easy enough but pretty original, investigation scenes are straight forward and it's easy to complete them by finding the missing items  and then reconstructing the scene+ took me 6 hours to complete the game for the 1st time and i didn't get stuch anywhere, also used the run button a lot, so it's NOT a very short game. also missed 2 scenes , so i have to replay it to see everything- character models could be better- some gameplay elements could be explained in the beginning (hint: first scene you investigate and have to find the crank, in order to get a vision of its location you have to align the words and press left button, this gameplay element is used throughout the game but is not explained, so keep that in mind, align the words to get the vision)- more puzzles would be nice- ending is predictablegreat game from great developers, i'm happy they didn't waste the assets into another fps or action game, they allready cancelled an adventure game in the past that also seemed very interesting, hope they will continue developing adventure games in the future of this incredibly high quality....p.s if steam overlay doesn't work exit fraps (or another recording program) and restart the game. if you need fraps to run (as i do in most games) minimize the game and run fraps again.

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a beautiful game.This game is not just beautiful because of its technical prowess: number of models crammed in the game, how high resolution the textures are, how it handles long distance views, etc.... but mainly because of the artistic directions chosen. The warm autumn colors, the softly billowing clouds, how and which trees and leaves are swaying, softly moving mists and light flares, and all the little details... all combined to make a pleasant environment just to walk around and enjoy the scenery. Luckily for us, it's not just a pretty walking simulator.So as you're thrust into Ethan Carter's world, you hear a short narrative by your (detective) character for the first minute or two... then, nothing. You're left standing all alone in the middle of a beautiful forest and It's all up to you to find where the stories are and to tinker with the game and figure out the puzzle mechanics. I didn't know this at first, so I kept walking (passing some of the obscure puzzle pieces) looking for an area that would trigger the next narratives... if it hadn't been for the super nice environment to enjoy, I think I might have already thrown a tantrum for this ;) But in the end, it makes for a really nice and visually rewarding walk around the island.The story parts and puzzles are littered all over the fairly small island for you to discover and most of them can be completed in any order you choose, except for the few final ones. This can be a good thing, as it gives you the feeling of freedom to roam and explore... but in my case it was a little bit confusing as I missed a key encounter (that hints on the backstory) until it was the very last one I did before the finale; and at that point I was a little disappointed at the story I wove myself in my head about Ethan. The ending though, tied everything together nicely... and it was a really satifying ending that explained just about all the loose ends for me. I came to appreciate all the little tidbits and details that were peppered throughout the island and all the characters and happenings to reach this conclusion.So, if you ask me... The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is not just a beautiful game, it's also a fine story.			"

The Vanishing of Ethan Carter ReviewGame DetailsGame: The Vanishing of Ethan CarterGenre: AdventureDeveloped by: The AstronautsPublished by: The AstronautsRelease Date: 25 September, 2014Metacritic Score: 82 (Link[www.metacritic.com])Game Review""The Beauty of Red Creek Valley""The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is an indie game made by The Astronauts studio. This is a story-driven mystery game where you control a private detective named Paul Prospero, exploring and discovering several clues by communicating with the dead and seeing visions that help him locate a missing boy and discover the mistery behind a dark force lurking in Red Creek Valley.GameplayIn terms of gameplay, its a game with very simple mechanics, yet they work perfectly in it with many enjoyable puzzles that will engage you into the game. There is not much more to discuss in this aspect since this is a story-driven game, but I can say that everything gameplay wise works in favor of the game, and its experience, which overall focus on exploring beautiful scenarios for clues that help you solve the mystery around Red Creek Valley, while having a great sense of freedom that differenciates this piece of art from other linear story-driven games.Longevity is pretty small since I completed the game in about 3 hours, but somewhat expected since this is a story-driven game. Yet you will certainly spend some more hours into the game just by wandering through the astonishing environments present in the game, as by taking several screenshots since this is one of the most beautiful environments in game history in my opinion. The only two downsides of this game are really the length and the few autosave locations present in the game (no manual save feature either). StoryThis is an extremely important category in this game since, like I said before, it is a story-driven game. And boy, how good it was! This is an extremely powerful and interesting story making the game extremely captivating. The writing is very smart, it is amazing to see a game with such smart writing and dialogs. This game also uses complex themes in its story in a very interesting and sometimes unpredictable way. The pacing of the story is top-notch too as the mystery unravels slowly till you reach the end. I also enjoyed the ending very much, it was an amazing conclusion and I am sure most of you will love it to.GraphicsMoving on, lets discuss the graphics. They are amazing! A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! This is one extremely gorgeous game. The environments are simply breathtaking. If you like taking screenshots, you will do it all the time in this game. Absolutely insane the level of detail and spectacularity present in the scenario. It is so good that it makes you wanna visit a place like the Red Creek Valley in the real life. With amazing views like it has, the exploration part of the game feels extremely good, instead of feeling like a chore like in some other games.SoundSound-wise I do not have any complaints either. The soundtrack is a perfect fit, as the sound effects. Voice acting was very good too, did not seemed like it was an Indie game at all.PerformancePerformance was great in my medium specs rig (you can see it in my profile). I played it in my 1440x900 resolution with almost every graphical settings maxed out (you have plenty of them to tweak in the game laucher) at 60 fps, with very few drops to never less than 50 fps.SummaryPros:Simple, yet effective gameplay and puzzle-solvingBreathtaking graphics and environmentsSpectacular story with amazingly well-written dialogsExtremely captivating game due to its story and scenariosAmazing sense of freedomGreat production values for an Indie GameCons:Poor autosave systemSmall lengthMy personal score: 8.5/10If you like story-driven games this is a must-buy. If you are looking for a game with amazing graphics this is also a must-have game. An amazing tale that revolves around the supernatural with a powerful story and a beautiful world to wander around. The small longevity may make you doubt about the value of this game, but even from its base price this game is one to have in your steam library. Have fun wandering through Red Creek Valley.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter offers a unique gaming experience by combining different genres into an impressive game.First, we have the exploration layer: the landscape is a dreamy mountain valley, traversed by rivers and bathed in sunset light. The scenery is so beautiful that it will make you want to take screenshots of every single tree that you encounter. And when you think you just caught in one screenshot the nicest view there is in the game, you realize that if you move a bit sideways there's a completely different angle that makes the scene even more beautiful than the previous one. I spent hours just walking around and looking at everything, discovering sceneries of amazing beauty and marveling myself at the astonishing graphic detail.

But the game is much more than a walking simulator. The story unfolds as you explore the surroundings: it's the tragic story of a boy called Ethan that has gone missing. Playing the role of the detective Paul, you embark on this mysterious adventure of finding the boy. On the road you discover different clues and solve different murder cases associated to his disappearance, by using of your supernatural ability to sense things. The story has a way of keeping you interested until the end, with unexpected events along the way. The ending is not predictable, although not out of the ordinary either; but it's the kind of ending you least expect to have.I would also advise checking a guide after you complete the game because there are a couple of vey enjoyable Easter eggs that are a nice addition to the main story and it would be a pity to miss them.The story is designed as a thriller, there are a few scenes that might cause a bit of discomfort to some people: blood on the ground, mutilated corpses, spooky dark areas and a couple of jump scares. But it's not at all a violent game and the horror-y scenes are very bearable even for an easily startled person as I am.The music adds a lot to the whole ambience of the game. It is dark in the sinister areas and cheerful in the lighted areas. The sound of the wind, of the river flowing, of the creaking floor when you step on it - all these immerse you even deeper in the whole atmosphere of the game.The price of this game has been a bit too spicy for me (18,99€) if you consider it's shortness (4-5 hours for a complete playthrough) and I avoided buying it for a long time, but now after I played it, I understand that the price might justify the effort the developers put into creating this superb game. I definitely recommend buying it while on sale, at 75% off.More reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page "

												Note: I completed the Redux version of the game.I've heard so many wonderful things about this game but I held off buying it because I'm not really a fan of walking simulator type of games. However, just a few minutes of watching an LP video on YouTube finally convinced me to pull the trigger. And I'm glad I did as I enjoyed it very much. Not only did I complete the game on the same day I bought it, I did it in one sitting as well. I just HAD to know what happened to Ethan.+ Graphics looked absolutely amazing! + Music and sounds are suitably melancholic and eerie.+ Interesting story that will keep you captivated.+ Simple but tight controls.+ Easy and a variety puzzles.+ They included the Redux version, free of charge, with the game's purchase. How awesome are the developers?!- A simple and short tutorial would be nice (though they do warn you about the no-hand-holding thinghy as you start the game).- Voice acting could be better.- Short gameplay (about 5 ~ 6 hours).The ending left me sad and melancholic. I can safely say that I was very much immersed in the story.I would probably play it again just to look the beautiful views of Red Valley Creek. An absolute steal if you can get it when it's on sale.My Rating: 8/10			"

												There are so many options that it would be completely boring for me to list them all, so here are just a few:  Resolution (640x480 up to 1920x1024), Language (subtitles are the default), Full-screen, Quality, five different sliders for Sounds, etc.  You can play with the mouse and keyboard (key mapping is allowed) or with a controller, which is what I chose.I could not play the game without it crashing when I was using a 32-bit system, but once I upgraded my Windows to 64-bit, it ran like a dream. (Happy day!!)  It will auto-save at certain points, but there is no manual save.Controls are basic, with movement, camera (full 360 at your fingertips), a button to inspect/interact, one to crouch, one to zoom, and one to run.There are 12 achievements that unlock simply by playing through the game, but there are also two secret achievements to be had.  One is rather easy to get, and the other is in three parts.  You could spend hours combing through the lush environment and still possibly miss part one, but oh -- what a beautiful place to get ""lost"" in~!If you've seen anything about the game, you already know know gorgeous the graphics are.  There is a brightness slider if you're worried about not being able to see, but what I really would've liked to see is a contrast adjustment.  I love it the way it is, of course, but the artistic side of me would've liked to make the visuals even more rich by increasing the contrast... but I digress! ;)Those who'd like to just immerse themselves in the world of Ethan Carter will want to simply explore and learn everything by trial and error, but for those of you who would like the basics of gameplay, I'll add them in a spoiler text here:A prompt will come up whenever you find something to interact with.  You will find as you play that you can ""see"" things -- After all, you're a psychic detective!  The view will expand when you've done something right, so if you don't see much at first, keep exploring and try to find what you've missed.In order to progress in that first recreation scene, you'll need to put everything back the way it was before the incident happened, then try again (it will make sense when you play.)There's a fascinating dynamic that comes into play as you progress, requiring you to identify the sequence of events that took place.  This will come up in multiple areas, revealing more and more of the story as you go.  It can be surprising, even confusing at times, but everything ties together at the end.Ethan Carter envelopes a realm full of beauty, wonder, and -- at times -- fear and unease.  The devs gave us a gift towards the end by allowing us instant transport to specific areas of the map so that we can continue to explore without having to spend 10 minutes or more just running to get back to where you want to go... Which is a good thing, because the game won't let you see the ending until you've discovered all of the story elements!As for said ending, I really can't tell you anything without giving something away, and I wouldn't want to ruin it for you.  The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is something to be experienced for oneself, then talked about later.  I will say that I think that the second playthrough will be even more enjoyable than the first, now that I understand how to play.  Totally recommended for those who enjoy exploring and mysteries.

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter revolves about finding the boy (Ethan) who wants to be a writer - so he creates many interesting supernatural short stories. Who are you, you might ask - let's say that doesn't matter. You are there to investigate what happened with Ethan and his family that got possessed by evil. What distinguish this game from other walking simulators, is definitely the graphics, sounds and music. It's made so delicately that you'll enjoy every second walking in the Red Creek Valley. And if you are more impatient or just want to quickly return somewhere, don't worry, developers allowed you to sprint (this is not Dear Esther). The nature around you feels like modded Skyrim that even on newest desktop builds run on low FPS, but Unreal Engine 4 makes a difference and this game, since the Redux edition that you get for free, runs great!The gameplay itself is casual, most of the time you'll be exploring the valley, with interludes of dark memories of Carter family, and interludes where Ethan's short stories become real. Those stories are really nice and there's the one that stands out from the others - I won't spoil much, I'll just say that the Lovecraftian horror fans will get excited. What's worse is the length of the game, the game offers about 3 hours of entertainment with getting all achievements, and not much replayability. That fact is compensated with the beautiful environment and precious soundtrack. In the end it's all about your priorities, if you prefer the environment and story, or the length.I understand if you don't want to pay 19 euros for a short walking simulator but trust me - if you will see it on sale, buy it. It's a great experience.			"

The Vanishing of Ethan Carter  Field Rating Review   Graphics 9.5 An absolutely stunning and absorbing environment both visually and audibly, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is crafted with love and some incredible attention to detail. That being said, the human models are not the most impressive things to look at, and the voice acting isn't the greatest, but none of it detracts from the experience of this beautiful game.   Gameplay 9 There is no hand holding in this mystery game, and once you start, it is all up to you to piece the puzzle together. With some wonderfully unique gameplay elements, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter succeeds in delivering both an enjoyable experience, and an immersive one.   Story 8 A compelling story that keeps you playing and thinking until you're done. Even once you have completed the game, you'll think back, pondering several possibilites. However, for how engrossed I was in solving the mystery of Ethan Carter, it was jarring how short the game was. Easily beaten in one sitting of a few hours. They could have taken this one a long way. But perhaps that's the beauty of Ethan Carter's story. It isn't dragged out, it just is what it is.   Multiplayer N/A None here, the best you'll do is solving the mystery with a friend sitting at your side.   Replayability N/A Only worth going back to if you missed something, or for the beauty of the envrionment. Other than that, there isn't much of anything to replay this game for. I'm giving this one a N/A simply because I do not feel replayability should be a factor in mystery games such as this. Once you know the story, you know it. These types of games are not designed to be replayed, so keep that in mind.   Overall 8.1/10 First, I was stunned by the envrionment and sounds. Next, I was thrilled by the gameplay elements. Finally, I was enthralled by the story.  Though I don't know I would recommend Ethan Carter for full price (simply because of the shortness of the game), absolutely pick it up on sale if you enjoy a good mystery.

												Review in Progress:So far I think I'm still on Chapter 1. But for the sake of spoilers. I will not talk about the plot or what happened so far, but I'll give you the premise. I'll just focus on the gameplay and everything else.So as some of you might know already. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is about a detective, Paul Prospero with supernatural powers who received a letter from Ethan Carter who claims to be in danger. He came to Red Creek Valley to find out what happened to Ethan.In the game you control the detective in first person mode. The very first thing I noticed is that the game is absolutely gorgeous even on medium settings. On high, it look on par with Skyrim in my opinion. The game run quite well on my GTX 760, though there are some occasional stuttering, which still appear even when I drop down to medium. Though it is not truly noticeable.The game does not hold your hand at all whatsoever. You are free to explore the Valley, which is a lot bigger than I originally thought. There are puzzles and items here and there that give you some backstory. The first big puzzle you encounter involved a train. (You'll know what I'm talking about if you play it) This is when your paranormal powers come into play. You can investigate the scenes and put clues together. Once all the clues come together. Paul special ability come into play, where you can put the entire sequence back in chronological order and experience what truly happened at the site. It's quite a fun and challenging experience. The next puzzle I encountered was with a house that warped, and you have to put the rooms in their correct place to solve it. (Which I am stuck on at the moment). As I said I'm only in Chapter 1, I think. So I'm sure there are many other gameplay mechanic I have not seen yet.The voice acting so far is very well done. Paul sounds like your grizzly veteran detective who have seen it all. He sounds unnaturally calm with all the weird stuff going on around him. Which really add to the mysteriousness of his personality and his past. The soundtrack is also very well done. Though there are very, very few jump scares. The soundtrack provide a sense of uneasiness that really keep me on my toes. I constantly look behind my back, thinking there was something behind me. But other times, the soundtrack get incredibly mellow, and when you look at the beautiful world that The Astronauts studio have created. I was amazed at how well the music and the scenery mixed with one another.If you are have play Murdered Soul Suspect before and somewhat enjoyed it at least. I think you would really enjoy The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. As I said, the game doesn't hold your hand at all. You are left to be your own detective and figure out the gameplay mechanic for yourself. It's quite enjoyable.The best thing about the game so far it's the environment. Incredibly mysterious and calm at the same time. I'm terrified while playing this because I literally have no idea what to expect next yet I'm intrigued because I really want to find out what's going on.Right now on Steam reviews. There are 72 positive reviews and only 1 negative. You can see why I'm really enjoying this. I highly recommend this based on what I've experienced so far.			"

												An exquisite experience of a game visually, emotionally, and story wise.  It is filled with exploration, mysteries that need solving, some minor puzzles, and lots of atmosphere.  It is not for everyone.  You won't find any fps action here or deep mechanics.  Its amazing in its simplicity and really hits the heart if you fully immerse yourself for the ride.  I played it in the dark with my headset on late at night and i was delighted by the mysteries as they unfolded.  I'd have to give this a 10/10 for an indie title that doesn't disappoint and which left it's mark.			"

												Paul Prospero, a detective with a unique skillset, is called towards a piece of fan mail as though the sirens themselves would emerge the moment he sliced the licked adhesive apart. A boy named Ethan Carter writes to him, detailing some dark happenings in the hidden countryside town he resides in. Paul realizes that Ethan wouldn't have chosen him if these dark things wouldn't require his particular abilities. His last case shall be this one, Paul decides, and sets out to the breezy hillsides of Red Creek Valley. Within minutes of arriving, he comes across a series of potentially deadly traps in the woods just on the outskirts of town. This case will be anything but ordinary for most people, but Paul Prospero is used to it.The Vanishing of Ethan Carter takes some elements out of Murdered: Soul Suspect’s playbook and gives the player the ability to piece together crime scenes through supernatural ability. Whenever an important element is visible, you can interact with it to see Paul’s thoughts on how it may all fit in with the current scene. Sometimes he’ll even be able to locate a missing object by peeking through a ‘magic mirror’-like thought process. By arranging the scene to be exactly as it was at the moment of death, Paul can see the entire final minutes of the dead through a series of flashbacks. All of this is taught to the player by letting them discover each of the functions on their own. With no tutorial some players may find themselves a bit lost at first, but once you've gotten the first case down you've pretty much gotten the hang of all the skills you’ll need to progress.Through scraps of Ethan’s writing laying around, we learn that he’s a pretty creative kid. If you’d ever asked him, he’d probably tell you his inspirations were Poe, Chandler, Lovecraft, and Verne. With this talent comes the evidence of a disturbed mind and a town with a secret underground some people are all too eager to get to. Some of his writing fits in with the events in town that you learn about through the paranormal mystery puzzles and newspaper clippings sitting around. There was an ever-present sensation in the pit of my stomach that something was up and it probably didn't want me here.There was a lot of time to ponder the events of each case and how they related to the big picture, thanks to the sheer size of Red Creek Valley’s map. While not a fully open world, you can get to most places through a handful of paths and practicing a little mental triangulation as you work your way around. Nooks and crannies leading to quiet spots in the shade of the forest or some tossed away rotted wood planks that once upheld something or other are all over the place. I had the option to run everywhere, but I found myself utterly entranced by the almost photorealistic, if slightly dreamy, visual work done by The Astronauts. Every few steps was another gorgeous vista overlooking a lake. Every rock looked sharp enough to scrape my skin on. It’s hard to believe that this was all done in Unreal Engine 3. If you've ever looked at a single screenshot of the game, the visual fidelity remains that consistent for every backdrop.Several times I sat down under a tree for a few moments, watching as the knee-high grass whipped around in the wind. I closed my eyes and took in the soundstage. So perfectly crafted, small sonic details most games don’t have the time, money, or the will to reproduce so crisply. Had I not been watching the vivid countryside dancing before me just seconds before, I would have sworn I was listening to a Chris Watson sound collage. Positional audio is one thing that developers rarely get right, but it is one of the most essential elements in establishing a truly enveloping sense of place. When a crow cawed above my head, the sound moved realistically as I turned to face the source. Bug screeches, bending branches, rattling metal constructs, all represented with care. Headphones are an absolute must.It isn't all purely idyllic, only a handful of shortcomings stain the pages of Ethan’s story. The first issue comes from the voice acting, which is about as stale as moldy bread. Paul himself performs the gravely-voiced detective role just fine and Ethan sounds much like a kid his age would, but any of the other supporting characters sound very off. The character models are another problem, their design and models not matching up to the picturesque backgrounds. They are stiffly animated, weirdly textured, and lack a lot of depth which would help them blend in more with the backgrounds. I won’t say it’s something like the toons sitting in a bar with Bob Hoskins in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but it is very noticeable. Some may find the game length too short, but I personally did not find this to be a big deal.At a short 3 to 5 hours, Ethan’s adventure is over relatively shortly. But the game is always presenting you with something beautiful to look at, something suspicious to chew on, or some puzzle to solve. It even changes up the mechanics here and there to help keep things feeling fresh, avoiding too much repetition in the more game-y mechanics. This is a game which can be enjoyed by those who want a little meat on the bones they find leaning against a tree in the forest, reminding me a lot more of Ether One (a game you must check out if you enjoy Ethan Carter, by the way) than Dear Esther. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is meant to be taken slowly, absorbed like a good book dripping with detail. The ending may not exactly be the most surprising and some may find themselves a little disappointed. But the journey towards it is full of heart and imagination. Much in the way that Ethan Carter himself is.Did you enjoy this review?

Intro:The Vanishin of Ethan Carther is more of an art than a video game, it's simply beautiful and filled with stunning visuals and breathtaking sceneries. But unfortunately, that's all it is. I feel like this is closer than a tech demo than a full game, don't get me wrong though, I'm not saying it's a bad product. What I'm trying to say is that it's more of a one trick pony. You get the absolute best graphics ever seen in a video game here, but that's pretty much all you're getting out of it.Pros (+2):- Intriguing atmosphere and beautiful world design- The absolute best graphics quality in any game: Photorealistic visualsCons(-9):- Almost zero replay value- Disappointing dialog and weak writing- Very trivial and easy puzzles, there's zero challenge- Extremely short and linear for an open-world experience- Basically a walking simulator, there's not much gameplay content in it- Voice acting is pretty bad, even though there are very few spoken lines- Incoherent story, weak narrative and nonexistent character development- Although justified by the lore, every sub-story and puzzle feels entirely out of place and random- A cliché ending that we've all seen a million times over already (It was all a dream/not real)Gameplay = 5/10 ; Audio = 8/10 ; Visuals = 10/10 ; Story = 6/10Verdict: 6.5/10 - Above AverageHonestly, it's quite hard to recommend this game but at the same time it's also difficult not to recommend it. This is one of those titles that makes me wish there was a neutral option for reviews. Vanishing of Ethan Carter definitely is not everybody's cup of tea, and not everyone would be able to connect with it the way they should. The main selling point of the game is photorealistic graphics and it's in fact the best visuals I've seen in a video game so far. The breathtaking graphics alone would be a good enough reason to purchase this game, it simply looks fantastic.			"

												I got the opportunity to play a preview of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and I fell in love instantly. The narration and voice acting gave me the same feeling as Alan Wake did and the environment is stunning. My favorite part was how the character was able to use his abilities to unravel the past and put clues together. Honestly the investigation mechanic is exactly how Murdered: Soul Suspect should have done it. I would recommend that you consider trying it for yourself. Oh and this game isn't afraid of gore and graphic scenes lol.You can watch my playthrough here:

 This Game was one of my First Walking Simulators. I played this game with zero expectations. The Graphics are wonderful and detailed. The Story is wonderful and i love the mystery stuff in this Game. The Game takes a huge factor in exploration and discovery. It contains no combat or explosions of any kind. Red Creek Valley looks perfect and even when the Game is ""only"" 8 Hours long it was a nice little journey. The only Question of the Story is: ""What happened to Ethan Carter?""Its Great!*RECOMMENDED*			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a first-person story-driven mystery game focused on exploration and discovery.You are Paul Prospero, a paranormal investigator. You go to Red Creek Valley after receiving a letter from Ethan Carter. It appears that some kind of being has been awakened as a result of the teenager’s adventuring and is wreaking havoc on the minds of his family. Gifted with a particular form of perception allowing you to visualize past events once the relevant elements are in their “correct” place, you explore the string of murders as well as the vanishing of Ethan Carter.The game consists only of walking and exploring together with some light puzzling and side stories. Unfortunately, it takes only something around 4 hours to finish the whole game and the few puzzles are just too easy.The graphics are absolutely amazing. Each area is distinct and beautiful. The sound is delivered in form of ambient strings and digital chirps that amplify the dark and creepy tone as well as engrossing environmental sounds. The voice acting is also good, could be better and more, but it is forgivable.Overall it was a great journey. Worth to play, especially because of the great graphics.Sounds 9/10Graphics 10/10Gameplay 6/10Atmosphere 9/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

Game world would be more beautiful if there were more games like this one. This is the game, which sticks in your mind.StoryPaul Prespero (detective - you), starts the game in an unconventional way - in a train tunnel. Strange letter from a boy named Ethan Carter brings you up here. You set off on a journey to find Ethan, but it looks worse than you imagined. You are on Ethan's tracks, who is a witness of the various murders. Thanks to your ability to elicit memories, you reveal every murder and you are also slowly getting into the story of Ethan.

GraphicsGraphically perfect game, beautiful environment of Red Creek Valley in the autumn. Even at low details game looks quite nice. The game becomes unique thanks to real objects, which they graphically brought them to the game. I think it's very interesting and you have to see how it is made HERE[www.theastronauts.com].

GameplayThe game is perfectly optimized and even if i do not have a great computer, I was able to enjoy the game at high details. The game is processed in the open world, which means that you can move freely and explore different parts of the world. Shame is that you can not save game (The game has autosave after passing each murder or puzzle). Also I recommend to pass all parts of the story, because if you do not complete all murders or puzzles, the game will not let you do the final ending and you'll have to go back (just like me). In severe situations, I recommend this guide. The game has touch of horror game. The game can be complete in 3-4 hours. Missing console.PriceI have shared this game from a friend and the price is acceptable to what the game offers.+ story and surreal ending+ atmosphere+ graphic processing+ nature sounds and character's voice+ open world+ letters from Ethan+ Interesting objects (train, traps, various houses, mine, church, crypt)- Completing all parts for ending games- console- autosave9/10 "

												Nevermind the length of this game because it is absolutely one of the most beautiful games you will ever play. Memorable, atmospheric, and hauntingly immersive at every turn of the game. Many will call this a straight-forward ""walking simulator"" and for the most part it is just that. Throughout the game you play as a detective named Paul Prospero who investigates into the disappearance of a young boy named Ethan Carter. Without spoiling a single thing, you pick up pieces of what may have happened to him by solving murders throughout the valley of Red Creek. In order to solve these murders you must figure out in which order the individual murders took place by identifying clues and placing them in the correct order. It may sound simplistic but you must use logic and careful inspection of the area in order to successfully figure out what happened for each murder. Other than the murders to investigate, the game boasts one of the most photo-realistic graphics I have ever seen. Just strolling through the area is breath-taking and convinces you that you are in a real place. The draw of the game in general is the story and its ending, which not only sums up the game neatly but also makes your head spin. This game sets a very high standard for any so called ""walking simulator"" because it is able to completely immerse you throughout its length. In conclusion, I highly recommend you buy this game, if not only just to screenshot a part of the game’s landscape!			"

A mystery to solve, with clues and puzzles to get you thinking, opening up answers to solving a sequence of terrible events. Take your time, explore the areas provided as there are some little easter eggs in this game that make it all the more intriguing. Too short - I wanted more, but the game is time well spent.

												Now this has to be a prime example to every dev company out there as how a game can look absolutely stunningly gorgeous with perfect performance that never drop below 60fps! The redux version solved all the problems with display resolution the original had (locked at 16:9) and it made the journey even more beautiful.You play as a paranormal detective, on his last case - where you get a letter from Ethan calling for your help. As you arrive in Red Creek Valley, you'll be struck with an insane amount of details around you. The vistas you'll be seeing in this game are just pure art! No screenshot can do this game any justice.The narrative is something completely different to standard adventure games but it blends in perfectly with the atmosphere. It's slow, casual, and cosy. The game never holds your hand and as you take the role of Paul Prospero, you're free to roam the Valley as you please, and at your own pace. There are only a few puzzles in the game and all of them can be finished within a few hours so please take your time to enjoy the visuals. It's completely worthy, and Ethan's story is a very interesting one even though I semi-expected a bit more emotional ending.			"

Great graphics, with realistic sceneries. Especially stones, rocks, and forest roads look like real.Interesting story, though not addictive.There are very few demanding puzzles. I don't feel like it's an adventure game - more like a grapics demo with some story and interactive elements. As for the murder scene puzzles, there are only five, of which one has already been shown by the devs. Of those four left, one is demanding and three others are so obvious, they shouldn't even be called 'puzzles'. What a shame, I was really looking forward to this piece of the game.Summing up, I'd advise buying this game when the price drops below 10$.			"

Posted: October 4, 2014
												This is a hard one to review, but I will say straight out that if you're seduced by the synopsis on Steam, as I was, tread carefully. 'First-person story driven mystery game' is not completely inaccurate, but it is slightly misleading. This is much less a game and more an 'arthouse experience with walking simulator'.The plot is certainly intruiging; you arrive in Red Creek Valley, as a paranormal detective named Paul Prospero. Having received letters from a young boy called Ethan Carter, his vanishing prompts your arrival and intent to discover what happened here. Slowly, piece-by-piece you start to dissect the confusion and put together the truth...Ok, so the plot doesn't sound THAT exciting when I look back at it, and I'd have to say that's my first big problem with Ethan Carter - this game does not grip you. I felt a real sense of disconnection from the game, and never really felt immersed in it from the word go. There is a real absence of tension, excitement and thrills from a game that implies it's full of the stuff.Visually, on the other hand, it's stunning. It's easily the best-looking indie game ever made, with graphics akin to Alan Wake on a commercial level. It has that 'coastal small American town' feel to it and it certainly looks the part - the lush vegetation and general scenery are epic.Back to the more negative aspect though is the length - this game took me 5 hours - and a lot of that was via walking around rather aimlessly thanks to a couple of bugs which cost me at least two hours of gameplay. For £15 you really expect more than just 3-5 hours gameplay, no matter how some people try to justify the 'experience' and it being 'high-brow arthouse that's to be savoured'. My wallet is to be savoured too, and 5 hours doesn't cut it. Then we have the abominable save system. There ARE some locations which have hard saves written in - aka you can go to them and they save your location, but otherwise you only get a save for achieving something in the game. AKA you can stroll around for ages, not actually go to a hard save location and not achieve anything, and guess what? None of what you did saved! And then there's the fact the saves only 'save scene'. So, for example, if you partially complete one bit, want a break...well...you can't. Because until you finish that scene your progress in that scene does not save, and if you move on without saving and DO save at a hard save location? Everything you did in that earlier scene is erased and you have to start again. In short, the save system is a mess.There's also that inescapable feeling that you're just walking around looking at things - nice looking things, yes, but the game's non-linear nature means you can do what you like in what order you want, and it makes it feel disjointed.There ARE great sequences here, and I won't spoil any of them. One of them actually intimidated me and made me say 'what the h*ll...' which I liked. I like something unexpected and different, and a few scenes achieved this.But overall I paid £15 for a first-person adventure and feel like I got a very nice looking 5 hour walking simulator more akin to Dear Esther than anything else. I recommend this if you like that kind of game, but please, know it's what you're getting and not a more energetic, high-octane thriller like I was hoping for. Due to the misleading synopsis I have to regrettably not recommend it, but if they change the synopsis to a more accurate and honest content appraisal, I will reverse that.Pity it doesn't reverse my £15.

												It is hard to sum up in any given number of words what makes The Vanishing of Ethan Carter such a success.  It's exuisitely rendered vistas, it's isolated creepiness, and it's love of all things strange annd weird leve a lasting impression on you long after the credits role.Like Dear Esther, this an exploratory trip, though not as mouthy or long winded.  This is first and foremost about the senses.  The visuals are top notch using Photogrammety (http://www.theastronauts.com/2014/03/visual-revolution-vanishing-ethan-carter/) as the catalyst for near realistic perfection.  In a sense there is no reused tiled textures, just real world goodness to trick your eyes into believing this is a random and breathing world.If Ethan Carter suffers from anything negative it's the ending.  Lovecraft buffs will find a bit of disappointment when the climax is reached.  Although the game is very much an art project, the story did not have to follow suit.  But Some may find the ending satisfying.  There is no mistaking the obvious: Ethan Carter is a labor of love that deserves every bit of attention it should recieve.  Do not let this experience pass you by.  If your PC can handle the process crunching this game dishes out (and amazingly can do quite a bit without being too extremely taxing on your videocard) then take the walk through this quiet yet haunting tale.  You'll not soon regret it.			"

												Prettiest hiking simulator I've ever played, 10/10.On a more serious note, this game will not appeal to everyone.  If you prefer action-horror titles with strong thrill factors and quick plot pacing, this game may feel a little empty and...well...like a hiking simulator (albeit an absolutely stunningly detailed one.)There is no HUD in this game, no map, no compass and notably, no visual indication of the passage of in-game time (the sun is fixed about 15 degrees above the horizon, creating gorgeous sunset shadows that really highlight the team's mastery of Unreal Engine's lighting effects.)  Gameplay consists of wandering through lush forrests and crumbling turn-of-the-20th-century industrial architecture looking for small mystery scenes, usually indicated by bobbing white text over any object that can be interacted with.  The scenes weave a narrative that can be loosely linear, although finding a piece of the story's thread non-linearly in no way spoils the effect.  If you've played Dear Esther, you'll find a more cohesive plotline but a very similar feeling narrative structure.If you're looking to quickly advance the story, this game leaves very much wanting - the mini mystery puzzles are few and far between, expect to spend approximately 10% of this game actually involved in gameplay and the rest of the time exploring and seeking out the next scene.  Exploration in this game is a reward in and of itself, but not in the sense that you'll find a unique item or clever easter egg.  Rather, the highlights of exploration will be to find particularly stunning view points where the sun quite literally bursts forth through the clouds and illuminates a vast and breathtaking vista in the valleys below, or marvelling at the craftsmanship and detail that went into the making of this world (I particualarly enjoyed the crests placed on the family tombstones in the graveyard - attention was paid to even minute details.)Learning one thing early in gameplay will save you quite a bit of time and frustration - the mini crime scenes are generally confined to an area no larger than a few hundred square yards, so if you find yourself going on quite a hike looking for a missing piece of the puzzle you should go back and re-examine the scene.TL;DR - Buy this game if you want a gorgeous (the visuals alone immersed me immediately) and thoughtful mystery horror adventure (think LA Noir crossed with Dear Esther in a more Lovecraftian world) with a strong emphasis on narrative and environment.  If you prefer more action oriented games like Silent Hill or Slenderman this may be slower and emptier than you seek.  If you ever question whether a game can also be art, buy this immediately.			"

												The decisions you make as a developer will be how the consumer remembers you.The Vanishing of Ethan Carter was an experience, I came into it immediatly struck in awe at the simple beauty of the enviroment, without anything meant to draw the eye, everything came at you at one, giving you so much to observe. The way the player travels gives time to enjoy the scenery, obviously lovingly crafted by a team who knew their intention and how to reach it.But, Ethan Carter has a major flaw. Without spoiling, I will say there are three distinct points that ruined the game for me. Two of them completely deimmerse you from the game, shaking you awake from a dream by simply slamming confusion into your face, where you wake up and immediatly realize, ""This doesn't fit"" forcing you to shake your head, only to try to get yourself back into the story. As well, the ending of the game (Again, without spoiling) completely erradicates the immersion and interest in the story by simply telling you ""Nothing you experienced mattered"" making any analysis of lines of dialogue, narrative, and story telling null and void.The game itself was a nice, narrative experience, but it leaves a bitter taste in ones mouth simply with a drop of the plate, taking what could have been a finely crafted piece of art into a shabble as the explanation to the events clears all of the paint from the canvas.The game left me unsatisfied, and not that I was wanting more, it was that I felt that the thought and time I invested into the story was simply thrown away when the developers took the easy route out plot wise.I sadly cannot recommend this game, watch a Let's Play if you're curious, but the dissatisfaction with how the story holds together in the end isn't enough to warrant even 20 dollars.

												Note: when purchasing this game, you get the original game The vanishing of Ethan Carter as well as the improved version called The vanishing of Ethan Carter: Redux Although this review will talk about The vanishing of Ethan Carter in general, it's the redux version I played, I'm reviewing and I'm advising you to play, too.GameplayThe vanishing of Ethan Carter is a first-person adventure game. I don't want to give away anything about the story besides what the game's title tells you: you're investigating the disappearance of a boy called Ethan Carter. You should discover the story yourself but suffice to say it's an above average detective story with some fantasy influences that comes together nicely and wraps up in a moving ending.I will, however, talk about the gameplay a bit more than is usual for a review of an adventure game. You see, at the start of the game the makers show a message on screen letting the player know they won't be holding their hand. That's fair, but you get thrown into a game unlike any other adventure game and they don't even tell you the 'rules' to play it? That's not nice. It took me a while to figure out how to play this game and only then did I start to have fun, so I want to explain the basics in this review for potential new players. If you don't care to know about this, feel free to skip the rest of this section 'Gameplay' and continue on to 'Graphics and sound'.Note that the developers of The vanishing of Ethan Carter, too, must have gathered that most people could do with at least some information on how to play, as they made a video and posted it on the Steam Store page (it's the third video). But beware: that video shows the solution for a whole part of the game so I don't recommend watching it but I recommend reading the completely spoiler-free version below instead.In The vanishing of Ethan Carter, you'll be roaming an open world. It's not a big world but it is completely open, only some buildings start out locked and will need to be opened. All in all, the story unfolds in ten major scenes. How and where you will find each scene is up to you to discover, but you should know the following mechanics: Explore the entire game world. If you encounter an object you can interact with, that means you've found a scene. Click on an object to inspect it. When the name of an object (with a question mark after it) appears multiple times on your screen, you'll notice that turning the camera causes the words to get closer together or to get further apart. You need to focus the camera so the words merge and you only see the item name once. This will tell you two things: first, the direction you're facing when the words merge is the direction the item is to be found in. Second, you can click and hold the mouse button or the controller button to see a scene showing you where the object is located If the game says you can hold button (mouse button or controller button), that means you can see a 'vision'. If the vision won't fully trigger (only a small part of your screen is covered with the vision), that means you need to investigate further and try again after you've found or done something else. Only when a Steam Achievement pops and the game saves, are you completely finished with a scene. If you think you're ready but the achievement didn't pop and you're still in 'vision' mode (night), that usually means you just need to find one more spot nearby with a subscene to trigger, which will point you to the next scene.Graphics and soundThe graphics of The vanishing of Ethan Carter are truly gorgeous, especially the environments. It's not often I take a few screenshots while playing but in this game, I couldn't resist.The music is beautiful. Mostly soft and unintrusive, only getting more suspenseful during the exciting moments, it all fits the game perfectly.The voice acting is spot on. A welcome relief in the world of gaming these days where amateurish voice acting with the weirdest accents seems to have become the norm.On Steam's extra featuresThe vanishing of Ethan Carter has 6 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 while running the game. Most of the Steam Achievements are unlocked when solving the mysteries that make up the story of The vanishing of Ethan Carter, but there are some missable achievements, too. The good thing is, though, that after you finished the game and the credits have rolled, you can click 'continue' and complete any achievements you may have missed. Be advised that both The vanishing of Ethan Carter and The vanishing of Ethan Carter: Redux have their own set of trading cards and achievements.			"

												A fantastic experience and this is coming from someone who hasn't really appreciated ""walking simulators"" in the past. Though short its impact stays with a great soundtrack an imaginative story and some very memorable scenes/puzzles it's also one of the most beautiful games I've seen in terms of visual fidelity and graphics. It's save system is rather weak only saving after key events but I'd recommend playing in one sitting anyway to feel the full effect of the story.			"

												Great storytelling and immersion.This is a first-person exploration-based mystery-adventure game. It is relatively short and could probably be beaten in 3-4 hours. I took 5, since I spent a lot of time walking around and taking in the scenery. Cranked up to max settings, the world in this game looks incredible. I am literally using screenshots I took as my desktop backgrounds. I highly recommend picking this up when it goes on sale.			"

												PROS: The game is graphically amazing and the ambiance is as it should be.   The levels are beautifully designed. I like the way the main character thinks and how you can impersonate him. The death scenes are interesting.CONS: Storyline not present enough. Lack of vitality (it's getting long, walking for minutes with no one to talk to or without seeing any animals... The game is TOO dead).  One of the most disapointing finals for a game.  WAY too much walking around.  If you skipped something, because the game isn't really intuitive, you have to walk all they way back around the map.Some spots are not easy to find.  Took me a while getting into the mine.Not enough puzzles for the fan of puzzle games.TL;DR  Game is visually stunning but, unless you have a good walktrough or hours to waste, this game is going to make you cringe.

												I am disappointed. It took me around 3-4 hours to finish this, and there is no point on replaying it (the extra time Steam says I was playing is simply because I left it running when I went for dinner lol).The graphics may be fantastic, as well as the music, but there is very little to do in the world apart from walking/running around, and there are few puzzles to solve - 5 murder puzzles and 2 or 3 other 'puzzles' if you can call them that. That's it, but you do get to do a few hours worth of walking around the world to get to each of the puzzles (which is empty of humans and animals).The story was fine, maybe a little disappointing at the end, but the puzzles were sometimes seemingly unconnected with the story and sometimes downright annoying and what I had to do to finish them seemed counterintuitive. Vastly overpriced for what it is.			"

												I finished The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. It’s a noble failure. Best graphics I have ever seen. They perfected a new technique that translates photographs of environments into game art. They call it revolutionary and I can’t argue.The problem is not with the story. It’s well written and solidly delivered, with reasonable voice acting.The flaw is the game itself. At the start they state that the game doesn’t hold your hand, which is just a disclaimer for bad game design. They wanted to have an open-world, but they failed to explain what to do. You will almost certainly have to backtrack to the start of the game once you realise the right approach. Small spoiler: at the start of the game there are several man traps if you go off the path. Do not do the natural, intuitive thing and stay on the path. Find every man trap, even though the game doesn’t give you any explanation why you would want to. It’s typical of the opaque game design and it’s not the worst example. I had to resort to a walkthrough to finish, in other words the game failed me.It seems a game with a linear story requires a linear structure to frame it. I’d rather play Dear Esther, even though it’s not quite as pretty and the story is far less sophisticated.Having said that, if you can get the game cheaply, it is still worth buying simply to experience the environment. I kept stabbing F12 to take screenshots.http://cheyne.net/blog/2014/11/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter/ "

												I made sure that I didn't read anything about the game beforehand (except some tech stuff since I'm in game development), and I'm happy I didn't! The story is great, the constant switching between fantasy and reality is superb, and the twist at the end... AH EXQUISITE!! The game is worth all it's money! The time it took to create a world like this filled to the brim with realism and scenery you could watch for hours on end... Which is exactly what me and my girlfriend did... out of the 9 odd hours in game at least 4 were just to take in the scenery and the world building. Both of us are game devs (she's the artist :P) and we were just awestruck by the detail the developers put in the game (and the redux version...)This game is a bite sized slice of puzzle/mystery heaven! The only problem I have with the game is that the puzzles could have been a little bit harder :P Other than that the game is excellent and should be played by everyone!			"

												I have just completed this game, PERFECTED it.-Bafta award for innovation was won IN 2015 by THE VANISHING OF ETHAN CARTER.-The graphics are highly detailed, and a lot of fun, playing through.Critique:-When I play a game, if it's in FIRST PERSON mode, I appreciate seeing my hands, (at least) my feet. ..Here I saw nothing, buttons were depressed, things were picked up. No hands or feet to be seen, not even my Paul Prospero's face..no jump buttons, no possibility of falling off a cliff,no getting in water because you wanted to.If a game has a high graphic quality I favor high interaction possibilities with it,the graphics here are VERY GOOD,but the interaction was clearly limited to the storyline.There is no difficulty choice,-no easy-no casual-no nightmare setting available,I don't know if that's a problem with you, IT WASN'T WITH ME.No cloudsave between PC's.Major Spoiler FollowsThe game has limited interaction with other living beings, -There's a zombie,-A spaceman/astronaut, you even fly to space,-All he does is speculate about situations he find's then plays out the most probable scene in his own mind,-When he actually does find Ethan Carter, again, it's a speculative scene & he comforts Ethan into unending darkness;WELL ALMOST, he does hint heavily at a sequel, which I don't foresee as by this time all of Ethan's relatives are not in the game anymore!-In the carter house there is, in differing sizes and ""evil eye"" in the form of a 1/2 skull on the wall in many rooms, keep an eye out for it,ALTHOUGH THE GRAPHICS ARE FLASHY, THE GAME'S STRICTLY LINEAR STORY GUIDES IT TO THE END,SOME MAY FIND THAT FRUSTRATING AND WANT MORE OF AN OPEN-WORLD FEEL.Positive Words for the protagonist-I am a HARSH critic, :-) he is a good investigator who knows what he is looking for.At the end of it all, I am recommending THE VANISHING OF ETHAN CARTER.Game on.

Mysterious but great story-rich gameIgnore my playtime, i only played the 'Redux' version, but i couldn't write a review for that one instead.This game is incredibly story-rich, the developers put alot of time into really working up something amazing. As usual, i don't want to spoil things so i will just say that the story is complex, is twisted, and makes you ask yourself dozens of questions.I will start by pointing out few small things, first, don't get me wrong, but i felt the game was slightly boring. I loved the atmosphere, i loved the story, i loved the looks, i loved everything, but i felt like something was missing.I wasn't also pleased about the fact that you don't have a journal of activities you've did, or anything to point out certain things you need to do, you just walk, and search for clues for various cases.But, please, don't get this the wrong way. Some things cannot please everybody on every 'plane', and despite the fact that i got slightly slightly bored, i loved the game, and i do really recommend it to you.I only played the Redux version that uses Unreal Engine 4, and what can i say... Graphics were astonishing, and the game/engine were also optimized quite decently.Also to point out, i've seen people getting 'affected' (in a good way) in various ways, and this kind of uniqueness isn't very common :)GameplayYou have to find cases, and then find clues for them, you investigate murders, but you have to find them first, you might love this, or may not. I personally would've preferred to have something to keep track of events and such.The thing that i loved most about the gameplay is that you basically can solve the cases in absolutely any order you want, you are not limited in any way.Searching for clues something can be a bit annoying because you have to 'expand' your search area, without you even knowing, but... that's puzzle for you!As someone who isn't a fan of puzzle games, i am not ashamed to admit i used walkthrough guides on numerous occasions, this is what i actually wanted this game to be for me, more of a walking simulator, but the puzzles, many of them i still tried to solve myself without looking at the actual content of the guide. I mostly just wanted to know the locations of 'action'.If you want a challenge, you can do it without the guide, as i said, this game doesn't prevent you from solving cases in any order you might like.If you just want a walking simulator, to become just an explorer in an amazingly beautiful place, you can look inside a guide, no reason to feel bad about it.AtmosphereThe atmosphere, a lonely one, is as beautiful just as it is scary.It felt amazing, that whole place felt very real to me, and i wished so much that i could somehow be there, instead of being behind a monitor, moving with few washed-off keys instead of my legs.The simple music fits the game perfectly, it's relaxing, it's soft as it should be, i loved it, not much i can say about it.Atmosphere overall is beautiful. Extremely Beautiful.Special SectionI feel i need to say this out loud, so here it goes.These are the devs people should support in my opinion, they created this beautiful piece of art that will be forever remembered by putting their hearts into the game.Every aspect of it, you just feel that passion they had, you can feel their struggle and teamwork at every grain of sand you step on, and at every leaf that falls.A very talented team, that i sincerely hope will get as far as possible into the gaming world.  If they will never change for the worst, they'll always be part of the ones i love the most.Pros Complex and Unique Story Completely stunning visuals Great atmosphereCons Few glitches from time to time No logs, no journals, no maps to guide you throughout the gameFinal Scores:75/100 - Gameplay (Due to the small glitches from time to time and because you don't have anything to guide you throughout your journey)100/100 - Story (Unique, that touches people in so many different ways, and it's also very complex)100/100 - Atmosphere (If i could i would move to Red Creek Valley in the next second)			"

												There are more and more games that are tagged “walking simulator” nowadays. Sometimes they are pretty, sometimes they aren’t. Sometimes they have great game mechanics apart from just being virtual tourism, sometimes they don’t. Story-wise, they could be good or bad. I have to say, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter has all of these.Upon starting the game it felt like I was really walking in a forest on abandoned train tracks. Many games I have played are “pretty”, but usually you’ll notice something out of place, some texture that doesn’t fit into place, something unpolished. Ethan doesn’t have this problem, the scenery is all very realistic and quite gorgeous - it’s quite clear the devs took great care on the quality. If you’re getting this game because you heard it’s very aesthetically pleasing, that’s one criteria down. Performance wise, I had some micro-stutters (which seems to be a somewhat common issue and is addressed in the main FAQ on the forums). But I’m running it maxed out, and it doesn’t happen often, capping it at 60 fps for me seemed to fix the issue, but I’m not completely sure if that was the only thing. Otherwise, the game has proved to run very smoothly.The story is really immersive - it’s not quite linear and you’re allowed to to play most parts in whatever order you choose. To get to the endgame, the game makes sure you have to have come across all necessary pieces of information to do so, but before that, it’s pretty open world. It also tells you what you’ve missed, before the end, so you can go back and gather the missing information without wasting time, something I really appreciated in the design.Now the gameplay -you are actually here to solve mysteries, and you have to carefully explore and observe to do so. I’m very impressed with the way the game lets the player do so - it seems very natural, a good contrast to some very forced mystery games (where you “randomly combine everything in the inventory to try to advance the story”).I do have some gripes with the game - there are some very helpful things with the controls I could have benefitted from knowing, but at the same time, a tutorial doesn’t seem to fit too well in the atmosphere the game is trying to create. So I suggest new players browse or ask for some beginner tips (not too much in case of spoilers), it did cause me frustration because I didn’t know of some mechanics at all till I had to read a guide. Overall, this frustration lasted for a while in the middle of the game but after getting past that, the game delivered so well all was forgiven!To be honest one of my favorite “walking simulators” has been Gone Home, or something similar - great visuals and storytelling, some puzzle solving elements. Ethan added on my expectations with greater scope and deeper gameplay elements, which makes it quite a full fleshed adventure/ mystery game in my books rather than just a “walking simulator”, now. So unless you’re expecting a guns blazing, action packed game, Ethan should meet your expectations in many good ways.			"

This review is for both The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and  The Vanishing of Ethan Carter Redux. I've played both games, they are the same, the redux version has better graphics and some small interface differences. At the end of this review i explain more about the differences*. More than 20 years ago, when i first played Myst  i remember thinking, well, this game seems cool and all, specially the graphics, the story is very vague...and i don't really see too many things to do...i hope i soon have some things to do.. because if i don't i'm not so sure this is gonna work out....aand, of course, turns out, in myst, i did have some/several things to do, but in an original and unexpected way and there was a story, although not like you were expecting it to be, and it became one of the most known adventure games of the 90s (even though, it wasn't considered an adventure by many...). And that's fine, because the game was anything but a normal adventure, it was something else. You could like it, or hate it, but it was difficult to remain indifferent (once you played it).Playing The Vanishing of Ethan Carter was the first time since playing Myst...that i had a similar experience... a sort of experience that not even the following game Riven could replicate, or the other games that followed in the series. Riven was a great game, even better than Myst, but it didn't replicate this feeling, of being in a real place. That's one of the things that's amazing from The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, it's been a long time since i felt this way about a virtual designed place.... this place....this creek valley....it could exist, it could actually exist (i believed it could). And i know is not real, CGI place of sorts, and the graphics were great of course, very good, but not the greatest, and still.... and that's what surprised me, there was something else happening, i don't know, maybe because of the photographic textures, maybe just by a design choice of space, or maybe the way each stage was presented , that something in my mind, told me, this could be real.This proves to me, basically, that no matter how good the graphics are, there's something more needed for a place to be ""believable"" Something that has to be well though out and put into place. Something does have to work in a practical way.One thing that this game dares to do, is design a place and then put all the different interactions in a organic way. Meaning, if you are in the woods, and there's something to do there, and then there's a bridge in the background and there's something more to do over the bridge, you are not just gonna jump from one place to the other....you are gonna have to walk all the woods and arrive to the bridge, and then if you wanna go to the house over the hill, you are gonna have to cross the whole bridge, and climb the hill. There's just no shortcuts in graphics and places, it's all there, you believe it could be some real place. Maybe that's the part that could come across as ""walking simulator"" because you do have to walk ""a lot"" but you also do have quite a few things to do, and an investigation to complete (also you can sprint fast). You are a detective of sorts, and you have to learn what happened to Ethan and his family. And whats this weird energy around  the valley where the games takes place.I was surprised by this, because, yes, the game is in part a walking simulator (you do walk a lot) and the game itself is not overly long. But , in this case and for this game, thats perfect! for once , it made sense to me to have a game where you do walk a lot while doing some interaction with things (it's part of the experience, to discover each corner of this place, and investigate) and it's fine for this game to not be really long, because the story doesn't need it. But it doesn't feel cheap, and it doesn't feel short. A movie takes about 2 hours, and we don't think it's short or cheap. This game takes something between 6 to 8 hours, and it doesn't feel short  at all. Also, while doing the investigation you will come around certain objects, that you will look closely, sometimes even pick them up to use them someplace else. And in certain scenes you' re gonna have to reconstruct a chronology of events. Telling more would be spoiling it...because, the same as myst, this game tries to be something else...it has to be discovered... and it does succeed in making you believe it is real. The story is good, very interesting, it's presented in a very good pace almost all along and the tension remains almost all the way. I would say that during the last scenes it was a little let down, not because of the ending, but to the contrary, because before the ending you would want to know more about the characters and their story, and how it happened all that came to be, before the ending. That's in fact a testament to how good the game was at times, although not perfect.I would say the story is good enough, but no great, and what truly is great here is the experience of discovering and learning about the game world.Playing this game makes me realize how gaming has come along these last 20 years that we are now seeing new genres (or variations of existing genres) and in this parcticular case, that not all games have to be a 60+ hs experience to be valuable (especially if its not justified) Sometimes, less and minimalistic, is just as good. I was just ready to quit for good these so called ""Walking simulators"" because i'm bored to death of them, i hate just walking around, if it is for the story i play it, then i just prefer to watch a movie, really.But, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter showed me that, if there's a good reason to make a ""walking simulator"" (with a good amount of interactions, albeit minimal) and it is justified,it can be a great gaming experience, different than a movie. A gaming experience, that if done right, could be the first of a new genre, like Myst did 20 years ago.******************************************************************************************************** original vs redux version: The original  was made with Unreal 3, and the redux version with Unreal 4. Unreal 4 works by default in 64bit so it makes better use of all available memory. Textures are more clear , more shadows and there are new water and light effects. There are practically no loading times ""in game"". When you start for the first time some effects may seem worst than the original but in fact they are better, you just have to play enough to see it. Another improvement was with the sound, the fading out / fading in between different tunes, with Unreal 4 it was more fluid. Also in redux version the saving system is more precise, it resumes mostly where you left off. "

												Loving the game, loving the soundtrack, loving the environment, loving the puzzlesso much love ❥It's a fantastic first person exploration game that focus on environmental story telling, the world is filled by tiny details and scraps of information that encourage you to take your time  and explore every detail and most of the time there is not a single loading screen from point X to Y. I can't even count the number of times that i stop exploring just to be mesmerized by the view and take screenshots.Cons: Why isn't my screen bigger? jk but true			"

Verdict: The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is another pearl of indie-gaming... and a future IGF's ""Excellence in Visual Art"" finalist for sure :DPros: EXTREMELY beautiful and eye-pleasing. ""Dear Esther"" of Unreal 3 engine. Even though it's not next-gen (game utilizes DX9c), it already looks far superior and photorealistic thanks to photogrammetry technique, that've been used to make game assets and levels; Misterious, nostalgic and captative atmosphere, that reminds of Twin Peaks, Alan Wake and that favorite suspense fiction of yours; Very well made and visualized puzzle and solving mechanics, that look refreshing and keep you interested; Weird fiction horror story. Even though nothing truly original, but interesting, logical and very well told; Rather cheap for the ammount of work put onto this project;Cons:  Short experience. All investigations, puzzles and plots will take you around 4-5 hours. Took me more then 7 hours, because I've enjoyed vistas and explored the levels more, then I should; Not really open-world. In fact it's like one of those vastly huge levels of first Crysis. It's understandable, and even surprising for Unreal 3 engine though - there are no loadings between locations, few FPS drops can occur here and there as assets are loading into your RAM/VRAM; I wish puzzle mechanics could be exploited more, it's too few of them for such a great idea. Scarcity of puzzles due to owerall shortness of the game and story (but not the map, lol, it's huge); No replayability, no loading to specific scene, no freeroam to enjoy the vistas after game completion; Few minor bugs here and there at the game's launch. My experience was mostly bugless though. "

I couldn't post a review under the Redux version, so I had to install the 10GB original and run it for 5 minutes. The Redux version took me 4.7 hours to finish, so pay no attention to the time on record. It's the same game, story-wise and otherwise-wise.This would be the first game I'd recommend if you hated Dear Esther. It's hard not to compare the two, but The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is more of a game whereas Dear Esther was an experience or experiment in storytelling. To me it was an unforgettable experience, rarely a game has crawled under my skin like Dear Esther, but truth be told, I've only finished it once. That doesn't take away the goosebumps and the emotions I went through, but replayability is an important thing to any gamer. I can't help but sneer at the term walking simulator though, cos it sort of closes the door on any experiment or game not conforming to the norm. While gameplay is king, I'd rather have access to new ideas than play the 400th Mario game, because the platforming is so timeless. Restricting player movement in a game goes against every instinct in your body, cos games are supposed to be liberating experiences, but on the other hand you have highly scripted games that are rewarded with your hard-earned €60 for doing the exact same thing.Our notions of pricing is another thing that's put to the test when playing these sort of games, which is understandable, but Ethan Carter steps comfortably out of the danger zone of being completed in 2 hours on your first playthrough. It lets you experience its story by having you solve multiple murders and puzzles, but mainly murders as you walk or run through the absolutely stunning Red Creek Valley. Considering how believable the location is and my cursed compulsion to seek out every corner, I would've hated this game with a passion if I hadn't had the option to sprint and I mean properly sprint not just walk faster, which some games seem to mix up. Sprinting would've destroyed Dear Esther, but here it's unavoidable, especially with the risk of backtracking.The Vanishing of Ethan Carter looks so good you wish you had the PC to be able to max it out, at least in my case, cos with the use of photogrammetry it literally looks picture perfect. You would gladly walk, admire your surroundings and forget the gameplay, but there is no need to go exploring every nook and cranny. There are only a couple of items off the beaten path; this is no game of collectibles. The words Inspect and Read hover over every item worth looking at. To avoid backtracking though you need to pay attention, cos every puzzle needs to be solved in order to finish the game.I can't say what the story is about without spoiling it, but you'll notice right away that this isn't a detective story rooted in reality. It's a nice mix between Dear Esther and Alan Wake. Often times I was enjoying the sights and the simple gameplay of putting murder scenes together that I didn't bother putting the actual story together, cos you're so used to a paranormal angle that it's become normal, which is why I was caught off guard by the games ending. Having only played the Redux version, which has a better save system though higher system requirements and the risks of backtracking aside, the gorgeous game world, its Lovecraftian tone and a good story make it a worthy experience.EDIT:A tip from grandsong: If you're not interested in walking, in keybindings change Run to W, so you can rest that pinky finger of yours.

												Red Creek Valley is a place with secrets—not many secrets, but knowing that there are any at all makes all the difference in how you approach its world.  From time to time, you will come across opportunities to explore optional vignettes reminiscent of classic sci-fi and horror storytelling.  These each offer a different and unique type of gameplay (within the basic context of walking around and interacting with things) and are more charming and evocative experiences than the mandatory crime scene reconstructions that make up the main plotline.None of that is terribly important, though.  You don't buy this game for the opportunity to determine the order of events in four or five murders; you buy it to explore its setting.  As you do, you're sure to notice that The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is unbelievably beautiful.  Sheer graphical prowess is not typically important when evaluating the worth of a game, but in this case every wind-blown leaf and scattered light shaft contributes to the sense of place.  If we see a game that looks better than this within the next five years it'll be a miracle—or perhaps a follow-up from developer The Astronauts.  The layout of the environment is exceptionally artful and, to players of a certain disposition, lends itself to another level of appreciation for the game.  When I first began playing, I must have spent twenty minutes simply admiring the paths that crisscross through the small opening area.  While the points of interest for gameplay purposes within Red Creek Valley are less than a dozen in number, they are placed in such a circular fashion that each has two different routes leading to it.  This enhances the believability of the locale while, again, being impressive and pleasurable in its own right for those inclined to enjoy the relationships between places.Music and ambient sound are as lovely and work as hard as the visuals in bringing this place to life.  As I played, now and then I realized that I was feeling a reverence for my surroundings that I find to be rare but nonetheless is one of my primary motivations for playing games.  The Vanishing of Ethan Carter gave me a sense of Being There that reminded me of other favorite experiences like Fract OSC and Ico.  Some might find the game part of the game to be thin or overly brief; I would argue that it's fine for what it is, which is an excuse just to be in this magical world.			"

												This was a pretty stellar exploration game. You play as Paul Prospero, a sort of psychic detective hired by what is presumably a dead Ethan Carter to investigate his disappearance and a number of murders in a small mountain/lake/mining town.The dynamic for revealing the pattern of each murder and finding certain clues was really cool. Basically, each piece of evidence allows you to peek a little bit more into the past until you finally unlock sequences of memories that, after putting them in the proper order, reveal what happened for each murder/disappearance. However, that is still just a small part of what this game is about. As you find pieces of stories Ethan wrote, you often unlock other sequences that end in reveals that further send you along your path of investigation.Attention to detail is important with this game. There are subtle cues that let you know sort of where to look or what you might have missed. These largely take the part of weird flashes in the distance. You can also easily find yourself wandering around wondering what to do next, but overall, once I grew familiar with the game and started to take note of the cues, my experience was far more straightforward. Of course, by that time, I had spent plenty of time enjoying the amazing graphics this game boasts. The game is truly beautiful, and attention was spent giving everything the little details that really breathed life into this game. From little nests to birdstains and moss on rocks, weather worn surfaces, and so on, this game really nailed it on a visual level. In this regard, it boasts similarities to Dear Esther, for example, but in a far superior fashion.The music was also excellent, and ofttimes completely creepy. You start wondering when some crazy creature is going to jump out at you or some beast is going to start gnawing on your body, lol. Really, really atmospheric music that adds to the mystery and sometimes tension of the game.As far as the story itself, it was also really well thought out. At the end, you kind of have to chuckle a little bit even as you feel completely saddened by the revealed source of everything that was happening in the game. The whole time, it keeps you guessing a bit, and then once the final reveal happens, you start having personal revelations akin to having watched the Sixth Sense for the first time (in that all the seemingly disparate events all tie together at the end and seem obvious in retrospect).I found this to be a thoroughly enjoyable experience and one I can easily recommend to anybody who loves games (and especially exploration/mystery type experiences).I give this ten ""solved murders and creepy piano runs that sort of make you jump"" out of ten.

												For me personally Ethan Carter is a pretty disappointing, though still good, game.I've really come to love narrative driven games that focus on gameplay like exploration and roleplaying, Gone Home and Kentucky Route Zero being two of my favorite examples. Ethan Carter was supposed to be like them so I was really looking forward to it, but it ended up falling real short compared to them. Most of my disappointment stems from the fact that the devs, The Astronauts, have been in the industry for a while (They're ex-People Can Fly, including the founder) so I expected more than what we got narrative-wise.First of all the game really is gorgeous, the soundtrack is quality stuff, and the atmosphere really is great but this becomes a problem as you get deeper into the game, it’s clear The Astronauts put way too much focus on said environments instead of making an engaging game and narrative. Red Creek Valley is beautiful, but it’s empty. The whole game world is just too big for its own good so you'll tend to find yourself running through deserted forests with nothing to do. The gameplay also starts off promising with the investigation of murder scenes but this eventually becomes extremely watered down and the gameplay just kind of devolves into the exploration version of pixel hunting. And that's another problem of this game too, it’s just too obtuse at times. The Astronauts laud themselves for not holding your hand but it goes too far in the other direction and it can be tricky to find what you need to do to progress. Also not being able to manually save is just dumb and it just seems grognardy. Finally the obtuseness is more of a problem than it could have been because you have to find every puzzle in the game to beat it and if you missed some, which there is a good chance that you might, then it can just kind of kill the pacing right at the very end.The narrative is also really barebones, which for what is supposed to be a narrative-driven game is a detriment. The characters are mostly all flat *ssholes so you really don’t care about them, which kind of alienates you from the plot. Plus the ending is just unfulfilling and just feels like a twist for the sake of one. In the end it didn’t leave an impression on me at all unlike some of the supernatural story-driven games I love like Silent Hill 2, Rule of Rose, and Deadly Premonition.The Astronauts should have taken more cues from Gone Home. Gone Home may not have looked nearly as pretty and its world was much, much smaller but it was just so dense, filled with tons of stuff to find that built on the narrative that Ethan Carter really lacks. It also was tightly paced with no padding unlike Ethan Carter's wandering and backtracking.This review sounds pretty negative, but it’s more out of knowing that this game could have been a lot better and out of disappointment over how hollow it feels due to the focus on style instead of substance. It’s still overall a good game  worth your time.  I’m just happy that so many people seem to enjoy this game. Video games don’t need combat to be games and video games can really tell engaging stories if the effort and skill are put into them. I want games like Ethan Carter, Walking Dead, Gone Home, and KRZ to succeed so  more can be made so despite my misgivings I’m glad Ethan Carter exists and is doing well and I hope The Astronauts can improve for a second game.

												Very overhyped. Recommended as ""art"", but it's an interactive story, not a gameI've got to admire the makers for giving us a distinct and beautiful open world game with a melancholic and eerie atmosphere throughout. It's like wandering around a weird abandoned wilderness that lies somewhere between a Stephen King novel and Myst. The graphics and music can't be faulted.However, as much as it has shown great potential in the likes of Flower and Shadow of Colossus, this to me is a sign that this indie trend of ""games = art"" is getting a little tired, at the expense of producing a game that actually has gameplay. So you get a fanbase easy to please by a world with a nice setting atmosphere and graphics regardless of what the story and gameplay are like.I had my eyes on this since it was released, and really wanted to like it, as I heard ""Lovecraftian point and click adventure"" and thought ""well there still aren't enough of those"". saw the trailer and screenshots and was convinced.Unfortunately though this barely functions as a point and click game. Sure the reviews clearly say already this is ""short and sweet"", some estimating the game length at 4 or 5 hours. Mine has been logged at around 6 I think, but I spent so much time backtracking I could have done it in half the time. More on this issue I had later. Reviews online have also referred to its ""restrained story"". No kidding, there barely is one, and I found the ending disappointingly anticlimactic in terms of gameplay and cryptic and somewhat cliched in terms of the story resolution, also the ""Lovecraftian"" setting was hugely overstated. It works more as a Stephen King psychological horror than anything else. .Regarding the point and click functions, I found every puzzle laughably easy once you work out the logic behind the game, which takes a while, because perhaps not unusual for a point and click, it does basically throw you into an open-world wilderness at the start and leave you to figure out how the basics of the game work as you go along. So as stated I spent half the game backtracking and doing bits and bobs of puzzles in a weird order until I figured out how the process of puzzle solving works in this game. Once you do get it it's exactly the same thing every time, doesn't get any harder, if anything with the last few it gets easier. A learning curve doesn't exist in this game.This game is a pleasant experience and journey, and the basic story surrounding the family is rather moving, but don't expect much of a game or a challenge out of it, and I frankly wouldn't bother unless it's knocked down to under £10 in a steam sale. The whole atmospheric Lovecraftian point and click has been done far better before in my opinion in the Darkness Within games, which had more puzzles, more gameplay and a darker atmosphere to them, despite presumably having a considerably smaller budget and less slick graphics.P.S. As stated by reviews online and on steam, the autosave system does indeed leave a lot to be desired			"

												It's a beautiful, but grim, puzzle solving game with an interesting, albeit a little cliche, story. A bit of Myst, Murdered: Soul Suspect, and even Miasmata (great games, make sure to play them).The game has beautiful visuals and looks even better in Stereo 3D (look up a mod that enables this mode in Internet, I've played it on LG passive 3D TV vis nVidia 3DTV Play).The main downside is that the story is really short.

												I'm quite skeptical when it comes to indie games, because the lower budget often means worse graphics. Nevertheless, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is definitely one of the best-looking games I've ever played, and in that it's quite ahead of AAA titles like Far Cry 3. What you get is what you'd only expect from a short demo for benchmarking, to see what kind of effects your graphics card can handle. With Ethan Carter, it lasts 4 hours and you're in full control.As for the story, there's a mystery at its core and a twist, as in a detective novel. I did not like it much, but it was not boring. I also didn't like the game's attempt to mimic Amnesia at one point. It should have stuck with being an amazing walking simulator to solve clues, with decent voice-acting and beautiful background music. It's definitely not a horror game.Get the game if you like adventures and crime solving, or if you're captivated by astonishing visuals and sounds. Keep in mind that it's quite linear and short though, which can still be a good thing if you need a break from those 30 hours long open world games.			"

												Fantastic game. At one point I was so scared that I had to stop playing the game, honestly haven't been this scared in any entertainment medium ever.Best looking game I have ever seen. The use of photogrammetry to create the photo realistic environments left me completely stunned and being able to run a beautiful game like this on 4k was a HUGE plus(it's very well optimized)Story was really interesting. Kept me intruiged and entertained throughout the entire game and it was paced so well and the lack of hand holding combined with the lack of UI got me completely immersed and made me feel like a detective.I also love the business model. A short game(almost like a double length movie) for a fair price. I crave more games like this.The music is awesome. It's beautiful and it has just the right amount of scary moments and upbeat moments to keep you playing and keep you interested in whats going to happen next.I livestreamed everything on my twitch channel (www.twitch.tv/wheeze202) and I have never played a game that has generated more highlight worthy moments. I will definitely buy the collectors edition to support the devs and get that lovely soundtrack.			"

												A mystery game, you play the part of Paul Prospero, a detective of the occult, who travels to Red Creek Valley after receiving a disturbing letter from Ethan Carter. You immediately find a load of traps ready to kill you, followed quickly by gruesome murder #1. Things spiral out of control from there, and you have to save Ethan Carter if you can, from an inexplicable horror.Graphically, the game looks great, with beautiful vista’s and disturbing sights following one another without a sense of break in the flow. The sound design is also good, with mention to be made of some high quality voice work, always important in a game of this nature. The gameplay, whilst it’s not set at a huge pace, really lends an air of investigation – you need to find all the clues to advance your knowledge of this case.Definitely recommended!

While I was leda to believe there was exploration, this made me think of skyrim. and that was my mistake for comparing anything to skyrim!This game is more linear in objectives than the impression given by the makers and producers of the game, but...I love it. I am torn between my OCD story telling and Love of Horror to complain too much.All in All The Vanishing of Ethan Carter was a delight for me to play and I really hope to see more games just like this one with bigger maps and more freedom on Quests.Beautiful and refreshing Horror Mystery Concept. I absolutely Recommend this game, it was, regaurdless of my sadness that it ended so quickly, it was worth every penny and I enjoyed every second of it.I was able to play this game on the lowest graphics smoothly on my Surface Pro with HD Graphics 4000 and it still wowed me. This game felt more alive than Most games today.			"

Picturesque Red Creek Valley conceals a haunting, unearthly tale that is short but worth your attention.Many have called The Vanishing of Ethan Carter a walking simulator and I can't really argue with that. I am, however, entirely OK with it. It's an impactful, atmospheric experience to hike through this painterly landscape with events going on around you that regularly blur the line between the supernatural and the mundane. The violence in this game is, in fact, more affecting since you as the player never swing a sword or fire a gun. Puzzles await you at numerous locations in the valley. They use simple mechanics, mostly to good effect. This game isn't trying to be a full on puzzle game, there aren't enough puzzles for that, but what's there generally does a good job of keeping you thinking and feeling involved. A few of them did frustrate me though. Keeping things vague, there was an instance where the missing piece that I needed was a smallish object on the ground that I didn't realize I could pick up until it was highlighted as I stumbled over it. Another case left me unsure where to go when a small drop in water level opened up a new path that wasn't sufficiently obvious.Clocking in at five hours for a thorough, 100% completion playthrough, this game's biggest weakness is that the journey ends too soon. I switched from the Redux version to the original for a second time through and this time finished everything in 110 minutes. I noticed little difference between the two versions. No change in the story or puzzles and the visuals were about the same. The save system in Redux is superior and the default camera movement controls were also preferable in Redux. Unfortunately, with the mysteries of the story unraveled, my second go-round lost much of the magic. There isn't much replay value here unless you just want to look at the scenery, which may very well be worthwhile in VR, but I can't comment on that from personal experience.			"

												This is a stunningly beautiful adventure game played from the first person perspective. I did a mistake by calling such a game an FPS (see my Stanley Parable review) so in order to avoid the ranting of other gamers let's clarify that while it does resemble that particular genre it does not have any weapons at your disposal. You do not fight, you do not have boss battles, you do not even have levels to complete. You just walk in a vast, wonderfully crafted world and you are completely free to go anywhere you want to. You play a detective who arrives to the fictional area called Red Creek Valley to find a missing boy, Ethan Carter.You can inspect objects throughout the game and you also find several dead bodies. The idea of every ""section"" of the game it to find out how the people in question were killed and by whom. Once all items / objects are found / inspected, you can utilise your sense ability which enables you to reassemble the murder from the various ""memory"" fragments given. Once the chronological order is selected properly you can move onto the next piece of mystery.I can't say enough how good the graphics are in this game. The atmosphere (thanks to the accompanying sound effects and music) is just excellent and it makes you stop and look at your surrounding area several times. And the game lets you do that - there's no time limit and no way to die and reload. You are free to complete the mystery at your own leisure.Oh, yes, and while the game has excellent graphics it does run very well - I have to admit, though, I encountered some occasional stuttering which various forums seem to confirm. Hopefully, one patch will fix this as it is an underlying issue irrespective of the hardware you have for the game.To summarise: Ethan Carter is an interesting, new take on adventure gaming. In my opinion, it is a rather unique and wonderfully done software that - and this is important to highlight - may not be to everybody's liking. However, if you liked Dear Esther, Gone Home or Stanley Parable you may just as well enjoy this one.			"

												I enjoyed this game.I know there are those who decry these ""walking simulators"", aka exploration Adventure games, but I am not one of them. I can enjoy a game that when done right allows a person to explore a world and soak in the atmosphere while trying to figure out what the world is about and what mysteries it holds. I appreciate a game with visually pleasing artwork for me to walk through and take in, especially with some lovely vistas and other sights .Most importantly, I don't mind hunting down for clues and putting things in their places or reading/listening to be told what has occurred. So for me, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter was a good game. A tale of mystery and death, strange happenings, and a certain somberness all in the setting of a child like view of small wooded town of the past.It is by no means a great game for me on the mystery front, where I rarely had trouble figuring out how the murders happened or how to solve a puzzle beyond the rare prompt not showing up the first time through, but for a once-through I enjoy the story as it went through much in the same way I would an old Amazing Fantasy, Outer Limits, or Twilight Zone, Ultra Q, and their kin because I was interested in what would happen next. Though I will say one thing took me by surprise that I had passed off previously when seeing the clues as an oh so standard static game image 07:00 of the clocksIt's story was well done and that's always the main crux of an Adventure game of this ilk, and though I expected the ending, it held it's charm and let me walk away happy with my experience. Even the final achievement ties in well to the final bit, though it left me wanting more... Now perhaps because I was playing the original version, rather than redux but I did have some problems with the audio. I can pass off some complaints with it's ""out there"" or ""things are just not quite right"" atmosphere it's going for, but I did not care for sound just dropping out as though I entered a tunnel just by walking into a building nor the same sound for a trap ready to be sprung occurring in areas where no traps were present, and thus confusing me. Minor issues all together, but I thought it was worth mentioning as otherwise it's quite nice with headphones on.I'd recommend it to others who like exploration Adventure games, as long as you don't expect it to be a great mystery game or demand much in the way of puzzle solving with some potential ""where do I go now?"" if you miss a clue. Just play Redux.			"

												I like detective stories but I had the impression that this game doesn't have a plot, it has a hint of a plot: the introduction is even interesting - you're an occult-minded detective who received a letter of help from a boy (Ethan) - when you arrive. you have to investigate the murders of his relatives, but the puzzle scenes where you try to understand what happened are too easy, there are few (or none) explanations of what happened and the ending is just pretentious (when I finished the game, I was like: ""This ending is just too cool for this game!""). The graphic is outstanding even in the first version of the game (when I played it there wasn't the Redux) and the atmosphere is intriguing, but I think it's not worth it, I finished it just because buying a game and then not playing it is a waste of money. I'm sorry because the premise was interesting but I can't really recommend it.			"

												I saw the trailer of this game even before its release. And, when I saw the beautiful scenery and the paranormal element in the trailer, I knew I want this game. Soon, it was released and not much later there was a discount, so I bought it. It had a promise of a mesmerizing game and it was! The gamer's perfect story, right?As to the details, there isn't much to tell. It is a beautiful game and that's the reason to buy it. The puzzle element isn't that difficult (once you've figured the mechanics). It's more about observance skills than intelligence. The story is influenced by macabre writings of such authors like H.P. Lovecraft, which I'm fan of. But ultimately it's very sad and leaves a touchmark of melancholy with you for some time.Apart from minor bugs and inconvenience with the launch screen, there are no faults in this game. And the developers are really polite and supportive.If you're looking for mesmerizing, atmospheric kind of game with some elements of mystery, then this game is for you. But take into account, you also need a pretty solid system to maximize your experience.My overall rating 10/10.			"

The rating for it is ""Fair"" in Nvidia 3D, but it looks fantastic with fixes from Helix Mod, a must buy for Nvidia 3D gamers. Try to avoid any spoilers, as there are lots of rewarding surprises.

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is an excellent game, and I would definitely recommend it (and I have). However, keep in mind that it is very short. By very short, I mean VERY short. I finished everything in under four hours. Everything. With that being said, it really is a great game. I wish there were more puzzles, and I wish some of the puzzles were better developed, but I still thoroughly enjoyed the ones that were there. The scenerey is the best I've ever seen. Seriously, it is gorgeous. The story is interesting, and as another revewer explained it, this whole game is basically poetry. While it is short, it is very deep. The controls are simple, and the gameplay is pretty straightforward.  Even though I enjoyed it while I was playing it, but I don't see myself coming back any time soon. Keep in mind its very short length. If the length is an issue, maybe wait for a discount to pick this one up. However, it is definitley worth playing. 7.8/10 +Scenery +Puzzles +Scenery +Interesting story  +Did I mention scenery? -Short -Few puzzles -Some underdeveloped puzzles			"

												PLAYTIME: 5 hoursThis is a first person mystery game with light puzzles and has a rich and atmospheric setting. You play as a supernatural detective named Paul Prospero who is in search of a little boy named Ethan. On the way, he uncovers the secrets of the town's inhabitants and uncovers a mysterious murder mystery. I don't want to give too much away, however the ending was a bit heartwrenching. The graphics in this game are phenomenal and the music was nice. The story was engaging. There was one or two jump scares that I was not expecting, but they were nicely done.			"

												This game is first and foremost, jaw-droppingly gorgeous. Immersive and beautiful, you will be sucked in. It's also haunting, contemplative, layered and complicated. It demands at least two playthroughs. The ending willl leave you stunned, then force you to immediately replay to see the whole game from a new light.

												9.5/10. This game was fantastic. It has been a long time since I found a game that I was desperate to play more of. This game delivers a purely story driven experience with simplistic controls that is presented in a new and refreshing way using gameplay mechanics not seen before. The end came too soon and I am desperate for another game of this type from the same developers. There are no difficulty settings and the game does not ""hold your hand""(This is an actualy thing the game tells you that it does not do). This makes the game difficult in a few places where you may be wondering where to go but helps with immersion as there is no HUD and you are free to take in the GORGEOUS environement with no distractions. This game is ♥♥♥♥ING GORGEOUS by the way. Worth the money just to see what developers can do with map/level design and visual blow the ♥♥♥♥ out of your mind♥♥♥♥♥♥ Although this game only took 8 hours to play and seems to have very little replay value I highly suggest that everyone pick it up as it has a solid plot that will leave you with a rockhardon for good stories and make you wonder why the ♥♥♥♥ you played BF4's campaign. If you like mystery/suspense(somewhat) and want to remember why video games are the♥♥♥♥♥♥then this is the one. Everyone is ♥♥♥♥♥ing about how it was too short but just take your time with it. If you're like me 95% of the story based games in your library aren't completed and it's really nice to play a shorter game that I was able to finish in a decent amount of time that didn't give me an extra 8 hours of filler that was slow and annoying. Content that is in the game is full and enjoyable. If you really don't think it's worth the $20 then put it on your wishlist(please, please do this, it's such a good game) and buy it as soon as it goes on sale. Now go forth master race and enjoy!

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a first person mystery game with some puzzles with an emphasis on narrative. I'd say, if you are in to atmospheric stuff, puzzle games, or just really like good looking environments, this game is absolutely for you.I'll say it right away; this game is quite short. Like most indie games that seem to surpass that level of quality that we ""expect"" when something is made on such a small scale (Journey, Dear Esther). As an Indie developer you can only make a game truly good if it's short (we're talking about linear traditional type of games, where it takes a long time to set up environments and set pieces). Either you make it linear and short, or you can make it open (which is a hit or miss design choice) and very long. Not only is it short, but it also has very little replayability. There aren't many things to ""discover"" that aren't already integral to your progression in the game. So once you've finished, you've done everything there is to do, as far as I know.So it's safe to say that TVOEC is one of those games that might not be worth the full price, if you don't appreciate short, but good games. I'm sure it will go on sale soon, anyways. (I'll try not to spoil anything or even mention the narrative)You kind of go in to this game not knowing much about it. It's called ""The Vanishing of Ethan Carter"", but who is Ethan Carter, and why are we here? How do we find Ethan? Do we find him at all? Is he real? Is anything real? What do I do? That's probably my favorite aspect of this game: It doesn't hold your hand, it gives you MINIMAL information and you get to put the peices together at your own pace. That's very much missing in most games these days.The game starts out putting you right in the beautiful forest of Red Creek Valley. You''ll be impressed by the visual fidelity. Screenshots don't have anything on the actual beauty of seeing this game in motion. It has a very moody, melancholic aesthetic. You could say that it's ""photo realistic"" but no, I cannot agree with that. It has realistic assets, but the actual treatment of movement, sound, and color are not realistic, they're romantic and depressing (in true Swede nature). Once you get to the first few puzzles, which are surreal, HP lovecraftian mini-adventures, you'll notice that some of them are thematically unrelated, that's because their only connection are narrative. There's sci-fi, fantasy, modern fiction, ect. all to be found in this game's stories. Which is actually incredibly creepy. It's hard to pinpoint why. I guess the surprise of seeing something so disconnected from what you expect the game to throw at you can be really off-putting (hopefully in a good way though).The consistent mechanics that go in to the strictly narrative parts of this game are fairly straight forward, you inspect things, find a dead body, and find out what happened by placing everything in the place where they were before the murder, and ""contact the dead"". It is actually a really cool idea, and the execution is perfect. Well, that's kind of all there is in this game, not including the story. It's short, but very very sweet. I'd say it's worth a swing if you're not insecure about non traditional gameplay *cough* people calling Dear Esther a walking simulator *cough*.			"

												This game is what Murdered: Soul Suspect could've been and even more if it had focused on improving its mechanism and graphics. As a person who expected a lot from Murdered being the fan of the genre itself, I really thought there's nothing else these type of games can improve on. And I'm delighted and happy to say that this game proved me wrong. Not only does this game is stunningly gorgeous in any possible way, it also has that creepy atmosphere that makes you really  think about every process you make and things you do in the game. ""This game doesn't hold your hand"" - is damn right, and I love how it isn't completely linear. You can explore and find cases however you like, there's no really a perfect order or the right order for that matter. You will end up doing the same thing in the end, and the fact that it's kinda ""open world"" with few limitations here and there is one of the pros of this game. For this price range, I'm not sure if a game that's around 4-5+ hours long could satisfy everyones needs, unless you are a fan of detective & mystery games such as myself, but I would definitely consider picking this up as soon as it hits your optimal price range. Score: 7/10			"

												Review ENG/ITAI recommend this pearl, BUT not with its actually price. You should buy it for 3-4 dollars/euro. I've played Redux version with Unreal Engine 4 and i can say it: it's graphically excellent. The story is simple, short but deep. I'm so sorry for the lack of self-shadowing. There're invisible walls, character can't jump or see his legs and game may be completed in 1 hour. Replayability is low. More games should use THIS game engine. Gameplay is funny and soundtracks are so good.Consiglio questa perla, MA non al suo attuale prezzo. Lo dovreste comprare a 3-4 euro. Ho giocato la versione Redux con l'Unreal Engine 4 e posso dire: è graficamente maestoso. La storia è semplice, corta ma profonda. Sono così dispiaciuto per la mancanza della luce dinamica. Ci sono anche muri invisibili, il personaggio non può saltare o guardarsi le gambe e il gioco può esser completato in 1 ora. La rigiocabilità è bassa. Molti titoli dovrebbero usare QUESTO motore grafico. Il gameplay è divertente e le musiche memorabili.Vote/voto: 7,8/10			"

While it's a little on the short side, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter has a great story that keeps you in suspense, has *tremendous* atmosphere both visually and audially, and really lives up to its ""we're not going to hold your hand"" promise!

												A touching story with beautiful graphics. While it looks and feels like a walking simulator it does have some gameplay elements. Game itself if very short, even if you explore all the available territory. And the territory does not play any role in game - it's just a way to immerse yourself into the world. The territory is not a throw-away like in most games - even though it has no place in the plot and gameplay, it is very detailed and is created with love - do explore all you can - game is too short not to do this. Also, if you really soak yourself with the atmosphere, you will appreciate the ending more deeply.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a First Person Adventure Game where you play as a detective trying to resolve the case of Ethan Carter. To do so, you end up in a forest, trying to search for clues to retrieve the little boy.First of all, the first thing that you will see when playing Ethan Carter is that the game is beautiful. A lot of work was done on the vegetation of the forest (as well as the buildings, the water, everything !) just to make it look as realist as possible. And it worked ! I found myself starring at some landscapes for minutes just because it looked so real.Since you're a detective, you'll have to find clues and interact with some of them to be able to reconstruct the crime scenes. After you found every clue, you now have the ability to revisit the crime. To do that, there are 4 or 5 visuals and you'll have to define the chronology of the events. This aspect of the game is pretty easy and it's well done. The story is really interesting and you'll want to know what happened in this strange forest and why Ethan went missing. ""This game won't take you by the end"".  In Ethan Carter, you're free to go wherever you go when you want. It's possible to miss some puzzles the first time and you'll have to come back later to do it (not sure if you have to do EVERY puzzle in the game to see the endgame). The puzzles are fairly easy. The only difficult part in my opinion would be finding a specific object when you have no clue about it's location. You know it's near but it could be everywhere on the ground. I would definitely recommend Ethan Carter to everyone who wants to play a good adventure game which isn't too hard to get into. The game is relatively short (between 3-5 hours) and doesn't have much replayability but these are intense hours that were totally worth it !			"

												Haunting best describes this atmospheric mystery. The music, sounds, and visuals all work together to make the world of Ethan Carter feel very big and very lonely. The story is intriguing and poignant.PROS: The way the plot is revealed is very well done, through reconstructing crime scenes and reliving short stories written by Ethan. There are many surprises, and the parallels between Ethan's stories, the events involving the adults in his life, and the revelation at the end are all intertwined extremely well. There's a lot more going on in this game than meets the eye.The music shivers and surges at just the right times and was never intrusive.The visuals, even on mid-low on my system, are stunning.CONS: A down side to this is what the game warns about at the very start: it does not ""hold your hand."" While it's nice not to be force-fed tutorials, it's too easy to miss vital story components simply because you don't know they're there. Case in point, I nearly reached the end of the game before quickly checking online for things I had overlooked. I found I'd managed to skip almost HALF of the story. What I wrote off as a ""weird house I'll understand later"" I was supposed to actually patiently pick apart right then and there. Some clues are even spaced so far apart they don't seem important or related. Compounding this problem, the game makes no indication when you've moved on too soon.To avoid this problem, I recommend finding a list of game areas but NOT using an actual walkthrough. Merely knowing you're supposed to do something of importance in an area will solve the problem of the game's absence of player guidance. This information is actually given to you near the end of the game in the form of a map, but save yourself the backtracking. A simple cue like ""I'm not finished here yet"" or ""I should take a look around"" might have helped.Despite that small issue, this was a very worthwhile experience. There are plenty of surprises and just a heavy aura of mystery that kept me playing. The game is short, taking me about 4 1/2 hours, but I finished feeling like I'd just read a good book.			"

The Vanishing of Ethan Carter - ReduxHeya folks!!I've been looking to get this game for some time now. I was not sure about buying it tho, even with the positive reviews it gets now and then. So I was just trying to find someone who would trade it for something else. Didn't get much luck there. So you can imagine how happy I was when this game got on the Humble Bundle along with few other interesting products.To the game review now.The game kind of ""warns"" you about not guiding you all the way around. So yes, you are simply thrown into the game without any knowledge what to do exactly. But hey, it's pretty much intuitive (to be honest - I did get lost for like 30 minutes once and I also accidentally skipped the first puzzle). The first few steps did give me a bit of creeps but I got over it pretty soon, because I got overwhelmed by the AWESOME environment and BRILLIANT soundtrack. The scenery is simply beatiful (if you don't mind the fact that people got murdered here and there) and the game will slowly consume you as you progress through it and through the story aswell. Sure, you won't probably like it if you are that trigger-happy player that loves chaos, mass destruction and ability to tea bag every dead body you see. But hey, it is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nice piece for taking a break from, well, basically from everything. You can pretty much play it as slow as you want to. So grab yourself a cup of tea or hot cocoa, pack of cookies and enjoy the game!ProsImmersive environment along with excellent soundtrack.Mysterious story that won't let you uninstall the game until you finish it.A relaxing pace of the game.ConsYou may get lost from time to time (its a puzzle game, duh).Can't really think of anything else right now.

												This is by far the most visually stunning game I've ever played.  I found myself stopping for whole minutes to simply gaze into the sunset or a waterfall.  No game has ever reached this level of graphical realism.  Ok, enough about the graphics.  It's fun to play.  The puzzles are challenging but not overwhelming.  The game doesn't give you guidelines or walk you through anything.  You have to figure it out for yourself.  And when you solve a puzzle, it's very rewarding.  It progresses the storyline beautifully and makes this a narrative game worth buying and playing two or three times.  It's not a horror game, though at times suspensful or scary.  It's not an action game, though at times you feel the urgency of combat.  Whatever it is, it's well worth the price tag.			"

												After two Playthroughs (one with the ""normal"" version, one with Redux) i think that i can recommend this game, if you know what you are getting.It's not a complete ""Walking-Simulator"" (I hate that term), although the interactions with the environment are very limited. The Hotspots are already defined and you cant deviate from it. In general this is a 1st Person story driven game, where you explore what happend to Ethan Carter and his family.You get a decent story, astounding graphics and an exceptional soundtrack.If you liked Gone Home or Dear Esther but wanted a little bit more gameplay this game probably is for you.On a side-note: There is one passage which is rather sinister and has a jump scare.. be warned.

You may confuse it with the games like Dear Esther, but it would be not very cose to the truth - the story here is built rather straightforward and consequent, even though you will experience some plot twists and discoveries.

												(Please note I've played 12 hours of the newly upgraded ""Redux"" version)Absolutely fantastic. I'll get the obvious out of the way first: It's one of the most vibrant, visually beautiful games I've seen in a long time. The new ""Redux"" upgrade version especially brings the environment to life and the accompanying soundtrack compliments with its haunting score. But the story is where the game really shines. The narrative puts you in the shoes of a detective on the search for a missing boy, the titual ""Ethan Carter"". As you progress, you come upon clues that you must piece together to solve various crimes that all tie together with the disappearance. Without spoiling the story, everything comes together into an ending that you really don't see coming, and so makes the impact all the more powerful.However, the game isn't without some (minor) flaws. The puzzle mechanic involved in piecing together the clues is obscure. You are literally warned that there will be no hand-holding on the learning curve and that's pretty accurate. The first puzzle will likely require some Google-Fu to get the hang of how the mechanics work. But once you've got the idea, the rest are pretty self-explanatory.The game is also not always as linear as it may appear. Some of the sequences you need to complete in order to finish the game you risk missing because they require you wander the forest around you, with no real guide as to what is expected. But helpfully, you'll be supplied a fast-travel system near the end to help you re-trace anything you may have missed, so it's not a huge problem.Those minor nitpicks aside, it's a great game with a memorable story. Definitely recommended.			"

												A mix of a Walking Simulator and a 3D Hidden object.I find both genres utterly boring in general.Puzzles were mentioned, but finding hidden objects is no puzzle solving. Resolving sequences of seemingly unrelated events, neither (although it can get pretty intriguing).A few items were collected, but no inventory. Not that it that it would be of much use. Just to be sure that I took the grenade before saving, without having to go all the way back to check. No map either. That would be of much use. Or, at least, a compass. After all, the forests have a reputation of disorienting the non-elven races. A minimal story was there. Not a bad one, to be sincere, but too short nonetheless. Hadn't I wasted so much time in random forest walks (evening tea not included), it would have taken about an hour to finish.Yet I somehow liked this game.Somehow, while aimlessly wandering with the petty excuse of searching for clues (actually admiring great landscapes in an almost totally inanimate world) the game managed to create an atmoshpere that thrilled me. Sometimes even scared me, for no apparent reason.Well, I managed to die once. (which must be some kind of a negative record).Once is perfect. Not too many to become frustrating, but enough to keep you thrilled.Perhaps the previous, enthusiastic critics clouded my judgement. Or, meyhaps, I've grown too old, and too cheap, and got carried away by the amazing artistic work, both in music and visuals (in expense of an actual gameplay). Or it was beacause of the smaller things, as the relaxing experience of using a joypad and moving at my own pace.Sometimes I imagine the game makers, having created a great 3d-modelled enviroment, coupled by an excellent soundrack, and then struggling to give the gamer a purpose to wander in it. From this point of view they did a great work. Definitely not overdoing it.In conclusion, yes I'd recommend it. Not a 20$ recommend, but on a discount it is a very good offer. After all, and despite having to install both game versions just for reviewing it, the fact that they provide fresher graphics for free (in the era of payable useless DLCs) is something I really appreciate.

												Wow. Where to begin with this title?The Vanishing of Ethan Carter takes you on not only a mental but an emotional journey through the eerily abandoned town of Red Creek Valley in search of a misunderstood little boy.Music: 10/10I loved the music! It took me to another place as I explored the town assembling pieces of the story.Gameplay: 7/10Nothing super different or ground breaking, but still very solid. Almost gave it an 8. Story: 10/10Amazing. Breathtaking. Astonishing. Bittersweet. There aren't many games where I actually care about what's going on or why. This game had me completely pulled in. Hook, line, and proverbial sinker. Replayability: 7/10This has the dust off replayability quality to it. Once you've gone through once or twice and completed the achievements, this will probably be a title you 'pull off the shelf' and play on a rainy afternoon indoors or when you're wanting to play through a story that you know is good. Atmosphere: 10/10Immersive! I play with a fancy Logitech surround sound headset and it really made the game just that more amazing. What I feel like I need to do now is experience this bad boy on an occulus. All of that being said, I feel like the $20 is just a hair too high. I picked it up for $10 and found that to be quite fair. This speaks nothing to the quality of the game as I have given this a glowing reccommendation. The story is simply a bit short and  since I am about to play through in less than an hour, $20 seemed a bit pricey. If you are a true fan of the game though, I'm sure the game is worth every penny. Buy this game! And if you're feeling skeptical, wait for Summer/Xmas sale and pick it up cheap! You'll be glad you did.			"

												5 hours, 88 screenshots and 14 achievements later, I think I can safely say it's time to review. Now you're probably thinking; ""4 hours to 100% a game? is that it?"" Bluntly, yes - But it's a 4 hours you'd be happy you gave up when you finish the game. It's hard to explain this game without giving much away, but I'll try. You play as Paul Pospero, a detective who traveled to Red Creek Valley to find Ethan Carter. On the journey, you'll see that a lot more has gone on than the fact that Ethan has gone. The twist is that you can see in to the past when core objects related to the mystery are found and put in their correct places.When you get dropped in to the game, it's all down to you, the whole ""This game does not hold your hand"" screen at the beginning really means it. There is no order in the way you solve things either - ""go do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want"" has never been so literal in a game before.Oh, and this game is ♥♥♥♥ing gorgeous. 10/10 - I would recommend this game to everyone, it's an experience any gamer needs to have.

												The game has many interesting moments and is very unique in how it plays amongst today's games, almost playing like a novel. However, the end seems very rushed, giving the feeling of a total cop-out, with almost the entire plot being open to interpretation and no definitive closure actually being given. Towards the end (which I didn't realise it would be at the time) I was very hopeful for more plot to unveil, but then suddenly finished the game and was left with more questions (in a negative way, not positive) than a sense of completion.Philosophically and visually, this game is very enjoyable but the let down of the seemingly rushed plot towards the end means that this game isn't worth the price tag in my opinion. I believe more depth on each character's actions and their turn of events would be required to make this game truly great, and it could've easily been one of the most unique and thought-provoking games of today if more tangible events had been included.Pros:         - Stunning graphics that will have you stopping quite often simply to take in the scenery.         - Excellent take on story telling; very unique and novel-like.         - Audio is generally very captivating.         - Very immersive, could be a perfect game for oculus rift.Cons:          - Plot can be very 'patchy' with a lack of definitive information.          - Late-game seems very very rushed with a lack of build up and leading between events.          - End game feels like a cop-out in comparison to the rest of the game; it just suddenly finishes.          - Voice acting can be sub par as well as character models.          - Graphical glitches and slight performance issues can affect immersion negatively.          - No allowance of quicksaving could be detrimental to individuals' freedom of progression.          - Short play time (4/5 hours) is only made a problem by the strange, uneven pacing.Generally I would recommend this game, however be warned that although it seems very well made at first, the lack of developer experience (in this rare genre of game) pokes through once you've completed the game and look back on your experience. If there is a sequel or expansion planned then this would be more understandable but this shouldn't have to be the case either way.A score of 70/100 would almost be generous, but will be given simply because the generally enjoyable aspects of the game can outweigh the many annoyances scattered throughout the story.

The Vanishing of Ethan Carter was, prior to release, one of my most anticipated indie games of the year. And can you blame me? The game looked fantastic. The story, atmosphere and gameplay all gave off this mysterious, minimalist vibe. When it finally launched, I didn’t waste a second not playing the game to completion. And then again. And again. Though this wasn’t only because I enjoyed the experience so much.The first thing you should know - in case the pre-release gameplay footage had you thinking otherwise - is that Ethan Carter is a very linear game. Though you do have some freedom in which order you wish to solve the various puzzles and events you come across, it’s still a rather short and directed experience. But that shouldn’t hold you back, because the moments of true awe stand in line to reveal themselves to you one at a time. Nothing ever goes on for too long, you’ll never get bored of anything. It’s rather the opposite - you’ll wish there was more of it, At least a couple more puzzles or something. No, game! Please! Don’t just end! Not now! We were having such a good time! Four hours is simply not enough! Nooooo!Though the game is pretty much perfect in every conceivable technical way - from graphics to sound to the mechanics - it isn’t quite perfect overall. It really does feel the game is a little too short, and even an additional half hour or hour extra would’ve helped tremendously. There’s “short and sweet”, and then there’s “too short and too sweet.” Secondly, for a game that claims it doesn’t hold your hand, it wobbles a bit too much between “this is how you do it” and “screw you, find your own way!” Though the game’s soundtrack is absolutely mesmerizing, the voice acting is only alright and never much more. Additionally, the story is decent but never much more than that. But if you go in expecting a directed artistic experience rather than some sort of open-world game, then I really can’t imagine you not loving it...especially the climax following that one chase in the forest. But hush, I’ve said too much already. Just go play it. You’ll wish it lasted longer, but only because it’s THAT good.Arbitrary meaningless score:4.5/5			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is, first and foremost, a really beautiful game. Some former employees of People Can Fly were responsible for this game, and apparently they got the employee who knew all about making beautiful enviroments. So there's a bunch of rotting old machinery among woodland forests, but it's organized so thoughtfully and animated so well that it all just seems perfectly natural and you're immersed in fears of tetanus and hidden mountain lions. Mountain lions are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.The second - and this is a huge point of contention for people as to whether the game should be bought - is pretty much a supernatural murder mystery played out between sparse puzzles in stretches of beautiful woodland forest over three hours for twenty bucks. There are some nice puzzles on display - supernatural elements play into the game heavily here, all punctuated at the end by a story written by the title character. I assure you it's not an obnoxious Stephen King style 'oooh, the little kid's imagination is special, call the ♥♥♥♥ing Overlook Hotel and ask for Mr. Torrance' plot point. There's variation, but not much of it. At one point, you have the opportunity to play a Splendaman-style (featuring the titular Splendaman character, who is Ryan Gosling of 'Drive' fame sneaking up on housewives to sell them sucralose-based sweetener) 'find the six corpses to unlock the exit' type puzzle, so I hope that all the Youtube Let's Players have bought this to scream in terrified horror at the broken oil lamps or bunnies in broad daylight. The annoying thing is, you have to stop and solve all of the murder mysteries before you can get to the end of the game, which I didn't feel the sting of because I'm the kind of smarty-man detective who worked out the murders as I went along. AND I did the house puzzle without any pen or paper, because I have a wonderful taste for ghost towns and old house layouts. So nyeh.It's a decent game, but if you don't think it's worth the price, wait for a Steam sale. And do not, under any circumstances, use the comment section to complain about price or I will throw a battery at you.			"

												A little slow at times and the narrative feels a little clumsy and childish at others, but when I came to the end I realised that it was more of an elegant pastiche than anything else (then I had to go look up pastiche to make sure that the word was indeed the right one). The controls are nice to use, the graphics are attractive, it took me quite a while to work out how the game mechanics actually work (embarrassingly long perhaps), but once I did they felt solid and intuitive.I doubt this is everyone's cup of tea. I have seen it referred to as a ""walking simulator"" by another reviewer and in some ways that's true, but overall I am glad that I played this game. I feel like I went on a journey and arrived somewhere that I didn't expect, but in a good way.			"

(don't mind my playtime, I mostly played the Redux version)Wow. What should I say about this. I played this game for about 15 minutes and instantly knew that it's going to be amazing. How this game creates immersion is almost unparalleled in my experience. The graphics are absolutely fantastic, no other game ever had me literally admiring a piece of brickwork. The Stephen King-esque supernatural mystery/horror story creates a tight atmosphere that grips you from start to end. The game allows you to seamlessly roam a vast island and progress at your own pace, solving gruesome murders along the way and putting the pieces together. The narrative is superb, keeping things vague throughout the game and ending with impact. The Astronauts, some major applause to you for creating this masterpiece!			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a slow and foreboding game that has you exploring a section of scenic countryside whilst trying to find a young boy who has gone missing (the titular Ethan Carter). You play a paranormal detective who is able to pick up clues from murder scenes to piece together what has happened. As you find a scene and investigate, you must figure out the sequence of events that led up to the murder, which will unlock a final extra scene giving further context to the killing.The scenery is beautiful, rivalling (and topping) the natural beauty found in games like Dear Esther. It could be described as a 'walking simulator' (apparantly a derogatory term for slower games where you wander the environment without killing anything), you don't use weapons or directly fight anything here, this game is rooted in exploration, investigation and a building sense of uneasiness. The story isn't exactly subtle with its fantasy, horror and sci-fi genre tropes, some of which really clash against the beautifully natural feeling of the world, forcing your suspension of disbelief early on. However, if you accept that the game goes to wacky crazy places, you can have some fun here.The story is both subtle and heavy handed at times, I recommend taking it slowly and reading every item and looking at environmental clues to get the full story.

												The best looker of 2014. Graphically a totally stunning game, which makes the game worthwhile in itself if you have a top-tier gpu. My 980 averages around 50-60 FPS everything maxed out. I have not played many mystery-games before, so I was quite new to the genre when booting up the game. The mechanics are quite fascinating, but even though innovative it does become stale. I am not sure I feel it lives quite up to it's price. I grabbed it at a sale, and am personally happy with the experience. I haven't completely finished the game yet, but it takes a lot for me to finish games. Whilst the game looks amazing, and the mechanics are very cool at first; that's not what grabbed me with this game. It was the atmosphere. The seemingly vast landscape created a sense of solitude; the kind of ""no-one-can-hear-you-scream"" kind of thing. The game executes this flawlessly. At first I thought this was going to be a pure horror game; as you walk through the abandoned, dark buildings the game produces quite a creepy vibe. If you're new to the genre; buy it. If you've played a lot of mystery games before this might seem a bit dull. All in all I do recommend it, but buy it at a sale.			"

												Quite short, story driven exploration game in an open world style environment with some puzzles. Puzzles are relatively easy to solve. Storyline is interesting and keeps you on the game to the end. The game doesn't hold your hand as it says in the game, so you might find yourself a bit lost at the beginning.I loved the atmosphere and the story, played it through on one sitting. I would recommend this for everyone, except for those that only appreciate action, as this is slow pacing and has very little of anything else then exploration.Pros:+ Visually stunning (Even more stunning in Redux version with UE4).+ Interesting storyline and puzzles. + Great music/sound/voice acting.Cons:- Relatively short (took me 6 hours to go through).- Quite easy puzzles (some might see this as a good thing)- No custom game saving (fixed in Redux version).Remember to play the redux version that you get if you have the game in steam.

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is quite honestly unlike any video game I've ever played before. It really wasn't what I was expecting and it's hard to decribe what I mean by that. It's often bewildering, sometimes strange, but it's always intriguing. Yes ok so it's played from a first person perspectvie and you have walk about looking at stuff to find those all important clues and like any mystery game there are notes and letters just dropped on the ground for the player to discover. Familiar game mechanics? Of course they are, but in this game they do tell a fascinating supernatural story and are definetly not filler or collectibles.You play the game as Paul Prospero 'a supernatural detective' and I imagine him as a cigar smoking, fedora wearing type not unlike Columbo, but I don't want to put images in your head. Anyway you've been summoned via a handwritten letter to Red Creek Valley by Ethan Carter, a young boy who appears to be in some kind of trouble and it is clear that he is going to need your help and to do that you'll need to don that fedora and do some investigating.As you examine the clues you find in the game world and interactive with objects Propsero’s inner thoughts are displayed on screen. Subtle clues to help you gather evidence and fit the pieces together. Find the correct order and the events are played back in supernatural film-reel style with a blue filter that act as cut scenes progressing the story.A point to note is that the game makes it very clear even before you start out on your journey that ""This game is a narrative experience that does not hold your hand."" That means there are no quest markers, no maps, no golden Fable-esq trail to follow. Just your own noggin to guide you. There are just a few clues to discover in the game world and you must explore, explore and explore. The world is a very beautiful place though and you'll frequently find yourself stopping just to admire the view. It would be unfair to just praise the visuals as the the musical score is equally beautiful, but also subtle and haunting, fitting perfectly with exploration and discovery.If you are into narrative experiences with lots of exploring required and a thought-provoking backstory to encourage you forward then you will definitely enjoy The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.

												In the end, you will be disappointed.I don't know where to start on this one. I remember some early marketing describing greatness of the game, telling that the game locations are based on existing ones. And that the story and the gameplay are nothing more and nothing less but eerie fairy tale everyone should experience. I had my hopes quite high, I bloody adore adventure games. But eh, it's not that simple with this one. And I'm not one of these who drool over 60FPS and 4K somethin' stuff. I pay more attention to the story, it's the most important part of an adventure game. It needs to keep you going, to keep you engaged, so you want to solve yet another puzzle and push things forward. Well, Vanishing of Ethan Carter does fail here - the story starts interesting and the fact that you aren't meant to meet anyone on your way to solve the riddle leaves you up with your thoughts. You keep wondering what exactly happened there, in Red Creek Valley, and eventually, you are disappointed. Because the ending is cliché as hell. It's worth playing once, but this is not a tale you will remember. A rather short, 4 hours movie. On the other hand - graphics are really good. I can't help but think that this is a bit of waste, considering how amazing would it be to implement them into some full-size RPG game. I mean - this is the world you want to discover and explore - but there is not much to do. It's a bit linear game with great atmosphere. But that's all. My final rating? - 6/10+ Falling leaves.+ Easy and short. May be perfect for people who prefer 'tell-a-tale' games.- The story. Why Ethan, why?			"

												To start things off The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a very beautiful game graphically & has a good settings menu but you might have to turn off the anti-aliasing to avoid game crashes while your playing.Even though the experience was a walking simulator the game had a good story, decent puzzles to solve (I really liked recreating murder scenes throughout the game) even though it was the same mechanic of using telepathy or something the entire time, I liked the amount of exploration in the game (Unleashing the Kraken & visiting Outer Space was very unexpected to find to be honest), I wish more games didn't hold your hand because when your not coddled by checkpoints or whatever it just feels awesome to solve everything on your own & the only thing that bothered me about the game was the lack of a save system which is resolved in the Redux version.For the rest of the review I'll try to explain my view of the story.When the game ended I realized that everything wasn't real in the game as Ethan's family was trying to save him from an accidental house fire & the entire game was all an escapist fantasy for him while he was unconscious since Ethan looked back at his life at how his family didn't respect his talents (A few of his family members might have been abusive too I don't know?) with writing so he was dreaming up one of his story characters Paul Prospero to save him from himself as The Sleeper.The murder scenes were a way for Ethan to express how he really felt towards his abusive & disrespectful family because he wanted them to suffer as much as possible but at the end maybe the family might finally apologize to him I'm not sure. When you the player were exploring Outer Space in the forest area & releasing the Kraken in the mines it was a way of telling the player on Ethan's influences on writing which were H.P. Lovecraft, Jules Verne, Edgar Allan Poe, H.G. Wells & many other authors whenever he went to the attic to find new ideas for stories to share to his family.When I found a bank letter in the mines I understood some part of Ethan's neglect from his family since the Dad owed money or something so when the family went poor they took their aggression to their introverted son Ethan who was talented with literature. Another thing about the murders is that the sick fantasies Ethan had while he was unconscious was his way to stay awake & his dad commiting suicide through one of his murder fantasies helped him stay conscious a little while longer through the smoke.Overall I can understand the amount of awards the game got, it's a good game that makes you think & if I missed anything feel free to leave feedback.

												Loved it. I liked the fact that it's all left up to youThe 'puzzles' can be a bit too easy sometimes and you don't get shown controls initially, but you get a great, compact, beautiful, well-told story about a missing child and the detective trying to locate him. Don't spoil yourselves if you can.If you can't -

												Do yourself a favor and read as little as possible on this game. Although short, the game manages to hold an incredible amount of story, depth, and weight into a timeframe that doesn't overstay it's welcome. Unbelievable visuals in a world that not only rewards, but requires, exploring. If you enjoy puzzle/mystery games, this will certainly top your list.Pros:+ A story that builds wonderfully throughout it's short stay.+ Did I mention the unbelievable visuals? A screeenshotter's playground.+ Incredible sense of atmosphere. Headphones definitely recommended.Cons:- The directional/positional audio in the game is sometimes jarring and sudden. Certain ambient sounds cut in and out from taking a few steps, while entering and exiting rooms can suddenly wash in an entirely new atmosphere. This was the only time I felt the immersion of the game break, and it's frequent enough to remember throughout my playthrough.- Certain pixels lit up red when looking into the distance. A frequent occurrence, but potentially an isolated one due to my configuration.Anxiously looking forward to The Astronaut's next release. A developer that has shown they are capable of making an incredible experience.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter may well have been the most visually stunning game I've ever played. The experience is enhanced by the terrific job done by the voice actor playing Paul Prospero - you, the protagonist - as well as a music score that knows when to leave the background and sting you when the time is right. Gameplay-wise, it's a first-person puzzle game-slash-visual-narrative in which the puzzles blend seamlessly into the story. You are a detective looking to solve a mystery. Piecing things together is your life's work, so here's an example of a perfect marriage between narrative device and game mechanics. User interface is simple and unobtrusive, interaction cues popping into view only and only when they're absolutely necessary, most of the time leaving the screen entirely available for the tasty pieces of eye candy the game throws at you.All in all, an intense albeit short experience which I emphatically recommend. Indeed, upon reaching the end of the game (which should take between 3 and 5 hours, depending on how often you stop to smell the flowers), unless you've got a heart filled with sand, you're bound to feel the game's emotional toll. Truly a thing of beauty.			"

												Ethans world has a mood that will easily make you forget your surroundings. Atmospheric environment, musical score, and a witful story. I especially loved a couple of expressive, seemingly out-of-the-place, almost poetic scenes, such as the flight and the dive. I love it that there was barely any handholding too - it felt like the game treats the player with respect.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is one of the best looking games I've played in a while. I can’t count the number of times I stopped moving and just lingered on a view throughout the journey. Valleys, lakes, and autumnal forests are just one of the few things that make Ethan Carter one of those games where I want to screencap nearly every single moment. The realism of the landscape, the mood and atmosphere of this game is simply awesome and sends chills down your spine. The story keeps you on edge just enough to make you curious and wonder what the next mystery will bring.10/10 "

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter was a video game that just popped out of nowhere for me, I hadn’t really read anything about it up to it’s release, or much after. It was only when I saw that one of my favourite Youtubers, Sips_ , uploaded a play-through of it that I decided to check it out. I quickly saw that it was a story driven game that I would not want to ruin my watching a video, so I didn’t.The Vanishing of Ethan Carter was developed and published by an unknown developed called The Astronauts, but this team is made up of some well known people (including Adrian Chmielarz, who was the director of People Can Fly) It is really lovely to see a small team of developers get together like this and make a game extremely refreshing and delightful to play.The story of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is really one that you need to play for yourself, do not try and watch a few ‘Let’s Play’ videos of it because this game is a wonderful experience that will be ruined if you just watch someone else play it. The game starts of with the introduction of the character you are playing in this tale, and that is a supernatural detective called Paul Prospero. Paul received a fan letter from a young lad, Ethan Carter (who has…well…vanished) This letter described supernatural on-goings that no young boy should experience. Already knowing of Ethan’s disappearance, Paul has made it his mission to find out what is going on in the small town of Red Creek Valley, and to find the young Ethan Carter before it is too late.  Want to know more of the story? Well I am not going to spoil anything, play it yourself!The Vanishing of Ethan Carter  is a first person detective game, with the events that Ethan Carter has suffered through have already completed. It is your job (well, Paul’s job) to find those clues scattered around and to put them into chronological order to how you believed it had happened – you will then see the story behind those clues. Each part to the story is split into different scenes, the clues are located in roughly the same area so that you won’t be trawling through the map trying to find clues that you may have missed – as long as you make sure you don’t just run through everything without paying attention, but you won’t have to run from one end of the map to the other because you missed one clue. Be sure to read all notes and stories that Ethan has left behind for somebody to read, they are all gems.The story takes you through a few different locations in Red Creek Valley, and all these locations are as beautiful as the next.  The Vanishing of Ethan Carter may be the best looking game I have ever played, no over-reaction.  I spent the first couple of hours just wandering around taking screenshots to upload to my Steam profile, that is how beautiful it is – I even posted these screenshots onto websites and people would be astonished and ask what game it was!  I am amazed at the sheer effort The Astronauts went through to make these photo-realistic scenes, there is a wonderful article written by Andrzej Poznanski on The Astronauts website about how they achieved this, http://www.theastronauts.com/2014/03/visual-revolution-vanishing-ethan-carter/ it is a great read.What is a great looking game with no atmosphere? The sounds in The Vanishing of Ethan Carter were as top notch as everything else. Just walking through the woodlands and hearing the wind gently whistling past with the steps my character made as he walked through some thick grass was nothing short of immersing, I really did feel like I was in the game – in the story. Gently playing in the background was the soundtrack to the game which was composed by Mikołaj Stroiński, who has also worked on the upcoming Witcher 3 Wild Hunt. The soundtrack was very peaceful, relaxing and something I would definitely buy and have on my iPod (in fact, I may check to see if they sell the OST now) Whenever I hear the music that was in the game, It instantly takes me back to the game and the great experience that I had – and in my opinion, that is what makes a good soundtrack.The game ran very well on my GTX 980 and i7 4770k and I was getting constant 60 frames per second with only minimal drops from time to time. I was playing on the highest settings on 1080p, but there were plenty of alterations you could make to the quality of the game. If your PC is a bit older, drop a few of the settings and it will still look great.All in all, I would highly recommend buying The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. If you are not much into story driven games where you are not running around shooting people – then this game may not be for you, but anyone who loves a good story with a sit back and relax nature to it (except one of the missions!) then definitely pick this up. The game spans around 5 hours, so if you are not sure if the game is for you, you may wish to wait until a sale or until it drops a bit in price – but at the current value, I would recommend it.For more reviews, head over to http://www.ordinarygamer.co.uk/2015/01/27/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-review/ .

												Despite the game's visual beauty, and though I would not place this game in the horror genre, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a macabre story depicting several horrific and depressing deaths in a very immersive and atmospheric world set in the desolate Red Creek Valley.  It combines point-and-click adventure with detective and mystery genres, spotted with a few puzzles and many flashbacks from the dead. The dark forces behind this story follow you throughout the game but do not progress beyond “creepy” or “grim.” Protagonist and narrator Paul Prospero is a seasoned detective with supernatural abilities that allow him to visualize the chronology and detail of crimes after piecing together evidence. Since you play as this single living character in the game, your skills are the only way to uncover the mysterious story of Ethan, a young boy who writes to you with a very disturbing problem. As you wonder through the game, you slowly uncover bits and pieces of Ethan’s story and disappearance, solving murders one-by-one, all in a non-linear fashion that allows you to go at your own pace and venture backwards if you miss something. Though you cannot die in the game, the opening screen does warn, “This game is a narrative experience that does not hold your hand.” The game’s focus is exploration, relying on your observation skills to proceed and uncover the pieces of the story. There are no tips, no maps, no character interactions and no instructions – it’s just you and the forest. Most of the time, there are a couple of cues to let you know you have cleared an area, usually the flashback of a character’s final moments. You have limited abilities: walk, run, crouch, interact. And there is no combat. This game is entirely story-driven and certainly atmospheric in terms of visuals, mood and environment. This game is a visual and auditory masterpiece. With the use of photogrammetry technology, the open world created here is painstakingly realistic and overwhelmingly stunning. Aside from pieces of the game that explore houses and a mine, it is entirely outdoors – during daylight – and full of rich forestry sprinkled with bodies of water. You can climb rock peaks in certain areas to get a better view, and even the far and distant scenery is texture-rich and detailed. Sun peaks through the trees, piercing the shadows, and it will sometimes fill your screen as you turn a corner into a clearing. A beautiful instrumental soundtrack accompanies you throughout the game (the theme is particularly luring), changing from scene to scene, but is in no way obtrusive to the other auditory genius of the game: wind blowing, leaves falling, bird chirping, branches creaking, rustling undergrowth, breezes swaying trees and grass, and your constant footsteps, changing slightly depending on what is beneath you (grass, branches, rock, water) and whether you are walking or running. All perfectly timed and all authentic. The grim storyline is pierced with these wonderfully peaceful nature highlights. The game can be completed in roughly four hours, but it was a very much enjoyed four hours for me. There are two not-so-obvious achievements, but other than those, you will be able to obtain 12/14 just by completing the game. Though a lot of indie games tend to have at least a few bugs or glitches, I did not personally come across a single one during my gameplay, which was very impressive. Also, Steam lists this game as having Partial Controller Support but I was able to use my Xbox controller throughout the game without ever having to resort to a mouse, even in the menus, just in case anyone was curious.Though two very different games, if you were a fan of Murdered: Soul Suspect, you will likely enjoy this. The games share many similar elements, including the investigative elements and the supernatural elements like flashbacks in order to reveal story. Both plots are very unique and have not been done before.As short as it was, this has been one of my favourite games of 2014. Even if you have no interest in the story, it deserves a playthrough simply for the visuals. Stunning game with a very interesting story.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is an excellently written, technical achievement and will surely set the benchmark for World design in years to come. If you yearn for a good story that you can really immerse yourself in then look no further, but if narrative isn’t your thing then you won’t find much else here.			"

												This game has impacted me a great deal. Perhaps like none other before. While fairly short, around 6 hours when looking in every nook and cranny (my playtime is in the Redux version), I never felt so invested before. Partly because of the brilliant graphics, partly because of the setting and mood and also the mysterious story...for me, this game is the synonym for immersion. If you like stories by Edgar A. Poe or H.P. Lovecraft, you are in for a ride. Once again, this gem has proven games to be an artform, because it's like looking at beautiful paintings in an art gallery - and this piece of art will forever hold a special place in my heart.			"

												Graphically astonishing and atmospherically imposing, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is one of the best walking simulators I have played. The writing, chock-full of noir platitudes and smug nods to pulp/weird fiction, is neatly justified with a clever twist in the ending. The puzzles are not implausible; the flavour text offers an engaging breadcrumb trail to the observant player. It doesn't hold the player's hand, as the devs deign to warn in the caveat, but it does hold our attention.The redux version is definitely more impressive and has a more stable framerate, but the original version leaves nothing to be desired. My first playthrough was on the original; the second on the redux right after. A blast was had in both.Brief and to the point, an interactive nonlinear narrative with no tricks up its sleeve. A story is told and told well. It lacks something in replay value, but you could probably go back to it at some point to walk through the woods and listen to the soothing soundtrack.			"

												Great Game!So much has been written that what else is there to say?... Except for the lie they tell in the ""About This Game"" section.  What lie?  The one that says ""It contains no combat or explosions of any kind...""   I can say with absolute confidence having gained 100% achievement that to get the Sniper Rifle achievement you have to use a grenade which makes a large explosion (and let's not forget that by doing so we kill a diver).  But what's a little lie when you get a near masterpiece.Get it at full price or wait for a sale, but get it.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is here and I gotta start by saying the game looks absolutely stunning. Very clever game indeed being only 4 hours in it feels very polished in every way. I would highly recommend. ~~~ PROS ~~~* Simple but good controls ( W | A | S | D to move ) ( Left click to interact )* All Graphics options you could ever need & nothing more.* Outstanding audio, I heard a freakin Loon ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loon )* Very Clear & Stunning Graphics ( Even with my GTX 760 2gb )* Runs exactly as expected - perfectly -* Game design  +++Now, for the hardest part of my review... the bad & the ugly.~~~ CONS ~~~* Had to use the bathroom too often. ( water sounds ultra realistic )All, jokes & humor aside... this is a must have any Adventure, Indie, Mystery, Horror Collection.Perfectly priced.... and perfect for anyone livestreaming as it requires interaction, an as a streamer this is perfect for me. As, a non-streamer you may ask yourself then why do I want it. Great, game to just sit back relax & enjoy the smooth sounds of the wilderness.8 out 10 would highly reccommend !Watch me live daily @ http://www.hitbox.tv/apandacolive "

												All I can say is it's a pretty game. The scenery is nice, the architecture is nice, but that's about it.I have to say I was pretty excited for this game from what I'd read about it but the whole thing was incredibly disappointing. The concept is nice, but the game does nothing with it and then the ending renders it all moot anyway. As far as puzzles go, the game claims to not hold your hand, but it will point you in the direction of the objects you need to find, and then the rest of the puzzling could be solved by a 5 year old, and even a 4 year old could do it by trial and error.I briefly mentioned the ending eariler, and it really was pretty bad. No spoilers but it isn't worth your time.Actually this entire game isn't worth your time, let alone your money. Watch a video, look at the pretty screencaps, nod sagely and think nothing more of it, because that's about all this game has to offer. Hell if you look at some screenshots and read a full plot synopsis you've had a better (not to mention quicker) experience than someone who bought and played the game all the way through. 3/10, would rather have paid some of my gas bill with the money.

												I did not like this game.I still gave it a positive review because that doesn't mean it's a bad game, it's good in fact.It's good because the visuals are refreshing and relaxing, because it's atmospheric and because the story is solid.The reason I didn't like it, is that it isn't my type of game. The way I see it, it's a walking simulator with some extras.The gameplay is similar to Gone Home if you've played that, in terms of puzzle solving, and walking from one puzzle to the next to find clues. I find that kind of gameplay a bit frustrating, tedious, with a lot of time wasting. If you're into a more interactive version of this game, with dialog and a solid ghost detective story, I would recommend playing Murdered: Soul Suspect instead.			"

												This game looked really promising, really nice graphics and some supernatural mystery story. I played through this game with my best gf. It took three hours. The first part was shocking ;D The second was interessting ... another was quite stressful and challenging....but in the end, the story is really boring, the conclusion is boring, and overall there is not much to discover. Just a bunch of puzzle parts...You can die in this game, but just at a specific chapter, a lot is left to your fantasy, which can be good, but somehow I wished there was a little bit more to the story...it's all like just a show off for the Unreal Engine + some spooky story with a detective with supernatural powers ... I can't recommend it for more than $10 ...			"

												There are very few games I've ever played that've kept me glued to the controller (or keyboard) and wouldn't let me go! I can safely say having JUST beaten, or rather, SOLVED the Vanishing of Ethan Carter, that the Astronauts have taken atmospheric & subtle-narrative storytelling to the next level in gaming. Allow me to share just a few of the pros and cons I had with the VoEC...PROS:+Incredible Atmosphere - there were moments where I actually BELIEVED there was actually a Red Creek Valley +Stunning Visuals - whether it was the limbs & leaves of the trees blowing in the wind or the dark & dusty remnants of a foyer in a long forgotten house, a TON of effort was placed in achieving NEAR photorealism w/textures.+Compelling Story - just when you think you have the story nailed down, its slips right from under you and only perplexes you even more! (which only adds to make you want to finish it even more)+CREEPY FACTOR! - Now normally this is something that I'd chalk up to the 'spooky' atmosphere or jump scares, but the thing was...there WEREN'T any of the cliche' scares of old. I was constantly looking behind my shoulder to turn and see...NOTHING I was just flatout scared! (immediately regretting playing this game in the dark w/my headphones on)+Puzzle Mechanics - there's nothing more satisfying that finding every clue and placing each step of the 'death' in chronological order. This isn't just a walk in the park, you have to THINK and WORK at it, but you feel a great sense of satisfaction knowing you're moving the story along and getting one step closer to finding Ethan.CONS: -- Um...let me think...-- Just give me a sec...-- DONT PRESSURE ME!! Geez-- Oh yeah, I beat the game in 6 hours...it was short, but forgivable since I felt strangely COMPELLED to finsih the gameThe Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a game that all future indie & mainstream games of similar genre should aspire to be like. The game shows that it can create for a memorable experience w/o the multi-million dollar budget of a $$$ or zombies, quicktime events, or jump-scares. What the team of Astronauts have done is perfected the minimalist approach to gaming, but yielded an adventure into darkest depths of the human psyche & supernatural world for a game not soon to be forgotten! Good luck to all those playing and here's to those on the fence considering buying it (JUST DO IT!)  "

""If this warning stands, walk no further. If this warning stands, our ritual failed.If this warning stands, the sea-thing gate remains sealed."" (c)This game is perfect. It scared me out, it was filled with atmosphere of Hovard Lovecraft's stories, it is amazing.""The vanishing of Ethan Carter"" is similar to the ""Dear Esther"". The protagonist, Paul Prospero, is the famous detective with paranormal abilities.  As we playing him, we walk around Red Creek Valley, hark Paul's monologues and, of course, find something, that distinguishes this game from ""Dear Esther"". Detective Prospero is able to seep through the dimension, he literally could go back in time. Thus, at the beginning of the game, as we get out of the railroad tracks, we encounter the traps, set in the forest. Once the player finds all traps, he can see a picture of the past and find a note, Ethan's story, which is called ""Sap"". Of course, the game doesn't make you to look for all traps, but player is free to do what he wants. Do you want to stay in the beginning and look for something interesting? You can do it! Do you want to go ahead, go out to the bridge, for example, and, do you see this house on the hill? You can go there, no problem!The most important thing, and, that's what make the game pretty darn exciting, is opportunity to investigate the murders. And not just to find the instruments of crime, but also to recreate the picture of what happened and see how things were in fact and how it affected on the boy, Ethan, whom we're trying to save.Throughout the game the player can collect all the Ethan's stories (which, in my opinion, are very interesting). They won't affect the plot, but I personally recommend to walk around all of the available territory, and try to find them all, because these stories just add nice atmosphere to the game.What I would like to mention, for the whole game we found only one monster, which, of course, will try to kill us. It appears only once in game and he's not very difficult, though, to say honestly, I was very scared the first time I saw him.In such games two issues are the most common: the atmosphere and the ending. In ""The vanishing of Ethan Carter"" developers have avoided these problems. They managed to create a wonderful, shrill atmosphere, and that's why you'd like to come back to this game. And, of course, ending of game... It was damn cool. I don't want spoilers in my review (:In general, ""The vanishing of Ethan Carter"" turned out to cheer. If you're fan of these games, ""The vanishing..."" you will definitely like!			"

												Pros:  Outstanding scenery - well-designed and especially well-rendered.  Wish my computer could handle this game at max graphic levels.Cons:   Weak story; lacks logical flow.  Assumes player has special knowledge of the powers of an occult detective - and that is the root of the story problems.  The various parts of the story, like the traps in the beginning, have no context and no raison d'etre.  Why would I expect to run around in the woods looking for traps?  Takes a lot of horsepower to run full screen. Please kill off Ethan Carter now!			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter makes great use of its gorgeous visuals, surreal atmosphere, melancholic soundtrack, and simple, but engaging and interesting puzzles to tell an enthralling, immersive horror story, all without resorting to jump scares or game overs. It takes roughly 5 hours to see everything the game has to offer, more than enough to appreciate what's probably the closest you can get right now to living through a good Stephen King novel.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter: In-depth ReviewGame release date: September 22, 2014Review date: July 23, 2015INTROThe Vanishing of Ethan Carter is an amazing game. The story is intriguing, the gameplay is unique, and the graphics are hands down some of the best in the history of gaming so far. The product is not without it's cons; however, it is still a polished and compelling game overall.STORY (spoiler free)You're a paranormal detective who journeys to a place called Red Creek Valley to find a boy named Ethan Carter, who sent you fan mail that intruiges you to invesitgate some of his claims. When you arrive, you find out that a strange evil has claimed the town, and an adventure of mystery, horror, and hope ensues. Overall, the narrative is solid, if not a little too vague at times. But with that said, it keeps you immersed throughout the entire experience, and is one of the defining factors of the game.GAMEPLAYThe game is played from a first-person perspective. As usual, you're basically just an invisible floating head, which means you can't see your hands, feet, or any other part of your body. Levers and switches seem to move on their own. Items are picked up by invisible your invisible hands. While this is a minor gripe, I think it would have made the game much more realistic. Primarily, you explore a decently sized open world map, solving puzzles and searching for clues on what to do next. The pacing is brilliant, that is, until you have to backtrack over large distances just because you missed a small element. By the time I reached the endgame, I had to go back and complete other ""missions"" because I'd so easily missed them as I passed by. This is another minor gripe, as the game itself tells you that it won't hold your hand throughout the experience. Keep your eyes sharp. But hold onto your seats as well, as there are some jump scares. The puzzles are relatively easy, but most require a ton of thinking. Traversal is almost entirely by foot. There's a zoom function for taking DOF lessened screenshots. and a sprint button (which you'll be holding down almost the entire time). There's also a neat easter egg which either requires you to have the knowledge of the steps before hand, or blind luck to solve it.GRAPHICSBy far, the game's most defining quality. My jaw hit the floor when I first booted up the game, and there are plenty of ""wow"" moments throughout the adventure. Almost every environment looks spectacular, and the level of detail is incredible. Textures are photorealistic, and looks amazing coupled with cinematic effects. Character models are also extremely detailed. The entire world is designed to give you that surreal-dream-like feel, and it pulls you into this virtual world. It's insane.Also take note, the game is running on the Unreal 3 engine, pushed to the limits. Performance is great, but as always, comes down to what rig you have. An update which upgrades the engine to the breathtaking Unreal 4 is in development at the time of this review.OVERALLWhile I recommend this to everyone, don't buy it expecting Call of Duty or Skyrim. This is a puzzle solving, story heavy, visually stunning experience. It clocks in pretty short though, I completed the game in around four hours, and that was with a lot of restarting and general goofing around. But don't let that sway you into not buying it. It's well worth the asking price, and unbeatable during sales. RATING; 9.5/10			"

												Finally, a game that makes me want to be a better person. Somehow this game is able to completely make me want to avoid each turn in fear, all while helping me feel comfortable enough to do so. It is an introspective adventure that may be a moment of peace and emotional release for some, and a time of self-reflection and decision making for others. Sometimes you have to go through hell to find the truth and make it out on top, and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter invites you to do so. Some of the higher points of this game are: +   A story that is both touching and gripping, while at the same time remaining simple enough to pack a punch.+   Control is never taken from the player for long if ever and as such I never feel disconnected from the experience of being Paul Prospero. Only at one time is control taken away from the player, but it needs to be taken, there is no other way. It is part of the experience that impacts the story in a powerful way.+   Textures and Atmosphere that have to be seen to be believed. I found myself looking over every nook and cranny of the entire game. It never got old. Truly a masterpiece in game design. Never have I mistaken a video game environment with someplace that could exist. I found myself rethinking that concept at every corner within the game. Only complaint is that some of the mountain textures could have been more detailed. But I understand, how do you 3d scan a whole mountainside?+   Graphics and gameplay flow that is new and revolutionary. At first I thought that when the Orange Sears across the screen I thought I was viewing an encoded video, but as I continued to play I realized it was an actually viewpoint that could change dynamically as I changed the scene. The door puzzle alone had me captivated and impressed with technically how the devs pulled it off. It stands out so much because it doesn't stand out to the player as a gimmick. It just works. This game is future proof. +   An impressive soundtrack almost worth listening to on its own. But coupled with the game it is completely mesmerizing and adds to every moment of gameplay. Intriguing, Beautiful, Eerie, all with the feel of a AAA score.+   Perfect amount of time to finish the game. Around 4 hours unless you cheat and look at guide. May take only a couple hours on subsequent play throughs. Not too long, not too short. The story is able to build and make its point all without overstaying its welcome.+   Crime Solving I actually felt like I solved. As stated in the very beginning of the game ""This game does not hold your hand"" I haven't played to many mystery games, but the ones that I have played (like Murdered: Soul Suspect) all made me feel like I was just running around collecting evidence until something decided to happen. In this game I felt involved enough that I needed to know what happened, not just that the game needed me to solve something so I could move on further in the game. Because the game does not tell you what to do, true discovery happens. The little thoughts that pop up as you observe items are perfect and leading you slightly without getting in the way. When the thoughts congregate to pinpoint you to where a clue might be it feels natural and unobtrusive. +   Very replay able. Not in the sense of Skyrim or Mass Effect where you can be something different each play through, but in the way a great movie with a moment of catharsis at the end makes you appreciate everything that came before even more, and even see it in a different light. It all keeps on adding up on itself each time you play again. This is just a thought that is neither negative nor positive, but a note to those buying the game:~   Some of the promo media advertising/screenshots/trailers never happens within this game. The screen shot above that shows the man crawling in front of the train, is never seen like shown, in the game. The picture of the ghostly lady standing outside the crypt is more accurate to what will happen. Personally I have mixed feelings that fully rendered play throughs of the entire crime scene events would have been better, compared to what the game offers, which is ghostly snippets broken up in chronological order. Here are some of the few hang ups in this game that keep it from being a perfect game:-   Some of the side quests broke the feel of the game flow. At only one point out of the whole 4+ hours of gameplay could you possibly die in this game and when it happens it really throws the whole game off since most of the game I felt secure in being an observer of the past. This wouldn't be so bad but since the game ""doesn't hold your hand"" you are left never knowing what to expect, which is just fine for a mystery game, that is unless you discover a part of the game that actually goes against the rest of the game’s standard even if just for a second.-   The save system really stinks, you can't save at any point and it is really hard to understand when the game is saving for you. This leads to extra time playing over again the same part of the game catching up from when you quit the game last time. I know they devs wanted this to be one sitting gameplay experience or possibly 2, but I just didn't have time to play it in two sittings. I had about 6 times that I had to finish this game. Steam says it took 5 hours, but only about 4 of that was spent actively playing something new. -   I felt downright confused by some of the mini side quests. And I don't mean normal confused like you are supposed to be in a mystery game, but one of them almost felt like an easter egg for the developer itself and until I understood how the game was flowing and how it fit into the story it seemed to be extremely distracting and took me out of the game. On the second play through it will not do that to me, but for sure on the first run though it really confused me.-   Knowing when it is the actual end of the game could be confusing to some, and be possibly frustrating after realizing you missed something critical you didn't know you were supposed to discover.But these negative points were all forgiven when I realized the worth of the impact of this game. Only one other game has actually left an impact on me (Spec Ops: The Line) for the better. Some things in life are not pretty and have to be faced upfront. This game is not just a pretty to play but flat experience, because I actually discovered I can have heartfelt feelings and play a video game at the same time. But this game ends up being very beautiful in my mind at the end of the day, and I'm not talking about the graphics.			"

												 With minimal gameplay elements and pretty graphics, this game puts you in the shoes of a paranormal investigator. There are a total of 10 ""puzzles"", or better said stories, in which you uncover step by step what happened to Ethan Carter. Not only that you are not forced to solve any of them (except the last one), you might actually miss some because sometimes they aren't in your main path. Rating: If there's something strange / In you neighborhood / Who you gonna call? Recommendation: the game is a short and atmospheric visual novel with minimal gameplay, are you into that? http://pixelloot.com "

												Very nice game, although it could easily go from very nice to truly awesome by making some easy fixes:1- Add a map! The world you play in is pretty big and therefore overwhelming without it.2- It doesn't really need a full tutorial at the begining but some more guidance on the mechanics of the game would be really nice. They are very original, but without proper explanation, they become confusing and frustrating.That's all, I loved pretty much everything else. And those environments are simply gorgeous <3			"

												StoryPaul Prospero, a calculating detective attuned to his senses and surroundings, arrives in Red Creek Valley after receiving news of a missing boy named Ethan. With a supernatural ability capable of digging up events from the past, you must shed light on dark happenings and piece together a chain of murders in your quest for answers, but most importantly, Ethan Carter.GameplayVanishing plays like a minimalistic walking simulator, no HUD, no inventory management, no menu for reading past discovered letters or journal entries. Environment interaction is limited solely to what is relevant to the case (with the exception of a few puzzle solving instances) your building and learning about the troubling past of the Carter family. During your search for Ethan you will come upon gruesome murder scenes, which you can dive into after you’ve discovered all the evidence in it’s surrounding area. Then, using Prospero’s supernatural abilities, murder scenes come to life with holographic like figures frozen in time, it’s up to you to number them in chronological order based on your findings and instinct. If successful, they come to life and play like an eerie reenactment before your eyes, if out of order, you’re reverted back into Paul’s shoes to correct your mistake. These scenes are clever and enjoyable to uncover, keeping you in your seat for longer, however the empty gaps in-between playing lost hiker and supernatural detective leave more to be desired.The puzzles along the way are difficult enough to keep you from rolling your eyes at their simplicity but not too challenging where they’d induce frustration. Vanishing is prefaced with the notion that the game does not hold your hand, which is both a valid statement and an arguable idea. Yes, you have a great deal of freedom as you roam Red Creek Valley for clues. Red Creek teases the idea of open world, boasting it’s vast size, however a great deal is filler with little to no reason. And arguable in the sense that, while hidden, every relevant object bears a large word or instruction overhead once in their proximity. All in all, the game takes a hands off approach that allows for player freedom, but it’s suggestions are not entirely absent.SoundSoft and magical music composed by Mikolai Stroinski sets a beautiful tone while you wander Red Creek Valley. Filled with wonder and mystery, it alone boosts the quality of this already enjoyable experience. Prospero’s narration provides insight to his problem-solving process, his feelings, and his genuine thoughts on the events that he’s uncovering. While scarce in dialogue, it only makes each word that much more important. Superb voice acting from all involved. Sound effects only build on the experience, from the wisps of wind flowing through the branches of pine trees, to the dense wall of wind that rushes over the dam. The crackling of a slow burning fire or a slow humming tune of a train car’s engine, everything whispers it’s own identity with fantastic sound.GraphicsUnbelievable. Not many games can make a forest or house feel like a living breathing thing but Vanishing does just that, masterfully. The kind of graphics you wish every game you play had. The detail put into each surface is astounding, blades of grass hide most of the textured ground floor, pebbles and stone walkways follow no blocky pattern, each rocky surface appears unique, weathered wooden boards layer the houses, and the list goes on. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter flaunts it’s beauty in every direction you look, and every object you examine. Runs smooth throughout the entire experience even with added visual effects. Hands down one of the most beautiful games I’ve played.Replay ValueLike many mystery narratives, the story builds and builds, relying almost entirely on it’s ending to gauge the overall quality of the complete story. Vanishing is one of those narratives and after your journey through Red Creek Valley is over, there’s really no reason to return.Wrapping UpThe Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a very impressive work of art, both visually and aurally. Offering an interesting story, solid ending, and an extremely fine-tuned gameplay experience that is both satisfying and challenging. I personally found the pacing between walking and detective work rather slow, and it’s concept of “does not hold your hand” odd, however they’re not strong enough to blemish this incredibly polished game.

												The most notable thing about this game is its stunning graphics and the beautiful world that completely holds your attention for the four hours or so it takes to complete. Despite the short completion time the game has a fairly slow pace, giving you time to really soak in the environment as you walk from puzzle to puzzle. There's no real explanation given as to how to solve the puzzles but seeing as they are largely straight forward I never found myself frustrated (with the exception of the infamous mine puzzle). Although not hard, the lack of any hints really made finding a solution that much more rewarding. The story is fairly interesting and carries a sense of mystery all the way until the end. The story might not stick in your head in the way something like ""Gone Home"" might, but it holds your attention throughout. It's primarily going to be the environment that keeps you wanting to explore. That said, the ending I found particularly good, I want to stress though that the ending seems to generate polarizing opinions. Looking to the cons, there really weren't that many, The mine stands out though, it's fairly visually uninteresting, and also contains the most irritating puzzle in the game. Sometimes it could be argued that certain spaces were lit poorly and as a result you really missed out on seeing all there was to see. I did also encounter one bug in my play through, it lead to the game becoming unresponsive and I lost maybe 15 minutes of progress. It didn't repeat though and just seemed like on of those unlucky things that can randomly occur in most games. I think you'd probably enjoy this game if you liked ""Ether One"" or to a lesser extent ""Dear Esther"". Overall I was quite pleased with what I got for my £15. I have little doubt I'll be loading it up again soon, but not to play through the story again, just to wander through the map. It's solid game that managed to really do a lot with such a short run time. It doesn't run for any longer than it needs to nor does it cram every second with gameplay or exposition. The time between the puzzles really gives you a chance to reflect on the mystery and enjoy the beautiful game world. 8.5/10  "

												Absolutely gorgeous game and a good adventure to boot. I kind of wish there were more puzzles but the ones that are there are good and interesting and I can't overstate how atmospheric Ethan Carter is. You'll probably beat it in a session or two but if you enjoy a decent story and great visuals it's super worth it.			"

												Short Review: 80% story, 20% puzzles. A joy to play if you like the mystery/puzzle/story type game.  The only bad thing is that this game is way too short, which is why I recommend getting this during a sale instead of paying full price.Longer Review: The story is intriguing and sometimes beyond fantastical, puzzles are mostly not too complicated. The graphics are gorgeous and the music is nice. Might get a bit slow at some points, but it’s a slower type of game that relies on atmospheric story telling. A joy to play if you like the genre. And then suddenly it’s all over. Way too short of a game, this is my only gripe with it. There’s not much replay value, unless you want to re-experience the lovely views and atmosphere. This game is not on my All Time Faves list, however it is an honorable mention simply due to the feeling I experienced at the ending, something only few games have achieved. A feeling difficult to describe, the best I can say is, it touched my soul. If you like mystery/puzzle/story type games, this is a must get. However due to the extremely short length, I recommend waiting for a sale to add this to your library.			"

												7/10This game is one of the most beautiful I've ever played. The visuals are to die for. And the plot is something that you'll have to experience for yourself. The narrative is interesting and the music playing often in the background is perfect for the kind of sombre mood that the game sets. It starts off with saying that there will be no hand-holding for the player and that is rightly so, as you have to find out what powers the protagonist, Paul Prospero, has for yourself and what its limitations are. It's a unique detective story, to say the least. The one thing I didn't like about the game are Ethan's ""stories"". In order to complete the game, you'll have to complete these stories. I only did some of them and they feel rather unrelated to the main plot. All in all, definitely a game worth playing.			"

												In the first few minutes, the game reminded me of Alan Wake, Dear Esther and Murdered: Soul Suspect. I have to say, this one is the perfect connection of all three games. Alan Wake tires you with pew pew pew which pushes the awesome story in the background, Dear Esther is done after 90 minutes and Murdered: Soul Suspect had kind of a fake/unreal way to interact with proofs. While Dear Esther is one of my most favourite games, this is finally something similar to it. Even the (few) negative reviews can't deny that the graphics of this game are incredibly good, you have 4 hours in the quality of a cinematic cutscene.People complain about puzzles being too simple, walking for 2 minutes without meeting anyone (this is not The Elder Scrolls), but in my opinion it's about the story anyways, which is really great. This is one of the few games that is more a novel to play, no shooting, no questmarkers, no HUD about health, ammo and compass. Just a story and awesome graphics. You can discuss about the price, but I highly recommend buying the game when it is on sale.If you liked Alan Wake for the story (and not for the shooting) and think Dear Esther was too short (such story much cry very tears wow), then you should get The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.

												GOOD:The visuals are stunning. The location of the game is actually somewhere in estearn europe and not wisconsin (judged by architecture and apperance of the infrastructure). Which makes sense given that the developers are from Poland. The immersion and suspense is complete, supported with great background music. NEUTRALThe story is ok. Interesting enough to keep you going, but weird and unpolished in places. After all is done it will leave you with a big ""what was that all about?""BADThe story Is way too short. The world is fairly big (area of the game world), but it's severly limited in places you can actually explore and in what you can do. The puzzles you have to solve are so simple it feels almost like a interactive movie, not a game. "

												From the graphics, to the voice acting, and the game layout to variety of experiences, the Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a masterpiece. The developers are nothing short of perfectionists. It truly takes you into the mind of Ethan, and makes me feel like a child again. It is a crime that this game will not get as much recognition as it deserves. No game has captured my curiousity to this magnitude, and I truly hope you will give it a chance. "

												StoryPaul Prospero, a calculating detective attuned to his senses and surroundings, arrives in Red Creek Valley after receiving news of a missing boy named Ethan. With a supernatural ability capable of digging up events from the past, you must shed light on dark happenings and piece together a chain of murders in your quest for answers, but most importantly, Ethan Carter.GameplayVanishing plays like a minimalistic walking simulator, no HUD, no inventory management, no menu for reading past discovered letters or journal entries. Environment interaction is limited solely to what is relevant to the case (with the exception of a few puzzle solving instances) your building and learning about the troubling past of the Carter family. During your search for Ethan you will come upon gruesome murder scenes, which you can dive into after you’ve discovered all the evidence in it’s surrounding area. Then, using Prospero’s supernatural abilities, murder scenes come to life with holographic like figures frozen in time, it’s up to you to number them in chronological order based on your findings and instinct. If successful, they come to life and play like an eerie reenactment before your eyes, if out of order, you’re reverted back into Paul’s shoes to correct your mistake. These scenes are clever and enjoyable to uncover, keeping you in your seat for longer, however the empty gaps in-between playing lost hiker and supernatural detective leave more to be desired.The puzzles along the way are difficult enough to keep you from rolling your eyes at their simplicity but not too challenging where they’d induce frustration. Vanishing is prefaced with the notion that the game does not hold your hand, which is both a valid statement and an arguable idea. Yes, you have a great deal of freedom as you roam Red Creek Valley for clues. Red Creek teases the idea of open world, boasting it’s vast size, however a great deal is filler with little to no reason. And arguable in the sense that, while hidden, every relevant object bears a large word or instruction overhead once in their proximity. All in all, the game takes a hands off approach that allows for player freedom, but it’s suggestions are not entirely absent.SoundSoft and magical music composed by Mikolai Stroinski sets a beautiful tone while you wander Red Creek Valley. Filled with wonder and mystery, it alone boosts the quality of this already enjoyable experience. Prospero’s narration provides insight to his problem-solving process, his feelings, and his genuine thoughts on the events that he’s uncovering. While scarce in dialogue, it only makes each word that much more important. Superb voice acting from all involved. Sound effects only build on the experience, from the wisps of wind flowing through the branches of pine trees, to the dense wall of wind that rushes over the dam. The crackling of a slow burning fire or a slow humming tune of a train car’s engine, everything whispers it’s own identity with fantastic sound.GraphicsUnbelievable. Not many games can make a forest or house feel like a living breathing thing but Vanishing does just that, masterfully. The kind of graphics you wish every game you play had. The detail put into each surface is astounding, blades of grass hide most of the textured ground floor, pebbles and stone walkways follow no blocky pattern, each rocky surface appears unique, weathered wooden boards layer the houses, and the list goes on.

												I'll just be blunt and short here: If you enjoy narrative-driven games (some like to call them walking simulators) where the exploration is the key element to the game, go for it. It's not exactly hard, as in that you can't exactly fail anything, but it has some very charming puzzles going on. I also really enjoyed the atmosphere, how the whole place feels like it's been abandoned for decades. And I'd be crazy to not mention the absolutely jawdropping graphics going on here (if you can manage it, play Redux version.) That's all I can really say here, I can't talk about the story since the whole game is all about it. Go in as blind as you can, you'll truly appreciate the whole experience that way. And I personally recommend to not use any walkthroughs. Memorize everything and immerse yourself to the world of this game. Hopefully you'll have as much as fun as I did.			"

												An outstanding short (long) story with ultimate immersion, both visually and introspectively. After noticing a historically accurate sigil in the game, I even discovered that The Astronauts took the time to study Goetia / The Lesser Key of Solomon, which just made the experience that much more captivating. This is a game that certainly doesn't hold your hand while you play; it offers little suggestion and requires both patience and enthusiasm for your position as the 'detective'. There's a lot of getting lost, and the story requires an eye for detail if you want to be able to progress the story whilst getting a full insight. I cannot stress the sheer beauty of this game; I was absolutely blown away from the offset. It's above and beyond what I expected and I couldn't fault it. As a photographer I even felt the itch to run around snapping screenshots, and found myself constantly distracted by the landscape.This is most definitely a game I'll be suggesting to all my friends!

												6/10Pro's: Visually stunning game with loads of vistas for screenshots. One of the prettiest games I have seen running on Unreal.Ambience is as it should be for the style of game and leaves you on the edge of your seat looking for the next clue.Con's: Story is very confusing. It's not until you reach the ending of the game that you fully know what has been going on in the little village. Level design leads to a lot of backtracking when nearing the ending of the game. Which equates to a lot of walking around with nothing going on.Price. It seems a bit high for me for the amount of gameplay you get out of the game. I managed to complete the game in just under 4 hours and I was by no means speed running it. I have seen others that have managed 7 hours out of the game. For $20 this seems a bit much. I feel a $15 price point would have been a better choice. "

												Just finished The Vanishing of Ethan CarterThis game is a game in the mystery genre, some say it's a horror game, but there is really only one part of thegame that scared me, quite a lot actually. That certain place made me wanna quit the game, and when I actually had to return to it after finished all the other puzzles I had to be brave! Anyway, the game has two different mechanics, one is to solve these murder cases, you get to find the murder object, how the murder happened, and so on. You also get to point out the chronology of the murder, one example: Did he lose his legs before or after he was hit in the head? That mechanic alone is quite unique in gaming, at least if you compare it to similar games I've played. The other mechanic is more puzzle solving, some harder than others, one was particulary easy, too easy. But the cool thing with these puzzles is that they reward us with more details of the story and also visually stunning places, also here some more than others. That particular easy puzzle rewarded us with one of the coolest settings in the game. The story of the game is very mysterious and you are throughout the game thinking ""Where is this taking me? Who am I? How am I related to all this?"" And that is good, and do the story answer these questions? Yeah, sure. Am I happy with it? Yeah, sure... I mean, it could have been a lot better, but it was still good. And now to the visuals, wow. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is one of the most beautiful games I've played, it's the most beautiful game I've played that runs on the Unreal Engine 3. Overall this is a game like Dear Esther, but with game mechanics. Some unique ones, some not so unique. I was happy with my purchase of this game even though I thinkit could have been a bit longer than four hours. My verdict is 7.5/10			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a detective game with some of the hardest puzzles, but will you want to play it ?The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a story driven game made by the ex developers of Bulletstorm. This is a heavy departure from the other games they have made.The Vanishing of Ethan Carter puts you in the shoes of the paranormal detective Paul Prospero. Paul get's a letter from a boy named Ethan Carter who say's something strange is going on at Red Creek Valley and he urges Paul to come here. As soon as we show up we find out something is not right about this place and it's up to us to figure out what happened to Ethan Carter.Gameplay is really simple. It's a walking simulator, but you actually have to figure out puzzles to figure out what happened to Ethan and his family. This goes from collecting clues to putting together a crime scene to play back a flashback and to find out how that crime was committed. The soundtrack to this game is phenomenal and the sound effects are amazing too. This game just begs you to play with headphones on. It's a great soundtrack and it's worth purchasing on it's own.Graphics are absolutely phenomenal. When I first played the game I took some time away from the game just to look around the scenery, it's that good. If you want some nice looking screen savers than this game is surely for you.Some of the puzzles are insanely difficult as the game doesn't hold your hand from start to finish. It's all up to you to figure out the mystery of the Vanishing of Ethan Carter. You don't take any notes so it's up to you to remember everything you saw and read. The game took me around 4 to finish and I found it just the right amount of time to complete this game.  Apart from that there's not much replay value. This game is a one time experience. Some of the crime scenes and the ending pack quite a punch and you won't get the same effect the second time through.I didn't encounter many problems. The only problem I had with the game is a micro stutter when I played through the mine section, but apart from that I encountered zero problems.Now this is one thing I wanted to address and that's the Ancient Gods puzzle in the mines. This is a spoiler for anyone who will want to play the game so I'll try to keep as less spoilery as possible. You have to find and inspect 4 dead bodies in the mines to get clues so you can open a door. There's a cursed miner that chases you through the entire section and he can kill you in one hit making you restart the entire thing all over again. It took me an entire hour just in that section which annoyed me the living hell out of me. But I guess that's just a rant and not a problem with the game.The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a phenomenal experience. I can't recommend the game enough. This game is a must own for any adventure game fan, detective fan and a mystery fan. This game is one of my favorite games of all time and is worth the full asking price. I give The Vanishing of Ethan Carter a 10/10			"

												It is a disappointing game with fantastic presentation and a subpar story.I would give this game a ""neutral"" review, but unless Steam won't allow me to do that, this game gets a sad pass. In games of this genre I'm most interested in getting a interesting story, enough game mechanics to not make me snore and a stellar locations to give those art-loving eyes some enjoyment. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter only provides the latter.Graphics and music are jaw-dropping. Attention to detail, pretty foliage, carefully crafted assets, textures and lighting... This game really pushes Unreal Engine 3 up to V-Max. If you are coming into this game for visual feast alone, I could recommend this game for you. Still, I personally cannot give such an easy pass to story and gameplay.I was expecting a great, thrilling, paranormal murder and investigation story and basically I got one, but I'm not really satisfied. Plot starts of really interesting, but it plays out most of it's cards too quickly, to the point where it all starts to feel really cliche. The straw that broke the camels back however, is the ending which both explains and justifies many of my complains but in the extremely clumsy and unsatisfying way. Voice-overs are rare, pacing is solid, but not great and environmental storytelling is bare-bones. Overall, story department is the place where this game seriously drops the ball.Gameplay is only a bit better. Thank heavens that this ""walking simulator"" gives you some proper  puzzles. This is very refreshing - they tried to give you some agency in the game and for the most part they succeed. You don't really feel that you are on the interactionless excursion. Unfortunately, the novelty and variety of problems and puzzles seriously drops down in later parts of the game. Mechanics are samey, there aren't any ""gameplay twists"" or new ideas. That results in gameplay that tried, but didn't hold my attention through whole journey...4 hour journey... This game isn't really worth a asking price. I got it for equivalent of 6 bucks and I'm not really feeling that I will return to this game anymore for story or gameplay. Sure, there is a Redux version with new Unreal Engine 4 and I will check it out for visuals alone, but If you are not into watching and exploring a beautiful virtual landscapes, there isn't anything other noteworthy about this game. Take my caution and if you want to try this game anyways, try to snatch it on strong discount.			"

												I just finished.  5.0 hours according to Steam, but I suck at games so a reasonable person should be able to finish it in 3 or 3.5.  I spent a LOT of time backtracking to finish stuff I missed the first time.Overall impressions:  If you like detective stories and outdoor atmosphere, you'll probably like this.  If you liked Alan Wake but hated the combat, I'm guessing you'll like this (I haven't played the Alan Wake games).  If you liked Dear Esther but wished it had even some mild puzzle elements, you'll probably like this.The bad:The open nature of the maps actually made me spend a lot of time backtracking because I missed a couple of simple triggers early in the game.  This made the story unfold in a weird manner, which is not really bad, but it made me spend an extra hour or two holding in shift and W to run around the mountainsides, which was a little tedious.The good:Probably the best visuals I've ever seen from Unreal Engine 3 (if this is just 3, maybe tailored?), potentially alongside Mirror's Edge.  In fact, thanks to the awesome textures and great color adjustments as you walk from area to area (color grading?), I feel like this is a pretty awesome game visually, from ANY engine.Going hand in hand with the nice textures, this game has awesome visual design.  The landscape, the shore lines, the skies, the vistas (""Oh lol, that's just a static background, no way I can walk down there........wait a minute, I -am- down there now.""), the muted colors, the balance of how everything fits together.  It's outstanding.I'm bad with directions so I ran in circles a lot, but the developers did a great job creating a huge, seamless, no loading environment.  It's not 10000 square miles or something, but it's a big area and things fit together pretty nicely.  I think they successfully realized a vision of creating a valley for you explore with some degree of freedom.The story is strange but very creative in parts.Performance is pretty great for me.  4.2 GHz i5 3570K, 8GB RAM, GTX 770 2GB.  Everything on max besides 4xAA, I got 60 fps and smooth operation (camera smoothing turned off) a lot of the time.  I didn't notice regular stuttering, but I guess because of map streaming, since I don't have a SSD, there was occasional hitching when running long distances.  There was one underground area where I got 35 fps or so because of some effects, and one house with special effects that might have brought me to 40 fps briefly (same with the hold-mouse-down effect).  Outside of those few special effect areas, things stayed smooth and looked great the majority of the time.The developers made some player-friendly choices since you have to walk/run so much.  There's no run toggle, unfortunately, but running does NOT give any nauseating headbob, and you do NOT get out of breath and make annoying loud breathing sounds.  Hooray!The soundtrack is appropriately creepy in parts, and the main mysterious theme is great.The atmosphere is great.  I hate scary games and this game feels fairly near the limit of scary I can or want to deal with.  However, the atmosphere for the most part just involves tension or creepy things, with few jump scares and no combat.The puzzles and interactive story segments are relatively simple, but work well with the story.  One note is that you should rebind the text toggle key to something other than spacebar so you don't have text showing up on top of a story segment.  Tab works fine.If you're only mildly interested, $10 might be a reasonable price for you but even then I'd say it's still worth closer to $10 than $5 side because of all the positives.  It looks great, it's polished, and it runs stable.  I have seen a couple of mentions of event bugs, so I don't know if I was just lucky, especially with a certain underground sequence, but I hope everyone managed to finish.Overall, I would recommend this game.  If you like point and click adventures, detective stories, or really pretty games you can screenshot, and you don't mind a 3-hour story, go ahead, I'd say it's worth $20.			"

												To put it simply, It is a beautiful looking game, and was quite enjoyable to play. However under 10 hours for total completion for $20.00 is absurd, $5-10 is all this is worth (maybe), there is no replay value at all, once you are done, that is it.Give it a go when it's on a special..

												I recently started and finished The Vanishing of Ethan Carter in a single sitting, and was thoroughly impressed the entire 4.2 hours it took me to fully complete the game.Although very short (and possibly too short for the full price of the game), TVoEC offers a simplistic yet incredibly engaging game. Taking inspiration from early 20th century weird fiction (namely H.P. Lovecraft, as expected), the story revolves around a private eye on a mission in an isolated village to help one ""Ethan Carter"". While playing through the opening segment, it seemed quite similar to Dark Corners of the Earth (also available on Steam, but broken as all hell) - being dumped in a disturbing setting with next to no guidance, only to figure everything out for yourself. This minimalist style of gameplay definitely works in the game's favour, as it seems to allow for a more immersive experience. There is no HUD, health bars, maps or quest icons. You have the WASD keys, the mouse, and your own two feet.Gameplay revolves around solving various puzzles, and entering the minds of those deceased to see memories shortly before their deaths. It feels slightly cliche, but isn't too over-the-top like you might expect. The game's story is unravelled through these various puzzle sequences, as you explore the village in which the game is set, learning of the characters and their relationships with one another. It's definitely not an in-depth story, but it is very engaging.Where TVoEC really shines is in its atmosphere. From the very first minute of the game, the atmosphere of this game almost smacks you in the face with how incredibly immersive it is. The stunning environments, beautifully-composed soundtrack and occasional narration from the main character provide an incredible feeling of isolation as you make your way through an empty and run-down village. It's almost unlike any game I've ever played, and has to be played to fully understand.I picked the game up off the Humble Store for $6.66 (coincidence?) and felt very satisfied with my purchase. For the RRP of $19.99 it may seem like a bit much for a game that can be finished in a few hours, but for anything ~$10 or less it's definitely a must-have for fans of mystery, horror, and weird fiction.

The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is an excellent interactive narrative experience.First of all, the graphics are absolutely gorgeous and stunning, some of the best visuals I've seen in games. Additionally to that, the soundtrack is amazing and fits perfectly to the mood of the game. Put those together and you get an incredibly immersive game that really sucks you in. And that already makes for 60% of the experience - wandering around in that beautiful world and enjoying the atmosphere is just perfect. You really have to play the game slowly to get the most out of it. (loud headphones and a dark room are helpful, too)But on to the actual game part. You play as a private detective, who has the ability to communicate with the dead to some degree. He comes to Red Creek Valley after the young boy Ethan Carter sends him a letter asking for help. The purpose of the game is to find out what happened in Red Creek Valley - a place with dark secrets, as you find out quickly. This is done by exploring the area (note here that the game isn't really openworld, but leaves enough room to wander around and explore), finding out the background to murders and solving (mostly easy) riddles. During all that the game does not give you any objectives, there isn't even a real HUD - ""This game is a narrative experience that does not hold your hand"" is a statement that pops up in the beginning of the game, and it is 100% accurate. Playtime is around 5 hours, which is a bit short, but then again the game is no full price title. Still the price could be a bit cheaper.This kind of game is special and certainly not for everyone, but if you like what you read here, go for it.Just don't expect to punch thugs or blow up terrorists, that ain't gonna happen here.

												This game was amazing. Visually stunning, great soundtrack, and wonderful storytelling. The world manages to be beautiful, whimsical, dark, chilling, and sometimes downright scary. The few puzzles that do pop up are well thought out and logical, so don't go running for a walk-through! Explore, take your time, just when you think you're never going to find anything something pops up that makes the searching worth it. Some reviews say the ending is weird. Personally I think it's perfect, and explains everything. Now if this were a star rating system, I would give this game a 4 out of 5 and here is why. There are some technical issues that need to be addressed. The only save mechanism is an auto save at the end of each big scene. That was a little frustrating, but I could have accepted it if it were not for the bugs that pop up occasionally, forcing you to reload your last save, and start from square one in each segment. All in all, barring the technicl issues I really enjoyed this game and would say if you like the genre, dive in!			"

Posted: July 18, 2015
												This is a difficult game to review - in a good way. :)*Note - I am writing this reviews as a slightly prejudiced and a huge fan of plot driven adventure games, a person who was, you could say, ""raised"" on classic adventure games, such as the cherished Broken Sword, Lucas Arts' Monkey Island, Full Throttle, legendary Grim Fandango, and Gabriel Knight. I also have experience with more recent adventure titles, such as Agatha Christie games, Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy, and various lesser known indie and non-indie titles from all eras of adventure games.The game begins with a warning (now I'm keen on thinking of it as more of a product disclaimer, literally) - - -""THIS GAME DOES NOT HOLD YOUR HAND.""(Implying: Don't curse our names while waving your fist around if you find that fact annoying while playing, as you have been rightly warned) :DAnd it's true, all the way. Let's start with the game itself. This game is beautiful. Period. One of the most detailed, nuanced and stunningly jaw-dropping visuals I have ever seen in a game, not just within the adventure branch. You are inserted deep in Pennsylvania countryside, and as it's seems, and it's fall. The most nostalgic part of the year. You play as Paul Prospero, an experienced, observant and world-weary detective who ""specializes"" in supernatural stuff. Prospero's voice acting andinternal monologues are very well-done, and quite badass IMHO, and even if there isn't that much voice actingin the game, the main protagonists come off as pretty well-rounded.You are investigating the disappearance of a young boy, named Ethan Carter, who had sent a cryptic letter toPaul Prospero's (your) address, warning him (you) of his upcoming disappearance and strange events happening in Red Creek Valley, in Pennsylvania.Well enough for a plot, and there are many more things for you to discover. The story is layered, emotionally charged, quite original,and takes you for a ride in some unexpected directions. And that's a good thing. Admittedly, I have not yet finished the game, but I am working on it. ;)The game revolves around A LOT of exploration in your environment and surroundings, looking around for objectsor traces of disturbance, and trying to ""reconstruct"" what happened at that place, some time ago.Our world weary detective Prospero also has supernatural powers, as he can literally ""reconstruct"" a crime scene,by seeing murder victims, collecting objects associated with the incident and placing them where they were during the time of the event/crime/struggle, etc.Takes a while to get used to, although I believe it's an innovative and well-utilized approach.Soundtrack is excellent, soothing most of the time, mysterious and intense when it needs to be - and helps very much to tell the story in it's own way. Every specific location in the game has it's own theme; which only adds to the overall excellent atmosphere of mystery and exploration.The game is very atmospheric - while not exactly a ""horror"" game (although there are a few REALLY good scares, belive me), best description that would fit would be ""supernatural thriller"" - think David Lynch's Twin Peaks series , and Lovecraft's or maybe Robert Louis Stevenson's supernatural fiction, combined with a soothing and meditative strollthrough the woodland outbacks.You are free to explore the game at your own pace, and in your own way. You can solve the puzzles in any order you see fit, and that is quite good. Freedom of movement and exploration in the beautiful outbacks is quite generous, too.So, what's the problem, you may ask? What makes this gripping, atmospheric and emotional story a tough one to review, and to recommend?Well, it's like this...There is <NO> inventory. Nothing. Nada. Rien. Zip. Also, no compass, and no map whatsovever. No way to get your bearings. The map isnt' that much of a problem, really - because you can get around pretty fast and it's not that tough to get your bearings, and it also makes a good orientation practice.The complete lack of inventory is a bigger problem, given that you do have to collect some important items in the game,and there is no way to see or examine them further once you've collected them. So, you better remember well what you've picked up and where. I know that it's supposed to make the game feel as an ""artistic"" and unique experience, different from other adventure titles, but it makes sense for an experienced supernatural detective to maybe, just maybe, know what he has in his coat and pants pockets, right? Right...? But the worst thing of all (and this doesn't affect all gamers/reviewers equally, but it did bother me quite a bit) - the wacky, counter-intuitive and unhelpful saving system.There is NO way to save manually. The game does have autosave function - but ONLY after the game decided thatyou have ""made progress"", reconstructed a crime scene, reached a place of importance, or something like that. On the plus side, you can't ""do"" anything wrong, or in the wrong order - you are completely free to play the game in the order you wish, no need to worry about making ""mistakes"" that will be saved and block you from advancing, or things like that. Although, do expect having to collect some items again and to play through some areas again if the game did not autosave.As I said, it doesn't bother everyone - but it bothered me. Not enough to give up on the game, no way, but still; certainly not a plus IMO. Did the developers make it that way to make us work harder on puzzle solving? Or just a ploy to ""extend"" the game experience?You be the jugde. :)Graphics are stunning, true - but if you want the game in full detail and lag-free, you better have a decent current-gen graphics card, and minimally 2GB RAM. This is also not often seen in the tradition of adventure video games; hardware demands. While not staggering, they are higher than with your usual adventure title. Truth be told, graphics and visual experience  justify it at least to an extent.There is the possibility of a lagging, which is also a minus - try changing the ""camera smoothing"" option, and if need be, get rid of anti-aliasing and some other stuff. Even though I can play it decently with an incredible amount of detail and in high configuration, it still sometimes lags just a bit with my GeForce GTX650.Do I recommend this game? That's a tough one. I have hit ""thumbs up"", but only because it was mandatory. :P xDWhy?Because, as with most things in life - it depends. :)If you want an emotionally rich and mysterious story, and you want to get lost in the woods (this game is good to tun to iyou're stressed or tense, it comes as a soothing experience, trust me), this is the right game for you.If you like  slow-paced, meditative and mysteryious experience, this is the right thing.If you enjoy a lot of quirky and offbeat dialogue with many characters in the game (similar to LucasArts classics), then it's not the best choice. If you enjoy faster-paced adventure games with some guidelines, you might try looking somewhere else.As for the price range, I would suggest grabbing it if there's a Steam discount available.I would even recommend it to newcomers to adventure genre - honestly, it might even sit better with newcomersthan veterans, because it is a fair departure from most of the other ""cult"" status titles.The Vanishing of Ethan Carter brings something new to the beloved adventure genre. How successful it is? Get lost in the woods and solve the mystery for yourself! :)			"

												An atmospheric, sometimes scary Lovecraft-esque adventure game with stunning graphics. Detective games are hard to do, since it is difficult to make the player feel like it is THEY who are performing the deductions/making the inferences. LA Noire and Murdered: Soul Suspect both failed to give the player this feeling, but The Vanishing of Ethan Carter IMO manages to nail it. The ""crime scene chronology"" mechanic is fantastic, elegant yet requires the use of your brain to make inferences from the clues. Having to return the scene of the crime back to how it was when the deceased was killed is also a nice touch and makes sense for a ""psychic detective.""The graphics are frankly gorgeous, although unfortunately the performance isn't as stable as it should be.The plot is good (although the ending can feel like a bit of an M. Night Shyamalan cop-out-twist-bordering-on-a-deus-ex-machina), the music is very appropriate and fitting, and I enjoyed my time with the game.The big drawback is the game's length; it can easily be finished in less than four hours. I'd advise buying the game if you love horror games, adventure/mystery/puzzle games, or just deeply atmospheric games in general. However, you may want to wait for a sale. The gameplay mechanics for the investigation scenes, however, are excellent, and I hope The Astronauts is planning to make more games like this... if this game is intended as a ""proof of concept"" for their idea of how to make a detective game, then I'd say they've proven their concept with flying colors.PROS:+ Best investigation mechanics I've yet encountered in a detective game+ Atmospheric+ Incredible graphicsCONS:- Brief- Uneven graphical performanceOverall: Fans of horror and/or adventure games should certainly consider purchasing this game.

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is an immersive, atmospheric murder mystery where you set as Paul Prospero to find (you guessed it!) Ethan. I'll make a simple list here.- Beautiful graphics The game is not only treat for your mind but for your eyes as well. You'll find yourselves pausing several times during the course of the game just to admire the sublime scenery.- Fun gameplay Like many mystery/detective games, there are no guns. You move in first person with the ability to interact with objects.    The game features different scenes where you have to restore the scene of the crime to correspond to scene of the time of the murder, followed by determining the chronology of the events. Personally, it was a fun and interesting game mechanic.- Immersive experience As you go delve deeper and deeper ito the story, you find yourself more and more invested in the story. Also I suggest playing the game with headphones, the background music and ambient sound effects are amazing and you'll feel as if you were truly strolling through a forest  or walking through a mine.Sidenote: Some people may find $20 to be a bit too much for a little over 4 hours of gameplay but personally, I found it to be more than worth the price.

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a short game, but I quite enjoyed it.  It has a wonderful sense of atmosphere: beautiful environments, lovely music, and a mystery to drive you forward.  The story was smaller in scope than I originally thought, but I liked it.The puzzles were not hard, but they were interesting enough to give me a sense that I was solving the mystery, and I genuinely enjoyed how their investigation system would bring up multiple observations and new questions, rather than just stating observable facts.My only complaints were some bad framerate when transitioning between areas and some unnecessary backtrack at the end.  My computer only has 4GB of ram, so the game paged memory to disc pretty aggressively, but it settled down once I got to the next area.  The backtracking was not required by the game design, but rather me not knowing where to go after one particular cause-and-effect puzzle.			"

The game additionally is sort of experimental, where some in-game graphic elements are achieved through very high quaility (in terms of detail) photography, which overall makes this game the best looking one I have played so far. In several spots in the game I ended up wandering around the scene and looking for a perfect composition for a screenshot (landscape photography instincts kicked in).The game is not hard, the puzzles are average in difficulty, but there aren't many of them: approximately 30% of the game. The rest of the gameplay is exploration, which is very rewarding because of fantastic visuals. The story is mysterious and dark, but for me was a bit confusing. Gameplay is otherwise based on detective style. The soundtrack is beautiful ambient stuff, and brought back the feeling of wandering around the mountains in Skyrim.Overall a very impressive game: strange, weird, dark, amazingly beautiful, with a fantastic atmosphere. Now, if you will excuse me, I am off to try and mod Skyrim to look like this.			"

												A definite ""yes"". Nice take on environmental storytelling with lovecraftian style. Absolutely gorgeous ""organic"" visual design makes you feel like you could go anywhere... At least for the first few minutes. Still, it's really amazing. I found the whole experience to be much more engaging than e.g. Dear Esther and would love to see more experiments like that in the future.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is very much a game about mystery, so I'll keep this brief and suggest you avoid reading too much about the game before playing it (should you wish to do so). It unravels at a measured pace and expects you to figure many things out on your own. So a player who is used to action games is likely to grow bored with it. That said, it offers quite an immersive experience for those who enjoy a slower approach and like to take their time with a game. The presentation is gorgeous and the story is very well told. All in all, I do not regret my purchase.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter can only be described as an interactive, narrative driven vision of beauty telling a horrific tale that will grip you until the very moment the story ends.From the moment Paul Prospero comes into this world, the Vanishing of Ethan Carter will strike you with its visual beauty and eerie atmosphere. Be it a stain of blood on the ground or a distant sound on the wind, you'll never feel completely safe in Red Creek Valley.The first thing that came to my mind when I jumped into The Vanishing of Ethan Carter was that it did not look like an Unreal Engine game, especially not Unreal Engine 3. This is a technical achievement all on its own by the developers. The draw distance alone as well as lush environments show that The Astronauts succeeded where many AAA developers failed miserably. Naturally there are no loading screens.Granted, the game requires a pretty powerful PC to run which is where I think the game has its biggest flaw. The game is decently optimized and I personally was getting solid frame-rates in outdoor areas with most of the settings set to High.Is The Vanishing of Ethan Carter a game? No. Just as with many other ""games"" in this not-so-well-defined genre (like Dear Esther for example) The Vanishing of Ethan Carter only comes close to being a game during the crime scene investigation... let's call them puzzles.It is a narrative driven experience which focuses on the story and immersing you in the world. It does so very well because it doesn't have guns or well defined gameplay mechanics such as skill trees and weapon upgrades. It will tell you it won't hold your hand and this is quite true.This approach means you will have to figure out the mechanics for yourself and you have to do so in order to advance the story. The crime scene investigation mechanic works in such a way that you have to find and restore objects to their original location and then linking a chain of events together by playing them back in the right order. This is where your supernatural powers come into play. My first experience with the crime scene investigation mechanic was for the most part looking around and clicking on objects it will draw your attention to. The way it does that is by hovering texts above the object in question. When you click on said text it shows you a thought process that in turn gives you clues as to what you are looking for.It is a way of informing you what to do while not ruining the immersion with a HUD notification or by pausing the experience.If only more game developers would take that approach.Story-wise the game will show you various events that you access through investigating crime scenes. While you can solve each of the mysteries in whichever order you please, the main story doesn't start coming together until you have solved at least half of them. Finding stories left by Ethan in the world will give you an idea of what is really going on and while there is a big twist, I think most people will have realized it long before it actually happens. If they payed enough attention to the stories, newspaper cut-outs and other minor clues that are left around in the world for you to find.I would love to give more of an example but the story is hard to write about without giving away major (or minor) spoilers. I will say though that the writing is very good, I never had any problems with the dialogue although the voice-acting didn't always fit.The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a great addition to my Steam library and while I got it on sale it is in my opinion worth the 19 Euros that it currently costs on Steam.I want to see more games like this and I want to see what The Astronauts come up with next.

												10 out of 10Let me explain, why. This is an outstanding piece of art. In every aspect. First, and most importantly, the graphics. It is mindblowing. This is probably the first game where the grass is not pixelated. The textures are beautiful, you can see every small detail of moss, leafs etc. The water, plants, rocks, everything feels real. There is no loading screen during the game, neither HUD, only you and the enviroment. Which was based on real places (in Wisconsin and Poland). They created an atmosphere which resembles to Alan Wake, Dear Esther and an independent game clalled The Cursed Forest. It is beautiful, with all the mountains, pine tree forests, streams and lakes, yet you can sense the darkness below the surface. You can walk free in this world, without restrictions. The devs put a real effort making the graphics as good as possible (uses Unreal 3) and they did a flawless job. Furthermore, they import it to Unreal 4 and everybody who purchased the game gets it for free.  I wonder why not all the games look like this today - especially the ones they call themselves ""nextgen"". Sound effects, ambient noises, character voices and musics are also perfect. All my respect to the sound designer. The story is interesting. It's not the jaw dropping type, but gives you some unexpected moments, and a few minutes of thinking after you finish the game. What you can do in only 5 hours (average is 4.5). This is a pity, I would have spend more time in the Red Creek Valley. Go buy it even on full price, these guys deserve the money for their awesome work.			"

												One of the most visually impressive games around, made even more amazing by a new, remade version with an updated engine and some of the original versions annoyances supposedly ironed out. I haven't played the redux yet, but it comes packed in with the original game for new and past purchasers, which is a very nice move on the developer's part. With some of the most impressively detailed environments around, the sheer attention to detail alone is astounding. I'd almost recommend this one just for the enjoyment of wandering around looking at stuff, and I'm not the sort who usually cares about graphics. Realistic backgrounds meet strange fantasy elements to make for a very distinct look and feel to things. It really is like playing a dream sometimes. But prettiness aside, there is also a mystery to be solved here. It's quite a dark one, involving murder, cults, and other things I won't spoil. It all wraps up in a way I found a little unsatisfying, but it's still a compelling narrative to follow. Which is good, because narrative is all he game really has going for it in terms of game stuff. Exploring, some fairly simple puzzle solving, and piecing together the storyline is all there is to keep you busy in the fairly short playtime, but this one's much more compelling than the usual narrative-only games, with some wonderful twists and surprises in store for you as you explore. Not for anyone who wants action, but great at what it sets out to do.			"

												First, let me confirm: this game is simply beautiful. The richness of the environment draws you in and makes you want to explore Red Creek Valley. From the lighting, to the variety of flora and its movement in wind, to the sounds of the country side, you feel completely immersed. This gorgeous area is directly (and deliciously) juxtaposed to the tension that you feel while moving through it.And tension abounds. Imperceptible changes in volume of music, coupled with nothing really guiding your way through this mystery, leaves you with a threatening anxiety that hovers all around you, but not so much that you lose your desire to push on.  This invisible tension could be so great at times that when Propspero, the character you play, would rarely muse something aloud, it would cause me to jump!The game isn't stacked with monster filled closets that are on the ready to jump out at you, though. The atmosphere is baked from anticipation and the emptiness of this picturesque lakeside town. Nothing in the game feels disingenuous; all element are borne from the story first, no puzzle is a pixel hunt. Indeed, one of the best aspects of the game is sometimes you have to figure out what the puzzle is before you can actually begin to solve it!There are some missteps, of course. For one, the chronological mystery puzzles were so enjoyable that you find yourself disappointed as they become easier instead of harder as the game goes on. For another, its silent save system provides another kind of tension--the unwanted kind--as you are not exactly sure when the last save point was.  This game cries out for “save anywhere,” and it is a shame that it doesn't have it. Fortunately, this shortcoming is partly mitigated by the fact that this a video game “short story,” which means it is best played, in my opinion, in one sitting:  it can be played in a single afternoon or evening.All in all The Vanishing of Ethan Carter was a thoroughly enjoyable departure from tropes of the adventure genre, and one that I certainly recommend. It's not for everyone, of course, as this is an exploration/adventure game and one that takes a much more relaxed (albeit tense) pace to many  other game offerings.			"

												Incredibly good looking, supernatural, horror, puzzle type game. Influences from Twin Peaks and Alan Wake, which is awesome.It might be the best looking game that I have ever played. I keep thinking that I want to experience it in VR. Very photo-realistic in places and just generally eye-poppingly good looking.It's an interesting game too, with some nice puzzle and story/narrative mechanics. There are some really impressive surprises that happen that I really wasn't expecting.I haven't finished it yet, but very good so far. Interested to see where it goes.			"

												I shouldn't have waited so long to play this. It's a fantastic game that takes the gorgeous ""walking simulator"" foundation of Dear Esther and layers on some genuine detective gameplay, an unsettling, deeply engaging story, quietly perfect music, and some of the most gorgeous visuals I've ever witnessed in a game.Ethan Carter is frequently near-photorealistic, and only ""near"" because there's a gauzy sense of nostalgia and sadness coloring everything you see that sets it just above and to the side of reality. Everything is both tangibly real yet ethereal and dreamlike, which is the perfect atmosphere for a story like this.You play a paranormal detective, sent to an island to uncover the titular mystery of what happened to Ethan and his family. Think more Twin Peaks than CSI and you're on the right path. This story is both wrenching and wonderful in very different ways. I'll avoid spoilers and simply say that your head will be swimming in myth, terror, and awe in a truly cosmic manner by the time you reach the conclusion. It's far more than a murder mystery, is what I'm saying.This game is for anyone who enjoys exploration, storytelling, atmosphere, and puzzle solving. There are no action scenes or QTEs, but it will definitely tax your curiosity and problem solving skills at just the right mixture. What it does, it does perfectly.			"

												Wow... Im a huge fan of Games that are capable of really enveloping me into the world it creates around me and slowly unravels as I move forward; whether it's through its Art Direction, Sounds & Music, Story-Telling, or the little, inexplicable things that add to the experience. From what I have played so far (probably the first chapter of the game), The Vanishing of Ethan Carter nails it on all fronts. The atmosphere is serene  and, at the same time, feels lonely. If you enjoy mysterious intrigue, interesting game mechanics and puzzles and exploration in a beautifully presented lanscape, then this game meets and exceeds those expectations. Looking forward to seeing what these developers have in store for us next :)			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter has the freedom and gameplay of Myst, which includes a rarely-seen-in-modern-games sense of wonder at the ability to explore the gorgeous landscapes while not being blocked by invisible walls or constantly yelled at to get back on track. It's an exercise in letting the player control their own pacing and progress, and it works marvelously.The story and setting are channeling pure Alan Wake. And that's a good thing. The graphics are some of the best I have ever seen. High res textures and thoughtful lighting effects make it feel like you're walking through a carefully constructed work of art.The soundtrack is phenominal. It's one of the only games I've played recently where I want to listen to the music outside of the game. Although part of the brilliance is the way the tracks change based on context.Where the game suffers is in its saving system. You only get checkpoints after major puzzles are completed. This means that if you make partial progress on a puzzle and then move on to another and then another you won't have anything saved until you complete one, and then only that last puzzle is saved. When you load up the game the next time all that partial progress is gone. It's a befudling problem. On forums the developers have waxed ad naseum about how the engine (Unreal 3) doesn't easily support saving the whole state of the world. Ok...who cares? It's a weak excuse for a monstrous oversight. They obviously have the ability to create a save system outside the bounds of the engine, they just got lazy and didn't extend it far enough. If you can save the state of completing a puzzle, then you can also save each piece of the puzzle. There's definitely less than a hundred steps across all puzzles total, so even brute-forcing the system and manually checking each state would be a simple task for a single developer. I'm harping on this so much because loading up the game for my second session was one of the most jarring experiences I've ever had in a game. To have work I thought completed magically undone is not fun.Another problem is the lack of a fast travel system. Having to walk everywhere feels great at first, but by the end running around to get to locations that can be many minutes apart with nothing in between gets tiresome. And it's very easy to miss things so it's almost guaranteed that you'll be backtracking. A lot.The game can be a bit obtuse at times as well. If you happen to miss one tiny thing then completing a puzzle becomes impossible, and there are no hints, so you're just left wandering around the game world, knowing that you can't quit yet because your work on the current puzzle won't be saved.Overall Ethan Carter is an excellent, immersive experience. It's thought provoking, chilling, and awe-inspiring at different points. It has flaws, but once you get past them it's a journey worth taking.			"

												Pros:+Gorgeous graphics+intriguing and well done puzzles with a satisfying result when you complete one+creepy, beautiful, sad, quite an array of emotional scenes+A great endingCons:-Short, if you do every scene in the game, you can maybe get about 12 hours-If you miss something and you reach the end, it will give you a rather vague map of where to go to complete it.  Meaning you could be running for 15 minutes, which for a game that is about the story, is a minor irritationConclusion:An emotional story, great puzzles and overall a very satisfying experience.  The graphics are up there with an ENB-enhanced Skyrim, which is saying a lot.  For $20, I highly recommend it.Thoughts:For those wondering why I only have .4 hours logged, I have played and beaten it through, other means (make of that what you will) and after beating it, I went and bought it - this game was a no brainer assuming you have the money.It seems The Astronauts know that regardless of how good a game is, if the game is only a little over 10 hours, you don't charge $50 or $60, I highly respect this since it shows they know and respect their audience.  I will be watching their next title with anticipation.			"

												This game was amazing. Visually stunning, great soundtrack, and wonderful storytelling. The world manages to be beautiful, whimsical, dark, chilling, and sometimes downright scary. The few puzzles that do pop up are well thought out and logical, so don't go running for a walk-through! Explore, take your time, just when you think you're never going to find anything something pops up that makes the searching worth it. Some reviews say the ending is weird. Personally I think it's perfect, and explains everything. Now if this were a star rating system, I would give this game a 4 out of 5 and here is why. There are some technical issues that need to be addressed. The only save mechanism is an auto save at the end of each big scene. That was a little frustrating, but I could have accepted it if it were not for the bugs that pop up occasionally, forcing you to reload your last save, and start from square one in each segment. All in all, barring the technicl issues I really enjoyed this game and would say if you like the genre, dive in!			"

												If you know you have the patience for a game about exploring and solving puzzles slowly, then go for it. It’s the best looking game, and the way it tells the story is inventive.Only the audio has glaring faults. Like they didn’t fence off the sound zones properly. Sometimes sound and music will stop at the edges of the map. Near buildings it’ll sound as if you’re inside, even though you’re not. And similarly when you’re inside it can sound as if you’re outside when you step near certain walls. The script and acting can sometimes also sound just a bit off. Like it needed another pass in editing, and another take in the recording booth. Also in the end credits they only have music for half the credit roll, so you end up staring at scrolling names in dead silence. There’s just a layer of polish missing on the sound front.Apart from that it does what it sets out to do very well. Some of the puzzles require you to use your brain, and feel fun to solve. Others are the 3d equivalent to pixel hunting, but take place within clearly defined borders so you don’t go crazy searching for the clues. And boy does it look good. Might be worth it for that alone. Most importantly though the story has a good payoff. It’s a mystery with supernatural elements, and those often tend to fall flat in the end when the veil is lifted. This doesn’t.			"

The Lovecraftian story is what finally made me buy the game, it was mentioned on a highly rated review so I figured I'd put this on the top here.Probably the prettiest game I have played to date, the first ten minutes I just walked around looking at the scenery basically.The story, world and atmosphere are all top notch, really well made.The only thing I need to stress is keep your eyes open and don't rush through the areas since that will probably end up in you back tracking alot.I can't wait to see what comes next from The Astronauts!

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a beautiful little mystery game with stunning visuals and a great, lonly atmosphere.  On the surface, you're visiting this remote town in the woods to solve the mystery of what happened to the titular Ethan Carter, but there's far more going on below the surface.Highly recommended.

												An atmospheric, sometimes scary Lovecraft-esque adventure game with stunning graphics. Detective games are hard to do, since it is difficult to make the player feel like it is THEY who are performing the deductions/making the inferences. LA Noire and Murdered: Soul Suspect both failed to give the player this feeling, but The Vanishing of Ethan Carter IMO manages to nail it. The ""crime scene chronology"" mechanic is fantastic, elegant yet requires the use of your brain to make inferences from the clues. Having to return the scene of the crime back to how it was when the deceased was killed is also a nice touch and makes sense for a ""psychic detective.""The graphics are frankly gorgeous, although unfortunately the performance isn't as stable as it should be.The plot is good (although the ending can feel like a bit of an M. Night Shyamalan cop-out-twist-bordering-on-a-deus-ex-machina), the music is very appropriate and fitting, and I enjoyed my time with the game.The big drawback is the game's length; it can easily be finished in less than four hours. I'd advise buying the game if you love horror games, adventure/mystery/puzzle games, or just deeply atmospheric games in general. However, you may want to wait for a sale. The gameplay mechanics for the investigation scenes, however, are excellent, and I hope The Astronauts is planning to make more games like this... if this game is intended as a ""proof of concept"" for their idea of how to make a detective game, then I'd say they've proven their concept with flying colors.PROS:+ Best investigation mechanics I've yet encountered in a detective game+ Atmospheric+ Incredible graphicsCONS:- Brief- Uneven graphical performanceOverall: Fans of horror and/or adventure games should certainly consider purchasing this game.

												Worth. Every. Penny. Before I continue, I see the review section for TVoEC primarily loaded with the question of ""is it or isn't it worth $20?""  I consider it an ugly trend in gaming to place too much emphasis on value vs time.  If you must place a monetary value on a game, let it rest on your experience and not how long it to you to get there.  If you enjoy a 90 minute film, it's not crazy to spend $20 to buy and own in on DVD or Blu Ray.  The same should be said for gaming.  If you find that in your own opinion, a game is a work of art and you truly enjoyed it, then you should have no qualms about how much you paid for it.That said, In my opinion The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a work of art.  This is a game about stories, how they're told and the entire package is quite brilliant.  I'll save writing a wordier review because this game doesn't need someone else to explain why you need to play it.  Just know that you should.  If you're like me, it's going to stick with you for awhile. Pros: +Presentation.  This is hands down, one of the best looking games I've ever seen.+Story.  It wasn't until it was over that I realized just how good it was. +Characters.  I actually cared.  That's all that mattered. +Gameplay/Sound Design/Atmosphere.  All present and a solid foundation for the above. Cons-The save system.  It's not broken and it's not terrible.  It should however be explained the the audience before playing.  The game saves upon completion of a puzzle.  There's no icon.  There's no warning.  When you continue your game you will standing where ever you were on the map when you completed your last  puzzle.  This can be initially frustrating.  If you're in the middle of a puzzle (some are long form) and you need to stop...this means your work will be undone and you will have to take another scenic hike to get back to where you were.  If you have a decent memory, it's fairly simple to retrace your steps quickly when you come back, but it is a hassle.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter it's a WEIRD FICTION inspired adventure game, with stunning visual, atmospheric music, non-linear story and gameplay that could leave a mark on every player.The player has the ability to explore almost every corner of the valley since the beginning, while collecting hints with psychic powers like clairvoyance (clairsentience) and psychometry about the location of a boy who needs the help of the main character and P.I. specialized in supernatural, Paul Prospero.From beginning to end, the game could be speedrunned quite easily knowing all the location and scenes, and even for the first time some people may finish it with little efforts.For myself was 4-5 hours of gameplay for the first run, and I was surprised a bit.Anyway, with its peculiar *not holding hands* gameplay some aspects like story and exploration may be not so obvious for some people so the gameplay time may differ from player to player. The game itself, if explored and thinked about has more replay value than a lot games in the market, each time you play it, you may find new things and details missed.Kind of game you wanna show to your friends after you finished it, while giving no spoilers about.It has 2 parts that are quite a surprise, almost a jump-scare, since the game is quite slow-paced to help the player *breathe the air of the valley*.About the ending, without spoilers, the game could get off-guard some players. Exploration holds the key for most answers, not all!A must for Myst-loving players and those who want depth in a game without much help for understanding the *truth*.Recommended in general for adventure-games fan and for the Lovecraft-lore addict.

												Pros:+Gorgeous graphics+intriguing and well done puzzles with a satisfying result when you complete one+creepy, beautiful, sad, quite an array of emotional scenes+A great endingCons:-Short, if you do every scene in the game, you can maybe get about 12 hours-If you miss something and you reach the end, it will give you a rather vague map of where to go to complete it.  Meaning you could be running for 15 minutes, which for a game that is about the story, is a minor irritationConclusion:An emotional story, great puzzles and overall a very satisfying experience.  The graphics are up there with an ENB-enhanced Skyrim, which is saying a lot.  For $20, I highly recommend it.Thoughts:For those wondering why I only have .4 hours logged, I have played and beaten it through, other means (make of that what you will) and after beating it, I went and bought it - this game was a no brainer assuming you have the money.It seems The Astronauts know that regardless of how good a game is, if the game is only a little over 10 hours, you don't charge $50 or $60, I highly respect this since it shows they know and respect their audience.  I will be watching their next title with anticipation.			"

												One of the most visually impressive games around, made even more amazing by a new, remade version with an updated engine and some of the original versions annoyances supposedly ironed out. I haven't played the redux yet, but it comes packed in with the original game for new and past purchasers, which is a very nice move on the developer's part. With some of the most impressively detailed environments around, the sheer attention to detail alone is astounding. I'd almost recommend this one just for the enjoyment of wandering around looking at stuff, and I'm not the sort who usually cares about graphics. Realistic backgrounds meet strange fantasy elements to make for a very distinct look and feel to things. It really is like playing a dream sometimes. But prettiness aside, there is also a mystery to be solved here. It's quite a dark one, involving murder, cults, and other things I won't spoil. It all wraps up in a way I found a little unsatisfying, but it's still a compelling narrative to follow. Which is good, because narrative is all he game really has going for it in terms of game stuff. Exploring, some fairly simple puzzle solving, and piecing together the storyline is all there is to keep you busy in the fairly short playtime, but this one's much more compelling than the usual narrative-only games, with some wonderful twists and surprises in store for you as you explore. Not for anyone who wants action, but great at what it sets out to do.			"

												First, let me confirm: this game is simply beautiful. The richness of the environment draws you in and makes you want to explore Red Creek Valley. From the lighting, to the variety of flora and its movement in wind, to the sounds of the country side, you feel completely immersed. This gorgeous area is directly (and deliciously) juxtaposed to the tension that you feel while moving through it.And tension abounds. Imperceptible changes in volume of music, coupled with nothing really guiding your way through this mystery, leaves you with a threatening anxiety that hovers all around you, but not so much that you lose your desire to push on.  This invisible tension could be so great at times that when Propspero, the character you play, would rarely muse something aloud, it would cause me to jump!The game isn't stacked with monster filled closets that are on the ready to jump out at you, though. The atmosphere is baked from anticipation and the emptiness of this picturesque lakeside town. Nothing in the game feels disingenuous; all element are borne from the story first, no puzzle is a pixel hunt. Indeed, one of the best aspects of the game is sometimes you have to figure out what the puzzle is before you can actually begin to solve it!There are some missteps, of course. For one, the chronological mystery puzzles were so enjoyable that you find yourself disappointed as they become easier instead of harder as the game goes on. For another, its silent save system provides another kind of tension--the unwanted kind--as you are not exactly sure when the last save point was.  This game cries out for “save anywhere,” and it is a shame that it doesn't have it. Fortunately, this shortcoming is partly mitigated by the fact that this a video game “short story,” which means it is best played, in my opinion, in one sitting:  it can be played in a single afternoon or evening.All in all The Vanishing of Ethan Carter was a thoroughly enjoyable departure from tropes of the adventure genre, and one that I certainly recommend. It's not for everyone, of course, as this is an exploration/adventure game and one that takes a much more relaxed (albeit tense) pace to many  other game offerings.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a short game, but I quite enjoyed it.  It has a wonderful sense of atmosphere: beautiful environments, lovely music, and a mystery to drive you forward.  The story was smaller in scope than I originally thought, but I liked it.The puzzles were not hard, but they were interesting enough to give me a sense that I was solving the mystery, and I genuinely enjoyed how their investigation system would bring up multiple observations and new questions, rather than just stating observable facts.My only complaints were some bad framerate when transitioning between areas and some unnecessary backtrack at the end.  My computer only has 4GB of ram, so the game paged memory to disc pretty aggressively, but it settled down once I got to the next area.  The backtracking was not required by the game design, but rather me not knowing where to go after one particular cause-and-effect puzzle.			"

												Great game with elements of exploration, puzzle, mystery and some horror. The game additionally is sort of experimental, where some in-game graphic elements are achieved through very high quaility (in terms of detail) photography, which overall makes this game the best looking one I have played so far. In several spots in the game I ended up wandering around the scene and looking for a perfect composition for a screenshot (landscape photography instincts kicked in).The game is not hard, the puzzles are average in difficulty, but there aren't many of them: approximately 30% of the game. The rest of the gameplay is exploration, which is very rewarding because of fantastic visuals. The story is mysterious and dark, but for me was a bit confusing. Gameplay is otherwise based on detective style. The soundtrack is beautiful ambient stuff, and brought back the feeling of wandering around the mountains in Skyrim.Overall a very impressive game: strange, weird, dark, amazingly beautiful, with a fantastic atmosphere. Now, if you will excuse me, I am off to try and mod Skyrim to look like this.			"

												This is the best graphically looking game I have ever played. It looks stunning on every graphical setting and I managed to run with smooth 60 FPS on my old GTS 250. Miracle, really. The original UE3 version, that is. UE4 redux was not tested on 250 but it happily ran just as well on GTX 970... Not surprising of course, but everything was cranked up, even 150% resolution scale.Other than that, it's a good walking simulator with great self-explanatory puzzles, controls and gameplay are intuitive, loading screens are non-existent and environments are gorgeous. The game definitely deserves more positive reviews and I can't possibly understand where all the negative reviews come from.			"

												I stumbled across this game many years ago through a mix of gaming coverage an the developers Tumblr. Their photoscanning techniques an picturesque test shots were amazing. When the game was coming up on being released I preordered an played it the night it came out.I put off the review over an over again an here I am almost half a year writing the review. This game is a masterpiece when it comes to a sense of place. The photoscanning they used to create their models helped more than hurt an at the end of the day it left them with a game that looks like a place. Maybe not the real world but it is a real world somewhere else an we just get a glimpse of it.The gameplay is the hard part, it starts off tough if you decide to do the first few mysteries you come across, not always in plain site clues an no clear indication where to go next. Though the charm is it's entirely avoidable. Steam's achievement system proves this achievements for secondary mysteries are more likely to be completed than the main story achievements.  Solving mysteries aren't easy an neither are they in this game, which on one hand makes them amazing an on the other a pain in the rear the first time round depending on the mystery.Moving away from that I find myself in the soundtrack an audio section, mainly because the cues to figuring out if you solved a mystery are vital to that system working, much like the music is vital to helping put the player in a relaxed but uneasy emotional state. Fitting for the story of this game.An speaking of story boy does this game have one, or two, or three. Heck, after that ending I'm not even sure but overall I found it enjoyable. It never left me going "" let's finish this already"" instead at the end I was wanting more.The sign of a good, but short story. I hope that where ever this company decides to go next they take the lessons, an maybe some of the story with them as I anticipate what is next from them.So overall I feel ""The Vanishing of Ethan Carter"" is a beautiful, interesting game that bears playing once or twice to try an fully comprehend the story it's telling an to enjoy all the detail they've put into this game.

												Strength points :-The vanishing of Ethan Carter has the best of all things in its genere. The game has first and foremost nice and engaging story, mysterious and unpredictable world, awesome music that adds a lot to the games worth, and beautiful graphics. This is one of the best looking games I have ever played and I dare to say it can even compete with Crysis 3 in terms of graphics. Depending on how you play and how fast you are it can take at least 4 hours to finish every part, but I didn't finish the game in rush, instead I took my time to try and discover, read and contemplate everything, when I entered the decayed houses I was thinking how the people lived in there as a family and I was trying to fit every piece or item to the members of that house. This game mix between sorrow, fear and doubt. Be cautious with eveything you do and prepare yourself for the odds that you might face. Drawbacks :-As awesome as TVoEC that doesn't mean it has no weaknesses. The most obvious weakness is the saving system and the second is the lack of time system, the game always takes place during daytime, no matter how long you explore in the gameworld it is always daytime, there is no nighttime which adds a lot to the experience and increase the fear factor which makes the game much more enjoyable.All in all this game is totally worth your money and time. 9.5/10.

												WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE YOU PLAY:This game is beautiful and I like the puzzles, but 2 hours into it I learned I had no clue how to play it and could not figure it out from the options, etc. So here's what I've learned so far about the game mechanics that you need to know before playing (no spoilers):1. When a word comes up multiple times like a floaty question, slowly look around until all the words overlap to form a single word. It will then flash you into a ""scene"" that shows what you're looking for and it will be in that direction. If you do not do this, the item won't appear. I walked past a crank like 7 times without it highlighting because I didn't know about this mechanic. Don't even ask me about the rock. Afterwards, it's actually pretty cool and makes you feel a little more psychic (plus you can actually play the game the way it's meant without giving up or resorting to walkthroughs).2. You have an inventory. It doesn't come up. You can't call it up. Things are just pocketed and then pop out when you need them to do something. Therefore you can forget what you're carrying. But don't worry, #3. will help with that.3. When you leave a mystery area, the thing resets if you didn't complete it. That means things go out of your hidden inventory and back on the ground if you picked something up. Portals come back to their original state, etc. So if you want to start the little area over, leave and come back.4. Holding Shift while you move makes you run. Holding Ctrl while you move makes you crouch.I'm sure there's more. I've only been playing a couple of hours and was totally confused and broke down to see a bit of a walkthrough and realized these mechanics. Back I go to trying it without, because I like the challenge and actually role playing as a detective rather than walking through. Sounds like this game is short with the walk through so the time to figure it out will give me value in the game and satisfaction of ""solving the dissapearance""If anything else weird pops up that is a mechanic instead of a story piece, I'll post it here.

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is predominantly a point and click game, reminiscent of Myst and similar titles. It is a captivating, if brief experience that immerses you in a gorgeous world as you attempt to uncover its dark secrets. First off, the game’s strengths:The WorldThis game holds some of the best environment visuals I have ever seen. On my journey from plot point to plot point, I would often explore around for no other reason than to take in the views and enjoy the love and care the developers put into every detail. However, the game was very demanding on my computer's resources. On my quad-core i5 with 16GB RAM and Nvidia GTX 680, the game was all but unplayable on high settings due to framerate stutters. With some tweaking, I was able to reasonable smoothness but the framerate still chugged from time to time.The PuzzlesWhile most point-and-click game puzzles are simply a matter of finding an item X and combining it with location Y to proceed, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter introduces a refreshing take on these mechanics. Most puzzles consist stumbling across a potential crime scene, restoring the scene to its original state, and then deducing the chain of events that led to that outcome. The game offers only a bare minimum amount of hints and does not give the player any instruction on the mechanics of a puzzle or the expected outcome. While this may be a negative for some players, I found I enjoyed solving the puzzles more, as I had to rely only on my reasoning and observations.The AtmosphereI would not label this game as being a horror title per-se - there is only one jump scare to be found in the game (which is legitimately terrifying!) - but throughout my playthrough, I was surrounded by a constant feeling of dread and suspense. Walking through the game's seemingly abandoned rural setting evoked a great feeling of loneliness and mystery which, when combined with the game's superb score and dark supernatural themes, left me constantly expecting something terrifying to jump out at me or attack me. And now, some things you might not like:The WalkingThe game provides you with no guidance on what you are supposed to do or where you are supposed to go and places you in a fairly large open world where it can be easy to miss certain puzzles entirely. Indeed, I missed two or three of the first puzzles entirely and had to backtrack to complete them later. This can be frustrating and time consuming, especially considering the game's minimalistic HUD does not include a map. Fortunately, the game features a sprint option and does include a map/fast-travel system in one section of the game that allows you to jump to any puzzles you might have missed. The game's beautiful environment also helps make this trekking more bearable/enjoyable.The EndingI found the majority of the game to be very intriguing. The fact that the player knows nothing about the events they are uncovering or even who they are or why they are there really drives the story and draws the player in. However, I found the game's ending to be rather predictable (I saw it coming about halfway through the game) and felt that the twist it tries to pull somewhat falls flat.Character ModelsThe few characters you see in The Vanishing of Ethan carter appear to be slightly stylized or are, at least, less-detailed/realistic than the rest of the game. This causes their visual appearance to jar with the heavily detailed environment. However, this is a pretty minor nitpick and is easily overlooked.If you are looking for an atmospheric, narrative experience you can complete in an afternoon or are a fan of mystery, puzzle, or point-and-click adventure games, this title is definitely worth your attention. I enjoyed my playthrough a lot and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. If you are looking for a longer title with more of a focus on dialog or action or are a gamer with a less-powerful rig, this may not be the game for you.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a short but amazing game.To be honest I found it very refreshing that in this game there are no hints no log book no map no nothing just you the player.The game lets you walk around and complete the missions in what ever order you want to.You can find yourself lost from time to time not knowing what to do or where to go next or what item you're missing but that didn't bother me because while I was looking for the clue I missed I was surrounded by this beautiful environment.If you like mystery games than you will like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.The Vanishing of Ethan Carter was a very refreshing and amazing experience.

												Beautiful graphics even on low settings, beautiful music and truly great atmosphere that left a lasting impression on me.  The story is the main focus here, which IMO totally justifies the shortness of the game (no unnecessary padding) and maybe even the lack of manual saving - there was just one sequence in which it was possible to ""die"" (as in get kicked back to the previous autosave point), and in that case the checkpoint was so close it didn't bother me at all. My only annoyance with this game was the technical bug some people experience at startup (see forum), but I solved that in just a few minutes by fiddling with the graphics settings. Also the spinning camera gave me motion sickness, so that's something to keep in mind if you're sensitive to that sort of thing. Some reviews have called this game a glorified walking simulator, and sure, it is pretty linear and the puzzles aren't particularly difficult. But it does also have elegant gameplay mechanics and multiple story layers that made me eager to keep playing and unraveling the mystery. If you like immersion and moderately paced, contemplative storytelling you'll probably enjoy this game. If you go in expecting tons of jumpscares and action... well, you won't find them but you might enjoy the game anyway.			"

 The Vanishing of Ethan Carter  Paul Prospero, a detective with paranormal abilities, receives a curious fan letter from Ethan Carter, a young boy who is disturbingly aware of the supernatural. Ethan's letter brings Paul to the fictional Red Creek Valley, where Ethan's family resides. Already aware that Ethan is missing, Paul begins to explore Red Creek Valley and investigate its dark secrets... The previous introduction to the story was copied and pasted from the game's wikipedia page since it compresses the story nicely. In my opinion the story was absolutely intriguing from start to finish. It kept me interested and wanting more. During the game you can see how it was inspired by H.P. Lovecraft. That fact gave me some nice cold shivers. The game left me with wanting more after the 4 hour long adventure. Even though 4 hours is a short time for a game, I think it was worth every second of it (you can pretty much beat the game in 2 hours if you know what you are doing).The introduction should also give you an idea about what you are doing in this game. You investigate the happenings of Red Creek Valley to hopefully find the missing boy, Ethan Carter. The gameplay itself is pretty straightforward. You have to find missing objects and return them to where they originally were to reveal visions from the past. These visions will tell you what happened at certain places. That is the gameplay in a nutshell and it is actually very relaxing. At least most of the time.This is where the game really surprised me. The graphics and the soundtrack. The game has some unbelievably gorgeous sceneries and buildings that look very unique and realistic. You can't just walk past them without staring for a moment or two. The soundtrack contains some well made music that will have you relaxed and sometimes on the edge of your seat. Nutshell Gameplay: 7/10Graphics: 10/10Sounds and music: 8/10Performance: 8/10Story: 8/10Length: 6/10 Conclusion The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a short yet an extraordinary game that will impress you with its graphics and enthrall you with an interesting story. I was eager to keep on going and I could've completed the game on one go, but I had other things to do. So if you are looking for a good story, graphics and soundtrack then this is the game for you. I just hope that the developers (The Astronauts) are planning on making more games like this. I bought this game from the summer sale of 2015. I feel like I robbed the damn studio. 9/10  ""An adventure unlike any other"" Please let me know if I missed anything. You are also free to give me your own opinions! :) Thank you  "

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a fun game if you want something that is rather relaxed, but mysterious. However, if you're looking for something more engaging, you probably won't find that here. Overall, the game's visuals are beautiful and stunning. The environments look spectacular and the building architecture even more so. From a distance, everything in the world looks beautiful, but once you start getting closer to structures you begin to see that the once spectacular buildings have been reclaimed by nature. The story is nice, but nothing special. However, the voice acting for the most part is top notch. In terms of gameplay, you can walk or run; there is no jumping. Solving puzzles in the game is trivial, and even though it's opened world, there are invisible walls in abundance.In conclusion, if you're looking for a game that will keep you going for hours on end, this is not that game. The whole story can be completed in less than 3 hours, and to my knowledge, I only skipped one murder investigation. However, if you're looking for that atmospheric and visually stunning game, this might just be the game you've been looking for.			"

												In mind of audiobooks this one is something that you might best call a playbook.Just like in Dear Esther or the Myst series, the engine of this title is primarely a vehicle to tell a well written story, while the gameplay is only implemented for the interaction and immersion of the player. It is nothing you can just consume like a movie. It is something you need to work with in order to get the story for reward.In Dear Esther you just needed to press [W] an move the mouse for this reward. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter now is a little bit more demanding, because of its paranormal detective puzzles. But still, everything is easy to solve and most of the time it is not much more demanding than reading a book.This was fine to me, because when I bought this one, I didn't expect a intellectual challenge like Myst or Riven. I just expected a good story in a graphical invironment and after my playthorugh I can tell you: Hell yeah. It was a great experience!			"

												*NO SPOILERS, DON'T PANIC* A short and melancholy old school adventure game in glorious photo-sourced 3D. Despite many reviewers disliking the end I have to disagree, I found it quite fitting for the mood and a nice way to bring everthing back down to Earth after working through a fantastical tale.The puzzles are fairly simple, but the game's refusal to give any hints makes them much more satisfying than other modern mystery games' hand holding investigations. The answers are always there, but you have to take a deep breath, read whats on screen and think through your actions, not just curse the game and look up a walkthrough. I highly recommend giving it a play, especially if you'd like a nice walk through a New England town, trickled with some gruesome crimes in need of your expert wit as a paranormal detective.			"

												Easily the most atmospheric and beautiful game I've ever played. I wouldn't hesitate to call it art either, owing to the craftsmanship put into the story and the way it's told. The gameplay itself can get a bit repetitive as there's only one basic mechanic, but the real selling points of the game are the music, atmosphere and story, so it isn't lost on this fact alone. That is to say, the mechanics of the gameplay itself is not what you'll be playing this type of game for anyway.A fair warning, though: as a mystery and exploration-oriented game with a rather large environment, it does require a lot of patience and searching. (And a decent graphics card, if you want to enjoy it fully.) However, in my opinion, this works out to the game's advantage since this ensures you spend enough time in each area to fully appreciate all the scenery.			"

												The world in The Vanishing of Ethan Carter first appears as a beautiful yet sleepy backwoods town, but it quickly becomes apparent that not all is well. A more desolate, abandoned feel grows on Red Creek Valley, like it's been neglected by the outside world for decades, its prime time having long passed. This eerie view of our mundane world is also visible through the documents and newspaper clippings found throughout the valley, portraying an outside view of life in this rural neck of the woods. These external reports are starkly contrasted by Ethan Carter's own imagination, channeling the same goings-on into those of the supernatural, seen in stories scattered across the valley.The Vanishing of Ethan Carter shows an interesting and deep outlook on life—the mundane, sleepy world, against the fantastic imagination of a child. This powerful story combines with a beautiful, polished world together with an immersive music score and great voice acting yielding a top-notch game. But it is what you make of it, as you can beat it in a couple hours if you run from start to finish and skip most of the mysteries, but you will miss out on its deep story. On the other hand, if you explore the whole world and look for all its secrets, puzzles, and mysteries, the game will really shine its brightest.Another unique and enjoyable part of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is its detective gameplay that reveals pieces of the story with each mystery solved. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is as close as you can get to making a detective novel into a game, and the result is something excellent. The game's succinct yet powerful, thought-provoking dialogue and story tied with its eerie, dark, supernatural premise makes it well worth the time of anyone that enjoys well-crafted mysteries and games with deeper meanings that will stay with players long after finishing.

												NOT worth $20!A beautiful game with easy to pick up, limited gameplay. Only took me 3 hours to beat (howlongtobeat.com says its a 4hr average), and there are only 2 secret achievements that are not part of the main story (which take all of 10 mins to get).Only buy this game on sale, it's only worth about $5, no more than $10.

												Very beautiful and atmospheric investigation game with a few flaws.   8/10  highly recommend but not at full price, wait for sales (50-60% off)Positives:-story-ambience, music, beautiful scenery-i did feel the horror element of the game through the whole game without actually fighting anything(accomplished through music and all the forest sounds, pretty creepy)-puzzles are interesting enough without being too hard-love how the world is open to explore and you can backtrack to collect achievements-enjoyed how they did the reconstruct what happened chronologically with ghosts and it reminded me a lot of Murdered : Soul SuspectNegatives:-save system is bad (game saves at predetermined spots which usually overlap with a chapter/mystery being solved)  Then again its not too long so most people will finish it in a sitting or two.-game is kinda short (around 4h i guess) but it also feels like a natural ending not forced or sped up. Only reason why i do think the game is one to buy on a sale.Conclusion:Make more games like these, Really good and ejoyable.			"

												(10/10)Utterly stunning work.  I really don't know what else to say.  It is an adventure style game, a bit more in the vein of myst than the classic point and click.  The execution though, was flawless and I mean that quite literally.  Every single aspect of what has made games like myst such classics has been executed to utter perfection. The graphics and sound are beyond immersive and pushing the boundries of what photo realism can achieve on current generation hardware.  The story is suble yet compelling.  The integration of puzzles is perfectly executed as a touch of surrealism that feels completely natural in this world of crumbling structures and abandoned buildings.Nothing is explained to you, but everything felt completely natural.  I even managed to solve one of the puzzles before I actually got to the 'hint/reference' area for it, simply by thinking and proceeding naturally based on the light/shadows/architecture and that was tremenduously satisfying.The 'user interface' such as it is, is just simple text tracing the thoughts of your character.   Puzzles that would otherwise be potentially punitively frustrating, have built in systems to help you along in a totally natural feeling way... Can't find something? when the text gets a little blurry, look around until you can focus and you can find your way forwards, etc.In the end though the main 'character' of the game is the world itself.  I could honestly just lose myself wandering through the paths and at times I felt like I already had.  I could swear I've seen bits and pieces of this world in my own life over the years and thats really utterly outstanding.  Normally this is where I would reccomend it to fans of the genre or to people who like x or y.  Honestly though for something of this caliber, its appeal can transcend its genre completely.  Whoever you are, whatever you like, dim the lights, put this game on, and allow yourself to fall into its world and come out amazed.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a puzzle narrative walking-simulator game.No-Hud, no weapons, no enemies just pure exploration and puzzle solving.I swear this game is a feast for the eyes, with stunning graphics and extremely detailed environment and beautiful landscapes. If you have a decent system, seriously don't pass on playing the Redux version. The graphics will blow you away on max settings.The story and the ending is a bit complicated, and the puzzles are sometimes very cryptic i had to use YouTube several times. Although the game says in the very beginning it won't hold your hands through the journey, meaning this game is mainly for puzzle fans but that doesn't mean anyone can enjoy it. As a non-fan of walking-simulator games, I recommend this game. I loved it, especially the visuals and atmosphere. Walking through the forests and at the dam were really fun and a great time.I can't think of negatives to be honest, but i know many people hate short games (I don't mind them), so beware this game can takes from 2 ~ 6 hours to complete with 100% achievements.8.5/10 - Recommended on sales unless you have no problem spending $20 on a short game.

												An utterly beautiful game, enthralling and mesmerising from start to finish. Akin to Portal, it's one of those short but as short as it needs to be games. The story and enviroment are incredibly immersive to a degree I've not sure I've seen in any other game. The game plays almost like a first-person interactive novel, and is a truly unique experience. Sadly due to the short length of the game I can't really recommend it at full price, but if you can pick it up in a sale it is absolutely worth it; one of the best games I've played in a very long time.

												While this game has outstanding visuals and music, the atmosphere and especially story itself not as solid as gameplay trailer wanted us to believe. In fact, there is not much story at all and after you finish the game this part of the game feels highly underdelivered. So if you are looking for a book-like narrative experience, you should probably invest your time in some good book instead. Well, what do you do when you did not like the game that much and think it is rather overhyped, but definitely want the developers to continue their work? I guess, you ""recommend"" it.			"

												What's this? An artsy game that's actually... good? Nah nah nah nah that's not possible... No developer could possibly make an artsy game without the pretentiousness that comes with it...Except for this one.This ""game"" (rather, interactive narrative), sets the bar for every indie developer out there looking to make the next ""Her Story"" or ""Gone Home"" or any other pretentious ""game"" out there.The visuals are stunning; Unreal Engine 4 makes the game look absolutely gorgeous. The plot remains interesting throughout the entirety of the game, and I was never drawn out from the experience. The music is beautifully written, and the dynamic of it is superb (dynamic meaning it changes seamlessly depending on whatever you're looking at).I also love the stylization of the text whenever you inspect clues; it adds to the immersiveness of playing as a detective.My only complaint is that it's not worth $20. Pick it up whenever it's 75% off though, and you'll definitely be intrigued finding Ethan Carter.			"

												Pros: Absolutely gorgeous, a stunning ambient soundtrack, and a smartly-written story that surprised me.Cons: Long stretches of boring walking, few things to actually do, and quite short (once you realize exploration is pointless).My biggest issue with this game is that there wasn't enough times where I actually got to do something.  There are two types of ""interactive"" encounters in the game: solving murders that have occurred through that spirit's memories and a handful of puzzles of varying complexity.  Unfortunately, there are far more of the former than the latter, with there only being three real puzzles in the entire game (and one of those barely counts as a puzzle).  The crime solving parts were interesting but too simplistic to really challenge me in any way.If you are coming to this looking for a purely narrative experience, it isn't bad (albeit a little overpriced).  If you're like me, however, and wanted a good first-person adventure game to sink your teeth into, this just doesn't have the legs to sustain that desire.			"

												Shows some promise in storytelling, but way too many issues. Better tape your shift key down so you can move at a normal speed the whole game. Constant lighting issues. Completely bullpoop hidden areas to progess to the point of pixel hunting. Slenderman ""spooky"" maze portions for no reason other than Slenderman was popular. Level design is a mess as what looks like broad open areas are really small confined hallways.The disclaimer at the beginning that the game doesn't hold your hand is a HUGE red flag and ended up being correct that the game is simply poorly designed. Be ready for backtracking because the game explains literally nothing and not for any sort of puzzle solving or exploration reasons given the hallway issue.Honestly confused about the positive reviews. The whole game feels like wandering from one hallway to the next hoping desperately to find something interesting.			"

												Interesting game.  I'll start with the negatives, though.  First, the game is a bit short.  It took me about 6 hours to finish the whole thing with all Achievments and exploring everywhere.  It's not a ""rushed"" or incomplete one, it just isn't one you're going to spend the next several days playing.  Second, most of the time in the game will actually be spent getting from mystery scene to mystery scene.  Once you're where you belong, solving the mysteries isn't all that difficult.  And finally, this is a ""no handholding"" game.  That's fine for the mechanics of the game:  it's trivial to interact with the world properly.  What it does need is a blurb on just what it is you're supposed to be doing.  I spent a couple of hours wandering around finding things and still had no idea what I was missing.  I'll give you a hint so you don't fall into that hole, too:  if you find a body, your job is to put the crime scene back to it's pre-crime state so you can re-create the thing.Now, the positives:  the game is absolutely beautiful.  It's got gorgeous scenery, design, ambience, acting, etc..  I can find no fault with it.  Plus, once you figure out what you're doing, the story is very interesting.I'm almost on the borderline on whether or not I recommend the game, though.  Why?  Because even though the game is beautiful, interesting and well-done, it IS still short.  I bought it on sale for $11.99 and that's just a bit high for the time you get to spend with the game (it has zero replayability since it's a mystery).  If you can find it for less than $10, I'd say go for it.			"

												The vanishing of Ethan Carter is a strange game. Obviously, it's beautiful and looks great, but is there more? A classic soundtrack is triggered whenever necessary to support the strong, mystical and somewhat threatening mood. The game consists of ten different puzzles. Put together they tell a story. Personally, I did not like the story. Until the decryption of the last riddle there are quite a number of aspects in the story that make no sense.Some years ago I read a book that in the end turned out to be a dream, making the whole story meaningless. In a similar fashion this applies to 'The vanishing if Ethan Carter'. I don't think it is possible to find a clear verdict if this game deserves a recommendation or not. It's simply a matter of taste. And while I do understand the many positive reviews for this game, I can not join the group of proponents. You have to find out for yourself if you like this game or not.Pros: - beautiful graphics - strong atmosphere - good music - easy achievements - a piece of artCons: - somewhat a walking simulator - very brutal - dark, strange, bizarre story - short (10 puzzles) - linear - few moments of surprising joy - only things to do: read notes, find half a dozen items, arrange story events in the correct sequence - no side quests - you can't make any decisions - didn't touch me emotionally - no direct dialogues with NPCs, you can only listen - not challenging			"

There is not that much in convensional gameplay per say, the puzzles are few and very easy and it's mostly walking in very pretty (but bleak) enviroments. But that is not a bad thing as long as you are prepared for it. This is what ""walking simulators"" should try to be. It's a short game, but well worth playing.

												Let's start off with the good side of things. The graphics, in short, are the best you can witness at this point in time. It is really a stunning looking game. I'm really surprised I can't actually smell the environment through my screen because it looks so beautiful. 10/10 - This really sets a bar, and simply needs to be experienced to be believed.Sound design is also exceptional. All the music and other auditory cues are timed very well and create a good atmosphere. I do feel that a lot of games get this right, though. Having played other games where atmosphere is important, I think developers realize that you just can't build a good immersive game without the proper auditory cues. This game makes great use of its music, sound effects, and just absolute, dead silence whenever necessary. It creates a very eerie atmosphere indeed.The story is very intriguing itself. It's got a nice, Bioshock level twist at the end. I do have to say that I expected this game to be a bit more focused on the ""horror"" aspect, and I found the story undermines it a little bit. It's hard to explain this without actually spoiling the story, but needless to say, I felt fairly confident that I'm unlikely to be in any actual threat, or at least the threats are going to be rather infrequent. It's not a bad story, though, in fact quite the contrary, it's a good story told very well. It just happens to miss the theme that I was expecting from the game. It's still very chilling as it progresses. It's just that you as a character are not participating in it, just observing it.Now on with the negatives.Steam will show that my play time for this game is about 3 hours or so. That's how long it really took to get through this game. Why is it so short? It makes it feel more like a minigame than a full fledged title. This short play time really makes me wish that the developers actually cut down some of the time they spent on the graphics and sunk more of it into creating an actual game. Pretty graphics are all well, but I want a good game.And that's another thing. This game can well be called an Eerie Walking Simulator. It's very minimalistic in almost all content that actually matters. It's a great experience, but it's so hard to actually call this a game. I think I would have felt no shame in just watching someone play it on youtube. It would spare me some of the backtracking if I just happened to miss one of the puzzles in the world, having to go back to it just to unlock the final narrative. I do like the fact that no one is holding your hand, however, and the fact that the world is, for the most part, open even if there is little of it.Overall, the experience is great, and the quality of execution is superb, but because of that, quantity suffers greatly. At 3-5 hours, you can easily finish it in one sitting even if you take your time to explore the environment. I'll recommend the game, but only if its on sale. I give it 7/10, just because of its length and the small amount of stuff to do in it. Despite the shortness, it's got a great story, great graphics, and great sound. If you can't get it on sale, watch it somewhere on youtube because it's worth at least that much.			"

												Incredible, breathtaking visuals enabled by creative use of photogrammetry and loving, meticulous artistic work. The amount of effort that went into crafting every meter of the world here is unmatched even by the best triple-A teams working on budgets orders of magnitude bigger. This is a masterpiece in environment art, an example to study. I definitely recommend reading the development blogs of the project for the look into the process - lots of developers should learn from this game.This carefully crafted environment is not there to be a passive eye candy either - it's an irreplaceable tool for telling the story. It sets the mood, manipulates your expectations and carefully directs your progression through the story. I'm not really sure what can be done to improve the game, actually. It's a complete, well-executed, focused product. There is no need for more action, the peaceful walks at your own pace are the definitive way to go through the experience - there is no place for explosions, crowds or thrilling chases here. There is no need for bigger environment - you don't need rock climbing, wing suits, boats and additional ten kilometers of lush forest to tell this story. There is no need for weapons, for inventory, for HUD.The sound work deserves high praise too - the environment is brought to life through masterful use of ambient, and the music is brilliant. So yeah, can definitely recommend this. Even if you prefer more active genres, this is a game is worth supporting - it represents the work attitude, fascination with art and understanding of narratives that I would love to see more in the game development industry.

Don't pay full price (it takes about 3-4 hours to play through. 20 bucks? seriously? Buy it at least at 40% off) and 2. Don't expect a FPS, You should be happy with this game. I'm happy with my purchase, it's basically interactive story telling. Don't let this game be about ""beating the game"" and it will definitely be worth playing. If beating the game is all games are worth to you, don't even bother with The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, it will just go over your head and dissapoint you.			"

												This game is a hardcore mystery/puzzle game not for the faint at heart but if you do play the game you will see it has some of the best visuals ever for a game. It is truly eye candy. The PC version is built on the Unreal 3 engine and the PS4 version is built on the Unreal 4 engine. There will be an update coming for PC that will update to the U4 engine soon. I can only imagine what the game will look like when this happens. Until then I have stop playing the game and will continue when the changes have been made.			"

												Great game. Took me about 5 hours to beat. The atmosphere and scenery of the game is amazing. The only issue I had with the game was that it has a lot of backtracking. When I was at the end of the game, I realized that I had missed the forst puzzle (the traps) and had to go back to the very start of the game, solve that puzzle, and walk back which took maybe 40-50 minutes since I had to basically go from the end of the map to the beginning and then return. Other than that it was a great expereince.			"

												6.5/10. I had much higher hopes for this game, and was definitely disappointed by the game, but it's still not a bad game. I was hoping for a game with mystery, atmopshere, adventure, excitement, horror, paranormal, etc. This game was less than I expected. You basically spend the game walking around solving puzzles and searching giant environments for a few objects, just like other adventure games. There is really no player interaction and really any action at all. There is 1 tense/scary part and that is about it. The game feels quite empty. I did love the atmosphere. The visuals and feel of the area are some of the best I have ever seen, and this game was made for screenshots. The areas are varied and the graphics are decent. The crime solving can be fun sometimes with observations made by your character. Sometimes solving the order of events and finding objects can feel intuitive and you enjoy it. Other times the scenes used for the order involve a person standing there by themselves, or 1 scene has a new person none of the others do, and since it's just a still you cannot possibly gain an idea of what happened enough to put things in order. The game does this with clues. Sometimes you have to wonder off in a tiny area to find something. Like adventure games, if you don't find all the puzzles, and every object/clue and trigger every event, you can't beat the game. This means you'll prolly use a walkthrough, because of how big and open environements are, and there is no help from the game at all. The game says it doesn't ""hold your hand"" but in reality they are just being obtuse and  poor with some object placement and scene solving just to make it harder for no reason. The game is short. The story is interesting to begin with and you are invested in what happens, and without spoiling anything, the ending is kind of a dud. So the best part of the game is the environment and visuals, with some interest from the story. The gameplay is the same ol boring item find/puzzle solve of an adventure game, with walkthrough needing for some parts, but does have a few new novel mechanics to use.			"

												This is one of those games where the beauty of the atmophere it amazing, but having very little to interact with makes it a bit of a letdown. Some of the puzzles seem to be non-sensical, but overall they're entertaining. There's no jump scares, but the game does a good job of instilling a sense of dread here and there.The ending is....unexpected. Not in a bad way, though.I feel that it was worth my time. Recommended.

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a beautifuly designed masterpiece.The very moment you open your eyes, the game absolutely stuns with beautiful visuals and as you are gently walking your first steps in the world, you will immidiately feel that childish sense of wonder and excitement, but that is only the beginning of the beautifu and sad experience that awaits you. The story is told in a slow pace and you have more than enough time to enjjoy the beautiful scenery. The game is surprisingly not linear yet for most part, you wont find yourself aimlessly wandering. As the story slowly unfolds, you are more and more intrigued by the question how did this happen ?As you finish the game, the ending will just hit you like a freight train. Absolutely unexpected not even by hardcore book readers / movie fans or gamers. Even tough I have to say that the storytelling in this game is more subtle and wont get into your bones as much a for example Brothers: Tale of two sons the game makes up for it fully with its stunning visuals, unique game mechanics and beautiful Norwegian like setting.10/10			"

The Vanishing of Ethan Carter tells several stories tied by a single main narrative in an engaging and visually atractive way.The graphics are very good, the music is up to scratch and mirrors the mood of the various places visited throughout the game. I think the main downside of this title is how short the gameplay is. It took me just three hours to discover and complete all of the available stories and puzzles, as well as all but one achievement.If anyone's looking for an adventure game, like those of the Myst series, including Uru, you might find the puzzles not challenging enough, maybe even disappointing. However,  The Vanishing of Ethan Carter simply does not belong to this genre. It's more of a multimedia story. Not an adventure game, not a pure story like Dear Esther, but something inbetween.It's probably not a game I'm ever going to replay but I certainly concider it money well-spent. Playing through it felt like reading a book (and a decent one) in many ways. The most vibrant inspiration behind the storyline seems to be that drawn from the works of H. P. Lovecraft. However, subtle hints of the styles and interests represented by multiple other authors can be picked up by an attentive player.			"

												I held off on getting this game for a while because of the ever-growing struggle of ""too many games, not enough time"" but I had been following since pre-release and drooling at every video and screenshot.  I'm proud to have finally received the priviledge of playing through this masterpiece and I can't give it enough praise!  It's definitely one of the best exexuted graphical story-based puzzlers of this generation, hands down...despite the relatively short gameplay experience.

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is an exceedingly beautiful game visually, a surprising and ultimately very sad game narratively.Gameplay-wise, the focus is exploration. It walks the line between being a walking simulator, a hidden objects game and (thanks due to a few simple, yet engaging puzzles) a classic point-and-click adventure. It's an engaging mix, especially due to the absolutely excellent score and aforementioned visuals; and you truly feel a bit like a detective as you investigate the game world.I can't think of a way to say more about the game without spoiling it or without becoming too subjective. Honestly, the official game description says plenty. I think if based on that and the screenshots you think the game would appeal to you; then there's a very good chance it will. It definitely was the case for me - I had a wonderful time exploring, and the story ended up personally resonating with me.			"

												After a couple hours, I was ready to call this an awesome game. Sadly, in the long run, it's a bit underwhelming. The game contains 10ish puzzles with half being murder mysteries that use the same mechanic and of those only a couple stand out. The five-ish other puzzles range from mundane to brilliant and most of the good stuff is early in the game. It feels like, with such a limited quantity of content, the majority of puzzles should be great and surprising, but here it kinda feels like the devs ran out of steam (no pun intended).Even with these slight flaws I still would recommend this game for its originality and the potential it shows.Also: AAA production value for an indie price!

												This game...This game blew my mind. Mysterious discovery adventure powered by unreal engine with graphics so outstanding you will never have to go out again, you can have your own forest at home on your monitor.Despite textures detailed to the latest pixel the game runs like a clockwork even on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop on HD resolution. Sure it lags for a second or two now and then (especially between another map segments) but that is no big issue especially if the game has no loading screens.The story is not as original as it seems, on the other hand it will surprise you as nothing is as it seems.The gameplay itself is interesting. First, as autors stated, game does not hold your hand. You have no idea what to do or hwere to go and it is all up to you to explore and find out. Due to a fact you cannot die in this game (or... can you? ok you can at one and only one segment of the game, beware da jumpscare!!) you can literally explore everything. There are invisible wall and small rocks or logs you cannot jump across but map is HUGE. Huge enough for you to have a lot of space to explore anyway.It might take you a while to realize and understand what game wants from you. How to use supernatural abilities of main protagonist and progress in the game.Eventually you make it to the end after just few hours of gameplay. You might get lost on the way, you will get lost. You will explore a lot, run around with no clue where to go next but it is allrigh, because the game looks gorgeous!The music is awesome. Fits to the setting, with its melancholy theme.I am not fun of these games, or at least I was not but now that I played this and few similar games (like Kholat) I am changing my mind.This is one job well done. I can only recommend this unique experience.			"

												A beautiful and innovative storytelling experience, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is three parts Poe to two parts Lovecraft to one part detective noir. The basely accurate assessment of this game as a glorified point and click, while true, does not do justice to this visually stunning, narratively gripping, and unimaginably immersive master work. Everything about this game shines with brilliance, from the phenomenal soundtrack and sound design, to the immersive set design, to the exciting variety of stories to explore. My only wish is that it were a little bit longer, but at its current length it is an incredibly tight piece.			"

Even though the game is short (I finished it in 5.5 hours) I would most definitely recommend getting it if it's on sale. The story of this game is amazing, you never now what to expect. Even though at times seems horror like, the games objective is to let you take your time in solving the mysteries. There is never a time limit or any enemies that kill you, all you have to worry about is solving them. My biggest mistake is rushing through the game from the beginning. If you take your time and look around the world, you will have a better gaming experience. This game is definitely worth playing.			"

I played this in ~6.5hrs without trying to break any speed records... which might be considered short regarding the price. It took me while to fully understand the main characters special ability and how to use it - not sure if it was just me being too stupid or if a little tutorial in the beginning would be called for.I liked the puzzles which I think could be a bit more complex - but on the other hand more straight forward puzzles can avoid a lot of frustration for the players and difficulty is a very subjective thing...The story is great and in the end everything suddenly made some sense - even though a lot of players won't like the ending.If there was a sequel - I'd get it immediately.

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a very mysterious adventure game in an absolutely stunning environment. You are a detective who is to find a boy who has been missing. This game does not have a lot of game to it, and is very much a narrative focused experience, which I'm a huge fan of. The music really sets the tone together with the very high quality graphics and beautiful, well-crafted environments with immense mountains and lush forests. I especially liked the timing of the music, which really set the tone just right for every part of the world.By solving puzzles you unravel a series of very mysterious and macabre tales in the world. The puzzles aren't very difficult, but finding out what the puzzle actually is is a lot more challenging. I somehow managed to skip the first 2 puzzles and just walked straight by them, only to complete them at the end. I was simply not aware of the fact that those were puzzles. The game can feel a bit pretentious with its whole ""not holding hands"" at times, and can scare away newcomers to games.Other criticism I have is that, while the story is nicely told, it's not in every part of it. The character art, voice over and development really pales compared to the setting making it very hard to empathise with them. Furthermore, there are some very cheap jumpscares in the game that I thought were utterly unnecessary, and in adventure games I nearly always find inexcusable. In the end the story itself also doesn't have much of a lasting appeal even when so masterfully told, which is a problem I have with most of the games in the genre. It's however probably still my favourite game of 2014, and a huge recommendation.I'm feeling a light to a decent 8.			"

												This game tells a story. It tells it very well--incredibly well. Some people have complained about its length. I say that it is more than twice as long as most movies, and more in depth as well. Because of the interactive elements, this game tells the story far better than any movie could. Do i wish it were longer? yes, I do. Am I still satisfied with the product? Very much yes.Visuals 10/10Incredible, not just in quality but in design.Sound 9/10Great sounds, great music. very immersive. there were a couple of audio glitches though, and it wouldn't work with my surround sound.Story 9/10 Great story. Well presented. Short.Gameplay 8/10This game reminded me of old school point and clicks, but in 3D with much more polish. Being a hybrid of a first person game and a point and click, I felt elements of both missing though. Like the lack of any way to jump (would serve no purpose really, just didn't feel natural without it) and lack of a viewable inventory or map. However, these things didn't really detract from the gameplay, and the lack of them almost added to the game's style.Would I recommend you get this game? Do you like story and puzzles? Then yes, get this game (maybe on sale, its only 5-6 hours long). If not, leave it be. If you are here for the horror alone, you might be disapointed. The game definately had a creepy atmosphere, a fair share of disturbing scenes, and a handfull of ""horror"" scenes--but not enough for me to really call this a horror game.			"

												I cant really describe the themes of the game with words.You really just have to play the game yourself.Its a little short, but its a reasonable length seeing that its very narrative rich.I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a deep, thought provoking experience.The atmosphere is incredible and the unique gameplay allows you to see the story in a variety of ways.The only problem i have with this game is the fact that there are lots of areas in the open world where you would expect to find something interesting, but its just empty. (See ""Extra Credits - Negative Possibility Space - When Exploration Lets Players Down"")Aside from that, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter was an incredible experience.As a game developer myself, it inspired me and showed me how powerfull a good narrative can be.

People have been mentioning that there is scarce-saving but that didn't really affect me because I sit down for several hours - I'm probably going to live to the age of 30.

												This game definitely doesn't hold your hand. There are missable sequences and the puzzles are reminiscent of old point and clicks at times. For the most part, though, the world is well layed out and interesting to navigate. Its beautiful enough looking to make the searching for objects and clues not-boring. The story is definitely enjoyable without being pretentious or overly complicated. Took me just under 3 hours (I might have referred to a guide so sue me) so I think it's well worth the asking price.			"

												In short, It’s a really really beautiful game. The gameplay on the other hand…The game features a decent story with good narrating, but the puzzles and mysteries aren’t really a challenge. More effort could have been made to them and/or some features could have been removed to make it harder.The story and game itself isn’t really that dark or scary either, except for this one puzzle who had this one zombie guardian you saw far behind you in one second, and when you turn around he suddenly spawns in front of you and kills you. I almost♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants multiple times.So summed up, I got mixed feelings about this game. For the fact that I like how pretty this game is and not how easy it is. I say this game is more recommended for those who are after a pretty and easy game, and if you are after a challenge you probably should pass on this one.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is an exceedingly beautiful game visually, a surprising and ultimately very sad game narratively.Gameplay-wise, the focus is exploration. It walks the line between being a walking simulator, a hidden objects game and (thanks due to a few simple, yet engaging puzzles) a classic point-and-click adventure. It's an engaging mix, especially due to the absolutely excellent score and aforementioned visuals; and you truly feel a bit like a detective as you investigate the game world.I can't think of a way to say more about the game without spoiling it or without becoming too subjective. Honestly, the official game description says plenty. I think if based on that and the screenshots you think the game would appeal to you; then there's a very good chance it will. It definitely was the case for me - I had a wonderful time exploring, and the story ended up personally resonating with me.			"

												A beautiful game, excellent storytelling, and, with a couple of caveats, an immersive experience.  The game will take between 4 and 6 hours to fully complete, depending on how much you backtrack.  If you let the game guide you a little, it's a fairly linear experience, but otherwise it's open for exploration.A few caveats before diving in, some of them kind of important to consider when playing the game:1.) This game can cause Simulation Sickness in those who are sensitive.  I fall amongst those, and despite tinkering in the settings to change the view angle and such, I still got very ill playing this game.  That didn't stop me from playing, but it did force me to only an hour or two of playing before I had to take a break and sleep the sickness off.  Your mileage may vary.2.) The save system is not player-controlled.  Instead, it saves after (and sometimes before) important scenes.  Because of this, you can find yourself having to re-tread old territory if you were exploring quite a bit and didn't encounter a scene save.  However, if you re-play a scene or re-read a story, the scene will save again, so you can use these scenes as waypoints.  It's not the ""conventional"" way to save, so this may throw some people off, but it really isn't that big a deal.3.) Certain game mechanics that you would expect from a first-person perspective game are missing.  Primarily, the ability to jump.  There are run and crouch mechanics, but sometimes you just want to climb over a rock and jump to try to... only for nothing to happen.  Not really a big deal, since there isn't anything there (that's the game's way of saying, ""Turn back"") but it's another of those minor hitches that can trip a player up.In essence, this is a game a little bit like Dear Esther, with the ""games as storytelling device"" mechanics, but I feel it does so in fine form.  Their spin on psychic investigation is quite novel, the effects very cool, and overall the whole game just compelled me to want to keep going.  Take your time when playing so you can really take it all in, from the scenery to the cutscenes to the narration.If $20 is a little steep for you, wait for it to go on sale, but at the very least put it in your Wishlist so you'll be notified when it does.  Oh, and maybe take a Dramamine once you get started.Highly recommended, and I hope to see more such stories from these developers.			"

												My favorite author is H.P. Lovecraft, so I make a point of checking out every game or movie that claims to be inspired by his work.  Usually the end result is pretty weak sauce, but sometimes I find epic experiences like Eternal Darkness or Dark Corners of the Earth ... or shorter, but still powerful stories like Ethan Carter.The game's story is more in line with Lovecraft's early work, with the focus on internalized existential angst with a smattering of references to the wider mythos and the power of dreams.  It's a slower, more personal, self-contained story, rather than one about ancient aliens rising up from terrible slumber to end humanity, which is fine.  Gameplay is all about investigating a series of murders in the gorgeously rendered Red Creek Valley while searching for Ethan Carter.  There is no combat and no way to die (although there is a gamebreaking bug that I at first mistook for character death towards the end, if you solve one of the puzzles before the final murder, that requires you to close the game and continue from the previous save).The unique method of sensing the psychic residue of strong emotions and reconstructing the timelines of the murders is clever and provides the only real ""action"" to what is primarily a short story you get to walk through and witness.  There are no outcomes to change, no secret endings, no agency for you as a player at all, really, other than the order in which you solve the murders.Graphically, the game is beautiful, alternating between peaceful and creepy, as needed.  The environments look and sound real and are the key to the experience.  Lesser visuals would have hurt the immersion.  The character models are less impressive by comparison, but the voice acting makes up for that and provides some believable personalities.  I would recommend you disable Motion Blur in the Graphics options, as I found it nauseating and a distraction from the great artwork done for the game.Total game time, exploring every possible location is 4-5 hrs, and for an $8 game, I can't really complain.  I pay more than that to see a 2 hr movie at the theatre.  Replayability is practically nil, however.  Once you have solved a murder or puzzle the hard way (without a guide - using one will only hurt your experience in the long run), you can easily burn through it again without much effort, further cutting down the game time to less than 2 hrs, easily, accounting for walking time and watching the cutscenes.  You'd be better off introducing someone else to the game, rather than play through it multiple times.  Then you could discuss the ending!For an additional $4, you can get a digital map, poster, making of document, and the origianl soundtrack, which I purchased to support the developers and found worth it for the great atmospheric music alone.If you want to experience a beautiful visual tale of mystery and the occult in the vein of H.P. Lovecraft, there's hardly a better way to spend a lazy afternoon.			"

												Technical:Doesn't support 21:9 or wider screen resolutions. Flawlesswidescreen fixes thisBuilt on the Unreal Engine, so performance is amazing and the graphics are breathtakingSeriously, buy the game, if only to bask in the gloriousness of the PC Master RaceMy thoughts:Masterpiece. Absolutely incredible at building an environment to play in.Little bit of a learning curve though. This game is a bit...different to play, than any other game I've played before. A lot of weird things go on, that can sometimes creep you out. Don't let your common sense grab hold of you, this is more along the lines of The Twilight Zone. Think of this title as a supernatural Nancy Drew, the the visual fidelity of Crysis, and the ability to tell a story on the level of Metro 2033. Stellar game, very much a 'proof of concept though'. Relatively short, you could beat this game in 4 hours if you tried. Although, it does take some getting used to.My final thoughts on the story of the game: Creations through observation.(Get it on sale though $10 is a reasonable price point I'd say)			"

												In two words: Beautiful game. Loved the graphics and scenery, which was very well done. Good storyline stat leaves you wondering and some parts left to your imagination or interpretation.  Would have been nice if there were some elements where the protagonist could somehow change the version of story (more endings). Also: the awesome graphics do have some glitches (seemingly random flashes of light in the forests), which at some point in the game made me think that they we're actually part of the game and something that I should investigate. That might actually have been an interesting part of the story, but it turned out to be nothing more than graphical glitches. So I was litterally chasing some ghosts there ^^Really would like to see more games coming from this studio!			"

The game does not contain the B-movie scares of a 'Resident Evil' or the psychological terror of a 'Silent Hill'.  Instead it possesses a heavy atmosphere and a thick sense of dread.You play as Paul Prospero, a noir detective investigating the disappearance of Ethan Carter.  This investigation takes you to the seemingly abandoned woodland environs where the Carter family once lived.  As you retrace Ethan's steps, you use your skills to reconstruct murder scenes that slowly link together to form a greater story, one that begins with Ethan's accidental awakening of a creature known only as the 'sleeper', and which continues into greater violence and madness.Although the world seems quite big, it is actually quite linear.  There are ten puzzles total.  Half involve investigating the aforementioned crimes by recreating murder scenes in order to understand the chronology of the death.  The other half relate to Ethan's short fictions, which he writes with a lonely heart.  These puzzles seemingly have no connection to the main game, but...From an empirical point of view, 'The Vanishing of Ethan Carter' does not contain much content; I played through it in three hours.  But having bought it during a Steam sale, I will say that it feels well worth the money I spent.  It is a heartbreaking story that filled me with uneasiness and mystery, and left me oddly pensive in the end.-----------------------I wrote my storiesFor you to read; but alsoTo save my own soul.

												Great game! Very moody, beautiful graphics, beautiful music, great voice from the player character and an interesting world and puzzles that makes sense.It took me 4h to complete it, would probably have taken shorter if they had actually explained how a feature worked, there are no tutorials because 90% of the game doesn't need one. Shame though that the main mechanic thats used really could have done with SOME explanation. Anyway, heres my explanation for it: When you see the cloud of words, look around until they are focused into one word. You will probably understand if you read this sentence when you're ingame. :)Its a mystery adventure in first person where you investigate, explore and try and sequence together what happened to make the world end up as it did before you arrived. As such it is very slow, there is no action in it whatsoever, you are there as an observer, investigator and solver. As such you cannot die or fail, however you might end up having an area reset or force you to the beginning of the puzzle.Graphics: Environments are amazing, it looks extremely good and everything just feels correct, which is good since its 95% of the things that you will look at. This is exactly how I expect Half Life 3 forests to look at, it feels like being back in the forests from Episode 2, but just amazing looking. Characters are probably the weakest point, they look lackluster next to the environment.Sound: Great great music, reminds me of skyrim, beautiful and calm. Voice acting was ok, the player character is clearly the best, would like to have heard more from him. Only iffy about the sound is that the 3d positioning were at times really bad. In one area I had to stand in the middle of the room to hear the ghostly voices at a correct level, and in another place I couldn't position the enormous water source because the sound didn't come from a specific direction. Minor things but kind of odd when playing with headphones.Technical things: Worked great on my computer, no crashes or anything. Had some annoying stuttering when I moved around and new assets loaded, otherwise the performance was fine on my 780ti. Might just be my SSD that is kind of bad, not a new thing for me.Only encountered one bug that forced me to reload to the latest autosave, kind of annoying but didn't happen anywhere else.If you feel that 20€ for 4 hours is a bit short you will be missing out on a beautiful game. I really enjoyed it and hope you will too, and that there will come more short games like these.			"

												This game was a surprise.  I hadn't actually heard of it until the day I bought it, and the gameplay trailer hooked me.  The atmosphere is engrossing.   The graphics in tandem with the music are a strong combination, invoking a feeling that I don't really want to leave.  I find myself just idly wandering the terrain, taking in the surroundings.  Vanishing reminds me, after it's fashion, of Shadow of the Colossus.  It has a story to tell, and it does this well, without unnecessary asides, distractions, side quests, or whatever.			"

												This game is awesome. It's like playing through an old scary story along the lines of Algernon Blackwood or H.P. Lovecraft, with some investigation gameplay that is among the best crime scene gameplay I've ever seen and which matches the mood and atmosphere of the setting. Due to their method of using interpolated photographs of real objects to make a lot of the 3D models, the game looks much better than other current gen games that have the same technical level of graphics but which use the standard method of 3d modeling. The game looks much more photorealistic than any other I've played, and it helps the mysterious atmosphere a lot. The story, atmosphere, and gameplay all go together extremely well and make for a great experience.			"

												You should know what you're getting into here. It's a game based on story and exploration. No action, minimal puzzles. As long as that doesn't completely put you off the whole idea, then definitely give this a try. It's eerie, subtle horror at its finest- no jump scares, no looming theat (except for one very brief, easy to beat segment). And yet the game left me deeply chilled, and more than a little bit sad.But if you play, have a guide on hand. Not because the puzzles are hard (they're not), but because some things are easy to miss- and you have to solve every puzzle in order to complete the game. If you don't want to spend an hour backtracking to that one spot you missed, check the guide every so often to make sure you haven't skipped anything. No need to read ahead or spoil things for yourself- just read up to the point you reached and see if there's anything you should have done.			"

 Review Time!!!!       So ill first start out with my original thought of game pre purchase.  I like all sorts of games so long as they bring something to the table that intrigues me.  In this case i had watched the trailer and the gameplay videos on steam, and decided that this game had first off amazing visuals (not just graphically but landscape design was pretty great)  and a style of game play that just struck me as a refreshing change of pace to my growing stack of story driven/puzzle games.  I had discussed the gameplay to my friend, (as we went upon an expedition into the forest to chop trees for quickly arriving winter) then nothing. I guess along the journey I had expressed interest in the purchase of the game, but only whence my financial portfolio was performing better. Fast forward a time we are cutting more wood we arrive back at the casa and i have a steam message.  Turns out whilst i was preoccupied my friend had found time to purchase the game without me knowing, and left me a message  We should play the game upon its download and then something about drinking yada yada  twas a great message.     Game installs we click play and the pre game window launches.  I enjoy when a game does this.  Not only does it remind me about changing the graphics settings, but makes the whole process much easier especially if the game is like Fable Anniversary and has the worst computer interface i have ever had the misfortune of dealing with.  After a few moments of turning everything to  maximum overdrive  it was finally time to play.  The Games Main Menu was very simple nice scenery of a meadow i believe now that i think about it i cant really remember, but i do remember a tree in the bottom left corner. There were four or so options we clicked new game or whatever it is to begin our adventure into saving some small child in a basement from his moth.... oh wait thats the  Binding of Isaac  .... to save a boy whom has vanished.     The game opens into an amazing graphically vivid environment.  Slight nuissance of blurring around the non focused center area of screen, but its an attempt to be more realistic i guess.  Controls are very simple which is good because there is no tutorial.  Straight into  Murder Train  mystery solving.  The solving of events is pretty simple; find dead guy, restore crime scene, and use dead guy's memories (I personally think that Paul Prospero is Dumbledore in disguise hence the use of pensieve) to discover a series of events that you must piece together to gain access to the dead spirits last major memory as its soul is torn from the world of the living.   BOOM  Solved my first scene psychic powers FTW.  Thus far into the game about 15 minutes or so, and the daunting question begins to arrive  ""How long is this game?""  This question never popped into my mind before, but story driven games are notorious for being rather short. I personally am ok with a game thats a few hours of great story because hey its a genre with usually a better story than an fps, but without the  pchew pchew.   Although at this  point you are also wondering is there going to be a good storyline as well. All you know is  there is an entity named the  Sleeper  controlling people. Ethan is resistant to its call, and he is in trouble.      That is it for giveaways to the story and progress that takes place now its the moment everyones been waiting for.  My friend and i finished the game it roughly 2 hours and 30 minutes.  Thats full completion all miscellaneous events and all story driven ones.  The story had its share of depth, but id say most of the depth came from the miscellaneous events and tidbits of  Ethan's  stories.  Twice were we caught off guard by sudden bouts of quiet to super loud doubtfully intentional jump scares.... Ok maybe one was intentional, and it got us because here we are joking about  should we run..... no he disappeared OHHH SH** . Anywho it was fun.  The ending was in my personal oppinion lack luster with everything you gather through out the story you start to see whats up.  Atleast we did.  As for exact events we didn't have that figured and it made for an interesting addition but we both felt strange about it.     Still no regrets from either of us about the $20 dollar price tag, and those whom complain that they just spent $5 bucks per hour of enjoyment we spent $10 and i will say $10 bucks per hour for a great time and pleasure of playing this game is worth it to keep this group of developers making games.  My suggestion is buy it call a friend have him pick up a six pack of a nice lager, and play the game. If you know someone who has this game call em up plan a day to drink and play it and just enjoy the time.  Maybe they themselves are regretting the purchase buy the beer and say hey now you've gotten some money back, (at this point they wont care because they have now officially enjoyed the game for a second playthrough) and you will have solved  The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.

(See ""Extra Credits - Negative Possibility Space - When Exploration Lets Players Down"")Aside from that, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter was an incredible experience.As a game developer myself, it inspired me and showed me how powerfull a good narrative can be.

												This game creeps and puts you on edge without anything campy or over the top. The game does a great job developing an unease, making the player feel as if they are a tresspasser in a land where things just are not quite right. The graphics and sound are beautiful bringing to life ancient forests, dilapidated structures, and artifacts of industry gone by the wayside. I really enjoyed wandering the map. Which you will have to, because there isn't a lot that is intuitive about ""The Vanishing of Ethan Carter."" Players who enjoyed the old ""Myst"" series will find some nostalgia here, but the puzzles are not as deep, and often, knowing whether you are in the puzzle is half the puzzle.  Once you solve your first major puzzle you will discover the pattern they take, but too often, the missing piece I needed to solve something was obscure, or worse, something I considered but just didn't do in the right order.Never the less, I enjoyed ""The Vanishing of Ethan Carter."" I recommend it with a little hesitation, as it isn't for everyone.			"

												I don't usually write reviews on games, but I thought I needed to write one for this one. Even though the game is short (I finished it in 5.5 hours) I would most definitely recommend getting it if it's on sale. The story of this game is amazing, you never now what to expect. Even though at times seems horror like, the games objective is to let you take your time in solving the mysteries. There is never a time limit or any enemies that kill you, all you have to worry about is solving them. My biggest mistake is rushing through the game from the beginning. If you take your time and look around the world, you will have a better gaming experience. This game is definitely worth playing.			"

												The world's visual glory might cloud the story but the unadorned gameplay steers narration with a clear focus and little regard to the player's ability to trail it. Pieces don't fall in place until the end, and the outcome might leave the player emotionally unrewarded. Nonetheless it compresses the game's themes into a satisfying whole.The story's hopefulness is its love letter to literature. It's the celebration of imagination and the naivistic nod to those who have tried to escape desolation in a dysfunctional family. It's the absence of absolute evil; Sleeper's function is not to frighten, it is to reflect our innermost needs.			"

												This game is one of a kind. It could be labelled as an atmospheric adventure game.The setting is extremely inspiring and the environment is gorgeous looking (even though stuttering happens from time to time) and so it is the music. The gameplay is extremely simple and the puzzles are mostly straightforward, but some of them certainly hold pleasant surprises. The game is very short, probably too short for its asking price and the replayability is very low. I would suggest to play the game in a single run and let yourself immerse in the interesting story and the superb setting/atmosphere. It is a game that, despite the shortness, you will remember and that is why I recommend it.			"

												Ethan Carter at a glance looks like a graphical showcase, but when you dig a little deeper, this game has a very intersting story to tell.  The game is short.  Most seem to finish the core ""storyline"" about 4 hours in but the game gives you the option to retrace your steps to completion.  The game begins flat out says it's not going to hold your hand so it may take some exploring to get the hang of things.  Graphically this game is phenomenal and gorgeous.   I hear they used a technology that processes still-photography to make the in-game scenes and textures.  Really looks good.  If you're looking for a short Mystery/Exploration game that easy on the eyes I'll bet you'll like Ethan Carter's stor(ies.)			"

												The game says it like it is as soon as you begin the story.  It doesn't hold your hand.  Nothing is ""obvious"" in regards to path or connections to the story.  You have to earn it by exploring and acting the detective that you are.  That means combing the woods, paths, buildings, or whatever you can see.  Most of the clues are fairly close together to one another, but there are some that are not.  You will not know until you explore every place that you are physically able to.  I love this sort of game because it is rare in today's gaming culture.  The masses play games now and the masses want simplicity.  This game is not simple.  It will frusterate you at times because you will not know what your next move is.  Youtube tutorials will be a constant temptation, but I urge you to only use them when you absolutly have to.  Discovering and figuring out things on your own is what motivates you to go on.  The story is well thought out, but there isn't a lot of dialogue that will help you along the way.  If this game was to have come out on consoles it'd be worth the normal $60 price tag, so you know its a steal for $20.  It's a memorable game that will hopefully influence a genre that will be improved upon even more than this game presents.  Give it a try if you want a challenging story that encourages exploring.  If you think that sounds boring, this game is not for you.			"

												I've just played this through and I loved every minute.This is an open world puzzle game with an intriguing mystery storyline with horror elements. You take the role of a detective investigating the titular disappearance of a young boy, Ethan Carter. It's pretty hard to discuss the narrative further without giving away spoilers. It has been described as Lovecraftian, I would say there are a few nods to Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos, but it's not the basis of the whole story.The puzzles are logical and not too tough to solve once you understand the mechanic. I did feel that the later murders were a little easier to solve and felt like less work had been put into them compared to say the first one. The puzzles are not all the same though, and there is a good variety to keep the player interested. I would suggest avoiding checking walkthroughs or guides as the puzzles are all achievable with a bit of thought. The graphics are stunning, the level of detail is very high and it must have taken a huge amount of work to create the game world. Pretty much everywhere you look there are amazing views and the landscape is very serene and peaceful. There is a known issue of flashing red lights in the trees which affects Radeon cards, and I did observe it but it wasn't frequent enough to cause a distraction.A few people have complained about the length of this game. You can expect 5-7 hours of gameplay depending on how good you are at solving the puzzles. I personally think that is pretty reasonable. I'd much rather have 6 hours of quality gameplay than 12 hours of filler.Anyway, I'm definitely recommending this.			"

												Short and sweet.  The game took me about 4 hours to complete, and that isn't a bad thing!  Not all games need to be 20 hour plus epics to tell the story.  I was quite immersed in the environment of the game and the soundtrack certainly helped to contribute there as well.  Quite an imaginative game.  My only complaint, however minor, is the puzzles could have been a bit more difficult or complex.  A good game for those who like to explore.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a great example of what a game can be based on nothing but environment and story elements. It uses far-reaching landscapes and beautiful visual effects to bring you a great narrative experience. However, be warned, this game may not be for those of little patience.__________Synopsis:You play as Paul Prospero, who seems to be a detective with paranormal abilities such as ESP. Receiving a letter from Ethan Carter, he learns Ethan has strong psychic connections, and that he has gone missing. Your job is to explore the village of Red Creek Valley and find Ethan. You quickly learn that something is amiss; the town is abandoned, no sign of Ethan's family, and mysterious occurrences. Story: A short, but interesting tale shrouded in mystery. Perhaps too short, depending on how quickly you progress through the game. It doesn't suffer very much from ups and downs in the story, and it ends pretty well too. Graphics: One of the most visually appealing games I've played in a long time. A wider, open world gives you plenty of room to stretch your legs and explore, taking in the sights and sounds as you go along. Functionality: Controls are pretty linear and simple. Essentially a Sherlock Holmes-puzzle solving game. Pick stuff up, find where it goes, and solve problems. Gameplay: Overall, it's not good. Again, it's basically a point-and-click mystery game akin to Sherlock Holmes. There is no combat mechanics, and every item falls into the one-use category. The real problem I encountered was spending obnoxiously long amounts of time searching the vast landscape for potential clues, which a majority of them felt arbitrary. This is where those of little patience may find the game frustrating.______________________________At the end of the day, you're buying this game for the story and the experience; but the experience tends to fall short when you're slowly crawling over a couple acres of land looking for that one last piece of the puzzle. I feel this may have been a better release under a different venue, like Heavy Rain, which offers great atmosphere, narritive, and incorporates at least DECENT gameplay elements. I did enjoy it, but my advice would be to wait until this game goes on sale to purchase.			"

												A richly atmospheric and often-spooky game with sumptuously detailed environments - but much more than this I cannot say without spoilers.  Oh, and be advised - the mechanics may be on the lighter side (you'll never point a reticle at anything), but as the game itself states, this story will not hold your hand; that pondering will be required!Take your time to explore, read, and ponder the implications along with the beauty of the world.  We did - and the experience didn't disappoint.			"

This is a pleasantly compact game, great for people who want to enjoy something for a couple of evenings. There IS a lot of walking between the interactive bits, but the valley is so immersive just exploring it is rewarding. Highly recommended for fans of Lovecraft, horror, or just good storytelling.

The Vanishing of Ethan Carter I stumbled upon this game a couple times before buying it. You can clearly see that this game looks amazing, no one can say otherwise. This is what I call the Perfect Sunday Game, a ~4hours long mysterious story with puzzle elements.It's a small but enjoyable game. The story could be a lot better and more complex, however the atmospheric gameplay makes you want to keep playing. If you'd like to explore such a beautiful environment while playing through a storyline be sure to get this game!			"

												You should know what you're getting into here. It's a game based on story and exploration. No action, minimal puzzles. As long as that doesn't completely put you off the whole idea, then definitely give this a try. It's eerie, subtle horror at its finest- no jump scares, no looming theat (except for one very brief, easy to beat segment). And yet the game left me deeply chilled, and more than a little bit sad.But if you play, have a guide on hand. Not because the puzzles are hard (they're not), but because some things are easy to miss- and you have to solve every puzzle in order to complete the game. If you don't want to spend an hour backtracking to that one spot you missed, check the guide every so often to make sure you haven't skipped anything. No need to read ahead or spoil things for yourself- just read up to the point you reached and see if there's anything you should have done.			"

												I had really looked forward to this game: the visuals, the gameplay and the type of ""puzzle adventure"".The graphics are amazing! It's like walking in a real forest and in a real ""town"". This, in combination with great music, makes you as a player feel as an active part of the story and you can feel that there is something cooking under the surface. Other games have to tell you that there is something going one, this game makes you feel it!Without spoiling it, the story is a bit weak at times and the story falls flat in the end. This could be, due to my inability to play it in on sitting, however, the end could have been a bit more explanatory and give the player a deeper understanding of the reasoning behind the story.But, the question is, should you buy and play this game? Yes, if you're into the genre of ""adventure puzzle"" and like a good story combined with some good puzzles. Or just buy it if you never have experienced a nordic forest and would like to know how amazing it can look during fall.			"

My only negative point would be that the game was quite short totalling at 8.4 hours, but it was the best 8.4 hours of gaming I've had in a long time.I have my fingers crossed for an expansion and look forward to seeing more from the Astronauts team, highly recommended.

A Paladin’s Steam Review: The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. A Subtly Disturbing Yet Compelling Mystery Game.Genre: First Person Atmospheric Story Driven Mystery with Psychological Horror ElementsDeveloper & Publisher: The AstronautsPlatform Support: Windows, PS4. Mac & Linux ""Coming Soon"". Business Model: Base Game. Copy Purchased by MyselfOverall Gameplay ThoughtsVanishing comes very, very close to a Walking Simulator. There really isn’t a failure state, your actions don’t really affect the game in any meaningful way and the game expects you to experience a lot of it. The only influence you have is exploring the world of Red Creek Valley, solving the puzzles and, by extension, the mystery Paul Prospero is here to solve. Oh right, that’s the guy who you’re controlling and hear monologue as you explore the valley. So, you'll walk along at a fairly steady pace (there's a reasonably faster sprint as well), drink in the atmosphere while you search for clues of Ethan's whereabouts. All the while discovering that there's something creepy and sinister beneath the surface. Red Creek Valley is divided up into multiple areas, each containing a major puzzle or two for you to solve. Puzzles, for the most part, boil down to finding all the objects within a given area and figuring out how they all go together. The music playing in the background will clue you in on whether you’ve left the given area very subtly. Which is helpful because you’ll never need to leave an area in order to solve that particular puzzle. There aren’t any random items on the other side of the map that you have to find. It should be noted that it isn't required to solve these puzzle areas in any particular order, they can be done at any time. Outside of soaking in the sights and experiencing the strange events going on, there’s not much else to do. However, I always felt like I was involved. There wasn't any boring section I felt forced to walk through. It might help that Red Creek Valley appealed to me. Being able to see the burned out buildings, the rusted train cars and nature reclaiming the area, it really intrigued me. It's a feel of history and decay that Vanishing goes out of its way to really sell to the player. It feels like a real place and it’s setup like a real place. I think that helped me enjoy the game more. Atmosphere & JumpscaresThe atmosphere ate away at me. Slowly, creepily, I would sometimes jump at my phone beeping at me. It’s insidious how this game gets into your head. It makes you think something will jump out, scare you half to death and eat what remains of your sanity alive. Spoiler: that doesn’t happen. Except for one area, I’ll explain below. This isn’t a hardcore scare title like Amnesia: The Dark Descent. It’s far tamer by comparison while holding its own. I was often thinking that some dark fantasy creature such as Cthulhu was behind the scenes. It was amusing when that theory was half confirmed. The game will do its best to unnerve you. So long as you let it. There’s only one section of the map where jump scares are present. It’s in a mine and they sort of warn you that it’s coming. Sort of. And it’s mostly optional unless you want a 100% completion rating. At least, I’m fairly certain its optional. The scare is when you’re running around in a mining maze, searching for clues to open a large door in the center of it. In this area, is an undead miner who’s been cursed. While you’re walking around, if you hear a telltale noise you should immediately turn around and go the other way. Otherwise, BOO. You have to start from the beginning of the maze. PC Settings & OptimizationOptimization wise, this game leaves a bit to be desired. You will need to tweak your graphics options to get the best performance as running everything on high will drag the performance down hard. I noticed that Anti-Aliasing and Texture Filtering were the big performance hogs. Oh and there is constant texture loading, which will cause your game to “stutter” frequently as it loads them. This is a problem that affects a lot of computers and it’s immersion breaking. Additionally, if you’re not running a 16:9 resolution, the game will letterbox/pillarbox. Which I find to be frankly inexcusable for a native PC game to be this way. I can’t figure out why the devs didn’t scale the resolutions properly, it’s not like the Unreal engine can’t do it. PCGamingWiki has a installable solution to fix this as well as grant you multi-monitor and ultra-widescreen options. Additionally, while there is a proper Field-of-View slider in the options, (70-120) it crops the image in order to do it. Overall, while the game does run/scale well (and it does so long as you tweak about in the settings), the remaining problems are less excusable. Also, saving is only done in chunks so you might revert some of your actions when quitting and reloading. Redux Edition Quick ThoughtsI gave the Redux edition a quick run through and they seem to have fixed a lot of the problems the original game had. The micro-stutter is completely gone, there's no more pillarboxing as the resolution scales and performance generally seems to be better, if more taxing on machines. Saving is now done every time you act now too. FoV is still a crop effect but I'll let it be. There's also a bunch of tweaks and visual improvements added that you probably won't notice. There's no story difference between the two editions so if you can, play the redux. If that's too taxing, play the original. Kudos to the devs for doing this for free. Final ThoughtsThe atmosphere and mystery makes for a compelling experience. While it does have a lot of adventure/walking simulator aspects to it, it still keeps the player involved the entire time. The atmosphere of a decaying rural area known as Red River Valley is simply intriguing. The psychological horror just works so well. Jump scares are rare but there’s something that eats at you the entire time. When finished, the game will leave you with more questions than answers though not in the “find out in the sequel” sort of way. I should note that the characters are rather cliche but when I consider the ending, it works and feels intentional. Visually, the game looks superb and the audio is top notch. If you're looking for a fun mystery/exploration through a decaying rural area, give The Vanishing of Ethan Carter a go.Read This and More Like It on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

												This is a beautiful and interesting game which, with a few nudges and tweaks could have been even better. Initially there is no plot - you just have to find Ethan. Unfortunately, there is also no guidance or advice about how to use the tricks at your disposal. I respect the designers' intention to not hold your hand, but a couple of pointers would have helped. For example, there is nothing to prevent you from wandering into another area before completing the puzzles in the first. I would guess it's possible to complete the game while missing most of the puzzles due to over-eager exploration. There's also no clue about how to use the psychic powers to locate clues, which can leave you searching for a tiny object in a large map. Finally, the game's puzzles could really do with a few more elements: one sequence is unlocked by simply returning an object to its original location. The psychic detective thing works nicely, though, and the idea of Ethan creating fantastical stories from modest family dramas is a compelling device which keeps the game moving forward. Graphically, this is about as good as Unreal 3 gets: high-res textures and masses of foliage show this was written for the PC but, as usual with U3, shaders are a bit sparse and there is no use of POM or tessellation. Most importantly, the world looks and feels real, and this is enhanced by the moody music. Given how few names are mentioned in the credits, the whole game is a pretty impressive experience. It's Dear Esther with a few more things to do, and there's nothing wrong with that. 7/10			"

												My favorite author is H.P. Lovecraft, so I make a point of checking out every game or movie that claims to be inspired by his work.  Usually the end result is pretty weak sauce, but sometimes I find epic experiences like Eternal Darkness or Dark Corners of the Earth ... or shorter, but still powerful stories like Ethan Carter.The game's story is more in line with Lovecraft's early work, with the focus on internalized existential angst with a smattering of references to the wider mythos and the power of dreams.  It's a slower, more personal, self-contained story, rather than one about ancient aliens rising up from terrible slumber to end humanity, which is fine.  Gameplay is all about investigating a series of murders in the gorgeously rendered Red Creek Valley while searching for Ethan Carter.  There is no combat and no way to die (although there is a gamebreaking bug that I at first mistook for character death towards the end, if you solve one of the puzzles before the final murder, that requires you to close the game and continue from the previous save).The unique method of sensing the psychic residue of strong emotions and reconstructing the timelines of the murders is clever and provides the only real ""action"" to what is primarily a short story you get to walk through and witness.  There are no outcomes to change, no secret endings, no agency for you as a player at all, really, other than the order in which you solve the murders.Graphically, the game is beautiful, alternating between peaceful and creepy, as needed.  The environments look and sound real and are the key to the experience.  Lesser visuals would have hurt the immersion.  The character models are less impressive by comparison, but the voice acting makes up for that and provides some believable personalities.  I would recommend you disable Motion Blur in the Graphics options, as I found it nauseating and a distraction from the great artwork done for the game.Total game time, exploring every possible location is 4-5 hrs, and for an $8 game, I can't really complain.  I pay more than that to see a 2 hr movie at the theatre.  Replayability is practically nil, however.  Once you have solved a murder or puzzle the hard way (without a guide - using one will only hurt your experience in the long run), you can easily burn through it again without much effort, further cutting down the game time to less than 2 hrs, easily, accounting for walking time and watching the cutscenes.  You'd be better off introducing someone else to the game, rather than play through it multiple times.  Then you could discuss the ending!For an additional $4, you can get a digital map, poster, making of document, and the origianl soundtrack, which I purchased to support the developers and found worth it for the great atmospheric music alone.If you want to experience a beautiful visual tale of mystery and the occult in the vein of H.P. Lovecraft, there's hardly a better way to spend a lazy afternoon.			"

Absolutely incredible at building an environment to play in.Little bit of a learning curve though. This game is a bit...different to play, than any other game I've played before. A lot of weird things go on, that can sometimes creep you out. Don't let your common sense grab hold of you, this is more along the lines of The Twilight Zone. Think of this title as a supernatural Nancy Drew, the the visual fidelity of Crysis, and the ability to tell a story on the level of Metro 2033. Stellar game, very much a 'proof of concept though'. Relatively short, you could beat this game in 4 hours if you tried. Although, it does take some getting used to.My final thoughts on the story of the game: Creations through observation.(Get it on sale though $10 is a reasonable price point I'd say)			"

												I literally cannot say anything about this game without spoiling everything about it. So trust me when I say that while it’s flawed mechanically, everything that’s good about it vastly outweighs some of the stranger gameplay mechanics. It’s short, but it’s exactly as long as it needs to be. The absolutely gorgeous graphics alone may be worth it, and I’m not even someone who cares about graphics. I may have finished this game in four hours if I didn’t keep stopping everywhere to take in the view and hammer the screenshot button.If you like weird fiction, short narrative experiences, if you liked games like Gone Home and The Path, if you want a game that puts atmosphere and narrative first, I promise you will love this. Give this developer some love. They have done an excellent thing and should do more of it.			"

												What can I say about Ethan Carter without spoiling it's story? Not a lot other than: I really, REALLY liked it. It's easily one of the most athmospheric and beautiful games I've ever played. The setting, the tone, the influences, the story, the puzzles, everything just worked for me. As I said, I don't want to spoil anything about it, as I think this is one of the games you should come in as freash as you can be, with as little knowledge of it as possible. It's not a long game, but it also don't have any filler material, only quality stuff. And it's a top experience from start to finish because of that. I think this is also one of the games, that could've been easily messed up, if this would've been some AAA-retail game with 20 hours of content. I really think the lenght is perfect as it is.If I would have to suggest something, that IMO would've maybe made the game even better, it's probably: few more puzzles would have fitted in, eventhough there are some secrets also.Only real critique I had with the game is it's saving system: if you have some mystery in the middle of solving and you go and do something and see the ""Saving scene..."", which usually leads you to believe, that everything you've done/found so far is saved, it doesn't save the mystery that is in the middle of solving. So, just a tip: solve all the mysteries you start before quitting, so you'll avoid playing things thru all over again.All in all this game is a hell of a debut from the small team hailing from Poland - The Astronauts. And if they'll do more of these narrative game experiences in the future, it'll be a day 1 buy for me. I'm really looking forward what they'll decide to do next.			"

												Beginning with a pointedly vague premise of your being some kind of detective on the trail of the titular missing child, the game barely holds your hand as you discover your paranormal investigative abilities and begin to piece together a series of strange events in a remote countryside. That lack of hand holding is more a part of the gameplay than one might initially realize as it ultimately provokes a sort of trial and error process that is in itself an investigation. Despite a few fairly simple puzzles, the game is mostly about discovery. While primarily linear, there are various clues and revelations lying just off the beaten path, many of which ultimately need to be discovered to complete the game, but that (whether found later or during the course of your primary investigation) don’t stymie the pace of the game.The game’s visuals are excellent, featuring not only the river valley vistas seen in the early part of the game, but beautifully dilapidated interiors and dank caves as well. The audio as well is great, with a near perfect score, quality voice acting, and immersive environmental sound. The GUI overlays are brilliant and are realized in such a manner as not feel like an interface, but instead like an extension of the protagonist’s investigative abilities. The ultimate result is a greater sense of immersion and that is a large part of Ethan Carter’s triumph.Throughout the nearly four hours I spent with The Vanishing of Ethan Carter I was almost completely enraptured by it, spurred on both by a sense of wonderment at the world before my eyes and also by a drive to discover the truth of the mystery at hand. It’s difficult to talk about the story at all without spoiling anything except to say that even when predictable, Ethan Carter delivers with a compelling emotional gravitas. I honestly can’t recommend this game enough to fans of first person adventure games, especially Amenisia, Gone Home, or Dear Esther. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is worth picking up at any price.

												A very well made game that makes you think.  The end left me silent and deep in reflection.  For the price It is well worth it.  Pure poetry.  Be advised that total game play is about 4-5 hours but this game crams so much into that time that some games don't even come close to.If you want a game that will keep you thinking well beyond the actual play then get this game!

												Absolutely fantastic, any fan of lovecraft and similar authors of strange stories will love this game. A couple puzzles were fairly challenging, but overall the designers kept it from feeling too much like a game and kept the atmosphere one of abstract curiosity rather then feeling like a ""do this to do this"" kind of game.  And I must say the ending was beautiflly done, hope to see more from this studio soon!			"

												First of all, this game is gorgeous. The screenshots do not do this game any justice. The music is wonderful. The gameplay is fun, relaxing and then terrifying. Never a dull moment, even when you ended walking for five minutes straight. But the best thing about this game is the story. It was sad, creepy, moving and it will stick with you forever.			"

												BEAUTIFUL game! Endure the creepy vibe as you walk through abandoned buildings solving murders. One jump scare in the game, so brace yourself. Enjoyed the Redux version first, then quickly ran through the original in about an hour.I did run into a bug where I couldn't interact with an item to finish an achievement. Resetting the game placed the items back in their original locations. Slighlty annoying.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a short but beautiful story. I wont spoil the story, but I will say that it is hard to follow until the very end of the game. There is no hud or map to guide you through the gameworld, which is a single big forest area. You play as a detective looking for a child by the name of Ethan Carter. The game has no combat. The graphics are great! (even though it uses the Unreal Engine)Music is even better and changes dynamicly from scene to scene.  "

												This was probably one of my favorite games I played this year, I am a sucker for games with beautiful scenery and sound, which this game has. I would without a doubt say that this game has the best visuals and soundtrack of any game I have ever played. This game is great if exploration, mystery and detective work peaks your interest. This is a must play for anyone who loves well made, beautiful games that you can just sit back and enjoy the view. $20 is a bit steep as you only get about 5 hours of playtime, if it is on sale definitely get it. I will remember my time playing this game for a long time.Pros: - Stunning visuals- Unique story- Incredible sound track- Interesting puzzles throughout the story that need to be solvedCons: - Short (about 4 hours)- Boring story at some points- Confusing at times- Expensive, buy it on sale- Game has no direction and does not hold your hand, you will get lostVisuals:          10/10Audio:             10/10Cutscenes:      8/10Gameplay:      5.5/10Story:              8/10Replayability:  0/5Solo: N/ACo-op/Multiplayer: N/ABalance: N/AOverall Score: 81/100			"

												This game is one of a kind. It could be labelled as an atmospheric adventure game.The setting is extremely inspiring and the environment is gorgeous looking (even though stuttering happens from time to time) and so it is the music. The gameplay is extremely simple and the puzzles are mostly straightforward, but some of them certainly hold pleasant surprises. The game is very short, probably too short for its asking price and the replayability is very low. I would suggest to play the game in a single run and let yourself immerse in the interesting story and the superb setting/atmosphere. It is a game that, despite the shortness, you will remember and that is why I recommend it.			"

												I've just played this through and I loved every minute.This is an open world puzzle game with an intriguing mystery storyline with horror elements. You take the role of a detective investigating the titular disappearance of a young boy, Ethan Carter. It's pretty hard to discuss the narrative further without giving away spoilers. It has been described as Lovecraftian, I would say there are a few nods to Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos, but it's not the basis of the whole story.The puzzles are logical and not too tough to solve once you understand the mechanic. I did feel that the later murders were a little easier to solve and felt like less work had been put into them compared to say the first one. The puzzles are not all the same though, and there is a good variety to keep the player interested. I would suggest avoiding checking walkthroughs or guides as the puzzles are all achievable with a bit of thought. The graphics are stunning, the level of detail is very high and it must have taken a huge amount of work to create the game world. Pretty much everywhere you look there are amazing views and the landscape is very serene and peaceful. There is a known issue of flashing red lights in the trees which affects Radeon cards, and I did observe it but it wasn't frequent enough to cause a distraction.A few people have complained about the length of this game. You can expect 5-7 hours of gameplay depending on how good you are at solving the puzzles. I personally think that is pretty reasonable. I'd much rather have 6 hours of quality gameplay than 12 hours of filler.Anyway, I'm definitely recommending this.			"

A Paladin’s Steam Review: The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. A Subtly Disturbing Yet Compelling Mystery Game.Genre: First Person Atmospheric Story Driven Mystery with Psychological Horror ElementsDeveloper & Publisher: The AstronautsPlatform Support: Windows, PS4. Mac & Linux ""Coming Soon"". Business Model: Base Game. Copy Purchased by MyselfOverall Gameplay ThoughtsVanishing comes very, very close to a Walking Simulator. There really isn’t a failure state, your actions don’t really affect the game in any meaningful way and the game expects you to experience a lot of it. The only influence you have is exploring the world of Red Creek Valley, solving the puzzles and, by extension, the mystery Paul Prospero is here to solve. Oh right, that’s the guy who you’re controlling and hear monologue as you explore the valley. So, you'll walk along at a fairly steady pace (there's a reasonably faster sprint as well), drink in the atmosphere while you search for clues of Ethan's whereabouts. All the while discovering that there's something creepy and sinister beneath the surface. Red Creek Valley is divided up into multiple areas, each containing a major puzzle or two for you to solve. Puzzles, for the most part, boil down to finding all the objects within a given area and figuring out how they all go together. The music playing in the background will clue you in on whether you’ve left the given area very subtly. Which is helpful because you’ll never need to leave an area in order to solve that particular puzzle. There aren’t any random items on the other side of the map that you have to find. It should be noted that it isn't required to solve these puzzle areas in any particular order, they can be done at any time. Outside of soaking in the sights and experiencing the strange events going on, there’s not much else to do. However, I always felt like I was involved. There wasn't any boring section I felt forced to walk through. It might help that Red Creek Valley appealed to me. Being able to see the burned out buildings, the rusted train cars and nature reclaiming the area, it really intrigued me. It's a feel of history and decay that Vanishing goes out of its way to really sell to the player. It feels like a real place and it’s setup like a real place. I think that helped me enjoy the game more. Atmosphere & JumpscaresThe atmosphere ate away at me. Slowly, creepily, I would sometimes jump at my phone beeping at me. It’s insidious how this game gets into your head. It makes you think something will jump out, scare you half to death and eat what remains of your sanity alive. Spoiler: that doesn’t happen. Except for one area, I’ll explain below. This isn’t a hardcore scare title like Amnesia: The Dark Descent. It’s far tamer by comparison while holding its own. I was often thinking that some dark fantasy creature such as Cthulhu was behind the scenes. It was amusing when that theory was half confirmed. The game will do its best to unnerve you. So long as you let it. There’s only one section of the map where jump scares are present. It’s in a mine and they sort of warn you that it’s coming. Sort of. And it’s mostly optional unless you want a 100% completion rating. At least, I’m fairly certain its optional. The scare is when you’re running around in a mining maze, searching for clues to open a large door in the center of it. In this area, is an undead miner who’s been cursed. While you’re walking around, if you hear a telltale noise you should immediately turn around and go the other way. Otherwise, BOO. You have to start from the beginning of the maze. PC Settings & OptimizationOptimization wise, this game leaves a bit to be desired. You will need to tweak your graphics options to get the best performance as running everything on high will drag the performance down hard. I noticed that Anti-Aliasing and Texture Filtering were the big performance hogs. Oh and there is constant texture loading, which will cause your game to “stutter” frequently as it loads them. This is a problem that affects a lot of computers and it’s immersion breaking. Additionally, if you’re not running a 16:9 resolution, the game will letterbox/pillarbox. Which I find to be frankly inexcusable for a native PC game to be this way. I can’t figure out why the devs didn’t scale the resolutions properly, it’s not like the Unreal engine can’t do it. PCGamingWiki has a installable solution to fix this as well as grant you multi-monitor and ultra-widescreen options. Additionally, while there is a proper Field-of-View slider in the options, (70-120) it crops the image in order to do it. Overall, while the game does run/scale well (and it does so long as you tweak about in the settings), the remaining problems are less excusable. Also, saving is only done in chunks so you might revert some of your actions when quitting and reloading. Redux Edition Quick ThoughtsI gave the Redux edition a quick run through and they seem to have fixed a lot of the problems the original game had. The micro-stutter is completely gone, there's no more pillarboxing as the resolution scales and performance generally seems to be better, if more taxing on machines. Saving is now done every time you act now too. FoV is still a crop effect but I'll let it be. There's also a bunch of tweaks and visual improvements added that you probably won't notice. There's no story difference between the two editions so if you can, play the redux. If that's too taxing, play the original. Kudos to the devs for doing this for free. Final ThoughtsThe atmosphere and mystery makes for a compelling experience. While it does have a lot of adventure/walking simulator aspects to it, it still keeps the player involved the entire time. The atmosphere of a decaying rural area known as Red River Valley is simply intriguing. The psychological horror just works so well. Jump scares are rare but there’s something that eats at you the entire time. When finished, the game will leave you with more questions than answers though not in the “find out in the sequel” sort of way. I should note that the characters are rather cliche but when I consider the ending, it works and feels intentional. Visually, the game looks superb and the audio is top notch. If you're looking for a fun mystery/exploration through a decaying rural area, give The Vanishing of Ethan Carter a go.Read This and More Like It on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

												This game is more or less:10% Myst20% Dear Esther20% Gone Home50% Lovecraftian Horror MysteryNow the (non-spoilery) review:Let me begin by saying this game is right up my alley so I may be slightly biased in the positive direction. Graphics: This game is beautiful, and not just because of the extremely high quality visuals. This game does a better job using high fidelity graphics and environment design to create a deep sense of immersion and an engrossing atmosphere than any I've played in recent years except perhaps The Last of Us. The wind, weather effects, lighting, textures, richly detailed and expertly designed environments all work together perfectly to create an eerie, atmospheric and very ""real"" feeling world. 10/10Gameplay Design: Engaging mechanics of play isn't the reason to play this kind of game. For a game that claims to ""not do any hand holding"" most of the puzzles are♥♥♥♥♥♥easy, although some of them are pretty original and well executed. Other than that exploring semi-linear environments is the only way you directly interact with the games world. However it is a perfectly sufficient manner to get you through the primary draw of the game; the story and environment . 6.5/10Environment(lvl) Design: This is where the game really shines. I don't think I've ever played a game where the world felt so real. The placement of every rock, log, patch of grass, door, etc. is perfect, and the environments are detailed without feeling ""over done"". The visual reference point I keep coming back to is The Last of Us but while it was a beautiful game with excellent visual design the world did feel stylized. Ethan Carter on the other hand has many areas that feel like places I've actually been, so close in fact that it should be uncanny, but instead it just adds a whole other level of immersion and engagement, especially when they introduce supernatural elements.Specific praises include: How well they use visual highlighting to guide the player to places of interest (including both actual light, and the shape of the landscape). Excellent use of the outdoor environment to hide the borders of the levels, this place only has a few places that are straight up ""invisible walls"" but you only bump into them if you're doing things that don't make sense in the context of the game, and the word is so beautifully realized and expertly designed that you forget about them the minute you step back onto the path the game intends you to take. It guides you without it feeling like it's shoving you down a hallway, something that is incredibly difficult to do. 10/10 Story: It's pretty difficult to critique the story it in detail without spoiling it, but here goes. It's well presented, and it starts out very intriguing but I called the twist ending about a third of the way through and it's pretty steeped in the tropes of supernatural mystery. It's not terribly original, but the way you experience the story is novel and engaging enough to elevate it past the written words. 8/10Overall Experience: The game won't change the way you think about games, and it isn't quite as gut wrenching or mind bending as other similar games, but if you enjoy games like the only I likened it to, give it a look. It's beautiful, atmospheric, and genuinely intriguing and engaging (while you're playing it, once you have the full picture it loses some of it's magic).One last praise I had is how well it paces itself, and how it maintains an atmosphere of mystery and subtle horror without every being terrifying the way something like Outlast, or even Amnesia is. There where many times it could have taken a turn and thrown in a jump scare, or a tense stealth/chase sequence, but it choose to instead be morose, bittersweet, and contemplative, and I think the game is better for it. 8/10Bottom Line: 8/10			"

												An entertaining mystery/adventure game with a compelling narrative and striking visuals.You play Paul Prospero, the Philip Marlowe of the supernatural world, picking up one last case after receiving a letter from fellow mystic and absent-minded storyteller, the boy, Ethan Carter. He's vanished, so it's time to put that second-sight to use and track him down!Graphically the game is quite stunning, and when combined with an eerie and ominous score, lends itself to a genuine Lovecraftian atmosphere. There are moments where you may inexplicably look behind you.The puzzles aren't anything to write home about, and I thought, could have been more challenging, but they will immerse you in the story. The narrative is well paced, at no point did trudge on to the next scene wondering what I was doing. It felt as though I had sufficiently adventured by the time I reached the ending, which is certainly worth it, bringing your supernatural connection to the young Ethan Carver full circle.The whole thing will take about four hours, a little more if you go achievement hunting.Have fun!9/10 "

												One of the most dissapointing endings ever. And yes, in my opinion worse than Mass Effect 3's (Which wasn't that bad). Expect to get stuck for hours if you can't figure out the mechanic of finding out where certain objects are. When you see the same word many times keep moving untill they all come together. Knowing that would have saved me hours. Definetly not worth 20$ as if you know what your doing it could be completed in a hour. But pretty much everything besides that is great. Things are really misterious and surprising. The first minute is very scary. And it's cool that some of the people behind one of the most underated game of all time, Bulletstorm, made this. Next time, just don't screw up the ending. It makes everything you've done seem like a waste of time. 7/10			"

												Hello guys!The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a great story/game that, in my opinion, should be tried out by every person who loves mysticsm and craves for a good written tale. At first, the game will impress you with stunning landscape views and beautiful graphics (although at some places it wasn't polished to the limits). It feels real. I mean really real, although it sounds kind of ridiculous. Well, at least when you do not look really closely. Wind is slowly swinging grass, tress, bushes and etc. Combining this with abandoned railroad and houses and, of course, mountain range environment the game creates feelings of lonelyness and melancholy. But after a few tens of minutes player will realise that something really weird is happening around there. Or maybe was happening... After this, the game will make you think. Not too hard, not too much. but still think... How to solve, where's the catch. Because the more you solve, the more story you'll uncover. And thus the game gets as interesting, as it is beautiful. And even if you won't be able to solve everything and leave some mysteries behind, you will still get to the very end of the game to see, to know what really happened there... And now i'll put aside my emotions and feelings and try to point out some pros and cons of this game. Pros:-interesting story with a few or even none flaws in it;-breathtaking and detailed environment;-kind of empty but still alive world;-really good soundtrack;-simple game mechanics;-even more interesting when played with someone.Objective cons:-seems to be overpriced for its length;-later on the puzzles give you the feeling that they are a bit unfinished (at least some of them);-is really violent (I wouldn't recommend this for underaged or really sensitive people);-Lots of backtracking.Subjective cons:-puzzles were too easy for me with most of them taking like 5-7 minutes to solve them;-in my opinion, it would be great if the puzzles had a little different solution mechanics and would make you to think more;-i'm not sure if this was my machine but I had some minor lags and one bug that needed a game restart to be solved.For the record, I played this with my girlfriend who isn't a fan of computer games. But she enjoyed this game a lot, loved the story, loved the time we spent for it. So... This game is really worth to buy and play, even if it's short and overpriced. Want to buy a book with a good plot and sophisticated point of view towards the world? Do it... But consider this game as well, because it's almost as good as any of Stephen Kings' horror stories.Short update: in my review the time spent for this game is not shown correctly - with long strolls and taking time to enjoy the views this game took me about 6 hours to complete it with doing all the achievements.As of 2016 - 11 - 27 I'm really happy to add that with tVoEC redux they fixed backtracking issues.

 Review Time!!!!       So ill first start out with my original thought of game pre purchase.  I like all sorts of games so long as they bring something to the table that intrigues me.  In this case i had watched the trailer and the gameplay videos on steam, and decided that this game had first off amazing visuals (not just graphically but landscape design was pretty great)  and a style of game play that just struck me as a refreshing change of pace to my growing stack of story driven/puzzle games.  I had discussed the gameplay to my friend, (as we went upon an expedition into the forest to chop trees for quickly arriving winter) then nothing. I guess along the journey I had expressed interest in the purchase of the game, but only whence my financial portfolio was performing better. Fast forward a time we are cutting more wood we arrive back at the casa and i have a steam message.  Turns out whilst i was preoccupied my friend had found time to purchase the game without me knowing, and left me a message  We should play the game upon its download and then something about drinking yada yada  twas a great message.     Game installs we click play and the pre game window launches.  I enjoy when a game does this.  Not only does it remind me about changing the graphics settings, but makes the whole process much easier especially if the game is like Fable Anniversary and has the worst computer interface i have ever had the misfortune of dealing with.  After a few moments of turning everything to  maximum overdrive  it was finally time to play.  The Games Main Menu was very simple nice scenery of a meadow i believe now that i think about it i cant really remember, but i do remember a tree in the bottom left corner. There were four or so options we clicked new game or whatever it is to begin our adventure into saving some small child in a basement from his moth.... oh wait thats the  Binding of Isaac  .... to save a boy whom has vanished.     The game opens into an amazing graphically vivid environment.  Slight nuissance of blurring around the non focused center area of screen, but its an attempt to be more realistic i guess.  Controls are very simple which is good because there is no tutorial.  Straight into  Murder Train  mystery solving.  The solving of events is pretty simple; find dead guy, restore crime scene, and use dead guy's memories (I personally think that Paul Prospero is Dumbledore in disguise hence the use of pensieve) to discover a series of events that you must piece together to gain access to the dead spirits last major memory as its soul is torn from the world of the living.   BOOM  Solved my first scene psychic powers FTW.  Thus far into the game about 15 minutes or so, and the daunting question begins to arrive  ""How long is this game?""  This question never popped into my mind before, but story driven games are notorious for being rather short. I personally am ok with a game thats a few hours of great story because hey its a genre with usually a better story than an fps, but without the  pchew pchew.   Although at this  point you are also wondering is there going to be a good storyline as well. All you know is  there is an entity named the  Sleeper  controlling people. Ethan is resistant to its call, and he is in trouble.      That is it for giveaways to the story and progress that takes place now its the moment everyones been waiting for.  My friend and i finished the game it roughly 2 hours and 30 minutes.  Thats full completion all miscellaneous events and all story driven ones.  The story had its share of depth, but id say most of the depth came from the miscellaneous events and tidbits of  Ethan's  stories.  Twice were we caught off guard by sudden bouts of quiet to super loud doubtfully intentional jump scares.... Ok maybe one was intentional, and it got us because here we are joking about  should we run..... no he disappeared OHHH SH** . Anywho it was fun.  The ending was in my personal oppinion lack luster with everything you gather through out the story you start to see whats up.  Atleast we did.  As for exact events we didn't have that figured and it made for an interesting addition but we both felt strange about it.     Still no regrets from either of us about the $20 dollar price tag, and those whom complain that they just spent $5 bucks per hour of enjoyment we spent $10 and i will say $10 bucks per hour for a great time and pleasure of playing this game is worth it to keep this group of developers making games.  My suggestion is buy it call a friend have him pick up a six pack of a nice lager, and play the game. If you know someone who has this game call em up plan a day to drink and play it and just enjoy the time.  Maybe they themselves are regretting the purchase buy the beer and say hey now you've gotten some money back, (at this point they wont care because they have now officially enjoyed the game for a second playthrough) and you will have solved  The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.

This is one of the best experiences from a game I've had. It will make you feel things you didn't expect to fall into. Regardless of how long this is, it's a definite must-have.

In BriefSomewhere between walk-'em-up and adventure game, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter blends the best elements of both.Most valuable resource:  The atmosphere.Of interest to: people who like their walk-'em-ups with just a tad more gameplay.The Vanishing of Ethan Carter received a lot of buzz in the indie-sphere, and rightly so.  It also has its detractors, and I can understand why.  There is just enough game here for it to be unequivocally a game, unlike other narrative-driven walking simulators like Dear Esther and Gone Home and thus, like Eidolon - another gamified stroller - Ethan Carter left itself open to criticism focusing only on the game elements.Now don't get me wrong, the game elements here are brilliant.  You are a supernatural investigator who stumbles across murder victims, hunts for clues using your psychic sense, assembles them, then gets to see little still poses of the victim and their murderer assembled around the scene.  By tagging them in the correct chronological order, you get to view a cutscene that explains what happened.  This denouement is masterfully done.  The process of stumbling across and then piecing together all the elements of the crime is entertaining, and doesn't break your immersion in the tense atmosphere the game is building by forcing you to involve yourself in mindless tasks or fiddly interfaces.But while these murders drive the narrative, the crime scene investigation definitely plays second fiddle to you just walking around this town.  I think the balance is just right, but for those who like more game in their game, the short running time combined with the few instances of this interesting mechanic equals not much game.  And I think that's a real shame, because the beauty of this game is in the way it artfully places you in a plausible scenario dealing with increasingly implausible elements that all have such gravity because the scene, the mood, the atmosphere are all so engrossing and so foreboding.The one criticism I do have is that that one wonderful mechanic is not explained.  It is barely referenced that you have this extra sense, and how your window on the past expands by assembling clues is never mentioned at all.  It doesn't help that the very first scene you encounter, the one where your powers are introduced, is completely atypical, lacking a body or any clues to assemble, and using a different visual to literally every other instance of the sense that occurs the entire duration of the game.  As far as communicating mechanics organically through gameplay goes, that's a cardinal sin.  I feel like the developers have heard this complaint before, and have inserted a warning up-front that the game does not hand-hold as a defence against this criticism, but if you find your players are googling ""ethan carter touch not working"" so frequently that google autocompletes the search three words in you've not communicated well enough.  And that's a real shame, because having to backtrack to redo the puzzles you didn't realise were puzzles kinda breaks the flow of the narrative and takes you out of the game. I do want to especially call out the jump scare section.  Ethan Carter is that rarest of beasts: a horror(-ish) game with an effective and appropriate jump scare.  Half way through the game, when the tension has been built and you're starting to get a sense that these are more than just mundane murders, this terrifying section comes out of nowhere, with no warning, and is genuinely terrifying.  Not just shocking or unexpected, but dreadful.  The fact that this section was managed so well is all you need to know to be sure that the whole game is subtle and intelligent and very expertly crafted as an experience.And it's beautiful, as all walk-'em-ups must be.  Unlike Mind: Path to Thalamus's saturated surreality, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is delicate, and wistful, and melancholic, but every inch as artistically gorgeous.  Take frequent scenic screenshots and you will be set for desktop wallpapers for a good long time.As a piece of Innsmouth writing, it is utterly on-pitch in its length and narrative progression.  If you're a fan of the understated horror of actual Lovecraft, rather than the Cthulu monsterism that has taken over the horror genre, this is a perfect experience for you.  It's not a long game, but it is exactly the right length.That said, I do hope there will be a sequel.  The set-up in terms of mechanics and theme here makes that perfectly possible, and it would be a real shame if we didn't get to play with this system again.			"

												I'm old.I've played 'Pong' on a Saba Videoplay console, 'Pac Man' on an Atari VCS, 'The Hobbit' on a Sinclair ZX Spectrum, 'The Castles of Doctor Creep' on a C64, 'Defender of the Crown' on an Amiga and hundreds of other games on consoles, home and personal computers.Like I said, I'm old.Up to this point, I've NEVER played - no, experienced - something that intense like 'The Vanishing of Ethan Carter' (TVoEC).This game made a lasting impression on me and I still think about it, although I finished TVoEC months ago.For me, as a fan of old Stephen King, David Lynch and H. P. Lovecraft works, this game was a revelation. It created the perfect mood, the right atmosphere, with amazing graphics, an ingenious soundtrack that creeps into your subconscious mind and the strange feeling of pleasant but spooky loneliness.Yes, the riddles might be easy to see through for an experienced gamer and let's be honest, TVoEC is not a very long game. But this doesn't have to be a disadvantage. I for example prefer a typical 6-episodes season of a British TV production over a 22-episodes season of e.g. an American or a German TV production in general.Those 6 episodes are packed with just good stuff and I enjoy watching them again and again, whereas 22 episodes often contain unnecessary fillers.In other words, I prefer quality over quantity. Maybe because I’m old.‘The Vanishing of Ethan Carter’ is a high quality game.This is a game for your heart, not for your heart rate.I can't wait to see with what ‘The Astronauts’ come up next.			"

												I bought this during the summer sale for about 8 bucks and it was completely worth it. Beautiful game, amazing atmosphere, haunting music, and a nice creepy little story. Minimal action, you're just playing for the exposition but it does that quite well. It's in a similar vein as Stephen King's old works, with some Lovecraft thrown in as well. Take your time and explore, and you won't be disappointed.That said, it is a very short game, without much replay value once you know the story. Definitely worth playing, but maybe wait til it's on sale to try. Took me under 3.5 hours to clear completely. "

There is not that much in convensional gameplay per say, the puzzles are few and very easy and it's mostly walking in very pretty (but bleak) enviroments. But that is not a bad thing as long as you are prepared for it. This is what ""walking simulators"" should try to be. It's a short game, but well worth playing. You are really missing out on something special if you don't play it.			"

												This game is visually stunning, atmospheric, captivating, and intriguing. There is little to nothing in the way of action, and overall it plays more like a mystery or puzzle game than survival horror (though it has those elements as well). If you're looking for a shooter, or a fast-paced pulse pounding survival horror game, this isn't it.It is, however, a masterfully executed, immersive, narrative experience reminiscent of Twin Peaks and the works of H.P. Lovecraft. The ways the player is given to interact with the environment and the story are both novel and intuitive, and the game has an unintrusive, minimal interface that fits well with the tone and theme of the game.I've been seeing this game compared to Dear Esther, which is a game I hate. Apart from generally seeming to have been constructed with more care, this game differs from Dear Esther in one very important, fundamental way: It gives the player things to do, and makes them feel like they are involved in the story. I felt a need to address this because the frequent comparisons between the two had caused me to avoid The Vanishing of Ethan Carter for quite some time. When I finally played it I was pleasantly surprised to find that this comparison does not hold up under scrutiny.			"

												This is a beautiful and interesting game which, with a few nudges and tweaks could have been even better. Initially there is no plot - you just have to find Ethan. Unfortunately, there is also no guidance or advice about how to use the tricks at your disposal. I respect the designers' intention to not hold your hand, but a couple of pointers would have helped. For example, there is nothing to prevent you from wandering into another area before completing the puzzles in the first. I would guess it's possible to complete the game while missing most of the puzzles due to over-eager exploration. There's also no clue about how to use the psychic powers to locate clues, which can leave you searching for a tiny object in a large map. Finally, the game's puzzles could really do with a few more elements: one sequence is unlocked by simply returning an object to its original location. The psychic detective thing works nicely, though, and the idea of Ethan creating fantastical stories from modest family dramas is a compelling device which keeps the game moving forward. Graphically, this is about as good as Unreal 3 gets: high-res textures and masses of foliage show this was written for the PC but, as usual with U3, shaders are a bit sparse and there is no use of POM or tessellation. Most importantly, the world looks and feels real, and this is enhanced by the moody music. Given how few names are mentioned in the credits, the whole game is a pretty impressive experience. It's Dear Esther with a few more things to do, and there's nothing wrong with that. 7/10			"

I played this in ~6.5hrs without trying to break any speed records... which might be considered short regarding the price. It took me while to fully understand the main characters special ability and how to use it - not sure if it was just me being too stupid or if a little tutorial in the beginning would be called for.I liked the puzzles which I think could be a bit more complex - but on the other hand more straight forward puzzles can avoid a lot of frustration for the players and difficulty is a very subjective thing...The story is great and in the end everything suddenly made some sense - even though a lot of players won't like the ending.If there was a sequel - I'd get it immediately.

												It took me a while to decide if I really liked this game. It's a departure from the types of games that I usually play, and  quite different from the detective games that I used to play a long time ago -- Tex Murphy etc. But, this game is gorgeous, the visuals are stunning, I spent a lot of time just looking around and enjoying the view with the detective work way on the back burner. As a 'walking simulator' this game rocks, as a detective story it's ok, but on the easy side and too short with only a handful of puzzles to solve. If you wanted, you could speed run this game in 30-40 mins I'm guessing, but in the end the great visuals save the day and you will not want to rush through it. I can only imagine how cool it would be to play this on an Occulus Rift or equivalent The Astronauts have raised the graphical bar and charted new territory, kudos to them!

												Spectacular. A very beautiful (literally) example of noir detective mystery story telling with enough horror elements to drag you in without the usual frustration or repulsion or terror that usually comes with it (I stopped playing Dead Space 2 times before I finally picked up the courage to finish it. I still haven't finished Amnesia!)If you've liked Gone Home, you'll love this. This game places story & atmosphere at the forefront so that's a big hint to you on whether you want to pick it up. There's very little action, no health or time limit or such stress factors...just you and a story that you can peel apart at your own pace and from your own angles. And it's a very touching, emotional story indeed that I feel ended in a pretty satisfying way, contrary to what many reviews say. Take your time with it; explore. There's lots to admire just by strolling through the sprawling forest landscape.Still, there're definitely game elements that draw you in and keep you engaged, besides the jaw-dropping scenery. Puzzles lie sprawled across the map waiting for you to discover and solve. They're not too hard - each puzzle was just enough of a challenge without too much frustration involved, and it's satisfying when you reach each answer, while at the same time, more of the story unfolds from there.Which brings me to perhaps the only sore point: the save system is quite vague at first: the game only saves after each solved puzzle, which means you shouldn't explore too much and then quit the game without solving something first, and once - only once - did I encounter a bug that made me lose about 20 minutes of progress. It's not really serious, but it's there.Overall, I'd heavily recommend the game. It's a little pricey normally (I bought it in the autumn sale), but it's definitely an unforgettable experience you have to try.			"

												The Astronauts have built a gorgeous, unsettling world to explore.  The atmosphere, aided by the sound and music design and the minimal interface, is engrossing and lingers with you (with the possible exception of the voice acting, which is - perhaps intentionally - less than completely convincing).The underlying plot is nothing ground-breaking, but it unfolds in sublime ways with twist(s) that never feel insulting to the player.  There is always a feeling of more stories, more mysteries, more history shimmering at the periphery.  All in all, I would gladly have spent two or three times as long in that world if there had been the content to support it -- one or two more puzzles (or perhaps just more depth to the existing ones) might have better rounded out the already wonderful experience.

												Wonderfully thought provoking, hauntingly memorable supernatural adventure game.  Not quite the revelation in gaming the press would have you believe, as the game is resolutely old school in it's appproach.  Ethan Carter rather reminds me of the old Infocom text adventures of the 1980's, the hardest of which more often than not contained equally as obtuse game mechanics as Ethan Carter and fantastically written plots.Ethan Carter looks stunning and is drenched in atmospheric visuals, the sound does a good job too.  On the downside there's some noticeable graphical lagging in certain areas on any quality setting and the musical triggers are a bit too abrupt when changing track.  Some of the character models are somewhat at odds with the beautiful environments too, with models looking a bit underdeveloped facially and texturally.The story and atmosphere are what sets Ethan Carter apart from the crowd however.  The story is told almost entirely through clues in the environment and sparse objects lying around, from which events must be reconstructed in an impressive, forensically supernatural fashion. The devs should be lauded for such a refreshing take on adventure gaming, a ray of light in today's wretched UBI/EA/DLC/AAA/CoD dominated con-fest of a gaming industry.In summary then, Ethan Carter is a short but essential Lovecraftian tale. An expertly crafted adventure game that puts triple A studios to shame with it's bold direction, visual story telling and technical prowess.  Buy this game, it's a game you won't forget in a hurry			"

												Let's get a few things out of the way first. I'm not sure whether to recommend this game or not, but I can recognise the developers created something extraordinary here, and that at least deserved being mentioned.This game is basically a walking simulator, but unlike for example The Stanley Parable, there are no alternate routes or endings. Replayability is non-existent here. Depending on how leisurely you play and how fast you resort to walkthroughs, you'll get about two to five hours out of this 'game'. In that sense you're probably thinking this game is overpriced, and I agree.I won't go into too much detail about the story, as that really is the meat of the game. I don't want to take away from that. But essentially, you are Paul Prospero, a detective with a keen eye for the supernatural, and you have come to Red Creek Valley per request of Ethan Carter's fanmail. As you solve murders and puzzles, the overarching plot reveals itself to you through cutscenes and voice-overs.The way this works is you are dropped into a gorgeous, sprawling open-world with the clues scattered about. This is very reminiscent of point-and-click games, but the difference is you can actually (un)intentionally skip puzzles or scenes and walk further into the world. But to get the ending, you'll have to eventually solve every puzzle. To summarize	 Top-notch visuals and music score make for a very eerie atmosphere. Easily the best part about the game.Absolutely zero replayability. Best when played through in a single sitting in my opinion. Try keeping a spoiler-free walkthrough handy if you don't like the idea of wandering aimlessly until you bump into a clue.The plot is alright to excellent, depending on your personal taste, but I don't think anyone can call it poor.If you like games such as The Stanley Parable, Dear Esther, or are otherwise interested in video games as an art, definitely pick this up if you catch it on sale. I can best summarize this game as being dropped into a gorgeous but gloomy lovecraftian film which you can explore and walk around in.That all being said, it's definitely not for everyone. I personally see this game for all its worth but it's hard to 'recommend' it in the typical sense. "

There's no jump scares, but the game does a good job of instilling a sense of dread here and there.The ending is....unexpected. Not in a bad way, though.I feel that it was worth my time. Recommended.

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a beautifuly designed masterpiece.The very moment you open your eyes, the game absolutely stuns with beautiful visuals and as you are gently walking your first steps in the world, you will immidiately feel that childish sense of wonder and excitement, but that is only the beginning of the beautifu and sad experience that awaits you. The story is told in a slow pace and you have more than enough time to enjjoy the beautiful scenery. The game is surprisingly not linear yet for most part, you wont find yourself aimlessly wandering. As the story slowly unfolds, you are more and more intrigued by the question how did this happen ?As you finish the game, the ending will just hit you like a freight train. Absolutely unexpected not even by hardcore book readers / movie fans or gamers. Even tough I have to say that the storytelling in this game is more subtle and wont get into your bones as much a for example Brothers: Tale of two sons the game makes up for it fully with its stunning visuals, unique game mechanics and beautiful Norwegian like setting.10/10			"

The Vanishing of Ethan Carter tells several stories tied by a single main narrative in an engaging and visually atractive way.The graphics are very good, the music is up to scratch and mirrors the mood of the various places visited throughout the game. I think the main downside of this title is how short the gameplay is. It took me just three hours to discover and complete all of the available stories and puzzles, as well as all but one achievement.If anyone's looking for an adventure game, like those of the Myst series, including Uru, you might find the puzzles not challenging enough, maybe even disappointing. However,  The Vanishing of Ethan Carter simply does not belong to this genre. It's more of a multimedia story. Not an adventure game, not a pure story like Dear Esther, but something inbetween.It's probably not a game I'm ever going to replay but I certainly concider it money well-spent. Playing through it felt like reading a book (and a decent one) in many ways. The most vibrant inspiration behind the storyline seems to be that drawn from the works of H. P. Lovecraft. However, subtle hints of the styles and interests represented by multiple other authors can be picked up by an attentive player.			"

												Easily the best game I've played in quite a while. I played through it over two days ago and I still can't stop thinking about it. It takes around four hours to play through which may be a turn-off for some, but the story is so compelling and the graphics are so beautiful that it's hard to put down. The writing is smart and at times intentionally ambiguous, which allows the player to ponder some of the deeper implications of the events presented. The creators seem to be heavily influenced by classic science-fiction and horror literature, and throughout the game pay homage to masters of the macabre like Edgar Allan Poe and H.P. Lovecraft. All of this is presented to the player in a world that is frighteningly beautiful and isolating. The end result is a game that continues to haunt you well after you've completed it.			"

												*MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS*I can most aptly characterize The Vanishing of Ethan Carter using its own words 'This game is a narrative experience that doesn't hold your hand'. To me, it's almost like a lovechild of Alan Wake and Dear Esther, combining brilliantly dark writing (reminissant of Edgar Allen Poe) and stunning life-like visuals (even well-textured foliage!) into an unforgettable masterpiece that shows the genre is still very much alive.The Vanishing of Ethan Carter explores ideas of broken souls, the human condition, a child's imigination and, apparently, vanishings.As I'm always fond of in games, there were some splendidly odd sequences (namely the space segment), yet nothing felt out of place. Every scene and aspect worked and flowed well.And I must comment on the sheer atmospheric genius - everything feels so alive, but you feel so alone. Yet with a lurking sense something or someone is waiting for you. The music compliments the atmosphere design perfectly, provoking emotional response and, not gonna lie, it gave me goosebumps.A beautiful metaphor and a loveletter to the genre.			"

The scenario is astonishing and breath taking.Although the game play is slow and not made for the action gamers, the idea of “not holding your hand” kind of investigation is a detail that makes the game wonderful to be played. The best part is to lose yourself in a big detailed place where you can go anywhere whenever you want.I strongly recommend this game for those that like its style.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is an absolute beauty of a game, from its stunning environmental landscapes to the fantastic atmospheric sound effects that you hear while walking around. I feel that this game has a mix of L.A. Noire with Dear Esther and a bit of Amnesia: The Dark Descent thrown in.The story is very good and the ending is very good too. Although the game is pretty short, with only a 3-4 hour length in gameplay, it is still worth getting! Also, The Astronauts made a prequel comic which you can read to find out what happened before the events that take place in the game.The voice acting, although not the greatest I've heard, it is pretty good but don't expect to hear AAA voice actors in this gameThe environment as mentioned before is stellar and beautiful in many ways, I would recommend buying/playing this game on a computer that can actually handle it, although I was able to play it on the High settings, I did experience some sticking in areas where there is a lot of objects. And the FPS did choke down to even 10 FPS!Although I never saw one single loading screen, I did notice some bugs in the game, in one part I had to put a certain scene in chronological order and two of the player models were missing even though I could still arrange them how I wanted them to be, plus the game did crash once (but that was probably my PC chocking itself with the amount of stuff it had to handle)Even though the game is great, I wish they could of improved on some stuff. The place where you visit which is Red Creek Valley, is pretty big! I know that the developers wanted to immerse you into the game, but I wish there was a few maps placed into the environment like in the Mine (players who played this bit, you know which bit!) had. Plus some of the items you have to search you don't even realize until you almost reach the end,  SPOILER ALERT! - In one such example, where you enter in the beginning of the game through the tunnel, there are a set of traps which make part of the story, I didn't even know this until I reached the map at the end where it shows all the areas! And I had to travel all the way back to the start! Also, another example is the astronaut that takes you into space, how on earth would you know where it is until you reach the end and then you have to travel all the way back to save that scene!  Another thing which also annoyed me was where you are in the scene that took place, you would either have to find something or rearrange something, some of the items took me over 30 minutes to complete because I didn't know what on earth I was supposed to do! Also, the puzzles are a bit tricky until you get the hang of it!The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a great game to play and a job well done to the developers as this was there first game by the company The Astronauts, although the game may be a bit short and it may be a bit frustrating at times, this is a great first person mystery game! PLEASE NOTE: Do not think that there isn't any scary areas in this game! Do not be fooled by the teaser trailers and trailers, there is a few jumpscares in this game! If you don't like a few jumpscares, be prepared when playing The Vanishing of Ethan Carter!  RECOMMENDED :)  THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY! (What's this? :- Like some games get ""Best Game of 2014"" or ""Best Indie Game"", etc... So I have decided to make my own!)  "

For one, this small studio managed to make a game which has better graphics, more consistent gameplay and fewer bugs than the vast majority of titles published by the ""bests"" of the industry.  Also, the purpose of the game, which I assume to be IMMERSION, is reached in totality. Every minute playing the game was enjoyable. Nature is beautiful, and its voice is rich and surrounding. As for the story and its characters; I was completely fooled. At first, it seemed like I was getting into a simple, straight forward mission, with generic characters and a tangible goal, but I couldn't have been more wrong. The characters are effective, the story intriguing and the protagonist has literally no guideline to follow. I loved just wandering in the stunning environment and simply letting myself be surprised by every clever bit of this fantastic, attaching adventure!			"

ATIRAXI’S IN-DEPTH THE VANISHING OF ETHAN CARTER REVIEWSUMMARYFirst off I want to express how beautiful this game is; it is one of the best games graphic wise that I’ve seen in a very long time. The game is actually pretty short, only around 6 hours, but the story is excellent for being so short even if it’s just for the little secret stories that are hidden around the game.I hate scary games with a passion, I can’t play them by myself, just the “horror” tag will drive me away from games the majority of the time. There are a few jump scares in the game, mostly in the very beginning and the middle of the game. The game runs smoothly and has absolutely no glitches at all.When I was playing and I got to the middle of the game with the jump scare I streamed with someone that already got through the game and they walked me through it so I didn’t have to worry about getting trapped by the jump scare. So if you are worried about getting scared then read a few forums or maybe watch a YouTube video.PROS•Excellent story•Amazing graphics•Smooth gameplayCONS•The game is too shortRATING8/10			"

												Very enjoyable. One of those special productions that is more of an experience than just a game.  Stunning, reallistic and memory stirring visuals, I spent a lot of time just looking and being amazed at the detail.  The narrative and the way it is presented is somehow very realistic as well. Severl times I found myself reflecting on my own childhood as the story awoke old memories in me. The story is rather sad and a little unsettling; sort of like 'Twilight Zone' or, for those who can remember, 'Alcoa Presents'.  When you finish the game you won't be finished because you will be thinking of what happened and wondering if maybe you can talk to the writers about it. I didn't like the ""save game"" feature as you have no control over it. Also, a log of sorts that you could refer back to would have been helpful. As it stands, you need a good memory to recall the notes you find and the dialogue that transpires.			"

												It's been a long time since  I got immersed in a single player game, let alone do a short review of one. This is the kind of game you think about after shutting your PC down and going to bed. Despite it being quite short (took me about 4 hours and I wandered around the map a bit) I spread my playthrough across 3 days. After the first session it felt like I played the game for a solid 3+ hours, when in fact I played only one. This game does walking around and exploring right, I can tell you that much. You WANT to see what the areas have to offer - the music and visuals are incredible but simple at the same time. The area itself is also very ""dark"" in some parts - enough to make it a horror game if only the devs wanted to go that way. Good thing they didn't, though. The ending was beautiful for me, open for interpretation and it just was a pleasure to see it like 5 more times after I finished - hearing the characters voices and the great end song.Slight spoiler here - I found / solved all of the 'quests' before reaching the end and it truly saddens me when I saw youtubers just rolling through the game, not wandering around, not exploring, etc. Shows you the current state of gaming, really. I will do a second playthrough to understand the story better - it's like a good movie, you see things differently the second time around.Shout out to the Astronauts crew! This is a great game and I'm waiting for more.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a good game. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I was captivated throughout.I played the Paranormal Investigative game all in one sitting. The game Last seven hours, taking into account some time used actually trying to figure out the clues or where to go next. I'll address this later.-Firstly the story:If you like the paranormal, Noir detectives and murder mysteries. This is your game, and I would recommend you get it ASAP. The narrative of the game is explained to you through flashback sequence; which occur when the player completes all the ""clues"" for a scene in the game. Even then it's not overbearing. A simple line from the protagonist and player, Paul Prospero details everything you need to know without taking you out of the immersion of the game. Another thing this games does very well.-The games world:The map of the game, although small, is detailed meticulously. This fact and the use of the engine mean you can immerse yourself in the world incredibly easily, with the help of the subtle narrative. I cannot imagine what this would be like in VR. The game play is not completely linear, but there are aspects; and rightly so, that are. Such as areas being blocked or just hidden until an event is triggered in the story. Otherwise you can visit anywhere in the map without restriction. One downfall to this is it can lead to a lot of back-tracking, which does cause annoyance at times. When you really just want to progress the story to find out what is happening.-Game MechanicsAs mentioned earlier the game tells it's story through a sequence of flashbacks, that the player instigates from restoring items to their original places at a crime scene. Adding, partially, the element of paranormal. Otherwise the game plays like a first person point and click adventure really. Personally I think that's what makes it good. It's not over complicated; and doesn't bar people from entry into the game. Also, more importantly, it doesn't take away from the detective work.One thing that I both praise and criticize the game in, is the lack of hints or hand-holding. On one hand this means how well you progress through the game is entirely up to your skill. However in certain cases this can lead to frustration when, to progress onto the next area you have to do something that isn't obvious at all.  When in the hydroelectric plant it's not at all explained that you need to turn off the last turbine to uncover a path across the river To conclude I definitely recommend this game. It's a fun paranormal investigative game, which had me on the edge of my seat throughout and left me wanting more when I had finished. While I haven't played this in VR I think it would add to the immersion of the whole game, while there probably wouldn't be a high chance of motion sickness due to the walking nature of this game. However if this is the case then there's an option to add a sight in the middle of the screen that could help.			"

												This game does it right. Visual quality. Atmospheric music. Voice work is high. Explore, detect, solve. I would of liked to see some wildlife roaming around in the distance but it's okay. Maybe some birds in the sky. It would of been even better if the clouds moved slowly to match the wind. It shares a lot with Dear Esther but surpasses it on so many levels. This game is an instant classic. A work of art.The redux is even more beautiful for the U4 Engine. This game is highly recommended.			"

												In short, It’s a really really beautiful game. The gameplay on the other hand…The game features a decent story with good narrating, but the puzzles and mysteries aren’t really a challenge. More effort could have been made to them and/or some features could have been removed to make it harder.The story and game itself isn’t really that dark or scary either, except for this one puzzle who had this one zombie guardian you saw far behind you in one second, and when you turn around he suddenly spawns in front of you and kills you. I almost♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants multiple times.So summed up, I got mixed feelings about this game. For the fact that I like how pretty this game is and not how easy it is. I say this game is more recommended for those who are after a pretty and easy game, and if you are after a challenge you probably should pass on this one.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is an exceedingly beautiful game visually, a surprising and ultimately very sad game narratively.Gameplay-wise, the focus is exploration. It walks the line between being a walking simulator, a hidden objects game and (thanks due to a few simple, yet engaging puzzles) a classic point-and-click adventure. It's an engaging mix, especially due to the absolutely excellent score and aforementioned visuals; and you truly feel a bit like a detective as you investigate the game world.I can't think of a way to say more about the game without spoiling it or without becoming too subjective. Honestly, the official game description says plenty. I think if based on that and the screenshots you think the game would appeal to you; then there's a very good chance it will. It definitely was the case for me - I had a wonderful time exploring, and the story ended up personally resonating with me.			"

												Technical:Doesn't support 21:9 or wider screen resolutions. Flawlesswidescreen fixes thisBuilt on the Unreal Engine, so performance is amazing and the graphics are breathtakingSeriously, buy the game, if only to bask in the gloriousness of the PC Master RaceMy thoughts:Masterpiece. Absolutely incredible at building an environment to play in.Little bit of a learning curve though. This game is a bit...different to play, than any other game I've played before. A lot of weird things go on, that can sometimes creep you out. Don't let your common sense grab hold of you, this is more along the lines of The Twilight Zone. Think of this title as a supernatural Nancy Drew, the the visual fidelity of Crysis, and the ability to tell a story on the level of Metro 2033. Stellar game, very much a 'proof of concept though'. Relatively short, you could beat this game in 4 hours if you tried. Although, it does take some getting used to.My final thoughts on the story of the game: Creations through observation.(Get it on sale though $10 is a reasonable price point I'd say)			"

												I literally cannot say anything about this game without spoiling everything about it. So trust me when I say that while it’s flawed mechanically, everything that’s good about it vastly outweighs some of the stranger gameplay mechanics. It’s short, but it’s exactly as long as it needs to be. The absolutely gorgeous graphics alone may be worth it, and I’m not even someone who cares about graphics. I may have finished this game in four hours if I didn’t keep stopping everywhere to take in the view and hammer the screenshot button.If you like weird fiction, short narrative experiences, if you liked games like Gone Home and The Path, if you want a game that puts atmosphere and narrative first, I promise you will love this. Give this developer some love. They have done an excellent thing and should do more of it.			"

												My favorite author is H.P. Lovecraft, so I make a point of checking out every game or movie that claims to be inspired by his work.  Usually the end result is pretty weak sauce, but sometimes I find epic experiences like Eternal Darkness or Dark Corners of the Earth ... or shorter, but still powerful stories like Ethan Carter.The game's story is more in line with Lovecraft's early work, with the focus on internalized existential angst with a smattering of references to the wider mythos and the power of dreams.  It's a slower, more personal, self-contained story, rather than one about ancient aliens rising up from terrible slumber to end humanity, which is fine.  Gameplay is all about investigating a series of murders in the gorgeously rendered Red Creek Valley while searching for Ethan Carter.  There is no combat and no way to die (although there is a gamebreaking bug that I at first mistook for character death towards the end, if you solve one of the puzzles before the final murder, that requires you to close the game and continue from the previous save).The unique method of sensing the psychic residue of strong emotions and reconstructing the timelines of the murders is clever and provides the only real ""action"" to what is primarily a short story you get to walk through and witness.  There are no outcomes to change, no secret endings, no agency for you as a player at all, really, other than the order in which you solve the murders.Graphically, the game is beautiful, alternating between peaceful and creepy, as needed.  The environments look and sound real and are the key to the experience.  Lesser visuals would have hurt the immersion.  The character models are less impressive by comparison, but the voice acting makes up for that and provides some believable personalities.  I would recommend you disable Motion Blur in the Graphics options, as I found it nauseating and a distraction from the great artwork done for the game.Total game time, exploring every possible location is 4-5 hrs, and for an $8 game, I can't really complain.  I pay more than that to see a 2 hr movie at the theatre.  Replayability is practically nil, however.  Once you have solved a murder or puzzle the hard way (without a guide - using one will only hurt your experience in the long run), you can easily burn through it again without much effort, further cutting down the game time to less than 2 hrs, easily, accounting for walking time and watching the cutscenes.  You'd be better off introducing someone else to the game, rather than play through it multiple times.  Then you could discuss the ending!For an additional $4, you can get a digital map, poster, making of document, and the origianl soundtrack, which I purchased to support the developers and found worth it for the great atmospheric music alone.If you want to experience a beautiful visual tale of mystery and the occult in the vein of H.P. Lovecraft, there's hardly a better way to spend a lazy afternoon.			"

												Jaw-droppingly beautiful. Incredibly original concept. Why cant all games look this good (and run flawlessly)? For being Mystery genre, with puzzle aspects, and full atmospheric immersion, its a total slam dunk in every category you can place it in. The devs of this game need to teach Techland how to create their map for Dying Light. (I know, I know, a city is mych different to render than a forest...dont leave stupid comments)One thing that amazes me is that so many games are trying to stand out by being ""open world"". Yet, take a game like Ethan Carter, and you realize that you dont need an open world environment to be good. Thoughtful writing creatives a narrative. Situations are revealed through the narrative, supported by the visual environment, and you have the basis of immersion. Open world or not, if you cant do at least one of those things well in a fpd style game, then it sucks. Ethan Carter not only does the basics right, but it does everything right.I fully expected a game this beautiful to not run smoothly. OR I expected to have to turn the settings down. It runs smoother than any game I have yet played. And I can run it at default settings (which are high by default) or even tweak it all the way up on the few options that are set moderately, and it still runs just as smooth.So far, I cant think of any area where this game falls short. It seems to excel in every category. And everywhere else it redefines quality and hopefully raises the bar for all other devs moving forward.Its easily a 10/10 - Buy itPS: Have I ever given a game a 10/10 before? And this isnt even my favorite type of game either			"

												Short answer - Would reccomend, 8.5/10, about 4 hours to play through.Longer review - Most games like this are not for everyone - short but sweet, atmospheric and spooky but without jump scares like the normal horror fan is used to. However, even if you like games that are action-packed and filled with nothing but cause and effect, taking some time to fall in love with this game will offer you a very rare and special singleplayer experience. Although many other games offer rich story and even more content, this game seems to succeed much more, for me, in capturing you in its Lovecraftian universe. Overall, I certainly reccomend you pick this up if you need a short break from traditional and more popular action based games. Its $20 price tag is well worth the wonderful experience, but you can often catch it on sale if you're low on Steam money. So if you're ready to spend about 4 or so hours to get caught up in the world of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, I reccomend it. Out of 10 I'd give it a solid 8.5, and hope you have just as much fun as I had with this game.			"

												This was probably one of my favorite games I played this year, I am a sucker for games with beautiful scenery and sound, which this game has.

This is a must play for anyone who loves well made, beautiful games that you can just sit back and enjoy the view. $20 is a bit steep as you only get about 5 hours of playtime, if it is on sale definitely get it. I will remember my time playing this game for a long time.Pros: - Stunning visuals- Unique story- Incredible sound track- Interesting puzzles throughout the story that need to be solvedCons: - Short (about 4 hours)- Boring story at some points- Confusing at times- Expensive, buy it on sale- Game has no direction and does not hold your hand, you will get lostVisuals:          10/10Audio:             10/10Cutscenes:      8/10Gameplay:      5.5/10Story:              8/10Replayability:  0/5Solo: N/ACo-op/Multiplayer: N/ABalance: N/AOverall Score: 81/100			"

The gameplay is extremely simple and the puzzles are mostly straightforward, but some of them certainly hold pleasant surprises. The game is very short, probably too short for its asking price and the replayability is very low. I would suggest to play the game in a single run and let yourself immerse in the interesting story and the superb setting/atmosphere.

												I've just played this through and I loved every minute.This is an open world puzzle game with an intriguing mystery storyline with horror elements. You take the role of a detective investigating the titular disappearance of a young boy, Ethan Carter. It's pretty hard to discuss the narrative further without giving away spoilers. It has been described as Lovecraftian, I would say there are a few nods to Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos, but it's not the basis of the whole story.The puzzles are logical and not too tough to solve once you understand the mechanic. I did feel that the later murders were a little easier to solve and felt like less work had been put into them compared to say the first one. The puzzles are not all the same though, and there is a good variety to keep the player interested. I would suggest avoiding checking walkthroughs or guides as the puzzles are all achievable with a bit of thought. The graphics are stunning, the level of detail is very high and it must have taken a huge amount of work to create the game world. Pretty much everywhere you look there are amazing views and the landscape is very serene and peaceful. There is a known issue of flashing red lights in the trees which affects Radeon cards, and I did observe it but it wasn't frequent enough to cause a distraction.A few people have complained about the length of this game. You can expect 5-7 hours of gameplay depending on how good you are at solving the puzzles. I personally think that is pretty reasonable. I'd much rather have 6 hours of quality gameplay than 12 hours of filler.Anyway, I'm definitely recommending this.			"

												Incredible, breathtaking visuals enabled by creative use of photogrammetry and loving, meticulous artistic work. The amount of effort that went into crafting every meter of the world here is unmatched even by the best triple-A teams working on budgets orders of magnitude bigger. This is a masterpiece in environment art, an example to study. I definitely recommend reading the development blogs of the project for the look into the process - lots of developers should learn from this game.This carefully crafted environment is not there to be a passive eye candy either - it's an irreplaceable tool for telling the story. It sets the mood, manipulates your expectations and carefully directs your progression through the story. I'm not really sure what can be done to improve the game, actually. It's a complete, well-executed, focused product. There is no need for more action, the peaceful walks at your own pace are the definitive way to go through the experience - there is no place for explosions, crowds or thrilling chases here. There is no need for bigger environment - you don't need rock climbing, wing suits, boats and additional ten kilometers of lush forest to tell this story. There is no need for weapons, for inventory, for HUD.The sound work deserves high praise too - the environment is brought to life through masterful use of ambient, and the music is brilliant. So yeah, can definitely recommend this. Even if you prefer more active genres, this is a game is worth supporting - it represents the work attitude, fascination with art and understanding of narratives that I would love to see more in the game development industry.

												Visually this game is utterly fantastic. I have rarely had the joy of seeing a game with as much attention to detail placed into nearly every environmental element. Everything from houses through to trees and down to rocks on the ground combine to produce a wonderfully immersive and beautiful world to explore. On top of the technical prowess the game displays, there is a clear and very effective aesthetic which together with the graphical fidelity generate something truly beautiful. The lighting and scene setting are also expertly done and there were many times where I simply stopped to admire what had been done. At the same time as being beautiful to look at, it managed to convey a feeling of sadness, abandonment and menace that stuck with me throughout the whole game.The soundtrack and sound design fit in with the visuals perfectly, very soft and low key. The environmental sounds were subtle and were effective in grounding the player in the scene and were very immersive. In terms of gameplay, this game shares a lot of DNA with titles like Dear Esther and Gone Home in that it is mostly about exploration and has no action to speak of. Because of this, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is not something that everyone will like, however I do think it is one of the best entries I have played in this genre. You play as a supernatural detective called Paul Prospero who has come to a quiet backwater town in response to a letter from Ethan Carter, something terrible has happened in this quiet and near abandoned town and it is down to you to investigate it. I will keep away from discussing plot points so as not to spoil the story as the game does rely somewhat on the player gradually unveiling what happened.With Prospero’s medium like abilities, he is able to pick up an imprint of dramatic events that have occurred in an area – however it is sensitive to disorder, and to get a clear picture, he needs to find objects that played a vital role within the event and try arrange them as they were prior to the event to reset the area.  From here he gets an impression of events and once you have figured what order they go in, you can then see the ghostly playback of what happened.These puzzles range in their effectiveness, with some being decidedly pedestrian in their difficulty, and one or two being very obscure. All however are quite effective in telling the story and for the most part they strike a good balance between pacing and difficulty. Each of these story fragments form up the story of what happened in this town, and although some of the puzzles can be done out of order, the major plot points are cleverly obscured until it is appropriate, which helps ensure the player does not get lost, while still allowing flexibility in how you reveal the story for the most part. The story was interesting and compelling enough to keep me going through till the end. Whilst the ending wasn’t quite what I had expected it was I felt a perfect ending for the narrative one that fit the tone that had permeated every aspect of the game. Like Dear Esther and Gone Home, this game is very short and does not lend itself to being very replayable. That said I think the length was appropriate. It didn’t feel stretched out and I think a longer play time would be detrimental to the experience. Dear Esther I felt was a dense poem ripe for critical analysis, Gone Home was a slice of life short story. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter I also feel is a short story in game form, a mystery novella. One that provided me with a great experience, well worth playing through.			"

The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is absolutely gorgeous, in every way. The storyline might confuse you until you reach the end, but Unreal Engine overcame themselves again, just look at the graphics, they're stunning. The atmosphere and soundtrack in the game makes it even more amazing, when i played it, it felt like I was in the game, that I unrevealed the secrets of Red Creek Valley - not the supernatural detective Paul Prospero. Yes some things in this game are a little weird and confusing, but you'll understand it if you reach the ending.Story 9/10Soundtrack 8/10Atmosphere 10/10Scenery 10/10Characters 7/10Graphics 9/10Overall 9/10 Amazing and very unique in every way "

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a great example of what a game can be based on nothing but environment and story elements. It uses far-reaching landscapes and beautiful visual effects to bring you a great narrative experience. However, be warned, this game may not be for those of little patience.__________Synopsis:You play as Paul Prospero, who seems to be a detective with paranormal abilities such as ESP. Receiving a letter from Ethan Carter, he learns Ethan has strong psychic connections, and that he has gone missing. Your job is to explore the village of Red Creek Valley and find Ethan. You quickly learn that something is amiss; the town is abandoned, no sign of Ethan's family, and mysterious occurrences. Story: A short, but interesting tale shrouded in mystery. Perhaps too short, depending on how quickly you progress through the game. It doesn't suffer very much from ups and downs in the story, and it ends pretty well too. Graphics: One of the most visually appealing games I've played in a long time. A wider, open world gives you plenty of room to stretch your legs and explore, taking in the sights and sounds as you go along. Functionality: Controls are pretty linear and simple. Essentially a Sherlock Holmes-puzzle solving game. Pick stuff up, find where it goes, and solve problems. Gameplay: Overall, it's not good. Again, it's basically a point-and-click mystery game akin to Sherlock Holmes. There is no combat mechanics, and every item falls into the one-use category. The real problem I encountered was spending obnoxiously long amounts of time searching the vast landscape for potential clues, which a majority of them felt arbitrary. This is where those of little patience may find the game frustrating.______________________________At the end of the day, you're buying this game for the story and the experience; but the experience tends to fall short when you're slowly crawling over a couple acres of land looking for that one last piece of the puzzle. I feel this may have been a better release under a different venue, like Heavy Rain, which offers great atmosphere, narritive, and incorporates at least DECENT gameplay elements. I did enjoy it, but my advice would be to wait until this game goes on sale to purchase.			"

												This game is visually stunning, atmospheric, captivating, and intriguing. There is little to nothing in the way of action, and overall it plays more like a mystery or puzzle game than survival horror (though it has those elements as well). If you're looking for a shooter, or a fast-paced pulse pounding survival horror game, this isn't it.It is, however, a masterfully executed, immersive, narrative experience reminiscent of Twin Peaks and the works of H.P. Lovecraft. The ways the player is given to interact with the environment and the story are both novel and intuitive, and the game has an unintrusive, minimal interface that fits well with the tone and theme of the game.I've been seeing this game compared to Dear Esther, which is a game I hate. Apart from generally seeming to have been constructed with more care, this game differs from Dear Esther in one very important, fundamental way: It gives the player things to do, and makes them feel like they are involved in the story. I felt a need to address this because the frequent comparisons between the two had caused me to avoid The Vanishing of Ethan Carter for quite some time. When I finally played it I was pleasantly surprised to find that this comparison does not hold up under scrutiny.			"

												What can I say about Ethan Carter without spoiling it's story? Not a lot other than: I really, REALLY liked it. It's easily one of the most athmospheric and beautiful games I've ever played. The setting, the tone, the influences, the story, the puzzles, everything just worked for me. As I said, I don't want to spoil anything about it, as I think this is one of the games you should come in as freash as you can be, with as little knowledge of it as possible. It's not a long game, but it also don't have any filler material, only quality stuff. And it's a top experience from start to finish because of that. I think this is also one of the games, that could've been easily messed up, if this would've been some AAA-retail game with 20 hours of content. I really think the lenght is perfect as it is.If I would have to suggest something, that IMO would've maybe made the game even better, it's probably: few more puzzles would have fitted in, eventhough there are some secrets also.Only real critique I had with the game is it's saving system: if you have some mystery in the middle of solving and you go and do something and see the ""Saving scene..."", which usually leads you to believe, that everything you've done/found so far is saved, it doesn't save the mystery that is in the middle of solving. So, just a tip: solve all the mysteries you start before quitting, so you'll avoid playing things thru all over again.All in all this game is a hell of a debut from the small team hailing from Poland - The Astronauts. And if they'll do more of these narrative game experiences in the future, it'll be a day 1 buy for me. I'm really looking forward what they'll decide to do next.			"

												Beginning with a pointedly vague premise of your being some kind of detective on the trail of the titular missing child, the game barely holds your hand as you discover your paranormal investigative abilities and begin to piece together a series of strange events in a remote countryside. That lack of hand holding is more a part of the gameplay than one might initially realize as it ultimately provokes a sort of trial and error process that is in itself an investigation. Despite a few fairly simple puzzles, the game is mostly about discovery. While primarily linear, there are various clues and revelations lying just off the beaten path, many of which ultimately need to be discovered to complete the game, but that (whether found later or during the course of your primary investigation) don’t stymie the pace of the game.The game’s visuals are excellent, featuring not only the river valley vistas seen in the early part of the game, but beautifully dilapidated interiors and dank caves as well. The audio as well is great, with a near perfect score, quality voice acting, and immersive environmental sound. The GUI overlays are brilliant and are realized in such a manner as not feel like an interface, but instead like an extension of the protagonist’s investigative abilities. The ultimate result is a greater sense of immersion and that is a large part of Ethan Carter’s triumph.Throughout the nearly four hours I spent with The Vanishing of Ethan Carter I was almost completely enraptured by it, spurred on both by a sense of wonderment at the world before my eyes and also by a drive to discover the truth of the mystery at hand. It’s difficult to talk about the story at all without spoiling anything except to say that even when predictable, Ethan Carter delivers with a compelling emotional gravitas. I honestly can’t recommend this game enough to fans of first person adventure games, especially Amenisia, Gone Home, or Dear Esther. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is worth picking up at any price.

I know $20 is a fair price, but I would have been perfectly fine paying a lot more.

												Very enjoyable. One of those special productions that is more of an experience than just a game.  Stunning, reallistic and memory stirring visuals, I spent a lot of time just looking and being amazed at the detail.  The narrative and the way it is presented is somehow very realistic as well. Severl times I found myself reflecting on my own childhood as the story awoke old memories in me. The story is rather sad and a little unsettling; sort of like 'Twilight Zone' or, for those who can remember, 'Alcoa Presents'.  When you finish the game you won't be finished because you will be thinking of what happened and wondering if maybe you can talk to the writers about it. I didn't like the ""save game"" feature as you have no control over it. Also, a log of sorts that you could refer back to would have been helpful. As it stands, you need a good memory to recall the notes you find and the dialogue that transpires.			"

												I'm finding it difficult to make my mind up about this game.  When I saw the trailers I thought ""Hmmm, what a lovely looking game"" and that held true.  Graphically, this game is top notch.  However, it is a little discordant: although supposedly set in some small town (presumably) in the US, the architecture and landscape are quintessentially mid-east European (think eastern Austria, Czech. Republic etc. and you get the idea).The gameplay itself is quite linear in a meandering sort of a way so you are free to do as you wish within limits; if you don't complete some tasks then others will not become available.  The puzzles are reasonably challenging without being blockers - a little bit of logic will get you a long way in this game.  The storyline is really what is making me waver.  OK, I know it's a supernatural, horror type thing but it isn't an ""omg, what the heck just jumped outta the walls at me"" frighty game - it's more HP Lovecraft: dark, foreboding and, at times, rather depressing.  I've never been a fan of HP Lovecraft.  I don't want to say much more than that otherwise it will spoil things.In short, if you're a fan of old school adventure games, beautifully executed and with a reasonable level of challenge then you will most likely love this game.  Just don't expect to feel refreshed, invigorated and uplifted when you finish it :).			"

												This is a wonderful game.  The world is glorious.  The sound keeps you on edge and slightly scared, while every now and then the absolutely Beatuiful visuals make you stop and stare.  The world seems real, this would be great with Oculus support.  There is a ""Sprint"" button, buy for 98% of the game I walked, as the game makes you want to take it slow.  You will not enjoy this game if you run through it as fast as possible.  Take your time.  The layout is very good.  If you explore things as you see them, you will not miss anything.  It is a game about discovery and tells a creepy story.  It is more then worth the money.   Get this game! This is the type of game you want your non gaming friends to play because of how great it is.			"

												The game is a foray into something much more involved that doesn't hit the player until the end of the game, and the sequences in between are wonderful yet shocking-- in many different ways. The free form of the game may mean that you get lost initially, or miss a few things, but it will let you know at the end what you might have missed so you can go revisit it.This is one of the more colorful mixes of suspense, imagination and mystery that I've come across. The world is painstakingly handcrafted, with no sense of it being generated by a machine. I could easily stand at many different places in the game and screenshot away, and use the results for desktop wallpaper. And it's beautifully done enough that it might cause some to ask where it is.This game manages to strike several emotional chords throughout its six hours of gameplay, but for the price I think it's worth the trip. If you've considered picking up this game, I'd encourage you to do so.			"

												A richly atmospheric and often-spooky game with sumptuously detailed environments - but much more than this I cannot say without spoilers.  Oh, and be advised - the mechanics may be on the lighter side (you'll never point a reticle at anything), but as the game itself states, this story will not hold your hand; that pondering will be required!Take your time to explore, read, and ponder the implications along with the beauty of the world.

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a short but beautiful story. I wont spoil the story, but I will say that it is hard to follow until the very end of the game. There is no hud or map to guide you through the gameworld, which is a single big forest area. You play as a detective looking for a child by the name of Ethan Carter. The game has no combat. The graphics are great! (even though it uses the Unreal Engine)Music is even better and changes dynamicly from scene to scene.  "

The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, a narrative adventure game from The Astronauts, is a miracle of game storytelling. It redefines immersion and sets the bar for realistic simulation of the natural world astonishingly high—one could even say, excessively high.It tells a story about a young boy who appears to have vanished. The gameplay consists of an exploration of his world, uncovering and solving a number of mysteries about what appears to be happening.The game warns you that it will not be holding your hand, and, through the protagonist, that things are not at all what they seem. The task of the reviewer is impossibly difficult because no explanation of how true this turns out to be can be made without spoiling the experience.All I will say is this: welcome to the mind of a young boy.With most games, the game-play is what matters the most. With this kind of game, however, spoiling the story will spoil the game. It is similar to other story driven games like “Papo and Yo,” “Brothers, a Tale of Two Sons,” “Gone Home,” and possibly also the Amnesia games (particularly the second of those). Although the visual style has drawn comparisons to “Dear Esther,” the games are only superficially similar. In ""The Vanishing of Ethan Carter"" one is very much a participant in events.The game world is breathtakingly lavish and beautiful. For a small game, a massive effort at realism has been undertaken, and it succeeds wildly. If you've seen the game (not just screenshots) than you know that my praise is not excessive. Frankly, the story would have stood up well with a far less demanding art style. Yet they brought it off brilliantly.Like many adventure-story games, there are puzzles to solve (several of these are quite entertaining and clever; have a pen and paper handy), items to locate and put in their proper places, narrative chronologies to determine, locations to discover. The process of uncovering clues and discovering meaning is not difficult, yet the tasks are varied and interesting. The game is not a long one (I stretched it to more than six hours).However, this game integrates game-play and storytelling better than any game I’ve seen. Everything has a reason—even the fact that despite the realism of the world you’re exploring, the sun never moves in the sky. Everything is seamless and utterly engaging.None of this would mean anything if it weren’t for the fact that, as the game progressed and the boy’s family situation became more and more clear, I found myself caring about him as if he were my own son. As Prospero the detective, I became dedicated to finding him, to helping him out of whatever desperate situation he found himself in. And the truth, revealed at last, is moving and satisfying as narrative in a way that few games have achieved. I've read novels that were less satisfying than the story in this game. Think about that a minute. I’ve got to salute the developer team for performing a miracle: they have created a story that is told in a completely believable world that could not be told in another medium.The game is not without its flaws, the principal one being the auto-save system. The game encourages you to explore, and when you uncover the solution to one of the many mysteries, the solved state of that mystery is saved. Each successive “scene” is saved along with the others as you discover them. However, when you quit the game and return later, any scene that you’ve begun but not finished will revert to its “undiscovered” status. This is annoying until you realize what is happening; if you don’t get it quickly—I didn’t—you can potentially lose hours of wandering about. The game is a luscious world that begs you to wander about. Just realize that once you discover a clue, that means (generally) that there are other clues nearby, and that you need to find them all and complete that story segment before you can safely leave the game. It is true that the clues are generally in the same locations, so this is not difficult, but it helps to be forewarned.There are also minor inconsistencies (in the version that I finished, it is possible to have two trains at once in the mine…), buttons that don’t seem to work properly the first time you press them, and other minor graphic glitches.But none of these, even the auto-save system, which the developer assures us would be impractical to change at this point, detract in the least bit from the game. Once you get into the rhythm of it, and have completed your first scene, things proceed very smoothly.Gamers who liked the games I mentioned earlier, or other story-driven but non-passive games will enjoy “The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.” The art design is best-in-class. The original musical score is haunting and beautiful, and is still playing in my head.Bravo, Astronauts. Thanks for the wonderful story. I’m looking forward to your next project.			"

												I absolutely recommend this game. This is for smart players who don't want to be explained what's happening and what button to press at each step of the way.The game takes the form of a small but open world in an abandoned mining settlement where tragedy has taken place. You roam, you observe, you desume. You have the ability to perceive what's beyond the world appearences and that makes you the only person for the job.The game is immersive and just enchanting, you will find yourself completely absorbed by the narrative. The puzzles are original and fit the plot, which is weird but interesting.Get it, play it.It's a little short, I solved it in less than 6 hours, but the experience was completely worth it.			"

												This game is more or less:10% Myst20% Dear Esther20% Gone Home50% Lovecraftian Horror MysteryNow the (non-spoilery) review:Let me begin by saying this game is right up my alley so I may be slightly biased in the positive direction. Graphics: This game is beautiful, and not just because of the extremely high quality visuals. This game does a better job using high fidelity graphics and environment design to create a deep sense of immersion and an engrossing atmosphere than any I've played in recent years except perhaps The Last of Us. The wind, weather effects, lighting, textures, richly detailed and expertly designed environments all work together perfectly to create an eerie, atmospheric and very ""real"" feeling world. 10/10Gameplay Design: Engaging mechanics of play isn't the reason to play this kind of game. For a game that claims to ""not do any hand holding"" most of the puzzles are♥♥♥♥♥♥easy, although some of them are pretty original and well executed. Other than that exploring semi-linear environments is the only way you directly interact with the games world. However it is a perfectly sufficient manner to get you through the primary draw of the game; the story and environment . 6.5/10Environment(lvl) Design: This is where the game really shines. I don't think I've ever played a game where the world felt so real. The placement of every rock, log, patch of grass, door, etc. is perfect, and the environments are detailed without feeling ""over done"". The visual reference point I keep coming back to is The Last of Us but while it was a beautiful game with excellent visual design the world did feel stylized. Ethan Carter on the other hand has many areas that feel like places I've actually been, so close in fact that it should be uncanny, but instead it just adds a whole other level of immersion and engagement, especially when they introduce supernatural elements.Specific praises include: How well they use visual highlighting to guide the player to places of interest (including both actual light, and the shape of the landscape). Excellent use of the outdoor environment to hide the borders of the levels, this place only has a few places that are straight up ""invisible walls"" but you only bump into them if you're doing things that don't make sense in the context of the game, and the word is so beautifully realized and expertly designed that you forget about them the minute you step back onto the path the game intends you to take. It guides you without it feeling like it's shoving you down a hallway, something that is incredibly difficult to do. 10/10 Story: It's pretty difficult to critique the story it in detail without spoiling it, but here goes. It's well presented, and it starts out very intriguing but I called the twist ending about a third of the way through and it's pretty steeped in the tropes of supernatural mystery. It's not terribly original, but the way you experience the story is novel and engaging enough to elevate it past the written words. 8/10Overall Experience: The game won't change the way you think about games, and it isn't quite as gut wrenching or mind bending as other similar games, but if you enjoy games like the only I likened it to, give it a look. It's beautiful, atmospheric, and genuinely intriguing and engaging (while you're playing it, once you have the full picture it loses some of it's magic).One last praise I had is how well it paces itself, and how it maintains an atmosphere of mystery and subtle horror without every being terrifying the way something like Outlast, or even Amnesia is. There where many times it could have taken a turn and thrown in a jump scare, or a tense stealth/chase sequence, but it choose to instead be morose, bittersweet, and contemplative, and I think the game is better for it. 8/10Bottom Line: 8/10			"

												Let's start off with the good side of things. The graphics, in short, are the best you can witness at this point in time. It is really a stunning looking game. I'm really surprised I can't actually smell the environment through my screen because it looks so beautiful. 10/10 - This really sets a bar, and simply needs to be experienced to be believed.Sound design is also exceptional. All the music and other auditory cues are timed very well and create a good atmosphere. I do feel that a lot of games get this right, though. Having played other games where atmosphere is important, I think developers realize that you just can't build a good immersive game without the proper auditory cues. This game makes great use of its music, sound effects, and just absolute, dead silence whenever necessary. It creates a very eerie atmosphere indeed.The story is very intriguing itself. It's got a nice, Bioshock level twist at the end. I do have to say that I expected this game to be a bit more focused on the ""horror"" aspect, and I found the story undermines it a little bit. It's hard to explain this without actually spoiling the story, but needless to say, I felt fairly confident that I'm unlikely to be in any actual threat, or at least the threats are going to be rather infrequent. It's not a bad story, though, in fact quite the contrary, it's a good story told very well. It just happens to miss the theme that I was expecting from the game. It's still very chilling as it progresses. It's just that you as a character are not participating in it, just observing it.Now on with the negatives.Steam will show that my play time for this game is about 3 hours or so. That's how long it really took to get through this game. Why is it so short? It makes it feel more like a minigame than a full fledged title. This short play time really makes me wish that the developers actually cut down some of the time they spent on the graphics and sunk more of it into creating an actual game. Pretty graphics are all well, but I want a good game.And that's another thing. This game can well be called an Eerie Walking Simulator. It's very minimalistic in almost all content that actually matters. It's a great experience, but it's so hard to actually call this a game. I think I would have felt no shame in just watching someone play it on youtube. It would spare me some of the backtracking if I just happened to miss one of the puzzles in the world, having to go back to it just to unlock the final narrative. I do like the fact that no one is holding your hand, however, and the fact that the world is, for the most part, open even if there is little of it.Overall, the experience is great, and the quality of execution is superb, but because of that, quantity suffers greatly. At 3-5 hours, you can easily finish it in one sitting even if you take your time to explore the environment. I'll recommend the game, but only if its on sale. I give it 7/10, just because of its length and the small amount of stuff to do in it. Despite the shortness, it's got a great story, great graphics, and great sound. If you can't get it on sale, watch it somewhere on youtube because it's worth at least that much.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is easily one of my most favorite games I've ever played. The music, the scenery, the exploration everything is truly captivating in a very strange world. You play as Paul Prospero trying to discover the mystery behind Red Creek Valley but one thing about this game is that where it leads you to, you will not expect it. This mystery game even says at the beginning that it will not hold your hand, you must find and solve the puzzles yourself and my advice is to always look around for the missing piece.Overall even though this game is short, everything is so captivating. I'd rate it a 9/10 missing 1 point only because you cannot save when you want to you must reach certain points in the story. Though I found a way around it by going back to where it last auto saved and reading around. Highly Recommended.			"

												One of the most dissapointing endings ever. And yes, in my opinion worse than Mass Effect 3's (Which wasn't that bad). Expect to get stuck for hours if you can't figure out the mechanic of finding out where certain objects are. When you see the same word many times keep moving untill they all come together. Knowing that would have saved me hours. Definetly not worth 20$ as if you know what your doing it could be completed in a hour. But pretty much everything besides that is great. Things are really misterious and surprising. The first minute is very scary. And it's cool that some of the people behind one of the most underated game of all time, Bulletstorm, made this. Next time, just don't screw up the ending. It makes everything you've done seem like a waste of time. 7/10			"

												This game is absolutely by far the best showcase for the dated Unreal Engine 3, so much so that I still have a hard time believing it really is using it. It really is astonishingly good-looking (honestly, you really have to see it to believe it) with excellent textures and almost photo-realistic landscapes and water and some lovely lighting effects. I was frequently stopping to admire the scenery.As for the game, it's an interesting variation on the concept of wandering around exploring rather than combat or action (the so-called ""walking simulator"" like Dear Esther or Gone Home) but with some nifty puzzles that once completed reveal more of the story. Unfortunately, if the game has any faults it is that the lack of any kind of hand-holding or tutorials at the start led me to being confused as to what I was actually supposed to be doing. And because the game is not linear and I was exploring rather than solving the puzzles then I found that my progress was not being saved (the game only saved on completion of puzzles rather than at specific points on the map, though this may have changed now with newer patches).Despite that, which may not be an issue for others, this is a very unusual, beautiful and relaxing game to play so it is hard not to recommend it.

												I'll admit it, I cried.If you like graphic adventure games, you'll definitely like Ethan Carter. Despite having one repetitive puzzle mechanic, there is enough here that varies it up and keeps it feeling fresh and interesting. Hands down the most beautiful game I've played from 2014.Aesthetically there's a lot here that might remind you of Stephen King, or maybe Lovecraft and other similar writers. So if you're into the sort of other worldly aesthetic they're known for, you'll probably enjoy this. A fantastically strange and personal story about a young boy's overactive imagination. I love it, but then again, I love these types of games. I hope you will too. "

												Pros:-A very beautiful game with stunning graphics-Interesting and wonderful story-Fantastic soundtrackCons:-The auto-save system is very scarce, so this makes it hard to play when you're in a hurry and don't have enough time to play, or if you just don't want to play for long.-If you don't pay attention or move to fast, you can easily miss huge chunks of the story, which is something I learned the hard way.Overall, this game is fantastic. It is absolutely beautiful and wonderful to look at, and the music fits perfectly with it. It is said at the very beginning that this game does not hold your hand, and that is very true, but it also means you have to inspect every little thing so you don't miss anything. The story is great and full of suspense and mystery, so I highly reccommend this game.			"

												Let's get this out of the way: this is a narrative-and-exploration-driven game. This is a downside for some people. Personally, I enjoy these games. This is, in my opinion, the ultimate of these games  out there. At least, the popular ones. I am sure someone who is more into these games than I am could rattle off a list of games that do this concept better.For me, Vanishing Ethan's Carter is a combination of an intriguing story, great visuals, great audio, interesting gameplay and novel mechanics. The biggest strength is clearly the game's visuals. The environements are incredible, high-res, and realistic. I cannot think of a time when I could even see tiling or repeating textures. Along with them, the sound design is great. The ambient noise and music lends a great atmospheric nature to the game.Another strength for me is the mechanics. The ""put the scene in order"" game is fun and novel, although sometimes difficult to understand why a part of a scene is represented by an object or in a location when, sometimes, that object or location is never seen in the final cinematic.The weakness in Carter's Vanishing Ethan is really more of a weak strength: the story. Don't get me wrong, it has several good twists. The problem I have is that it's confusing, particularly near the end. It feels like we needed a final ""put all the cinematics in order"" game to make sure I had the timeline right. Then there's the final twist which seems almost like a cop-out to me, but it has a lot of symbolism so it kind of gets away with it.Overall, this game is well-worth the money you put into it. If you enjoy exploration games, you will probably enjoy this. If you don't, consider getting it during a sale!			"

A Paladin’s Steam Review: The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. A Subtly Disturbing Yet Compelling Mystery Game.Genre: First Person Atmospheric Story Driven Mystery with Psychological Horror ElementsDeveloper & Publisher: The AstronautsPlatform Support: Windows, PS4. Mac & Linux ""Coming Soon"". Business Model: Base Game. Copy Purchased by MyselfOverall Gameplay ThoughtsVanishing comes very, very close to a Walking Simulator. There really isn’t a failure state, your actions don’t really affect the game in any meaningful way and the game expects you to experience a lot of it. The only influence you have is exploring the world of Red Creek Valley, solving the puzzles and, by extension, the mystery Paul Prospero is here to solve. Oh right, that’s the guy who you’re controlling and hear monologue as you explore the valley. So, you'll walk along at a fairly steady pace (there's a reasonably faster sprint as well), drink in the atmosphere while you search for clues of Ethan's whereabouts. All the while discovering that there's something creepy and sinister beneath the surface. Red Creek Valley is divided up into multiple areas, each containing a major puzzle or two for you to solve. Puzzles, for the most part, boil down to finding all the objects within a given area and figuring out how they all go together. The music playing in the background will clue you in on whether you’ve left the given area very subtly. Which is helpful because you’ll never need to leave an area in order to solve that particular puzzle. There aren’t any random items on the other side of the map that you have to find. It should be noted that it isn't required to solve these puzzle areas in any particular order, they can be done at any time. Outside of soaking in the sights and experiencing the strange events going on, there’s not much else to do. However, I always felt like I was involved. There wasn't any boring section I felt forced to walk through. It might help that Red Creek Valley appealed to me. Being able to see the burned out buildings, the rusted train cars and nature reclaiming the area, it really intrigued me. It's a feel of history and decay that Vanishing goes out of its way to really sell to the player. It feels like a real place and it’s setup like a real place. I think that helped me enjoy the game more. Atmosphere & JumpscaresThe atmosphere ate away at me. Slowly, creepily, I would sometimes jump at my phone beeping at me. It’s insidious how this game gets into your head. It makes you think something will jump out, scare you half to death and eat what remains of your sanity alive. Spoiler: that doesn’t happen. Except for one area, I’ll explain below. This isn’t a hardcore scare title like Amnesia: The Dark Descent. It’s far tamer by comparison while holding its own. I was often thinking that some dark fantasy creature such as Cthulhu was behind the scenes. It was amusing when that theory was half confirmed. The game will do its best to unnerve you. So long as you let it. There’s only one section of the map where jump scares are present. It’s in a mine and they sort of warn you that it’s coming. Sort of. And it’s mostly optional unless you want a 100% completion rating. At least, I’m fairly certain its optional. The scare is when you’re running around in a mining maze, searching for clues to open a large door in the center of it. In this area, is an undead miner who’s been cursed. While you’re walking around, if you hear a telltale noise you should immediately turn around and go the other way. Otherwise, BOO. You have to start from the beginning of the maze. PC Settings & OptimizationOptimization wise, this game leaves a bit to be desired. You will need to tweak your graphics options to get the best performance as running everything on high will drag the performance down hard. I noticed that Anti-Aliasing and Texture Filtering were the big performance hogs. Oh and there is constant texture loading, which will cause your game to “stutter” frequently as it loads them. This is a problem that affects a lot of computers and it’s immersion breaking. Additionally, if you’re not running a 16:9 resolution, the game will letterbox/pillarbox. Which I find to be frankly inexcusable for a native PC game to be this way. I can’t figure out why the devs didn’t scale the resolutions properly, it’s not like the Unreal engine can’t do it. PCGamingWiki has a installable solution to fix this as well as grant you multi-monitor and ultra-widescreen options. Additionally, while there is a proper Field-of-View slider in the options, (70-120) it crops the image in order to do it. Overall, while the game does run/scale well (and it does so long as you tweak about in the settings), the remaining problems are less excusable. Also, saving is only done in chunks so you might revert some of your actions when quitting and reloading. Redux Edition Quick ThoughtsI gave the Redux edition a quick run through and they seem to have fixed a lot of the problems the original game had. The micro-stutter is completely gone, there's no more pillarboxing as the resolution scales and performance generally seems to be better, if more taxing on machines. Saving is now done every time you act now too. FoV is still a crop effect but I'll let it be. There's also a bunch of tweaks and visual improvements added that you probably won't notice. There's no story difference between the two editions so if you can, play the redux. If that's too taxing, play the original. Kudos to the devs for doing this for free. Final ThoughtsThe atmosphere and mystery makes for a compelling experience. While it does have a lot of adventure/walking simulator aspects to it, it still keeps the player involved the entire time. The atmosphere of a decaying rural area known as Red River Valley is simply intriguing. The psychological horror just works so well. Jump scares are rare but there’s something that eats at you the entire time. When finished, the game will leave you with more questions than answers though not in the “find out in the sequel” sort of way. I should note that the characters are rather cliche but when I consider the ending, it works and feels intentional. Visually, the game looks superb and the audio is top notch. If you're looking for a fun mystery/exploration through a decaying rural area, give The Vanishing of Ethan Carter a go.Read This and More Like It on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

												An entertaining mystery/adventure game with a compelling narrative and striking visuals.You play Paul Prospero, the Philip Marlowe of the supernatural world, picking up one last case after receiving a letter from fellow mystic and absent-minded storyteller, the boy, Ethan Carter. He's vanished, so it's time to put that second-sight to use and track him down!Graphically the game is quite stunning, and when combined with an eerie and ominous score, lends itself to a genuine Lovecraftian atmosphere. There are moments where you may inexplicably look behind you.The puzzles aren't anything to write home about, and I thought, could have been more challenging, but they will immerse you in the story. The narrative is well paced, at no point did trudge on to the next scene wondering what I was doing. It felt as though I had sufficiently adventured by the time I reached the ending, which is certainly worth it, bringing your supernatural connection to the young Ethan Carver full circle.The whole thing will take about four hours, a little more if you go achievement hunting.Have fun!9/10 "

												One of the most dissapointing endings ever. And yes, in my opinion worse than Mass Effect 3's (Which wasn't that bad). Expect to get stuck for hours if you can't figure out the mechanic of finding out where certain objects are. When you see the same word many times keep moving untill they all come together. Knowing that would have saved me hours. Definetly not worth 20$ as if you know what your doing it could be completed in a hour. But pretty much everything besides that is great. Things are really misterious and surprising. The first minute is very scary. And it's cool that some of the people behind one of the most underated game of all time, Bulletstorm, made this. Next time, just don't screw up the ending. It makes everything you've done seem like a waste of time. 7/10			"

												This game is absolutely by far the best showcase for the dated Unreal Engine 3, so much so that I still have a hard time believing it really is using it. It really is astonishingly good-looking (honestly, you really have to see it to believe it) with excellent textures and almost photo-realistic landscapes and water and some lovely lighting effects. I was frequently stopping to admire the scenery.As for the game, it's an interesting variation on the concept of wandering around exploring rather than combat or action (the so-called ""walking simulator"" like Dear Esther or Gone Home) but with some nifty puzzles that once completed reveal more of the story. Unfortunately, if the game has any faults it is that the lack of any kind of hand-holding or tutorials at the start led me to being confused as to what I was actually supposed to be doing. And because the game is not linear and I was exploring rather than solving the puzzles then I found that my progress was not being saved (the game only saved on completion of puzzles rather than at specific points on the map, though this may have changed now with newer patches).Despite that, which may not be an issue for others, this is a very unusual, beautiful and relaxing game to play so it is hard not to recommend it.

												I'll admit it, I cried.If you like graphic adventure games, you'll definitely like Ethan Carter. Despite having one repetitive puzzle mechanic, there is enough here that varies it up and keeps it feeling fresh and interesting. Hands down the most beautiful game I've played from 2014.Aesthetically there's a lot here that might remind you of Stephen King, or maybe Lovecraft and other similar writers. So if you're into the sort of other worldly aesthetic they're known for, you'll probably enjoy this. A fantastically strange and personal story about a young boy's overactive imagination. I love it, but then again, I love these types of games. I hope you will too. "

												This game is more or less:10% Myst20% Dear Esther20% Gone Home50% Lovecraftian Horror MysteryNow the (non-spoilery) review:Let me begin by saying this game is right up my alley so I may be slightly biased in the positive direction. Graphics: This game is beautiful, and not just because of the extremely high quality visuals. This game does a better job using high fidelity graphics and environment design to create a deep sense of immersion and an engrossing atmosphere than any I've played in recent years except perhaps The Last of Us. The wind, weather effects, lighting, textures, richly detailed and expertly designed environments all work together perfectly to create an eerie, atmospheric and very ""real"" feeling world. 10/10Gameplay Design: Engaging mechanics of play isn't the reason to play this kind of game. For a game that claims to ""not do any hand holding"" most of the puzzles are♥♥♥♥♥♥easy, although some of them are pretty original and well executed. Other than that exploring semi-linear environments is the only way you directly interact with the games world. However it is a perfectly sufficient manner to get you through the primary draw of the game; the story and environment . 6.5/10Environment(lvl) Design: This is where the game really shines. I don't think I've ever played a game where the world felt so real. The placement of every rock, log, patch of grass, door, etc. is perfect, and the environments are detailed without feeling ""over done"". The visual reference point I keep coming back to is The Last of Us but while it was a beautiful game with excellent visual design the world did feel stylized. Ethan Carter on the other hand has many areas that feel like places I've actually been, so close in fact that it should be uncanny, but instead it just adds a whole other level of immersion and engagement, especially when they introduce supernatural elements.Specific praises include: How well they use visual highlighting to guide the player to places of interest (including both actual light, and the shape of the landscape). Excellent use of the outdoor environment to hide the borders of the levels, this place only has a few places that are straight up ""invisible walls"" but you only bump into them if you're doing things that don't make sense in the context of the game, and the word is so beautifully realized and expertly designed that you forget about them the minute you step back onto the path the game intends you to take. It guides you without it feeling like it's shoving you down a hallway, something that is incredibly difficult to do. 10/10 Story: It's pretty difficult to critique the story it in detail without spoiling it, but here goes. It's well presented, and it starts out very intriguing but I called the twist ending about a third of the way through and it's pretty steeped in the tropes of supernatural mystery. It's not terribly original, but the way you experience the story is novel and engaging enough to elevate it past the written words. 8/10Overall Experience: The game won't change the way you think about games, and it isn't quite as gut wrenching or mind bending as other similar games, but if you enjoy games like the only I likened it to, give it a look. It's beautiful, atmospheric, and genuinely intriguing and engaging (while you're playing it, once you have the full picture it loses some of it's magic).One last praise I had is how well it paces itself, and how it maintains an atmosphere of mystery and subtle horror without every being terrifying the way something like Outlast, or even Amnesia is. There where many times it could have taken a turn and thrown in a jump scare, or a tense stealth/chase sequence, but it choose to instead be morose, bittersweet, and contemplative, and I think the game is better for it. 8/10Bottom Line: 8/10			"

												Very enjoyable. One of those special productions that is more of an experience than just a game.  Stunning, reallistic and memory stirring visuals, I spent a lot of time just looking and being amazed at the detail.  The narrative and the way it is presented is somehow very realistic as well. Severl times I found myself reflecting on my own childhood as the story awoke old memories in me. The story is rather sad and a little unsettling; sort of like 'Twilight Zone' or, for those who can remember, 'Alcoa Presents'.  When you finish the game you won't be finished because you will be thinking of what happened and wondering if maybe you can talk to the writers about it. I didn't like the ""save game"" feature as you have no control over it. Also, a log of sorts that you could refer back to would have been helpful. As it stands, you need a good memory to recall the notes you find and the dialogue that transpires.			"

												Immediate beauty. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter strikes you right away with a vibrant naturalistic look. The trees sway in a sort of hazy wave-like motion and the bright colors of the forest grasps you, encompassing your entirety in its supreme beauty. There is a mystery in place, hints of darkness and a brooding sense of tragedy is at hand. The enigmatic atmosphere is accentuated by the fog and thickness of the flora, the hostility of nature looming towards us; and as we exit out of the tunnel, out of the darkness, onto a rail track, we are met with a frame, that of an almost clichéd photograph. It is the rail track that gives us a way forward, and it is the center-piece, but there is also the worn-down electricity line accompanied by the rusty rail track that gives us the same ruggedness as that of a lost and forsaken place. When the path veers off into the multitude, we truly understand the vastness of our task, the enigma that lies before us, the abrogation of our sense of security and bearing. It is in this murky following we move along the lines the synthesis between rot and beauty, and the  concept of beauty residing in the rotten, in the forgotten, the worn and forlorn, that The Vanishing of Ethan Carter gives us as its first impression. Musically the game conveys similar images, similar themes. A sort of mixture between dread and beauty underlies every moment of the game, that at times suddenly shoot out into excitement, and forces the player to move quicker, it becomes a signifier for changes in play. We are early on met with an astronaut that when we catch up to him, he vanishes to our discombobulation, but the music switches and we hear the sound of a reappearance in the distance, indicating now our new task to follow; to chase! The music elucidates the occult nature of our surrounding, making it a salient grabber of both or attention and curiosity.For our mission is often unclear, or veiled in the occult: there is no goal to be discerned throughout the start of this game, and what keeps us playing is for the most part the player's beguilement of the setting. We haplessly move forward due to small hints in front of us, even if it is but our immanent curiosity that leads the way. The anxiety that comes with choosing a path, or prioritizing different strains of curiosity, and in the process eliminating another (in a sense), is somehow palpable, since ignoring a path may lose out on a tangible story-element, or perhaps even the experience of a sublime beautiful scene; the potentiality of which is very real – as real as a potential contingency can be. The gameplay, however, is generally quite lacking, there is another type of game going on in our head. Firstly, we are trying to decipher what is going on, seeing patterns and hints at where things might be heading everywhere. There is a type of surrealist logic to the story that gives way for interpretation. It is the logic of a child that leads us in this story, in many ways. One that feels homely, one that gives us a way to see ourselves in the childish naivety of Ethan. There are these constant contrasts of reality contra belief, or imagination, that strikes us hard every time we go from a beautifully playful setting, with magic and space-travel, to the sloppily scribbled notes of a child in need of escapism, or the magical secret room juxtaposed with a broken down still. Secrecy gives way for imagination, the enigma gives us the reflection, and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter shines in this regard. The makers of this game knows how to engage the player in what is happening on screen, and this in spite of it being walking simulator-esque. But what my original point on this matter was, is that despite having little motor-control of your character, it heavily involves the real you in its puzzles and gameplay sessions. It heavily engages memory, imaginative and spatial skills to force the player to use mnemotechnical ways of thinking to achieve progress. The game gets you down to the level of this imaginative child and rips out any possibility of a vacant experiencing of this game. While the game has a process that goes on within the player, it does not suffer from complete unsubstantial gameplay. There are certain game-mechanics that the player gets to work with to figure out what really happened, what the actuality of this twofold story is. It is in the end a detective-story with a backbone of tragedy, and the game-mechanics reflect that. You have to inspect gruesome scenes of ritualistic murders, severed bodies and the like to find out what went on alongside the storytelling, and fix the memory or story of such a scene to render it complete. This story is all about finishing a story, game-play-wise and story-wise. When the smoke clears, in the midst of the mist, of what the story really is portraying, it hits you not without force. In the end you've been through a lot, the world is a knitted whole that feels perfectly melded into an experience that ultimately respected your time, for the most part. There are parts of the game where your objective is unclear, where your objective is well hidden in the lush forest, where you blindly try to stumble across the solution of a puzzle or a scene. But as a whole, there is no way to fault The Vanishing of Ethan Carter for these minor issues, that most likely will vary from person to person, depending on how attentive you are. The story has a lot in it, especially the one told from the child. There is frustration and hatred conflated with a sense of childlike wonder to be seen here, one that does have an emotional bone to it, that then is perfectly mirrored in the story as told from the detective's perspective. Herein lies not the most important game ever, or the best or most interesting, but a very well made, well told story with gameplay that suits it well. Everything has its place and suffers not from any contrivances. It is a finite, timely game, one that offer a fair bit of excitement, dread and compassion for the player, enough to warrant some – at least of my – time of remembrance, praise and appreciation.			"

												Not five minutes into this game, I had already taken at least twelve screenshots. The beauty of this game is striking and is something that will be mentioned in countless other reviews. Even though it may only take about 4-5 hours to finish, you may end up taking much longer than that because every few seconds you'd want to stop and stare at the scenery. Just make sure you don't spam your activity feed with screenshots of the whole game. No doubt you would be tempted to. Props must also be given to the sound in this game. Ambient sounds combined with brilliantly written music create the perfect atmosphere. They complement the environment making you feel wonder, awe or even terror. Apart from looking gorgeous, Ethan Carter tells a story that is very well written. As you progress through the game you will encounter puzzles of varying difficulty and upon solving them you uncover pieces of the story. Even though some aspects of Ethan's tale will no doubt be confusing (I was scratching my head at many scenes) it remains engaging throughout, leaving you itching to know what happens next. There are a few small issues I had with the game, nothing major. This is just me nitpicking. It is a very short game and the puzzles are not aplenty. Most of them I was able to solve easily. Only one or two required some serious thought. Nonetheless, they were all fun to do.At full price, Ethan Carter is $20. I paid half of that in the Winter Sale and it found it to be a great buy for what I paid. It's up to you if you want to pay full price for this very short indie title (Ignore the 30hrs I have clocked on Steam, I had gone out and forgot to exit the game) but if you do, I doubt you would regret it.

												This is a nice little mystery-solving game that you can easily complete in an afternoon. There are some great moments and set-pieces, and although the overall plot and especially ending left me a bit disappointed, the enviroments are (mostly) beautiful, and the puzzles are generally satisfying without being particularly difficult or annoying.  7/10.

												Perfect for what it wants to be, which is a supernatural, eerie mystery, with almost the most breathtaking graphics in a game.It's a bit short, and not very difficult, but the narrative and world design supplement the lack of challenge.It warns you that it doesn't hold your hand, and it rather takes that to an extreme.  There is no guidance of any sort, really.  And the world is full of intricately detailed places you don't need to go.  On the one hand, that feels realistic, and on the other hand, it can be a bit annoying.My only real complaint is the saving system.  You have to wait for an auto save, and that happens when you do something in the story, or after certain actions such as going on a lift or reading certain documents.  I don't see the point in not giving the player a manual save.  It's not as if you can die or even fail.Overall, great experience, if a bit short (I'll be honest, the length for this sort of experience is actually perfect).  An absolute joy to walk through its levels, and a compelling mystery and story.			"

												I heard of this game about two years ago. It wasn’t even footage at the time, more like a voiceover and a nice-looking picture. I have no idea why I decided right then and there “yes, this game is for me, I want to play it”, but I did and I was not wrong.There are many, many reasons you should play this game: the gorgeous graphics, the engaging storyline, the atmosphere, the ingenuity of the whole concept. It is short and dare I say relaxing, enaging your mind rather than your reflexes. There is no fighting and apart from a relatively small Amnesia-like horror section it is quite understated in its intensity.If you want thoughtful, deep exploration of a secluded, supernatural location right out of the weird fictions of H.P.Lovecraft, you can't get much better than this game.10/10 and I can't wait to see what The Astronauts do next.

												While I was venturing through the creepy forests, I was asking myself if it would not be better to leave this whole thing here to a detachment of Marines, but then again, I did feel somewhat responsible to find out what happened to Ethan. Sure, I still preferred to have some Marines with me, but I wasn't even sure anymore if the realm I was in was real, or unreal (oh, btw, game uses Unreal Graphics Engine). I was able to solve the first puzzle regarding a dead guy (CSI style), then, I thought I was too smart for this game, until I reached the next puzzle. Youtube could save my intelligence there a bit, so I was able to solve the problem, thanks to youtube, but I was smart enough to know where to find answers when you need them, so that doesn't make me that stupid.I am now heck who knows how long into the game, saved a few additional puzzles and all I can say is, to be honest, I have no idea. So let me list the Cons and Pros.By the way, if you are a COD or BF fanboy, I think this game is nothing for you, you are able to throw a hand grenade into a lake at one point for no reason, that is all about the action you will get up to my point.Pros:- You jump up from your chair a few times, scary moments....especially if you are a weakling like me that was too afraid to play Dead Space 2 and other such horror games when being over 30 years of age.- Graphics if your rig can support max graphics is nearly RL.- You think of Marines being brought in any second, but it doesn't happen. Game suceeds in adding creepyness.- You are able to ride a small train over severed legs.- You feel like being some serious CSI dude after a while.- You have no idea what the heck is going on, but things start adding themselves together, however, apparently there is still something very, very, very bad awaiting me, it also has a name from a horror movie, I am still hoping Marines to be able to come to help later on in the game.- You reading this and giving me a LIKE.- Price: it is good atm for what the game is, truly.- Good few hours of your lifetime spent.Cons- Save system does not exist, just an auto-save that saves after major events like solving a murder case. So play this game ONLY if you know you can spare about 1 hour, otherwise you gota do the whole thing over.- No Marines so far.- No weapons unless a hand grenade that you find, if you find it. There was an option for me to throw it into the lake, so I threw it... I hope I was not dumb enough to have wasted the grenade, because the more I play this game, the more I feel like I will be needing that grenade in the end... oh well. They could have at least throw in a pistol with some ammo, would have felt saver at least...- Space key is useless. You cannot jump in the game. For a gamer that uses since 20 years the space key to jump, that is serious business. I still kept pressing it tho all the time and nothing happened.So, let's see how this continous, the reason I am writing this is because I just solved another murder case, so finally the auto-save worked (if it did, you do not even see if it did save or not), anyway, gota take a dump now and then walk my dog, yeah just get the game and play it.

												A narrative without hand holding indeed.  I thought this one was well worth the $12 during the Steam holiday sale.  It took me about five hours to see it all, which included some wandering where I was just stuck but not enough to be frustrating.  The game actually did a really good job ending one mystery in the general vicinity of the next, so that you weren't completely lost but also didn't receive any flashing arrows.  I like that the over-arching story makes you think and doesn't even give away exactly what happened.  There is some room for interpretation.			"

												From the moment I saw the trailer to this game I was hooked. Rapt. Pierced through the heart by the harpoon of mystery and dragged beneath the turbulent waters of unfathomable horror, and I enjoyed every white-knuckled second of it.  I'm not going to spoil anything for you, but from what I can say about the story, the protagonist, Paul Prospero emerges from a tunnel, through a portal into Red Creek Valley, and things just get weirder from there. While I'm not one to gush about visuals and atmosphere of a game, this particular game manages to take superlativeness to a whole new level when it comes to looks and atmosphere.The setting, the fine details had me on my toes literally from the first minute, and had me asking a lot of questions come the end of the first 'sensory' scene. The kinds of questions that gnaw at your sense of comfort and stability, eat away at your confidence in the mundanity of reality. I particularly loved the way the game handles its doses of startle and fright, getting the dosage in that sweet spot that makes your stomach backflip whenever you hear the strings twang or the sound of an otherworldly moan. One little segment of the game in particular scared me in a way I haven't been since the original STALKER, and to a far better degree might I add. Until today I have never dreaded the thought of being in a cave underground as much as I do now. I am scarred for life and I have never enjoyed the experience more.There are only two drawbacks to this game that I can think of: The first is its length. Entirely forgivable given the amount of work that has clearly gone into making the game. The second is the way the game's progression can be obfuscated at times. While a horror game is rarely enhanced by extra degrees of handholding, surely a game with such wonderfully written narration and oodles of interleaved details in all of its backstory could tell us how to use Paul's abilities through his own words, and maybe, just maybe, make a few of the more difficult items/doors/buttons/etc. a teensy bit easier to find?But other than those two tiny things I have yet to enjoy a single horror game more than I've enjoyed this interactive story. Worth every penny you pay for it.			"

												My first impression of the original 'The Vanishing of Ethan Carter' was not positive. I was not pleased with the unfriendly checkpoint autosave system, the general lack of clear instructions, and the linearity of the game (to trigger the autosave points) despite the game claiming it doesn't hold your hand. While I was very impressed with the beautiful graphics rendered on the Unreal Engine 3 and the game's use of music and ambient sounds to set the spine-chilling mood, I quickly gave up on it.The Astronauts then tweaked the game based on gamers' feedback and updated it to run on Unreal Engine 4. I decided to give the game another chance, and I'm glad I did. The improvements that the designers made resulted in a more playable game, mainly because of a better autosave system. The claim of not holding the player's hand remains an issue for me because to me, in order to get the most out of the game narrative-wise, the player should solve all puzzles, perhaps even sequentially, so he/she can see how all events and character motivations fit together. Without some form of hand holding, looking for the next puzzle at times feels like looking for a needle in the haystack. If it weren't for a published walkthrough, I would have missed two sets of puzzles altogether.Nitpicking aside, the revamped autosave system means no need to backtrack to save your game as in the original version, and that itself makes the redux version more playable and less infuriating to play. Furthermore, the graphics in the new version are GORGEOUS. Never have I spent so much time taking in-game screenshots. Thank goodness 'Ethan Carter' is full of quiet moments that allow you to soak in its gorgeous vistas.'The Vanishing of Ethan Carter' turns out to be more supernatural than I anticipated. It feels tonally inconsistent at first, but as the player unravels more of the mystery, this inconsistency starts to make sense even thought one particular scary part sticks out like a sore thumb gameplay-wise. Overall, 'The Vanishing of Ethan Carter Redux' feels and plays like a really good M. Night Shyamalan movie, and it has won me over with the improvements the developers have made. I highly recommend those who gave up on the original like I did to give the game another try.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is eerie.Let's start with the story. You play Paul Prospero, a paranormal detective answering fan mail from one Ethan Carter, a 12 year from Red Creek Village, WI. When you arrive, you realize something is awry as you find a railcar with blood sprayed on the front and a pair of legs not far behind it. The rest of the corpse is nearby. Now you get to investigate and look into the dark world of the Carter family and you start to realize just how insane they are. Without spoiling anything, let me just say that the further you progress, the more you'll realize about what's really going on.On the technical side of things, the graphics are stunning. I mean, perhaps some of the best graphics in a video game I've seen to date. The atmosphere is, as stated, eerie. The plant and tree life are highly detailed. The water looks amazing. Basically, everything looks amazing. Even the sun, you don't get terrible sun shafts, instead the sun shines naturally, it's great. Gameplay is rather simple, you explore for clues and put together pieces while uncovering memories.I really liked this game. It's short, but once you uncover everything, it's kind of shocking, but at the same time not that surprising.9.2/10			"

												The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter is a game where you play as a psychic detective who is investigating a case in Red Creek Valley. It's a forsaken and gloomy place where tragic and mysterious events have unfolded which you have to put together piece by piece. Like in a good detective story, we have a narrator, the protagonist Paul Prospero himself, as he reflects on his previous cases and the little that he got to know from the letter from a boy called Ethan Carter. The storytelling is superb in this game, the scrip is very well written and the voice acting is true to life. Every sentence said carries a meaning and enhances the whole experience. Now, the thing that got me jumping off my stool with this game were the graphics. The beauty of the scenery is breathtaking. It's this lush overgrown countryside in early autumn where the trees have red and yellow leaves on them already but the weather still holds. All the time there's a light breeze which makes the trees and grass sway in a lazy manner and they found just the right sound to go with it. I could literally start sensing the odours of the countryside, that's how powerful the experience was. The gameplay is simple but original. You interact with some items and pick up others but the way they're connected with the psychic abilities of Paul Prospero makes it a whole new experience. The puzzles are tough at times and need focus, I even made notes on sticky paper here and there to keep track, but at least they fall in the same box and have a sense of consistency to them.If the beauty of scenery is something that matters to you then I highly recommend this game. If it doesn't, then it's still loaded with good puzzles and a kickass storytelling. Highly recommended. "

												Immediate beauty. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter strikes you right away with a vibrant naturalistic look. The trees sway in a sort of hazy wave-like motion and the bright colors of the forest grasps you, encompassing your entirety in its supreme beauty. There is a mystery in place, hints of darkness and a brooding sense of tragedy is at hand. The enigmatic atmosphere is accentuated by the fog and thickness of the flora, the hostility of nature looming towards us; and as we exit out of the tunnel, out of the darkness, onto a rail track, we are met with a frame, that of an almost clichéd photograph. It is the rail track that gives us a way forward, and it is the center-piece, but there is also the worn-down electricity line accompanied by the rusty rail track that gives us the same ruggedness as that of a lost and forsaken place. When the path veers off into the multitude, we truly understand the vastness of our task, the enigma that lies before us, the abrogation of our sense of security and bearing. It is in this murky following we move along the lines the synthesis between rot and beauty, and the  concept of beauty residing in the rotten, in the forgotten, the worn and forlorn, that The Vanishing of Ethan Carter gives us as its first impression. Musically the game conveys similar images, similar themes. A sort of mixture between dread and beauty underlies every moment of the game, that at times suddenly shoot out into excitement, and forces the player to move quicker, it becomes a signifier for changes in play. We are early on met with an astronaut that when we catch up to him, he vanishes to our discombobulation, but the music switches and we hear the sound of a reappearance in the distance, indicating now our new task to follow; to chase! The music elucidates the occult nature of our surrounding, making it a salient grabber of both or attention and curiosity.For our mission is often unclear, or veiled in the occult: there is no goal to be discerned throughout the start of this game, and what keeps us playing is for the most part the player's beguilement of the setting. We haplessly move forward due to small hints in front of us, even if it is but our immanent curiosity that leads the way. The anxiety that comes with choosing a path, or prioritizing different strains of curiosity, and in the process eliminating another (in a sense), is somehow palpable, since ignoring a path may lose out on a tangible story-element, or perhaps even the experience of a sublime beautiful scene; the potentiality of which is very real – as real as a potential contingency can be. The gameplay, however, is generally quite lacking, there is another type of game going on in our head. Firstly, we are trying to decipher what is going on, seeing patterns and hints at where things might be heading everywhere. There is a type of surrealist logic to the story that gives way for interpretation. It is the logic of a child that leads us in this story, in many ways. One that feels homely, one that gives us a way to see ourselves in the childish naivety of Ethan. There are these constant contrasts of reality contra belief, or imagination, that strikes us hard every time we go from a beautifully playful setting, with magic and space-travel, to the sloppily scribbled notes of a child in need of escapism, or the magical secret room juxtaposed with a broken down still. Secrecy gives way for imagination, the enigma gives us the reflection, and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter shines in this regard. The makers of this game knows how to engage the player in what is happening on screen, and this in spite of it being walking simulator-esque. But what my original point on this matter was, is that despite having little motor-control of your character, it heavily involves the real you in its puzzles and gameplay sessions. It heavily engages memory, imaginative and spatial skills to force the player to use mnemotechnical ways of thinking to achieve progress. The game gets you down to the level of this imaginative child and rips out any possibility of a vacant experiencing of this game. While the game has a process that goes on within the player, it does not suffer from complete unsubstantial gameplay. There are certain game-mechanics that the player gets to work with to figure out what really happened, what the actuality of this twofold story is. It is in the end a detective-story with a backbone of tragedy, and the game-mechanics reflect that. You have to inspect gruesome scenes of ritualistic murders, severed bodies and the like to find out what went on alongside the storytelling, and fix the memory or story of such a scene to render it complete. This story is all about finishing a story, game-play-wise and story-wise. When the smoke clears, in the midst of the mist, of what the story really is portraying, it hits you not without force. In the end you've been through a lot, the world is a knitted whole that feels perfectly melded into an experience that ultimately respected your time, for the most part. There are parts of the game where your objective is unclear, where your objective is well hidden in the lush forest, where you blindly try to stumble across the solution of a puzzle or a scene. But as a whole, there is no way to fault The Vanishing of Ethan Carter for these minor issues, that most likely will vary from person to person, depending on how attentive you are. The story has a lot in it, especially the one told from the child. There is frustration and hatred conflated with a sense of childlike wonder to be seen here, one that does have an emotional bone to it, that then is perfectly mirrored in the story as told from the detective's perspective. Herein lies not the most important game ever, or the best or most interesting, but a very well made, well told story with gameplay that suits it well. Everything has its place and suffers not from any contrivances. It is a finite, timely game, one that offer a fair bit of excitement, dread and compassion for the player, enough to warrant some – at least of my – time of remembrance, praise and appreciation.			"

												I heard of this game about two years ago. It wasn’t even footage at the time, more like a voiceover and a nice-looking picture. I have no idea why I decided right then and there “yes, this game is for me, I want to play it”, but I did and I was not wrong.There are many, many reasons you should play this game: the gorgeous graphics, the engaging storyline, the atmosphere, the ingenuity of the whole concept. It is short and dare I say relaxing, enaging your mind rather than your reflexes. There is no fighting and apart from a relatively small Amnesia-like horror section it is quite understated in its intensity.If you want thoughtful, deep exploration of a secluded, supernatural location right out of the weird fictions of H.P.Lovecraft, you can't get much better than this game.10/10 and I can't wait to see what The Astronauts do next.

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a really nice looking and sounding game that takes around 5 hours to finish. Its surreal story is reasonably original and will keep the player interested for the duration of the game.This type of game requires good immersion to be successful and fortunately it delivers in this regard. Its atmosphere is one of semi-constant uneasiness which will keep you on your toes as you explore its ominous locales.The main mechanism to advance the story is basically to stumble upon a mystery as you make your way across the setting and solve a few basic puzzles in order to figure out what happened. Said mysteries can be solved in any order.Some cons of the game are the checkpoint save system and some stuttering issues. Besides these, the game is smooth as a 25 year old Rum Zacapa.All in all, it's atmospheric and aesthetically pleasing but with some shortcomings, especially its short duration. Give it a go if you like narrative-driven games. Definitely one of the best looking games to date imho. "

												Perfect for what it wants to be, which is a supernatural, eerie mystery, with almost the most breathtaking graphics in a game.It's a bit short, and not very difficult, but the narrative and world design supplement the lack of challenge.It warns you that it doesn't hold your hand, and it rather takes that to an extreme.  There is no guidance of any sort, really.  And the world is full of intricately detailed places you don't need to go.  On the one hand, that feels realistic, and on the other hand, it can be a bit annoying.My only real complaint is the saving system.  You have to wait for an auto save, and that happens when you do something in the story, or after certain actions such as going on a lift or reading certain documents.  I don't see the point in not giving the player a manual save.  It's not as if you can die or even fail.Overall, great experience, if a bit short (I'll be honest, the length for this sort of experience is actually perfect).  An absolute joy to walk through its levels, and a compelling mystery and story.			"

Compared to other similar titles.My initial reaction to the game play and interaction with the world was: OH yes. Please more! Moar!After having completed the game I can say it was one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had in video gaming period.Having known what I know now I would have paid much more for the game. Totes worth $8.00Only draw back? The development studio responsible for this gem only have one on steam. This game is quite short comparative to other titles. If it had been done any differently it would have taken away from the game. I have literally no critiques to give.Make moar games. Get moar games on steam. I will buy and play them.Side note: This game would be totally epic with oculus rift or a VM ware.			"

												TVEC is an extraordinarily immersive game that succeeds by providing the player a fascinating abandoned world to explore. The landscape and buildings seem to be of a time and place one can't easily pin down, though the setting is somewhere in the modern day USA. I was reminded of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. by lonely hills, forests, and tunnels that may or may not be haunted. The supernatural exploration detective game Betrayer comes to mind as well as the paranormal investigator protagonist combs the terrain for clues. The story is hit or miss. I had a hard time buying into the story, but I was familiar with the type of tale being told. The incorporation of certain horror literature elements were rather well done but it was the interpersonal family dynamics that weren't as convincing as they could have been. The ""twist"" ending (depending on your point of view) wasn't very profound and the idea of ghosts ""letting go"" alternately fascinates and bores me. It was done reasonably well in Betrayer, dealing with cursed souls, and handled rather clumsily in Murdered: Soul Suspect, which over-relied on the concept. If all that is appealing to you, buy the game at full price - it will be worth it. If on the other hand, you're marginally interested in a game of a different pace than your usual frenetic adventure games, buy it on sale. Either way, I'm confident it will be money well spent.			"

												I love games that involve casual exploration through expansive natural environments, but this game taught me an early lesson that they sometimes hide plot-vital triggers off in the woods. By the end, they will help you find what you missed, but I did not know that at the beginning. For much of the game I was so worried about potentially walking past an investigation point that I could not simply enjoy the wind and the sun setting through the trees. Since the world is very large and interest areas are spread out, it would have been nice to get some sort of audio cue that I was close to one. The developers clearly know about using music to set the mood, it would have been nice to go the next step.			"

												This game was amazing! If you like puzzles that don't hold your hand and just give you the world, this is for you! The world is beautiful, and the puzzles are hard. If you miss anything for a puzzle or scene as the game calls it, it won't stop you. Just later on you will have to redo or complete it. I know that from experience, but luckily it was only one and it was very short. You have to be very opened eyed or explorative to find some of the clues or items. A few had me stuck for a while. The only gripe I had with this game is the save system. If you haven't completed a scene or have gotten a clue it will not save. I had found a work around for this but it was later in the game, when you get on the elevator and move and get off it saves. For example you just get in press ""up"" then ""stop"" then ""down"" it will save. All in all I really liked the game and would definitly recommend this game to friends.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is an amazing story-driven game, in which you travel through Red Creek Valley, solving mysterious killings along the way. You take the role of Paul Prospero, a supernatural detective set out to find the titular Ethan Carter. The game starts with the words:  This is a narrative experience that does not hold your hand . This is very true. You are put right into the world with no real introduction whatsoever, and you just have to figure out what's going on. Not that the game does a bad job of explaining itself, and since there's very few mechanics, you will learn quickly. You immediately get feeling that something very wierd has happened, and as the plot unfolds, more questions will be asked than answered.The graphics is absolutely gorgeous. the sound and the voice acting is also very well done. The game took me about 3½ hours to complete.I can not recommend this game to anyone, though. You will spend most of the time just walking from a to b, and and someone who requires some action to keep them entertained, this might be a bit boring. But if you, like me, enjoy just experiencing the world, and the story, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is certainly the game for you.			"

Only because of the short play time, I can't recommend this game at full price.  But, if you see it on sale, you should pick it up.  I paid $12 and I feel like I got my money's worth.  If they came out at $10 buck a pop, I'd probably buy a dozen games like this.Note: I actually played the Redux version.  But for some reason I can't write a review for that version.

												This game is definitely worth the money you pay for it. It has a wonderful, if not short, story filled with creepy vibes, strange twist and heavy cult-like symbolisms throughout the game. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter takes a wonderful approach to story telling wherein the protagonist, Paul Prospero, looks for 'clues'  to solve puzzles related to the Carter family and their ties to this strange place known as Red Creek Valley. By the end of it all, you'll be asking yourself what just happened and trying to go back and understand just how this tragic event for the Carter family came to pass. If there's one game to try this holiday season, this is it.			"

I was excited to play through each episode (complete walk through is on my YouTube channel ""Remmasta""). The graphics are absolutely breathtaking! I stopped more than a few times just to take in the detail that went into developing the game. Walk across the train bridge about midway and look down, take in the way the waves that are below. Walk up to the bridge posts and see how detailed the rust marks are, the paint chipping away is. This is an absolutely STUNNING graphic masterpiece that is also a great game to play. Definitely invest in this game. It will make you rethink on how a game should be.			"

You play as Paul Prospero a pyschic detective who has shown up in the town of Red Rock to find a young fan who has dissappeared. The game is about exploration, and discovery. As you explore about you will come upon bodies who you will then try to piece together how they died. If you are a fan of Sherlock, its basically the same concept of finding the obvious and not so obvious clues and then placing events in chronological order and watching the crime unfold.

												A beautiful environment, eerie, lonely, mysterious.The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a game for people looking to waste a few hours taking in the incredible scenery, walking around, doing some basic puzzling, and taking a ton of screenshots.While minimalistic, the story is a nice take on the detective genre, and keeps you entertained throughout.

												I like it and I don't.  I just finished it, and what I wrote above is all I can think about it. I do not want to give away to much because this game is all about the experience and the  ""I figured it out myself rush kind of feeling"" . But in the end, I am dissapointed. Are the answers to my questions about what this game's story is about that simple? To me, storywise, it was anticlimactic.All and all, graphics are very very nice and the game is well made (and if I look at it, not from my personal opinion point of view, but in a general way, the story is okay and it works).If you like detective games / puzzle solving. This game could be for you.If you want fast action paced games. This game is probally not for you.Tip:   the second Mines part (it can be cool, but)  is awfull. Save yourself a grumpy game evening or two and just look up how to solve it.			"

												It took me a leisurely 5 hours to complete the game; it is relatively short and the plot is fairly straight-forward (although it might not always seem so).  The game draws some limited inspiration from Lovecraft, but not too much.  Both the game's tone and visuals remind me of Dear Esther, but with a real plot and puzzles.  Unfortunately the game does rely on an abudance of exploration to find all the clues--which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing if the map wasn't as large and linear (taking a LONG time to walk to the other side of the map).  Some plot elements are placed well off the main pathways and can require a keen eye (and luck) to discern.  On a scale from 1 to 10, I'd give this game around a 7.  Visually, it is stunning.  The story unfolds in a compelling manner and MOST of the puzzles are fair and help push the narrative.  Unfortunately some puzzles are too simple, while one in particular can be extremely difficult and is not coherently presented within the narrative.  It is a short game, but well worth picking up.  If you have a GPU capable of running the Redux version, don't even bother with the ""original"" game.  FWIW, I found the game's conclusion to be satisfying--YMMV.Pros:Beautiful graphics (Redux version)Interesting plotNice soundtrackCons:Some critical data is located far off the obvious pathways.At least one ""puzzle"" (house portals) is not presented logically within the plot and can be dificult to discern what is required.The map is fairly huge and can require time consuming trips from one end to the other if you missed something (which is likely).

												The game is very very well presented and the crime solving element was very very cool. However the intersting crime solving mechanic devolves after the first two and stops being an exercise in observation and ellimination, which was incredibly satisfying, and instead becomes very linear. I loved this part of the game up until this point.That, however, is the only problem I have with the game. Great visuals, great story, very intelligent puzzle solving situations, great atmosphere and nice mechanics. Think Alan Wake, Gone Home and Dear Esther wrapped into one, but handled much better than the afore mentioned. It is fairly short and can be completed very quickly, but it is a good ride while it lasts.If you're looking for a good story, a great sense of creeping horror and a game that treats its audience like intelligent people, then pick this up in a heart beat.

												This is a beautiful game, with interesting puzzels and a semi-open world to wander about in. I found the main story to be interesting and enjoyable, but I was baffeled by some minor story arcs that seemed, at first, to be random tangents, but that I latter realized were subtle clues (perhaps too subtle) about the nature of the main story.The only drawback for me, is that once the game is complete with all of the puzzels solved and the story concluded, there is little reason to play the game again. Yes, the game is beautiful, but the story unfolds the same regardless of what order you encounter it and its minor sub-plots. I enjoyed this game and recommend it, but due to the lack of replayability, I think most folks will enjoy this game more if they buy it on sale or receive it as a gift.			"

												Graphically beautiful, some good voice acting, challenging puzzles, And probably one of the best stores I've ever experienced in a game. Ther's not much to hate about this game.My only gripe is the games length. It only took me about 2 and a half hours to complete.  Now, It does a lot in this short time, tells the story it wants to and leaves it at that, and does a great job with it.However, I'm not certain it warrents the $20 price tag. Normally a game of this length you'll find for aroung $5-$10. Does the outstanding quality of this game justify the higher price? Perhaps, I suppose that's up to the individual player. For me, I would have been much more satisfied with maybe a $15 price.Picing issues aside, This game is still worth getting, and you will find much to love about it.			"

												This is a beautiful game. Beautiful in terms of its music, its ambience, and most definitely its graphics. And in terms of its appeal, it is definitely one of those ""Walking Simulators"" you've heard about.There's certainly actual concrete ""gameplay"" here, but it is light and never really what keeps you playing. You also don't really have to worry about death or failure in any way, at worst puzzles simply reset your position.Beyond simply exploring, the other main draw is the series of unique and interesting vignettes that offer a small self-contained 'experience' when you encounter them. These, in addition to investigating the scenes of the murders in the own, offer the concrete gameplay of Ethan Carter.The game has you playing paranormal detective Paul Prospero as he searches for a lost boy in a small town that reeks of death and the occult... and that's about as deep as I'll go before I'd inadvertantly start dropping plot spoilers. If the player character and plot premise sounds somewhat flimsy and weak, setting you up as a cornier pacifist version of Harry Dresden... you wouldn't be wrong. Infact that's definitely the major flaw of the plot for me, the premise was so paper thin at points that later plot twists didn't end up being twists for me. The plot had made itself transparent in very major ways so that the ending simply ended up as ""Oh, that seems about right. Yes."" rather than anything mindblowing.Graphically this game is stunning. It uses phototelemetry to build up 3D versions of actual objects using a multitude of photographs and the result is actually pretty mindblowing. Though sadly it means the parts of the graphics that have to use conventional methods, folliage and characters... well they can't measure up at all.The game is so scenic that simply exploring the town and the surrounding woods becomes a mesmerising experience, helped along by some really beautiful atmospheric music.The actual puzzles in the game arn't really that great, generally revolving around you solving murders by finding relevant objects (which can turn into a bit of a blind hunt at times) and ordering the sequence of events by way of psychic memories left in the enviroment. This ends up being a combination of trial and error and obviousness. There's at least one of them so easy to solve that you're simply ordering them 1 to 10 in a straight line.In terms of content this game has horror underpinning with strong references to the Cthulhu Mythos. There is a fair amount of gore present in the murders, but generally no other life so it never really graduates from 'creepy' to 'scary' with the possible of one segment of the game.Minor spoilers below meant for those that care about the level of 'scariness':That segment, while not one you can die in, does feature moderate jump scares as well as a non-lethal 'threat' that will reset your progress slightly.This game is relatively short, clocking in at around 3-4 hours of playtime (which may make the non-sale price steep for many), but offers something unique and memorable. The main draw for me was a combination of exploration and the unique vignettes, so I'd class The Vanishing of Ethan Carter as more of a short experience than a 'game'. Sadly the story fell just short of engaging me due to it playing its hand earlier than it intended to, but I'd still recommend this game any time it is on sale.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter tells a very sad story of a boy who creates his own world. The gameplay is simple, but the puzzles are difficult and the best thing to take away aside from the great story is the scenery.

I would thouroughly recommend this game to anyone and everyone, if only for the beautiful artwork and scenery.			"

												Note: I played the Redux version of the game, which was redone for Unreal Engine 4, and is added to your library automatically when purchasing this standard version.Beautiful.By FAR the most beautiful gaming experience available. Screenshots from regular gameplay look nearly photo-realistic. Even if this game didn't have any story, wandering around in the scenery enjoying the landscape would be sufficient for me to recommend this game. It's truly a marvel of graphic design for a video game.With the simple beauty of the game out of the way, there is an actual story as well. This is a mystery themed walking-sim with a few horror-esque elements thrown in (although it's certainly not horror focused). Learning the story as you go can be a bit confusing, but when the ending cutscene played, the whole story finally came together and made sense. It was definitely well told, and a strongpoint of the game as a whole.There are some ""puzzle"" elements, however these are closer to ""find the thing"" rather than what I would call a ""puzzle"" (with maybe a couple exceptions) (which isn't necessarily bad). The gameplay is not difficult, nor are the puzzles, so don't come in expecting a challenge.This IS a walking sim, so the main point is to explore, discover, and investigate as you uncover more of the landscape and the story.I also need to mention the soundtrack is also great, and definitely enhances the experience, although note the soundtrack is largely atmospheric, so barring a couple exceptions of a few specific songs, you probably won't be going to download and/or listen to the soundtrack as standalone music (unless you're into more atmospheric music).Overall, in my eyes, this is the golden standard for a walking a sim. Absolutely the best graphics, and thus some of the best atmosphere compared to quite literally any other game in existence. Great story telling, no hand holding, no restriction on exploration (barring the edges of the maps), and a great pacing and overall length.It's short enough that you could complete the game completely in one extended sitting, but it will more likely take 2 or 3 sittings to fully complete. As far as walking sims go, I would consider this a good length, although some people may call this short (I doubt anyone could get much more than maybe 8 hours, probably more realistically around 4-6 hours).Honestly, this game is worth it just for the graphics, and to revel in its beauty and see just how far gaming has come. Just look up gameplay screenshots and you'll see what I mean.			"

Product received for free
												A walking simulator and a simple puzzle game with beautiful landscapes and atmospheric music. It is not obvious what needs to be done at first but after a couple of puzzles it becomes more clear what to look for.  Due to the amount of walking involved you'd better permanently hold the shift key to move at reasonable speed and only stop from time to time to search for clues and admire views. Recommended as a relaxing laid back game. The big dowside is that the game can't be saved by the player, there are only autosaves (usually after each completed section/ unlocked achievement) so if you're not sure if you have time to solve the next puzzle you'd better exit the game and not waste time walking as the next time you'll be brought back to the end of a completed puzzle.+ graphics+ music and sound effects+ story- only autosaves- some puzzles not clear enough (no tutorials/ hints), some repetitive - no replay value			"

												I've been following the development of this game since it was originally announced and it’s absolutely everything I hoped it would be and more. Gorgeous, skillfully created and executed, THE VANISHING OF ETHAN CARTER is easily my favorite game of this year so far. The music and aesthetic is haunting and cold, the entire experience atmospheric. Exploring Red Creek Valley is probably one of the most unsettling and tense things I've ever done in any game. If you’re a fan of Adam Arkapaw’s cinematography on TRUE DETECTIVE and TOP OF THE LAKE, this is the game for you, because every moment in the game feels like walking through an Arkapaw shot.			"

												At first, I was a bit worried by the somewhat cheesy lines delivered in the opening sequence by our intrepid detective 'Paul Prospero', but it didn't take long for these concerns to diminish and to become engrossed by the amazing visuals, music and story in this game.  The game crafts a rich atmosphere that feels very considered.  As it turned out there's a reason for the detective's manner of speaking that is part of the story but that is in spoiler territory as to why.  The rest of the writing and voice acting is superb (especially Ethan's).I like to call the game a supernatural, first-person, narrative-driven, detective adventure game.  The environments are like nothing you've seen in a game before.  Despite how well they're crafted they took extra care to make it 'feel' real with wind through the grass and trees and leaves blowing in the breeze.  At the same time, the environment is completely devoid of people and animals (except for the puzzles) which makes it feel lonely and a little creepy and sinister.  I would've liked to see a few animals like birds to add to the realism but not too many to detract from the general vibe.  I highly recommend playing this game at night with either good speakers or headphones to experience the atmosphere to its fullest.The puzzles mostly revolve around establishing the sequence of events of various murders you find around the game.  On one occasion I had to consult a guide to understand why I couldn't solve it (the hidden room puzzle) but once I figured out that there were options I wasn't seeing it was easy enough.  If I had any criticism here I'd say the game can feel a bit 'walking simulator' at times, but with visuals this good I didn't mind that much.  On a technical level I noticed the standard version of the game was fairly jerky on my laptop but the remastered version played smoothly, so best to stick with the update.I'd say it’s a 4 to 5-hour game at normal pace, more for intrepid explorers, wanderers or the snap-happy and less for the 'efficient' or impatient.  Sure you could watch a play through on YouTube but you'd be denying yourself the full experience of one of the truly great indie games in recent years.  The ending was truly cinematic and a beautiful conclusion to this amazing gem.  It left me feeling like I'd experienced something genuinely hand-crafted, original and filled with love and care, just the way a fine film does.I feel with this game they bit off just as much as they could chew, preferring a polished quality experience than to drag on or deliver more of a game that is incomplete or rough around the edges and I always prefer it this way.  This game is indie gold and I can't wait to see what's next for the cool guys at The Astronauts.			"

												At first, I was a bit worried by the somewhat cheesy lines delivered in the opening sequence by our intrepid detective 'Paul Prospero', but it didn't take long for these concerns to diminish and to become engrossed by the amazing visuals, music and story in this game.  The game crafts a rich atmosphere that feels very considered.  As it turned out there's a reason for the detective's manner of speaking that is part of the story but that is in spoiler territory as to why.  The rest of the writing and voice acting is superb (especially Ethan's).I like to call the game a supernatural, first-person, narrative-driven, detective adventure game.  The environments are like nothing you've seen in a game before.  Despite how well they're crafted they took extra care to make it 'feel' real with wind through the grass and trees and leaves blowing in the breeze.  At the same time, the environment is completely devoid of people and animals (except for the puzzles) which makes it feel lonely and a little creepy and sinister.  I would've liked to see a few animals like birds to add to the realism but not too many to detract from the general vibe.  I highly recommend playing this game at night with either good speakers or headphones to experience the atmosphere to its fullest.The puzzles mostly revolve around establishing the sequence of events of various murders you find around the game.  On one occasion I had to consult a guide to understand why I couldn't solve it (the hidden room puzzle) but once I figured out that there were options I wasn't seeing it was easy enough.  If I had any criticism here I'd say the game can feel a bit 'walking simulator' at times, but with visuals this good I didn't mind that much.  On a technical level I noticed the standard version of the game was fairly jerky on my laptop but the remastered version played smoothly, so best to stick with the update.I'd say it’s a 4 to 5-hour game at normal pace, more for intrepid explorers, wanderers or the snap-happy and less for the 'efficient' or impatient.  Sure you could watch a play through on YouTube but you'd be denying yourself the full experience of one of the truly great indie games in recent years.  The ending was truly cinematic and a beautiful conclusion to this amazing gem.  It left me feeling like I'd experienced something genuinely hand-crafted, original and filled with love and care, just the way a fine film does.I feel with this game they bit off just as much as they could chew, preferring a polished quality experience than to drag on or deliver more of a game that is incomplete or rough around the edges and I always prefer it this way.  This game is indie gold and I can't wait to see what's next for the cool guys at The Astronauts.			"

												Completed the entire game for 4 hours. Was it worth it for this price? I would say no. First of all this game is not friendly for casual players like me. When i started playing and I didn't have a single idea what was i supposed to do. I saw some traps but it just asked to keep clicking A button to reveal it. How am i suppose to know what does it mean? After that i found a dead body and once again - The heck am i suppose to do with it? Saw some random letters appear and the point was to move them in order to find thing. How was i suppose to know all of it? I had to google for some ""letsplays"" before playing the game by myself.  So it would be nice to have at least some like an instruction in the game. Puzzles and story is ok by itself. I still didn't get who is sleeper but i guess it doesnt really matter. The graphics is amazing, sound effect is perfect too and you actually can feel atmosphere of this game. Sometimes its getting really creepy. I also liked that most of the puzzles you can solve by yourself. Not too complicated , just takes time. Overall i would give 6/10. If you really like this kind of genre you should definitely get this one. For the rest i would recommend to avoid this game or at least wait until sale.			"

												This is a breathtakingly beautiful first person mystery/adventure game and definitely worth a playthrough. The game starts with a disclaimer that it doesn't hold your hand and indeed it doesn't by not providing a map to Red Creek Valley but you soon remember the whole map by-heart(coz it is gorgeous). The core gameplay is solving 5 murders by restoring the crime scenes using environmental clues and then reenacting the murder. Overall not the best of games but definitely worth a buy.			"

												A beautiful, interesting, narrative experience. There isn't too much 'game' per-se, just a few light puzzles and a lot of walking around taking in beautiful scenery, but it was quite enjoyable.It isn't particularily long (3-4 hours, depending on how much walking around you do), but I had a good time throughout the experience. Sort of like a more interesting version of Dear Esther with more interaction.I'd recommend it as long as you know what you're getting in to. Don't expect any high action or heavy narrative. The entire game is quite subtle without being obtuse.			"

As such, buy it on sale, just for the fun of exploring a beautiful environment. A rare experience in this day and age of blood and guts. Just don't expect anything in the sense of gameplay.  In fact, i give this a thumbs up, as support for the crew, so that one day they'd make a proper horror game with these beautiful settings. There is a world of opportunity. Also, good artist who can make a beautiful setting like this, a handfull i say...			"

												A beautifully crafted game. From its start to the very end ""The Vanishing of Ethan Carter"" manages to keep you engaged in every possible way: exploration, puzzle solving and constant thinking.While you will be sinking into your characters words and while you will be constantly drawing maps in your head trying to figure out Ethan Carter's world and mystery, this game just spins you around. I give you an honest promise - this is one of the most rewarding, emotionally thrilling and beautiful conclusions to a game I ever so. Usually we do not notice some things or see them differently then we should, and ""The Vanishing of Ethan Carter"" just points us into the right direction and tells a story which most of the times are left untold. And it is not about horror, about survival or something specific - this game pulls everything out of you and out of the game genres it covers: think of it as ""Gone home"" + ""Dear Esther"" times two and then add a proper mechanic from ""Murdered: Soul Suspect"". This will be this exact game. But the story of ""The Vanishing of Ethan Carter"" just takes this game a whole extra mile, believe me. I personally never was to USA, but with this single game I felt this country more and more deeply then with anything else I ever witnessed from or about actual country. So do yourself a favor - or better yet - many favors and just play this game. You'll see.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is about a supernatural detective - Paul Prospero - who's been summoned to solve the mystery of the Red Creek Valley, a remote region hiding a dark secret.The game is an atmospheric 3D puzzle game. You have to explore the environnement in order to find clues and solve various puzzles. It doesn't hold your game; you have to figure out everything by yourself. Worry not, however, they are not overly difficult. Pros: - Graphically stunning- Open world, you go through no loading screen throughout the entire game- Fun game mechanics- Intriguing and immersive environnement.- Beautiful OSTCons:- Game is very short - can finish it in below 4 hours.- Puzzles could have been a bit harderTo me, the pros clearly outweighs the cons. I would recommend anyone who's into mysteries and has a decent rig (game may be heavy) to try it out!			"

												Being my first mystery/exploration game i've ever played, I was unsure if I'd really like it. I was only recommended this game because of its unbelievable graphics, but never really got too into the story/actual game. I stopped playing it for a while after being lost and not knowing what to do, something this game should try to fix. I came back to it after getting my new computer with better graphics, and with the help of some guides, started progressing again through the story. After I learnt the mechanics, I began solving puzzles myself and going off and exploring more places. Once I'd gained a new confidence for this game, I became more invested in the story, and within an hour or two I'd completed the whole game. Overall this was a lovely experience and totally worth the money, the graphics are truly beautiful, and the story was very intriguing. The only downfall I saw was previously mentioned, the game doesn't guide you enough. Maybe veterans to the genre will enjoy that, but for me searching up guides to complete a section was a little embarassing. Great game though, 8 / 10.			"

												This game, visually, looks pretty good, and not just in terms of fidelity. It has a discernible style that separates it from an Unreal Engine tech demo. The premise is that the player is a detective searching for a boy who wrote him a letter (with a twist that I won't spoil). The detective's investigation leads him to an abandoned mining village in American backcountry, populated by dilapidated quasi-Victorian buildings cutting into the dense surrounding forest. Most of the story is provided by flashbacks that are activated through environmental cues. The rest is supplemented by minor diversions concerning its paranormal elements. Strictly speaking, there are no characters to interact with directly--only to view from a spectral distance.The exposition accounts for an interesting tonal difference in the presence of architectural decay. Exploring ruins lacks the familiar feeling of melancholy due to the continuous distraction of exposition, and to the story clarifying much of the surrounding mystery of the world. Taken with the vibrant foliage and sunny glow, the visual atmosphere is almost hospitable enough to contradict its darker narrative. Unfortunately, the story is sometimes tonally inconsistent. The aforementioned paranormal elements and the cliched twist make it feel a bit silly, but these inconsistencies are also sometimes presented to service a clear visual setpiece. It's best to absorb this game visually and not to try too hard to digest its meaning, which will likely disappoint you.			"

												I can't recommend this game highly enough. Let me start with the only negative thing I can say about this game - it's too short. Actually, for the story, the length of the game is just right - I only wish I could have spent 2-3x as much time in this world, an experience for which I would have gladly paid top dollar. My play time was about 6 hours, which included my scouring every corner of the island to ensure I didn't miss anything. Next I'll move on to the obvious - the game is visually stunning. Few titles can compare. My understanding is that the devs used a new technique to create hyperrealistic textures and objects, and their work has paid off unbelievably - resulting in a huge open world that you feel you could reach out and touch. I hope to play this using Oculus Rift someday. The controls are simple and intuitive and your character is only limited in his exploration of the world by a sense of realism - for the most part, he will not venture any further than you reasonably could in real life.The audio is incredible, weaving natural ambience in with a moving and haunting soundtrack that flows perfectly as you move from one location to the next. And the locations are a sight to behold. Any moment of this game would make a gorgeous postcard, and the overall layout of the island is very well thought-out. There may be some backtracking, depending on how observant you've been, but it's hard to complain, considering how beautiful the walk will be.As you move deeper into the village, the story captures your attention and pulls you through to the end. The story is primarily a murder mystery, but blends many aspects of occult and science fiction in to good effect - and if you pay attention, all will make sense at the end. For the most part, the gameplay is very simplistic, but there are a couple of puzzling moments that will make you think, and a decent scare or two. If you watched a gameplay vid and were concerned that all the puzzles would work that way, I can tell you that's not the case. One puzzle stood out as my clear favorite, the one involving doors, and I won't say any more than that to ensure I don't spoil it for you. The investigations are also very interesting, if a bit simplistic. But simplistic is a welcome change for this gamer, who sometimes tires of hunting for dozens of odd items in adventure/mystery games and trying to make sense of them. There is none of that here - this game challenges you to think in different ways. Once you've unraveled all of the mysteries, the story comes to a surprising conclusion, which personally I found to be a satisfying explanation and resolution for the strange events that have taken place on this island.Overall, I feel that this game resonates with me personally as an example of what I am looking for in gaming these days. This is a visceral experience that requires some thought, and rewards you handsomely for your efforts. It also represents a great effort to imagine new types of gameplay, which I feel was very successful. I look forward to playing this game again some day, and I hope to see many more titles from these developers in the future. 9/10			"

The Vanishing of Ethan CarterPlease note that I haven't played the Redux version, so this review will only focus on the original version.TL:DR version: 8.5/10. A clustertruck of genres that works surprising well. Incredible atmosphere. Probably the best 'walking simulator' ever but with a rather predictable story.Long version:The Vanishing of Ethan Carter... I'm not quite sure how to place this game on what genre it is. Many call it a 'walking simulator' and if we're going by the main element then yes, it is a 'walking simulator'. But it's a little bit more... interesting than that. As YouTuber Caddicarus put it... ""It's a exploration, walking, artsy, puzzle, ghost story, mystery, detective, atmospheric, culty game, I don't know?"". It's a complete clustertruck of genres but it all meshes in rather interestingly.Gameplay You hold W and use the mouse to move around mainly. That's it really, until you get to the detective parts while start when you find someone's dead body. Clicking on points on interest will make words appear, symbolising what the character you are controlling is thinking. Other times you'll have to move your mouse around untill you hit a hotspot to reveal where a important plot item is. You then go fetch the item and replace it where it needs to go in order to continue the plot, which in this game mean finding out how they were killed.After you have all the evidence, you find all the actions leading up to it and sort them into chronalogical order. Then the entire scene plays out, giving another hint to where Ethan Carter ran to next. Then more walking. Then there's a puzzle, then more walking, then another body. Repeat ad infintum. There's only really one minor shake up of the formula, and that is in a mine with a rather interesting other character. I won't spoil it, but to those who know what I'm talking about... you know exactly what I mean.StorySince it's a 'walking simulator', the story has to be pretty good for us to keep playing. And good it is. It does get rather repeditive once you figure out the pattern however. The ending annoyed me however. To see it, you need to read 5 stories, and I missed the one right at the start of the game, so I had to backtrack all the way there and back to get my ending. But I never expected the twist at the end, and it isn't a twist for the sake of having a twist like other games. It completely makes sense in the context of the game. Again, no spoilers, but the story is an interesting treat.GraphicsThis game is beautiful. Absolutely. Stunning. I've never seen anything quite like it before or since. You might as well get it, just to stare at the graphics and take some pretty screenshots. I think part of the enjoyment of the game is from the graphics in my opinion.ReplayabilityBasically none. This is meant to be played once and that's it.Completionist bonus?Nope. Just get all the achievements (1 is rather well hidden) and get out and boom, 100%.Expected hours?Around 2.5-4 hours to beat the game. The game isn't hard, and it's nearly impossible to die (yes you can die, but it never happens) but you might get lost in the amazing world at times.Worth the price?For the graphics and story alone, I almost can ignore the price. However, for the gameplay aspects... I must say get it when it's on sale. Also, it's a short game so consider that when purchasing it.Bugs?Only a few related to achievements but nothing game-breaking.Final Notes:The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is probably the shortest game you will play with the longest title. It is soaked in atmosphere with an intreging story, interesting murder-mystery elements and those with a thirst to see how a walking simulator should be done should buy this immediately.Gameplay: 6Story: 9Graphics: 10Replayability: 0Completion bonus: 3Final result: 8.5/10 "

You walk around in the woods all alone and your goal is to find out what happened to Ethan Carter and his family.(The reason it says I've only played 5 minutes is because I played the Redux version which has better graphics. When you buy the game you get both versions)Pros:The story - Interesting, makes you want to find out moreThe sounds and music - Both fits this game perfectly, should be played with a headsetThe scenery - Probably the game I've taken the most screenshots inNo loading screens - You can actually walk around the whole map without running into a loading screenThe graphics - I really got surprised by the graphics in this game, the Unreal Engine 4 makes everything look so realThe only con:Game time - I completed this game in 3 hours which I think in a bit short, I didnt rush anything nor did I go very slow			"

												Let me say before anything else that I had high hopes for this game. I'm a big reader (and sometimes writer) of weird fiction and I was very excited when they said that it was going to be based around the works of people like Blackwood, Lovecraft and so on. Unfortunately the game itself didn't have a lot of dialogue, had a disjointed story due to the open world design (if you didn't do the puzzles in a very specific order and there were no indicators for that) and that story didn't have a lot of meat to it. And by that I mean it was barely there at all. The game felt empty in the worst possible way a game can feel empty and was very, very, short. The ambiant music didn't fit the theme of the game, but was nice. On the upside? The developers clearly spent a lot of time making things look absolutely fantastic. If you've got a nice machine this game will make you feel like you're actually walking through the places you explore. I don't have a good computer and even I was kind of wowed by the graphics. 4/10 A good try. Do better next time. You ALMOST had it!			"

												Very beautiful and sad short story! I've never made so many screenshots per hour yet!The world is incredibly rich and detailed visually but small and linear. Somewhat even pointlessly rich and detailed compared to scope. If someone could have added a flycam to this game it would be a great screen-saver.The story is quite touching yet not original and somewhat expected. It seems to me that I have found all of side-stories in a single 3-hour walkthrough. But I've failed to see any drawn parallels between side-stories and main-story that could've give some insight on Ethan's life. Puzzles are not very challenging but puzzle mechanics is a fresh idea. Nevertheless once you got the first one others do not provide any significant challenge.Overall the game is rather outstanding. It will give you some fresh (but brief) and high-quality experience.

The controls are simple and intuitive and your character is only limited in his exploration of the world by a sense of realism - for the most part, he will not venture any further than you reasonably could in real life.The audio is incredible, weaving natural ambience in with a moving and haunting soundtrack that flows perfectly as you move from one location to the next. And the locations are a sight to behold. Any moment of this game would make a gorgeous postcard, and the overall layout of the island is very well thought-out. There may be some backtracking, depending on how observant you've been, but it's hard to complain, considering how beautiful the walk will be.As you move deeper into the village, the story captures your attention and pulls you through to the end. The story is primarily a murder mystery, but blends many aspects of occult and science fiction in to good effect - and if you pay attention, all will make sense at the end. For the most part, the gameplay is very simplistic, but there are a couple of puzzling moments that will make you think, and a decent scare or two. If you watched a gameplay vid and were concerned that all the puzzles would work that way, I can tell you that's not the case. One puzzle stood out as my clear favorite, the one involving doors, and I won't say any more than that to ensure I don't spoil it for you. The investigations are also very interesting, if a bit simplistic. But simplistic is a welcome change for this gamer, who sometimes tires of hunting for dozens of odd items in adventure/mystery games and trying to make sense of them. There is none of that here - this game challenges you to think in different ways. Once you've unraveled all of the mysteries, the story comes to a surprising conclusion, which personally I found to be a satisfying explanation and resolution for the strange events that have taken place on this island.Overall, I feel that this game resonates with me personally as an example of what I am looking for in gaming these days. This is a visceral experience that requires some thought, and rewards you handsomely for your efforts. It also represents a great effort to imagine new types of gameplay, which I feel was very successful. I look forward to playing this game again some day, and I hope to see many more titles from these developers in the future. 9/10			"

												Pretty good game. Very Very pretty (as you can see by all the pictures i took) and a great OST create one of the most atmospheric games i have played. The puzzles are pretty easy but they are mainly a vehicle for the story. The story is quite fantastical and magical at times (in a good way) which makes sense after you finish the game. The only detraction i would actually offer for getting the game is the short duration (5 hours for me and i looked around). If you can stomach the price/hour ratio i definitely recommend you get this game.			"

												This may be an unpopular opinion, and it pains me to say this because I wanted so badly to like this game, but I cannot recommend The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.  I'll go into detail below, but simply put: the game's disconnected narrative, requisite backtracking, convoluted progression and lack of any redemptive feeling upon completion outweighs any positives that could be mustered from the experience.  The game is visually appealing, and anyone with a halfway decent graphics card will be blown away by this game's immersive environment.  The creators really focused on the environment as a focal point, and it shows.  It is by far the strongest part of this game.  The puzzles are challenging and force the player to think outside the box, for better or for worse.  I truly enjoyed some of the game's puzzles, however others required so many tedious attempts that it's almost not even possible to progress through unless you look up the solution.  The story is intriguing from the outset, however the method of storytelling employed leaves the player confused, and by the end of the game it's very difficult to piece together how the events took place.  Despite things coming together fairly well during the ending sequence, I was still left puzzled about a large portion of the game's events with little closure on aspects that made the game intriguing at first.  You definitely should not play this game if you aren't prepared to play a walking simulator type of game with lots of cerebral elements.  The game tells you that it does not hold your hand from the beginning, and boy, is that the biggest understatement ever!  I don't personally mind a challenge, but having to walk across the entire map just to find out I didn't even complete a portion of the game correctly and have to go back and do it again is not exactly my idea of an enjoyable challenge.  Even if you are prepared for the aforementioned cerebral, frustrating walking simulator experience, I'm still not convinced that the game is worth your time.  I left the game feeling pretty empty and did not come away with much emotionally or mentally.  The story had me thinking at first, but by the end very little is explained and I did not feel attached to any of the characters or experiences.  TL;DR The Vanishing of Ethan Carter excels with its environment and SOME of its puzzles, but is hampered too much by a labyrinthine storytelling method and torturous progression system for me to recommend it for most players.

												Very beautiful and sad short story! I've never made so many screenshots per hour yet!The world is incredibly rich and detailed visually but small and linear. Somewhat even pointlessly rich and detailed compared to scope. If someone could have added a flycam to this game it would be a great screen-saver.The story is quite touching yet not original and somewhat expected. It seems to me that I have found all of side-stories in a single 3-hour walkthrough. But I've failed to see any drawn parallels between side-stories and main-story that could've give some insight on Ethan's life. Puzzles are not very challenging but puzzle mechanics is a fresh idea. Nevertheless once you got the first one others do not provide any significant challenge.Overall the game is rather outstanding. It will give you some fresh (but brief) and high-quality experience.

												It is Finally Time I put something down about a game I've had for a year and never could get to work because my computer wasnt graphically 'meaty' enough, to run it.I know why now. and its because Every scene is like a postcard!. I think you could take every scen as a screenshot, because the whole game appears so beautiful.This is a great mistake because below the veneer of beauty, lies an ancient Evil waiting to 'awaken'. I have never been 'jump scared' but I understand,... I did Yesterday and THAT fact Alone, was enough to get me to write to you to check this game out. I screamed, for the first time ina while . Totally took me off-guard, and then I laughed because it was SO effective, and Unexpected!! The game play is Hard for this game, so the learning curve is Steep. It says Right at the beginning of the game It wont hold your hand. It doesn't, and I floundered until I did a bit of research. Glad I did! Ther's SO much to this game you do not Ever have a clue about untill you realize the sequence of how to descover a way to unveil the scenes that explaing to you what has happened. Its a tough time but worth every moment. I loved the cut scenes better than the views. I whole-heartedly recommend this game. Its pretty if you have a PC that will run it. if you dont it will sit in your Library like it did in mine, untill I upgraded my PC.Thats a sad comment but its the truth. I had a great time descovering all the interesting things, and Deadly things, in ""The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter"". Im not finished yet, but this is a game youd like to take your time wioth like a great Book. Its story is complex and strange enough to keep you 'poking' around for clues to what happened to Ethan. 8/10			"

The music, the graphics, the environment (in terms of design), the narrators, the storyand honestly, I couldn't find anything I don't like yet.Something that makes this game graphically stand out is that everything looks ""handmade"".Nothing looks like it was copied and pasted over the world to fill gaps.Every single rock looks different and realistic and everything is so detailed. I spend about half my time by just looking at all the details and things you can see.I could tell you so much more about how good the game feels,but I don't wanna waste your time.To make it short.This game is a masterpiece and totally worth its money.Get it, if you love to explore immersive game worlds and a cool storyline.Do not get it, if you just wanna rush through it.

												First thing, the game looks awesome! When I entered it, I was very happy about the freedom you have. No one tells you where to go or what to do. But that's not entirely true as I found out while playing. On a lot of occasions you will face invisible walls that force you to follow a certain path. And that's what bugged me the most. In the beginning you're told, that the game won't hold your hand and that it's about exploring. But in fact the way you go through the game is pretty well defined. That is in some way understandable because there have to boundaries where the games world ends. But creating those by invisible walls feels extremely cheap and uninspired...			"

IntroductionThe Vanishing of Ethan Carter is definitely a thought prevoking game, to say the least. It visually impresses and ensnares with a rather unique take on telling a story in a game. If you don't mind a lot of walking, and maybe even backtracking depending on how you play, the game can be quite enjoyable.VisualsVisually the game is breath-taking and some screenshots don't really do it all the justice it deserves. From the very get go of the game you will be hit with beautifully encompasing vistas, forests and derelict towns.The overal attention to design and look of enviroments in the game are really well thought out. You'll be able to feel every bit of tension or emotion emanating from everything from warm exteriors to dark ritualistic crypts.AudioAgain the game almost overwhelmingly impresses with the audio throughout. The musical score is fitting and flows beautifully between enviroments. Voice acting is also some of the best I've heard; it all sounds natural, clean and no dialog is wasted.StoryWithout going into any spoilers: go into this game expecting something different, but highly interesting. Your character is in this place looking for Ethan Carter and he's a detective, so it's natural for the story to follow a ""piece it together"" format.The overal story is very morbid, this is made evident from the first few minutes (if not seconds) into the game. Throughout it is basically your job as the player to run around, or calmly meander, and piece together the overall happenings in this strange little valley  you've entered, by the use of your psychic powers.This however can run against the games favour though, as it's rather core to the overal gameplay.GameplayFirst off, just know that many of  gameplay mechanics are actually intricately tied to its story, as that's the games main selling point, its' story.At the start the game could feel a bit overwhelming, as there is truly no hand-holding, it's up to you to figure stuff out. The game does do a great job at giving you lots of opportunities around the start to get use to or introduce you to those mechanics, hightening the chance for you to actually get the idea around them.There is a lot of walking, but I feel like the addition of actuall content in between segments gives it enough weight to not be considered just another walking simulator. Even dullish walking between segments can very often be broken apart by our detective giving some very well recorded exposition. The, ""no hand-holding,"" can be very frustrating though, as there can quite often be no clear indication on where you're suppose to be going, or more importantly, what you're actually suppose to be doing.It could be inconsequencial, as there are only so many places you can actually walk around in.The biggest issue is that if your unfortunate enough to miss certain ""fragments"" of the story on your way to the end, which is very possible, you will find yourself having to backtrack across the entire game world. This is actually a mechanic in game, as you will not be able to unlock the ending of the game (even if your standing awkwardly, literally right in front of it...staring at it) if you had missed any of the ethereal security-camera footage caches.There are some horror elements to the game, but they definitely do not play an overwhelming role throughout. I would rate it more as a suspense/thriller. There are some puzzles, some running, but mostly just walking and thinking.ConclusionThe game story is very gripping, interesting and something fairly fresh in the time it was released. It will capture your imagination and make you wonder about what truly happened in the place you're roaming around. There are elements from everything from the twisted forms of childrens imaginations to Lovecraftian horror and the repercussions that our actions may carry.The gameplay is solid, with no bugs that I have experienced myself. The core gameplay will probably not appeal to everyone, it's a slow build up and in the simplest definition a puzzle game wrapped up in an amazing story, so don't buy this expecting a fast paced run through.Otherwise, this game will really be a decent addition to you're steam library.

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a beautifully rendered map with a tacked-on walking sim on top, an unfortunate union that failed to meet each and every one of my expectations. What a beautiful disaster.I'm not new to walking sims. Ever since I started with Dear Esther years ago and kept going with the likes of Gone Home, I've thoroughly enjoyed this narrative genre and what it can offer in terms of ambience, feelings and story. I've had this one in the oven for the longest time, hearing all the praise it got. I saved it for a rainy day, one where I really craved a good story and a satisfying time.Ethan Carter, to date, ranks as the worst walking sim out of the mainstream/famous ones.In this game you're Paul Prospero, a paranormal investigator called to Red Creek Valley by a boy (the titular Ethan Carter) who is in dire need of your help. Arriving at the location through the woods, you'll start making your way toward the inhabited areas with long walks peppered with sparse first person narration.The roads and rivers and hills are all beautifully rendered, really immersive and a joy to look at. The Redux version kicks everything up a notch and makes the lighting even more beautiful than it was before. It's a really well constructed map, with a great sense of scale and reasonable topography. The dam is really massive and imposing.As you traverse these beautiful and eerily abandoned locations, you'll stumble upon murdered individuals; this is where the supposed ""meat"" of the game is. You need to recreate the scene of the murder by placing each item into its original position so you can use your paranormal sensitivity; by doing this, the spirit of the deceased will present you with a few character models scattered in the vicinity, representing the few minutes that precede their death. You'll then have to put these in order to see the relative cutscenes in motion and hear them talk, finding out bits of the mystery surrounding the valley.This, sadly, is nothing but a gimmick that happens a very few times throughout the game. You have no real edge on this task, no skill or intuition will help you make it more satisfying: you simply walk until you find all the objects, place them in the only interactive slots that pop up, then order the trivial scenes that lead up to the murder. Don't worry, you can try again if you make mistakes.Other interactions with the game are a handful of sidequest which feel entirely unrelated to the reasons that led you to the valley and absolute curve balls on top of that. These interactions vary from always walking forward, walking to follow an NPC, finding and clicking all the items, walking a maze and clicking on all the items. There's only a very interesting one, involving doors and impossible spaces, a minigame that I hoped was an integral part of the gameplay at the point in my playthrough. It wasn't.The musical score is pretty good and really helps getting in the mood, be it relaxed or anxious. I have some issue with the sound design, as loud constant noises (i.e. a waterfall, the engine you're sitting on) go crazy when they're directly behind you, but other than that it's quite alright.So that was the pretty and the neutral. Here's the bad.The walks between each instance of interaction/narration are so long that this game ends up feeling more empty than regular, ""pure"" walking sims that have no interaction at all. While walking around with just the sound of the birds and the wind, I ended up asking myself ""nice, but are we there yet?"" at least 3 times throughout this 2h long game. This doesn't take in account the shorter walks where you can see your goal (so you know you're not there yet) but that still feel excessively long.The characters are one-dimensional madmen, and the story is so dull that only a masterful narration and direction could've possibly saved it. As you can already imagine, none of that is present here. The re-enacting that lead up to the deaths are devoid of any drive and pathos, and failed to make me love or hate any of them. I was wholly indifferent toward them. The story, as cheap ones tend to, pulls a couple of twists toward the end that may catch you off guard but still not save the situation.So that was the bad. Ready for the worst?Imagine having gone through most of the above, and you're now at the ending. You've found all the characters, solved the mysteries and find yourself at the centerpiece of the narration. There! You've finished the game. Wait... no, the game stops you. Unfinished business? What? Well, you have to go back and clear all the sidequests you missed or skipped earlier in the game in order to see the ending. Not the extra ending. Not a secret ending. THE ending. The game even gives you a convenient map with the location of said sidequests so you can find them and trudge through them, then get back and see the ending.I could've glossed over the neutral and the bad, remembering just the pretty, but the worst really did it for me. This game opens with a smug ""this is an open narration, there's no holding hands here"" and puts me down a very long (albeit deceptively large) corridor, only to tell me at the end that I have to go back and check all the (few) boring or hidden rooms the game itself led me to think I was allowed to skip.That was the last straw. I quit the game and checked the ending on Youtube.What started as a promising experience and slowly turned into an unimpressive sequence of tasks, ultimately ended as an infuriating husk of a game and an offence to my intelligence, my money and my time.Please consider carefully before purchasing this game. It's not bad per se, but it's a poor walking simulator, unredeemed by its bland and gimmicky interactions, and an even worse experience overall if you've played more than a handful of games in your life.

												I bought this game on sale for around $3, but still can't help but feel dissatisfied. Pros:As mentioned in other reviews, the game is visually stunning. It simply looks great. If you're after a piece of eye candy to view on your high end PC, this game is for you. Furthermore, the soundtrack was on point for most of the game, and fitted the game's atmosphere.Cons:I had some crashes, freezes, and bugs, that forced me to restart the game multiple times throughout my playthrough. This caused me to annoyingly spend time backtracking and redoing tasks already completed which weren't saved by the game's autosave feature. I hear that the Redux edition mostly fixes these problems, but I've yet to play it myself. Regardless, the problems I have with this game are one's that can't be solved with tweaks and updates, and instead come from the core elements of the game itself.The biggest problem with The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is its bad plot and weak story telling elements. The story is interesting in the beginning, but your interest steadily deteriorates as the game progresses and the game's lackluster plot   begins to emerge. What is toted as an engaging mystery, ends up becoming a monotonous one packed with mediocre puzzles and player interaction. The story is presented through a traditional mystery game format, the clues given via multiple fragments and in a non-linear fashion. However, as the clues conjoin and the pieces of the story are put together, you're left with an impression of complete indifference. What could be an intriguing mystery ends up becoming a washed up version of a horror-adventure game. The character development is non existant, and what characters are developed are boring and dull. These characters are tailor-made cliches stamped with bland characterization, and you find it difficult to remember their names and their personalities. In addition, the voice acting is sub-par, and the dialogue is not convincing or at all interesting to read and listen to. There are some areas where the story peaks your interest, particularily in the examination of the game's written clues. However, these brief moments of intrigue soon lead to continued boredom and disappointment. Whatever story you've managed to collect and understand is made completely redundant by the terrible ending of the game, which is presented to you in a ""twist ending"". You hoped as you played the game, that maybe a great conclusion would tie together the loose ends of the story and leave you with a satisftying smile on your face. This does not happen. Perhaps, with better writing and plot progression the ""twist ending"" would still be satisfying, but this is not the case. You hoped through your playthrough that it would all come together in the end. It didn't.     A good analogy for buying this game would be this: You're hungry for sweets and so you go out shopping. You look around, not sure what to buy. Then, you come across a beautifully decorated cake. The icing covering it looks incredible, and the patissier crafted it delightfuly. You buy it and take it home, for a fair price too. You open the box of cake and cut your first slice. It looks great! But as you lift the slice and place it onto your plate, you realize that the inside is rather dark. You prod the piece with your fork, and it feels hard. You scrape some icing off the top and you discover that it's burned. Uh oh. Well, you got it on sale, what can you expect? Plus, you're hungry, so you decide to eat some cake. Your fork manages to cut a piece from your slice of cake and you put it into your mouth. You first taste the sweet icing and you momentarily convince yourself that the cake is good, that your purchase was well justified. But as you continue savouring the flavour, you realize that the icing on top cannot cover the burned texture of the cake itself. It slowly begins to taste worse as you continue eating it, but you do so because you're hungry. However, the icing's sweetness begins to loose its effect as you continue eating and the dull, burned, flavour begins to overpower you. You're completely disappointed, but you tough it out. It's not bad enough to make you spit it out, but it isn't good either. Finally, you finish the cake, and look at the now nearly empty box the cake once lay upon. You see a single cherry in the box! It must have fallen off the cake! You reach for the sweet looking cherry that will surely clear the bland taste of the cake from your palate and throw it into your mouth. It's extremely sour! What a twist! But, wait. It doesn't fit with the cake at all, and it doesn't taste very good. What a disappointment. "

												Atmospheric graphics mixed with a slow-paced adventure that does not demand too much, but leaves you a lot of liberty to decide when and where you want to go to a place. I was spending most of the time playing just by strolling around through the best looking forest in my whole gaming life. Soo much love was put in every detail, every straw, placing of stones and trees. The textures are manifold, on the rocks, you rarely see the same in a certain radius again. The trees and grass is moving perfectly in the wind. It's a lively world even if there are no other NPC or even animals. Might be a negativ point, but would my grey GTX 680 be able to render such a graphic wonder in stereoscopic 3D? I'd doubt this.The 3D vision support is execellent after applying the community patch. I have to say, this is going to be my new perfect example to show off the qualities of 3D vision to friends that are still reluctant regarding the most mind-breaking technology in PC gaming since Mario64's 3d world - if you don't know 3D vision, check on google. It will change your life. I rarely had such an immersive experience with a game in my life. It's similar to the first time I was playing Skyrim in 3D vision and walking through the fields and woods. Imagine a new Elderscrolls with such love to details, this kind of hand set environnement. But with a bigger areal, a huge living world. It would be mind-blowing. But it will come soon. I am certain.Can I recommend this game? Yes, I do. Besides of said qualities of the graphics it has a decent story to follow, even if it's honestly secondary with regard to the mere wandering through the beautiful and pitoresk landscape. The game might be a bit short, around 5 hours if you rush. Many more if you like to walk instead of run and do not bother yourself visiting a place twice. If it is too expensive for you at the moment, put it on your wishlist. You won't regret buying it someday when the price is right for you. If you have a 3D vision kit at home, this is the obligartory game for you.For the love they put in the game I rate it with 9/10. Unique experience you should not miss out.			"

												I played the Redux Version, so do not mind the playtime.Bought it on sale, still not worth the 3€ and especially the time.After reading all the good reviews and getting a ""its alright"" from a friend I finally bought this game.But why does my opinion differ so strongly?First of all the positive: It looks really nice, nothing mindblowing, but nice sceneries. Sound design is good too.But then the game just fails in all other aspects unfortunately. I am not sure how people can find the story anything above average. The characters never get any color or depth, no mystery that gets ""unmystified"" or something and no real writing you can dig into either. You can sum up the story in about half a page wihtout missing any details at all and it would blandy reveal how simple it is without the graphics.I'm not the biggest walking simulator fan there is, but I had much fun with them in the past. I would like to especially compare it to Gone Home, which was more interesting, with a much more satisfying ending and it had even less gameplay than Ethan Carter.Lets get to the worst part IMHO, the ""game"" or the ""naration method"" if you like. It consists of a few ""puzzles"" while only 2 of them are even close to being puzzles at all. Which was very disappointing because there was one door puzzle which was really neat, but nothing good came after it. The other main part of the story mechanic is just a useless run around and inspect stuff mechanics, which then tells you about a interaction between people that happened there, only that the stuff that happened is completely uninteresting and does not really contribute to make the overall plot more interesting.Last but not least the gameplay/narration concept is just a big hypocrite. At the start the game tells you something along the lines of ""this is a narrative game that doesn't hold your hand"". Sounds good right? Sounds good until it shoots itself in the foot. One step before the ending you get told you have to solve all puzzles to progress further which completely torpedoed the promise at the start. What use does a ""free narative game that doesnt hold my hand"" have when in the end it slaps me in the face and sends me back to the start in the worst case. Unbelievable.To end on a positive note, it was nice to figure out the mechanics and especially the good puzzle completely by myself, instead of getting tutorialed at the start. But that does not save the game unfortunately. Do not buy unless you love walking around in a neat environment for some hours + sale.			"

												I was loving this game, but unfortunately the save feature is broken.  The game only saves at ""Auto-save points,"" which are apparently non-existent.  I played for an hour, solving the first two mysteries and reaching the third, but when I restarted the game nothing had been saved.When the save feature gets changed to ""save on exit,"" I'll update this review to a positive and add more details.  Until then however, those details are pointless because I cannot recommend the game in its current state.  There is no reason for a game like this to not have ""save on exit.""[Edit April 2015] The developers have promised to fix the save system.  Once that happens, I will try the game again and update my review.[Edit Nov 2015] The new save system is finally released.  I will have time to replay the game around Christmas; I'll update my review at that time.			"

												A unique twist on the mystery-solving experience. If you're into mystery, I would definitely recommend this.There's nothing much else I can say that other reviews haven't said better, but I will say that I own both the regular and collector edition of this game and played them both for achieves, so this game does have replayability. It's worth doing over to make sense of things you might have missed the first time, and if you already have played it once and know where to go/what to do, you can beat this game with 100% achieves in a hour and a half tops.My one negative would be that I felt the ending had more potential.Overall, very enjoyable and intriguing.

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a one huge mystery / walking simulator. Yes, you'll walk alot, but you'll not even care. The game is GORGEOUS! One of the best looking games I've ever seen. It has that photorealistic feel to it, so you may feel like it's real.I said it's a walking simulator, so let's say something about that. You walk alot but in the meaning that you're searching for clues. For clues on how to find the missing boy, Ethan Carter. As the Paul Prospero said in the beginning, you'll need to solve all of the Ethan's stories in order to reveal what happened to him. I don't want to spoil the story, so I just say it's great and indeed, mysterious.It's a bit short, but it's worth it. I don't even blame them, I think the game is good with its 3-5 hrs of gameplay. They don't need to make it really long as those few hours are pretty much enough to uncover what happened to Ethan. And it also means you can happily complete it in one sitting!So this review was short, but enough said. It's gorgeous, filled with great story and voice acting, and while it kinda is a walking simulator, you'll love to walk around this world! I'm not really sure if it's worth the full price, as it is short and replayability is close to none, but if it's on sale, it's a must grab!			"

												Wow.I have to say this game blown me away.I expected something good already before I bought it because of the pictures and everything.But then I got more then I expected.This game is a detective puzzle game. Thats it basically. Doesnt sound like much, I know.Its not even long. Somebody can finish it in 5 Hours.Glad that I bought it when it was on sale for 66% off because I wouldnt play the full price for such a short game, even if its good.To sum some things up:Positive:- Amazing and beautiful graphics. Unreal Engine 3 on its limit, actually can mess with CryEngine if you ask me at least in this game. (Developers are working on a Unreal Engine 4 Version Update! Means it will probably look even better once!)- Great atmosphere (Sometimes a little bit spooky)- Interesting gameplay of solving puzzles- Much background of the story- Unique experience- Amazing and atmospheric SoundtrackNegatives:- Short- Gameplay is maybe a little bit flat for some folks. Dont expect any action or much to do in the game.- No instructions or tutorial how to solve cases. First time I played it I didnt even know that you can solve something...If you cant make any progress ingame, you should try the Walkthrough guide which will explain how the game works and also shows you how to finish it.I can recommend the game if you look for a nice, atmospheric game experience and not for a action shooter or something. Since there is not much content and after 5 Hours you saw pretty much everything I would say grab it when its on sale. I can recommend the Collectors Edition upgrade, especially when you want the Soundtrack in extended and high quality FLAC format. The Soundtrack is amazing. Beside there are Wallpapers and Making of and this stuff.My Rating: 8/10			"

												What a great story.If you like explorative walking simulators with engaging story get this game. Is it a horror game? No. Is it at least creepy? Yes and might be disturbing to some.Some of you who just want the story might want to grab a guide to nudge you in the right direction(s) and to minimize all the walking. But with scenes this good, it's a joy to walk. The music fits very well too.There are problems with stuttering, it's the engine limitation and probably my old rig showing its age. It kinda break the immersion. Try the UE4 redux version if you can.			"

												It took me 2 attempts to get through this game, but it was definitely worth it.TL;DR: Frustrating at first, but a brilliant experience in the end.The first time I played, the game dropped me into an area surrounded by trees with no instruction of what to do. After wandering around a bit and managing to solve the first 'scene' (without understanding how I'd actually solved it), and I was left to explore a larger area with no idea what I was doing. Super frustrating, I quit.On my second attempt, I had a look at a walkthrough for the first 'scene' after the area I'd already completed. After seeing how the puzzle is solved, and understanding the game mechanics better, I played through solving the rest of the puzzles on my own. Now having an idea of what I was supposed to be doing, I could focus on what the game had to offer, and it was beautiful.The game is full of picturesque landscapes and stunning scenes to look at. You won't even need to try to keep an eye out for these scenic views, they just naturally pop out as you're wandering around following the story, so you won't miss out on anything if you're not specifically looking for the best viewing positions. The screenshots shown on the store page really don't do it justice. Complimenting the gorgous visuals is an excellent soundtrack. It seemed to fit perfectly with what I was seeing, seamlessly transitioning from no music, to a calm serenade, to a haunting background track without you really noticing.The story was engaging, and I loved being a part of piecing the scenes together and then watching it unfold. It was a fantastic experience overall, my only gripe was the lack of instruction, but in hindsight I imagine adding any kind of tutorial or instruction to the start of the game would only ruin the immersion so it's probably better without.Highly recommended as a way to keep yourself entertained for a few hours on a lazy weekend.

												I've seen a few flame wars started from this game, so straight out of the gates I will say this game is NOT for someone who wants a long linear or even free roaming adventure rpg.With that said, if you're looking for a game with a story that you have to wrap your head around and piece together, then maybe this game is for you! I'm a huge psychological anime fan and occult mystery lover, so I fit right into the story telling and the fact that I was a ""famous occult detective"" that was asked to investigate ""The Vanishing of Ethan Carter"" made it catch me from the opening sequence. Also honestly if you're good at deducing a mystery (like a detective *hint hint*) then the things fall into place and start to give you that mystery solving satisfaction as if you're slowly solving the murder mystery of the century!Beyond the whole I <3 mystery part,The game scores an 8 out of 10 with mePro's - Graphics are beautiful, I'm on med graphics and still felt compelled to take screenshots - The mystery kept me wondering what is the cause? How will it end?! - Gameplay is a welcomed change from the recent norm. No blaring markers saying ""ITEM HERE! DROP OFF HERE!"" - Environment felt stressful and edgy yet mysterious and relaxing all at the same time - Soundtrack is mysterious as well Con's - It is pretty short if you rush it, I can counter argue it with the brain wrapping and speculation you can give it... But it still is a pretty short game. - Is confusing sometimes, if you are quick to get frustrated or don't have allot of time, maybe consider passing on this one or going in with a guide. - Still coming out with regular updates and fixes, I feel as though it's a one play game and I may be wrong if they make more stories based around the universe and release it. But once I'm done I don't think I am going to come back unless to re-live the mystery gameplay when I get nostalgic. - Characters feel distant unless you can get into the story and piece together who they are and what they are doing. Like I said before, maybe not a game for someone who doesn't really piece information together creatively and decisively.    With all that said I really loved this game myself and will be looking forward to more work like this, pick it up and give it a try if you wanna play something a little more on the out there side!

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a beautiful game, but poorly optimized. Even with a good computer you will get stutters when an area is loading, which does break the immersion somewhat.If you are wondering whether or not the game is for you, let me explain what kind of game it is. It's a narrative game. You walk around and you can witness some scenes and dialogs. There is very little to do. You have to click on a few items and there are two puzzles, but that's pretty minimal. This isn't an adventure game. This is a one-time narrative gaming experience you play for the immersion and story.			"

 ""Large pieces of this country were thrown away, doomed to become, and then remain, the worst versions of themselves. Beneath all that rot, dark things grow."" This game was such a good experience from the start to the end. My experience with the game was different perhaps (?) from the others. when I started, I thought this was going to be a Dear Esther Improved experience. So I just follow the route the game was showing to me. But when I got my first achievement, I realized I skipped 3 achievements that I should already have. In that moment, I realized I was playing this game wrong. Totally wrong in factSo I started again. Started to explore as well as interact with the objects and my surroundings.  What a surprise, when I realized I skipped a BIG part of the game, just in a place I just pass by in my last wrong attempt of play. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a game that you must explore everything, this is not ur typical lineal game where everything will just appear in front of you and its easy to figure out Ethan It's just not that type of game. You must explore and be careful with the details, then you can REALLY figured out what's going, and if you want to see the big scenes on the game, you must find the pieces of the puzzle and re-create the scene by yourself. The dialogue of the game, It's good to read/listen to. But definitely what I liked more from the game was the ending. It's so ambiguous. So much, that literally you can interpret what happened in the game by yourself. A ending that works for you. I will share in this review my interpretation of the ending, There's nothing that I hate more in this world than spoilers, so please, hover the spoilers by your own risk. You can also finish the game and come back here to see my interpretation and contrast it with yours. WARNING: EXTREME SPOILERS. There is a double universe in the game. One when Paul is dying and the other where Ethan is dying as well. In the last moment of their lives, when they are almost falling asleep before death. They encounter each other in some kind of limbo world, based mostly in the Ethan's world. And so, finally, when they encounter each other, they can die together in peace.In the prequel mini-comic (http://www.theastronauts.com/comic) we can see how Paul said this would be his final case. (as he said in the game as well), and it looks like hes dying, and most likely, Ethan also died after he got trapped in the room cuz the flames. Also, I think everything that happened in the game, It's the stories Ethan created based in how dysfunctional his family was. But at the end, we can clearly see even though they were a family with a lot of problems, they really cared about him.  They tried to saved Ethan life's till the end. Most likely in that situation, he died from suffocation, but before that, he sleeps, in those dreams, the 2 universes between Paul and Ethan, can connect from the first, and the last time. Ethan created Paul, Paul created Ethan.Ethan is Paul, Paul is Ethan.9/10, An amazing trip you must experience.Oh and...plz, play the Redux Version.			"

												It's a walking sim- hey wait, come back! It's actually a good one. The world is scenic and beautiful, but it doesn't feel completely inert like, say, Everybody's Gone to the Rapture. It's interactive to a fair degree and the environments change enough to keep you interested. The story's a very slow-burn kind but again, unlike some games, it makes perfect sense and manages to cultivate a seldom-seen kind of slowly creeping terror even though there are only few dangers - I guarantee by the time you're actually at risk of death you'll be shaking in your boots, fueled to press on only by how interesting the story's gotten at that point.It's a fascinating world to explore, and it manages it far better than other, similar, games. I'd recommend this for everyone with patience, and especially for writers - there are a few interesting literary themes in it.			"

I came to no conclusion other than, ""Maybe I just didn't 'get' it"".While the game is undeniably pretty, and though it offers some interesting and unusual gameplay, the game just isn't compelling enough (or challenging enough) to warrant a recommendation from this player.

												I think tagging this game as ""mystery"" is highly misleading, as the player will find out after solving any puzzle and reading the scrap of paper they find afterwards (not really a spoiler).  That said it is a very picturesque walk through an abandoned town in the woods with several mysterious, spooky puzzles and an excellent.  Highly recommended given the $2.99 price tag, not sure if it's worth $20 given how short the game is (you can probably complete in a couple hours if you hold down run button & have a sense of direction).

It takes me only six hours to complete without any help (soluce or wiki), and the ""open world"" thing is a lot overestimated.On the other hand, the global atmosphere is great and the experience so refreshing.To finish, I can advise you to buy this game but be aware of its short duration and lack of exploration.

												I got this game on sale for 12 dollars and I'm comfortable with the price that I paid. I don't think I would've paid more.That said, this game should be called Nature Photography Simulator 2014 because there is no game that has had me reaching for the F12 screenshot button so much before. I've taken over 40 screenshots within my 6 hours of gameplay. It's just so beautiful to walk around and look at all of it! It could also be called a Graphical Benchmarking Software: The Video Game.Regarding the gameplay, the murder solving mechanics and storytelling techniques here are top notch. Really entertaining. I had my entire family sitting around the TV trying to piece together the clues to each crime scene.It's NOT a terribly long game, but as this game says at the very beginning, it will not hold your hand. You're free to roam the entirety of Red Creek Valley without any guidance. So unless you look up a guide, you could very well get many hours out of this.Don't expect too much of a challenge however, this game is not super difficult. But it is an enjoyable narrative experience for anyone that likes a good story that keeps you guessing, and amazing scenery.EDIT: After playing the game a little longer, I can confirm that NO, you cannot travel to any place you can see. So there are some boundaries to this beautiful world.			"

Or just look up the solution and follow the right hand wall to the main room without the parts.

												Although I haven't played much, I didn't really want to continue playing. The game looks fantastic but I just did not like the lack of direction and not knowing where to go. Others might love this feature, but I need aims and objectives and don't just want to wander for ages til I find something vaguely interesting, which is what I felt like I was doing whilst I was playing the game.

												So this is one of the few games I've ever 100% completed everything in the game. It only took me about 11 hours so it's not a super long game, it can be beat in much less time. The game does a very good job making you want to discover everything. The story is so captivating and ambigious. Of course there is a simple way to go about the game to get a simple story with a simple ending. But if you really look into everything there's such a deep meaning behind everything in the game. 10/10 Best story driven game I've ever played.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a first person mystery adventure game centered around supernatural detective Paul Prospero as he receives a letter from the mysterious Ethan Carter and begins his investigation in the mysterious Red Creek Valley.The game is increadibly atmospheric with the locations in Red Creek Valley feeling real and lived in. The surronding forests accompanied with the little to no sound but trees leaves rustling in the wind and the odd piece of music every now and again help make you feel that while the place appears like any other forest area there is something beneath all that, that feels wrong and wierd, this caused me to constantly look around my enviroment as I played thinking something was watching my every move but as Paul says at the beginning of the game ""No place is truely quiet and Nowhere is really Oridinary"".Because of this the overall feel and look of the game is very lovecraftian with the odd town and it's strange residents believing in some unseen possibly evil entity and occult minded individuals getting roped into the events.The gameplay simply consists of you exploring the surronding areas of Red Creek Valley and investigating the series of murders that have place.The first instance of this happens minutes into the game with you noticing blood on a nearby traincar, this then leads you to using your supernatural abilities to locate a crank to start the train, but before finding the crank you notice a blood trail that leads to a body and from there you look around the nearby area for clues as to how this person ended up in this state.Graphics wise The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is stunning to say the least, it lead to more suprise to find that it ran on Unreal Engine 3 and as I say this I will probably get bombarded with ""X game looks better"" or ""I've seen better Unreal Engine games"" but this game is probably the best use I've seen of the engine to date.The audio side is also very well done with the soundtrack consisting of piano and violins that put you into a deep and methodical trance which is fitting considering you're a detective.As I finishing The Vanishing of Ethan Carter I can say that I was pleasantly suprised and will probably make this one of my top games of the year.This game left me with more questions than answers which some might not take to kindly too but I feel that it is rather fitting for a mystery that there are somethings left to unanswered and only for our imagination fill in.

												''A narrative experience which does not hold your hand'' This game does what it says on the tin, it leaves you stranded in the woods with only the aim to find Ethan Carter - who is believed to have vanished (if you hadn't guessed that already). Throughout the whole game you are left to your own devices to investigate several murders and solve several puzzles which you are also left to find on your own in actually quite a vast world for a game of this size, with this aim. The horror of this game does not lie in its gore, or its jump scares (of which there are a few - but not enough to put off you that do not enjoy a jump scare) it lies in the game's atmosphere, and is for the most part a psychological horror story. The atmosphere of this game is tagible and thoroughly enjoyable - like reading a bloody good book, you will feel more than compelled to journey on through the mysterious past of Red Creek Valley.This is a game that I have played through twice and I am still in awe of the beautiul Autumnal landscape that the producers have created. It will leave you guessing right up until the end, which you will not want to arrive at. This is why I play games. Money well spent. Game well made.			"

												This is one of the best mystery / adventure games I have played in a long, looong time. There's no hand holding, as they do warn you at the bginning of the game, so it's challenging, yet no so much so that it becomes frustrating. Each puzzle or ""scene"" solved reveals another part of the story and I quickly became invested in it, trying to get the whole picture. The game dynamic and the ""supernatural"" methods used to gather clues are both very refreshing and novel. The game itself is visually stunning and the music is beautiful and fits the story like a glove. I recommend it wholeheartedly!			"

												This game is astoundingly alive, foreboding, and immersive. So treacherous and rewarding and beautiful. So poetic and dark and impressive.This game captivated me. Withing moments of starting the game I was greeted by a world that felt more alive than any other game I had ever seen. The nature around me seemed to breathe, and the tracks of an abandoned railroad sat, waiting for me to venture to whatever lay at the end. Basically, I was smacked in the face with a load a' good stuff.Right off the bat, you are greeted with amazing visuals that blow most games out of the water, wonderful sound design, some mysterious commentary from the narrator (and character you play as) Paul Prospero, and a very bloody dead body on some railroad tracks.The game introduces some unique gameplay aspects and a disclaimer telling you that it will not hold your hand throughout the mysteries you come across. TVEC stays true to this promise, and as you roam around the dilapidated setting to different locations, you will find that you are only left with your wits- and a nifty power to visualize the memories of dead people once their murder scenes are set up properly.Pros:-Astounding graphics, especially for an independant developer-Gripping, dark story with a Lovecraftian style and a wonderful twist-Brilliant gameplay. Many well implemented mystery-scene styled features-Extremely immersiveCons:-The models and lip syncing on the characters are a bit stiff, but that doesn't distract too much from the gameplay-Very short game, only about 5-6 hours of gameplay (unless you're slow like me)-Some may experience graphical errors (mainly bright red, small, flashing dots in trees) depending on their hardware (the dots were very infrequent for me and did not distract too much, inconvenient nontheless)The Spooky Pizza's Rating: 9/10tl;dr- The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a game that will astound you, from its brilliant aesthetics to its mysterious storyline to its engaging gameplay. Worth every penny.			"

												Beautiful. I did not realize how good this game looked when I bought it. It's well optimized and it runs flawless on my pc.I finished the game the same day I bought it. I don't regret this purchase one bit. You are an occult investigator who received a letter from a boy asking for help. You begin the game when you arrive. Entire game is first person and well written. The voice acting is decent as well.You seem to have some psychic abilities of your own and you use them to help solve puzzles and figure out what the hell happened to the boy and his family, and why everybody is killing each other. Nice little twist at the end. There's puzzles where you try to figure out how murders happened to ethans family and many others. They aren't too difficult either.This is an exploration-puzzle kind of game. Not for everyone. If you think it is something you would enjoy, just buy it. It is a very good game and worth your money.			"

												If you're looking for a short and sweet game with puzzle solving, a beautiful environment and story, I cannot recommend this game enough. It's hard to explain what I like so much without spoiling the story but, it's a magical, mysterious game that - despite being so short - left me completley satisfied. I'll be remembering this game for many years.That said, here's my main points:- Very short, I finished it in 4.5 hours including going back through to get achievements. However this is not a bad point.- 0 replay value. Once you've played it once, you've played it.- Fantastic, beautfiul environment. Hitting F12 all day in this game is no shame.- Well created puzzles and effects, challenging, but not frustratingly so.- Slight horror sprinkled here and there.- Excellent mystery.			"

If you don't like games with a story that needs you to make sense of it, then this game probably isn't for you. Especially if you don't like games that make you think in general. That being said I loved this game and the way it told it's story. I would not recommend paying $20 for it, that's a rediculous price for what this game is.

What I like about this game:Graphics: The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is one of the most beautiful games I've ever played, whitout a doubt. The landscape is just mindblowing and forced me to stop and just look at it on more than one occasion. The fact that you don't have a UI makes this even better since a lot of times you have your screen look like a picture. Gameplay: I really enjoyed solving every single puzzle/mystery that was thrown at me by this game. Usually games like this one force you down a very linear path. In this game you can, at least to some extent, solve the puzzles in no particular order and even just walk around the amazing Red Creek Valley.Sound: Some games that have horror elements in them sometimes overdo it with the ""scary"" sounds. In TVOEC it had just the right music and sounds to keep me at the edge of my seat and not be annoyed about it. Story/Narration: The story had me hooked until the very end of the game. If you like mystery novels than you will enjoy this game a lot. One thing that stood out for me in particular was the narration that helped the story a lot. Atmosphere: All of the above mentioned points add to this games astoundingly amazing atmosphere. While playing TVOEC I got this feeling that you sometimes get when you read a good book and you just emerge yourself into the world and story of that book. What I did not likeSaving system: Luckily enough I played through the whole game in one go but in TVOEC you cannot save manually. Instead it saves automatically from time to time. Unfortunately those times can be quite far appart and if you have to leave your PC you may lose quite a bit of your progress.Price: As much as I love this game and for me it was worth every cent (I bought it on sale), I personally think it's a little to expensive considering it is not the longest of games. ConclusionThe Vanishing of Ethan Carter is definitely one of the best games I've played. Since the issues with the automatic saving didn't really affect me I have nothing negative to say about the game. Having played through it now I probably also would pay the full price of the game. I seriously hope there will be more games like this one in the near future.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a one huge mystery / walking simulator. Yes, you'll walk alot, but you'll not even care. The game is GORGEOUS! One of the best looking games I've ever seen. It has that photorealistic feel to it, so you may feel like it's real.I said it's a walking simulator, so let's say something about that. You walk alot but in the meaning that you're searching for clues. For clues on how to find the missing boy, Ethan Carter. As the Paul Prospero said in the beginning, you'll need to solve all of the Ethan's stories in order to reveal what happened to him. I don't want to spoil the story, so I just say it's great and indeed, mysterious.It's a bit short, but it's worth it. I don't even blame them, I think the game is good with its 3-5 hrs of gameplay. They don't need to make it really long as those few hours are pretty much enough to uncover what happened to Ethan. And it also means you can happily complete it in one sitting!So this review was short, but enough said. It's gorgeous, filled with great story and voice acting, and while it kinda is a walking simulator, you'll love to walk around this world! I'm not really sure if it's worth the full price, as it is short and replayability is close to none, but if it's on sale, it's a must grab!			"

They don't need to make it really long as those few hours are pretty much enough to uncover what happened to Ethan. And it also means you can happily complete it in one sitting!So this review was short, but enough said. It's gorgeous, filled with great story and voice acting, and while it kinda is a walking simulator, you'll love to walk around this world! I'm not really sure if it's worth the full price, as it is short and replayability is close to none, but if it's on sale, it's a must grab!			"

												What a great story.If you like explorative walking simulators with engaging story get this game. Is it a horror game? No. Is it at least creepy? Yes and might be disturbing to some.Some of you who just want the story might want to grab a guide to nudge you in the right direction(s) and to minimize all the walking. But with scenes this good, it's a joy to walk. The music fits very well too.There are problems with stuttering, it's the engine limitation and probably my old rig showing its age. It kinda break the immersion. Try the UE4 redux version if you can.			"

												Awesome story yet a bit confusing at points.. Puzzles are not too difficult either. The graphics are absolutely brilliant and the endig of the story is beautiful, u really want to find this kid!The only frustrating thing about this game is is that you've got totally no idea which way you should go or if its the right way to go to.. I would definitely recommend this game to other adventure-game players!			"

												It took me 2 attempts to get through this game, but it was definitely worth it.TL;DR: Frustrating at first, but a brilliant experience in the end.The first time I played, the game dropped me into an area surrounded by trees with no instruction of what to do. After wandering around a bit and managing to solve the first 'scene' (without understanding how I'd actually solved it), and I was left to explore a larger area with no idea what I was doing. Super frustrating, I quit.On my second attempt, I had a look at a walkthrough for the first 'scene' after the area I'd already completed. After seeing how the puzzle is solved, and understanding the game mechanics better, I played through solving the rest of the puzzles on my own. Now having an idea of what I was supposed to be doing, I could focus on what the game had to offer, and it was beautiful.The game is full of picturesque landscapes and stunning scenes to look at. You won't even need to try to keep an eye out for these scenic views, they just naturally pop out as you're wandering around following the story, so you won't miss out on anything if you're not specifically looking for the best viewing positions. The screenshots shown on the store page really don't do it justice. Complimenting the gorgous visuals is an excellent soundtrack. It seemed to fit perfectly with what I was seeing, seamlessly transitioning from no music, to a calm serenade, to a haunting background track without you really noticing.The story was engaging, and I loved being a part of piecing the scenes together and then watching it unfold. It was a fantastic experience overall, my only gripe was the lack of instruction, but in hindsight I imagine adding any kind of tutorial or instruction to the start of the game would only ruin the immersion so it's probably better without.Highly recommended as a way to keep yourself entertained for a few hours on a lazy weekend.

												This might be my most recommended game of 2014. It's stunning. Absolutely jaw-dropping gorgeous. The story might follow the same beats as a number of other pieces of ""weird"" fiction, but to call it cliche(as I've heard many do) is kind of nuts. The template is there, sure, but in that template are fairly well-acted and interesting characters. If you're the completionist sort, the kind that wanders around and finds everything, then this game is exactly for you. If you tend to rush from story point to story point, I'd advise caution, as there are wonderful tucked away set pieces that, sadly, you'll have to backtrack for if you don't find them the first time.But seriously: Gorgeous. One to show off your graphics card/have your friends oooh and aaah at. It really shows what the UDK can push out when it's not hampered by iOS or last-gen console compatibility.			"

												I just played this game from start to finish in one sitting. I had been following the game for a while and was very excited but also wary given how similar it seemed to Murdered: Soul Suspect and how that turned out.Well your worries can fade because this game is excellent. The environment is obviously gorgeous and the graphics are astounding for a 20$ open world title, the soundtrack fits the tone perfectly and the atmosphere is both eery and peaceful. The few gameplay elements and puzzles involved are implemented well and don't break the flow of the game at all, it's all very immersive and the detective bits are fun to go through and are solved using sense and logic making it all seem very grounded.The storyline is where I found the game to shine though, it's very HP Lovecraft-esque and those familiar with his work will immediately notice similarities. Clues and information are often discovered out of order and you'll find yourself confused most of the time, struggling to put more and more outlandish facts together into a cohesive story. But I can promise you that the ending is worth it. Some people may not dig it, but that's them, I found it to be both thought provoking and deeply touching.I absolutely recommend this game, it isn't especially long (my playthrough was probably about 5 hours), but it's definitely an experience/game worth having.

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is to Classic Stephen King Horror what Amnesia the Dark Descent was to Lovecraftian Horror. It's a dark, quiet, slow, and disturbing.This is not a game with a rush around every corner or creatures to murder. You are putting together the pieces, uncovering the tale of a child who woke something they shouldn't have. You have to put the puzzle together and stop what was unleashed, armed with some minor psychic abilities and your wits.For some, this game will be to slow, as there is a lot of wandering and observation. But for it's price it delivered a horror-adventure game in a way that is engaging and atmospheric. It was scare you, it will surprise you, and it will make you curse on occasion.For a horror game, I can think of no higher praise.			"

												I'll keep this short and to the point. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a lot like Dear Esther, but with some actual gameplay and with a very Lovecraftian twist. It's a detective-story wraped in a stunningly beautiful and strangely haunting package. If you enjoy a good narrative experience, like the previously mentioned Dear Esther or the more recent Gone Home, you will definitely enjoy this as well. Also have a look at it if you are a fan of H.P. Lovecraft, as it borrows some pretty great elements of his stories.			"

												This is one of the most visually stunning games you'll play and also one of the most intriguing.As the game itself says, it won't hold your hand, so you're on your own to explore the open world available to you - something that is most pleasing on the eye.In place of any action there's a series of events for you to discover and solve.  This is where the game comes into it's element.  Finding the clues and piecing them together in sequence is where this game comes into it's element.  The developers have created an incredible way of performing these parts of the game.  So much so that you'll definitely want to see the game through to the end.+ Stunning visuals+ Captivating storyline (especially at the end)+ Puzzle-solving element is amazingly well done- It's short. 4-5 hours should see you through, including all achievements- Some backtracking or loss of direction can take you momentarily out of the moment(I played the Redux version of the game)			"

												If you always wondered what video games could look like if developers didn't have to water down the graphics to make their games run on consoles, then this is the game for you. This game is stunning, and thats coming from a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥. Its like you are controlling a movie as far as visuals go. I haven't got very far into the game yet, but once you start playing it, the graphics alone will keep you hooked. Tip: Buy this game once you have decent hardware to run it on, otherwise you will waste the first play-thru experience. I am running the game on an i7-4790K + GTX 980 + 16GB config and my framerate stays between 75 - 130 on Ultra settings with 4x MSAA and Nvidia Control Panel set to ""High Quality."" This should give you a rough idea of what to expect.We need more PC game developers like this one. "

												A waste of time and money. Built on an Unreal Engine 3, the environment is attractive but it casts the mind back to Half-Life 2.The ""Open Environment"" that ""allows you to roam around and explore"" is no such thing, in fact it is a cookie-cutter, one-way game without imagination. The puzzles over simplistic other than for the house which can is overly complicated and relies on cheating.The game claims that it won't lead you by the hand, because they don't know how to develop a learning ramp for the user, which is steep but caps pretty quickly and doesn't develop further.After all the hype, I was seriously expecting something great and instead I found myself with a 12 year old's creation, and no, the game wasn't created by the protagonist.The characters are simplistic and one-dimensional, the main character has no feelings for anyone yet there is no indication otherwise of sociopathy. The graphics that depended on the artist's skills, bloated, ugly and unrealistic.Overall, disappointing and a waste of good money. Cudos on knowing how to place previously designed rocks, tree or grass on top of one another. Un-cudos on the buggy environment that prevents you from jumping over a speck of dust blocking your way.			"

 Is it just me it's too short? What a great game to play on christmas in one go. With it's unique gameplay (close one's are S.Holmes games), immersive graphics and mind bogling storyline, you'll just want more. The puzzles are not challenging though (although I accidentally triggered the mother(witch?) thing and have to use a walkthrough for the final achievement) . It easily became one of the memorable games I've played.			"

												Says it does not hold your hand but it is literally the most hand held mystery game i have ever played. You literally can see the size 36 font text above mysterious items from almost 30ft away. Not to mention you get to use floating letters as a personal aimbot to find out where all the clues are.Basically you just walk around keeping your eyes peeled for size 36 font letters and you will win in no time.All joking aside however this game really does have the best graphics i have ever seen in my life. So for that its worth the $7 alone "

Product received for free
												A gorgeous game with a beautiful story and a brilliant soundtrack. You get to investigate a few murders and deduce the order of the events that took place. The only thing I disliked about it is the fact that it's so short, and there's a maze section that can be quite frustrating to explore, although it has been made better in the redux version. The redux version also offers a fast-travel system that can be really helpful for backtracking after beating the game. I really enjoyed it.			"

												* My gameplay time is very short for the original game because I played the Redux Unreal Engine 4 version.  The redux version is graphically superior to the original and the version you should play if you decide to purchase this game.The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a game that does not live up to its potential.  The atmosphere and graphics are great, but the gameplay and story feel lackluster.  There are some intriguing moments like the mysterious astronaut and the last coal miner.  But this game needed more of these moments to further build the protagonist and to keep the audience intrigued in mystery.  I think the story buildup of the murders and the villain is too simplistic and could have used more dialogue and character development.  The puzzles are too simple to solve and the only intriguing one was the house with portals.7/10			"

												A waste of time and money. Built on an Unreal Engine 3, the environment is attractive but it casts the mind back to Half-Life 2.The ""Open Environment"" that ""allows you to roam around and explore"" is no such thing, in fact it is a cookie-cutter, one-way game without imagination. The puzzles over simplistic other than for the house which can is overly complicated and relies on cheating.The game claims that it won't lead you by the hand, because they don't know how to develop a learning ramp for the user, which is steep but caps pretty quickly and doesn't develop further.After all the hype, I was seriously expecting something great and instead I found myself with a 12 year old's creation, and no, the game wasn't created by the protagonist.The characters are simplistic and one-dimensional, the main character has no feelings for anyone yet there is no indication otherwise of sociopathy. The graphics that depended on the artist's skills, bloated, ugly and unrealistic.Overall, disappointing and a waste of good money. Cudos on knowing how to place previously designed rocks, tree or grass on top of one another. Un-cudos on the buggy environment that prevents you from jumping over a speck of dust blocking your way.			"

												I got into this one for my wife, who likes low-difficulty level (coordination-wise) games.  I tag these games with ""No Combat"".  Anyway, Ethan Carter is definitely a no-combat game.  And, honestly, I usually find these types of less-hands-on, less-player-interactive games quite boring, like, oh, the granddaddy of all snoozefests, Myst.  This qualification, I think, is important here.  It tells you a) that this IS one of those (basically) minimalist point and click adventures and b) despite disliking these games, I found enough intriguing about Ethan Carter to invest in it for myself.  There's no denying it's lush, and not just graphically.  The storytelling is right up there in the lush department as well, although not in terms of minute detail, but more in terms of coherent, well thought out, and above all good and interesting and intriguing story.  The only complaint I have with the story is in sputtering pacing.  It almost seems as if there are a few puzzles missing.  The, well, I guess you'd call them side quests, help to flesh out the backstory of Red Creek Valley and enhance the main story, but are not required as far as I can tell.  If I had to compare Ethan Carter to other works, I don't think it would be to another game at all.  I'd compare it more to an earlier Stephen King novel set in Castle Rock, perhaps Salem's Lot or Pet Cemetery.  It has that Stephen King brand of casual creepiness to it that makes it more of a hybrid media, not-quite-game, interactive storytelling experience.  While not necessarily linear, per se, I can't see anything that allows for changes in the story (i.e. player choice doesn't effect the world).  But that's not a bad thing any more than a novel not rewriting itself the second time you read it is a bad thing.  All in all, if you understand what you're getting into, I can highly recommend The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, even at full price, which is still a third of current A-list titles.			"

												This is an atmospheric, exploration, puzzle game with a great ""narrative experience that does not hold your hand."" The game opens with that claim, and it certainly holds true.  I loved every minute of this game (minus the one puzzle that deliberately tries to scare you).  This is the most beautiful game I've ever played, and the story it tells is revealed in pieces as you explore the stunning world.  This combines for not only a great narrative experience, but a game that rewards exploration of the world that was so lovingly crafted for your enjoyment.The clues for each investigation actually make sense, and finding them is an enjoyable, rewarding experience.  However, piecing together the story for each case once you have the clues is often a trial-and-error approach.  I would like them to be a little more intuitive but overall I didn't feel that the solutions were completely arbitrary (which is a flaw present in many other detective-type games).  The ending is open to interpretation, but I felt it did a good job to tie all the stories together and finally give you an explanation about why you're in Red Creek Valley and who your character is.I played the Redux version, which saves every time you do something meaningful, so you no longer have to worry about solving an entire area before the game will save.My interpretation of the story:Ethan is the only one who dies.  He wrote stories about each of his family members, but they were nothing but stories.  The mysteries you solve are the stories he wrote.  His family members didn't actually kill each other.  The negativity toward Ethan is likely an emotional outcry for his family never supporting him in life (the audio clips you hear always have his family putting aside his stories and not reading them or supporting his creativity).  I would guess Ethan is the sleeper, and ""the sleeper must not sleep"" may refer to Ethan's daydreaming and story writing.Your detective character is just another one of Ethan's stories, but in a way you are tied to Ethan himself.  In fact, you are Ethan's final story before the house accidentally gets set on fire.  He created you, and when you finally discover the truth about what happened to Ethan--that he is suffocating in a house fire--your story ends, just as Ethan's story is ended.  The entire game is a compilation of Ethan's stories, wrapped up in his final story about a supernatural detective. "

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.i will keep this review short as there is very little to be said without spoiling the story of the game.The Vanishing of Ethan Carter kept my heart racing through every terrifying isolated moment of this game, it's a horror mystery that delivers a relatively inclined reason to continue playing and while it is short i personally feel it is very very worth it, the game is truely an emotional experience and all in all was brilliantly put together, the graphics create one of the most beautiful enviroments and the person who voices the main character was absolutely incredible.note: this is not a horror game, do not confuse it for one. it gives a spooky setting but there is no horror aspect to the gameplay, it is specifically a mystery game, if you enjoy Mystery games then i advise looking into buying it.

												A beautiful, story-based game with a perfect soundtrack.  You can tell it's doing a lot of things right by the sheer tenacity of the trolls in the community hub.Given the passion of the trolls, you can correctly infer that the game is about in-depth exploration, not fighting.  If that sounds appealing, you'll likely love this game.  However, it should be noted that the game DOES have exactly one area with a real, traditional, troll-approved monster roaming around.  It's an unpleasant desgin choice, given how well the rest of the game is tailored to the exact sort of player who would hate that.  On the other hand, if this is a concern of yours, please note that you can easily look up the details of this in advance.  (Not immediately.  The game itself will quite directly warn you when it's time to do so.  Spoilers can be kept to an absolute minimum.)  If you do research the area before heading in, the challenge of avoiding the monster is fairly minimal.  I did exactly that and never ""died.""  Also, note that the penalty for this ""death"" is minimal.Aside from that, this game was amazing.   Go for it.			"

												I just finished this game and all I can say is that it was a massive let down. My play time is posted, obviously, so you can decided for yourself if that warrants a 20 USD price tag. Yes, the graphics are stunning, easily some of the best outdoor enviroments I've seen to date. Combine that with the ambient soundtrack, and you're sure to get sucked into this world from the get go. Unfortunately the absolute joke of (or lack of) a story ruins it once you figure out what's going on in this beautiful valley. I bought this game because I was under the impression it told a great story influenced by classic weird fiction authors. So if you're considering buying it for that reason I'm telling you now that is not the case with this game apart from a few cringeworthy Lovecraft references.  The developers even created a blog post on their site explaining/defending their story. You shouldn't have to address such issues if you truly tell a good tale. http://www.theastronauts.com/2014/10/vanishing-ethan-carters-ending-extreme-spoilers/If you think the graphics are worth the money then go for it, but you won't get much else here.

												Bought this as wanted to support the guys that made Bulletstorm and GoW Judgement, both excellent experiences. This one...not so much. Total disappointment. It combines the worst aspects of a walking sim with a terrible save system. Hey Astronauts, there's no point to a Dark Souls/Destiny-like save system in a WALKING SIM. All you're forcing people to do is walk the same paths again and again. There's no reward, no real interaction. Your character just walks around clicking at stuff and listening to the odd voice/plot expo. The map is indeed huge, but it's also quite empty and just leads to frustration. And again, the save system is broken. When it says ""saving scene"", if you quit and restart, you will not be where it was supposed to save. Yes, the visuals are quite nice, but there's very regular stutter on my PC, which is running this on high with 2XMSAA. Most of the time framerate is smooth, but it'll stutter regularly when loading new areas in the background i suppose.In short, a big big letdown. Part of the risk of supporting the industry, but still a shame. 4/10			"

												I'm usually a fan of narrative story games like this, and the game is beautiful, though the story just didn't thrill me.It's a mix of supernatural detective story, unreliable narrator and kids imagination.			"

												Looks amazing, but there's really not much here. The puzzles are few and far between, often trial and error over logic. The story seemed really interesting until it became super obvious, then tedious. If you don't do everything perfect the first go, which means often stumbling on puzzles, you have to run back through the entire game. Visually though, pretty incredible.			"

												**WARNING** SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW!    To be honest, I knew very little of this game leading up to its release, which is why I was excited about playing it. The less I know the more I'll be surprised by the actual content of the game. Unfortunately the only surprise I felt was that I was suckered into paying 20 bucks for a 4 hour game.    While the first 1/3 of the game shows a lot of potential with the introduction of a unique crime scene gameplay mechanic, interesting mystery and one fantastic puzzle, the game never evolves beyond this point and becomes incredibly closed-in despite what the environments try to convince you. SECOND WARNING! SPOILERS BELOW!    I'll summarize briefly, but the story is your character, Paul Prospero, has received a disturbing fan letter from a boy named Ethan Carter. Concerned that Ethan is in grave danger, Paul arrives at Red Creek Valley to investigate. Along the way you begin to unravel the events surrounding the murders of Ethan's family members, as well as exploring the depths of Ethan's imagination through his story pages.   What's disappointing is the ending doesn't really have the emotionally gripping payoff I think the developers were hoping for. To put it simply, Ethan Carter in his (possibly) final moments while trapped in a room during a house fire, has imagined the entire scenario, including your main character Paul Prospero.     Instead of being pulled into that ending emotionally, I was left thrown out of it asking ""ok, then why did these imaginary murders occur the way they did?"" Beyond the idea that Ethan Carter hated his abusive and resentful family, the way each family member are killed doesn't really say anything in particular about how Ethan related to each of them.    The potential was there, cause the scenarios surrounding Ethan's story pages have great imagery that really keep you in suspsense and feel connected to the ending, but the murder scenarios lack this and feel like they occurred the way they did ""just cause."" This wouldn't have been such a big issue with me except these scenarios were a big part of the story and ultimately wasted otherwise well-handled characters (Particularly due to the voice actors and what the player learns about them through reading material).    Also, apparently the idea for good symbolism for a particular murder scene was to just throw Crow's all over the place. So not only did they use an overrused concept, but it was done in the most generic and casual way possible.  My final gripe is the price tag. Charging players 20 dollars for a four hour game? Nothing short of ridiculous. Maybe there could of been more content and depth to the story if the majority of the game's time and resources weren't devoted to its environment, which to no surprise looks great.   So to put it simply, I think the big issue for me came down to the handling of the story. Unfortunately, Since this game is essentially a sight-seeing tour with a few gameplay mechanics dispersed here and there along the narrative, the story was very much a make-or-break factor in this game, and it just doesn't live up to its potential.

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a nice little exploration-mystery game. It is beautiful, has a great setting and atmosphere, and have puzzles and detective bits that may stump you for a bit, but they're ultimately fairly doable. You walk around the location searching for clues to solve the deaths of Ethan's family members. Backtracking is not a requirement, but if you somehow miss out on solving a murder or a puzzle, you can just backtrack. It seems vast, but on the overall the location is not that big. It may get a bit off-putting if you end up having to backtrack many times. I would say it should take the average gamer 4-5 hours to complete the game. If you manage to ""go with the flow"" and solve everything fairly straightforwardly, you could finish the game in around 3 hours.The game mechanics are fine. First, you need to find all items at the murder scene, then tag them in the order in which they happened. Some trial and error may be required for certain scenes. I think it's a fairly decent game. There could have been more things to do, since the map does seem a bit large for what there is in the game. Another thing is that the mouse feels very floaty. It seems like there is a lot of weight attached to it. My biggest complaint though is that the game stutters like nobody's business. You can confirm this by just looking into the forums. Whatever settings I choose, I get stutters every 5-10 seconds or so. For a game that primes itself on the atmosphere and setting, this is a real deal breaker. Another thing is that this game is extremely graphically intensive. Even on the lowest possible settings, I get mid 40fps when I am in the middle of trees. And basically every other part of the game has trees. Basides, many graphics settings like Ambient Occlusion and FXAA do not seem to work.I would recommend this game for those who don't mind something slower paced, or just want to take in the breathtaking visuals. Perhaps not at the full price though (I got it at 40% off).			"

												I really like this game. The visuals are beautiful, the storyline is intriguing, but if you have problems with motion sickness, this is probably not the game for you. I played for a few hours today, but needed to take a break after about two because I started feeling ill. I made all the setting adjustments others had suggested to help with motion sickness and after a break, tried to play again. However after another hour of gameplay, I actually ended up getting sick. Consider yourself warned!			"

												I was debating this with myself for a moment, before finally picking thumbs down for this one. There's aspects I really like, such as the overall atmosphere, visuals, music and story elements. It's all very atmospheric and well done. But there is ultimately too little content for the asking price and too little game for a, well... game. I don't feel particularly cheated or even that I wasted my money on this game, it's just not a ""game"" I'll recommend to anyone else at its current 19€ price point. For people on the fence, I recommend picking it up in a future sale. It's a nice experience while it lasts, but there's simply not enough game here.			"

												The Unreal Engine is impressive. This game is quite pretty to look at. Beautiful textures and nice lighting effects make for an excellent looking game. A small gripe, though, are the character models - they are quite stiff, comparatively dated looking, and do not animate well. Unfortunately the game design is not as impressive as the visuals, minus character models. It's at times very unclear what your next objective is; not that hand-holding is a must for modern day video games, but so often the puzzles require an unnecessary attention to environmental detail. Many of the ""must find"" contextual puzzle pieces are very tricky to spot, resulting in aimless wandering for too much time. An example of this is trying to find the missing rock during the game's first detective scene. The story is interesting - and the thing that holds this game together. It's just unfortunate that it's marred by poor game design. Not really recommended. 5/10			"

												Right when you start the game it warns you that it is a ""narrative"" and is 100% true.  You don't really ""play"" this game, you just go along with the story.  It took me 3 hours to finish the entire game, getting every achievement.  This is way too short.  Ethan's stories (no spoilers) are both engaging and the highlight of this narrative, but they are only 5.  The graphics are good, and the story too, but I just can't recommend this game.  Puzzles were way too easy, achievements were way too easy - nothing in this game was challenging - 100% narrative - walkthrough a story.*Note-I played the Redux version first, first run through took 3 hours.  Then I played the normal version to see what is different - that run through took one hour.  Really couldn't tell any difference between the two versions. "

If you have a closed mind and can't play a game for an experience rather than a kill count, you will not enjoy this game.  I, however, welcome these types of experiences.

												I was very excited about this game.  The deal breaker for me though is the way the game handles saving.  You cannot save whenever you want, you cannot save on exit.  The game auto-saves when it feels like it as the story progresses and it doesn't tell you when it last saved so when you've had enough and you want to do something different with your life for a while besides playng this game you go to exit and are informed that all of your progress since your last auto-save (whenever that was) will be lost.  So unless you plan on keeping this game running 24x7 until you finish it, or just re-doing a lot of stuff due to the fact that your real life obligations didn't coincide with when the game silently saved...

												This is a roughly 4 hour game where you walk across Red Creek Valley, 'renact' connected murders along the way, by ordering a sequence/chain of events (usually). You do this by finding 'clues' in the area. There are about 8-10 of these scenes.

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a terrific exploration game that truly does not hold your hand. As I write this review I've actually been playing closer to 5 hours so disregard what Steam says. Here the dev made story telling simple yet incredibly fascinating. You start by walking down the tunnel and being introduced to who you're playing as. A detective by the name of Paul Prospero. You find out that Ethan knows things that no child should and decide to investigate WTF is going on. Thus, the game starts.WARNING: THIS GAME HAS  A SECTION WITH JUMP SCARES.

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is the debut title from Polish developer The Astronauts founded by former People Can Fly (Painkiller, Bulletstorm) founder Adrian Chmielarz. As an adventure game with an emphasis on exploration and atmosphere without any combat whatsoever, it’s definitely a departure for the designer. The players assume the role of Paul Prospero, a detective with paranormal abilities who comes to picturesque Red Creek Valley after receiving a letter from a young boy named Ethan Carter. It is clear from the beginning that Ethan is missing, but everything else is up to you to uncover. There is no tutorial, there is no hand holding.The most striking thing about the game from the first second is how gorgeous it looks. You start off in a dark patch of forest, but very soon you’ll reach a bridge providing a breathtaking look at the valley. It makes a strong statement for realism and art being able to co-exist in a single beautiful package. The sense of scale is impressive as well. Even though in reality this is a fairly linear game, it is designed in such a way that it gives the illusion of grand scale. It masterfully escapes that ugly feeling that you’re being pushed down a singular narrow path. This is also reflected in the puzzles and storytelling. You can solve the puzzles in any order you wish and you’ll probably even miss some as well as you go along. However, you need to solve them all if you wish to see the very ending.There are two types of puzzles: solving a murder and experiencing a supernatural short story written by Ethan that you can find wandering about. Solving a murder revolves around finding a body and several key items and then piecing together the chronology of events which will then unfold before you. It is a really interesting and effective method of storytelling that ensures that the player feels involved in what happened even though he is just an observer. Both the murders and Ethan’s stories give small yet interesting glimpses of insight into the relationships within the Carter family and the strange and tragic events which took place. The puzzles themselves are fairly simple and the narrative is light, but the sense of immersion and atmosphere is very strong throughout. I will also provide a small hint regarding the puzzles which may prevent you from wandering around aimlessly too much. Each puzzle is a separate scene, this means that all of the necessary items and solutions regarding the puzzle are nearby, you won’t find an item in one location that you will need to use somewhere else.The terrific soundtrack and sound design are also a big part of the great immersion and atmosphere. A haunting piano melody or the soft rustling of leaves in the wind go a long way to establish a sense of presence, you really feel like you’re there yourself. It’s a game of contrasts. Beautiful and serene in one moment, creepy and uneasy in the second. You’re trekking through an idyllic landscape only to uncover abandoned, dilapidated buildings and mutilated bodies. And it all comes together in a refreshingly unexpected ending that will give you pause and provide you with something to think about even if for only a moment.The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a truly great adventure game with a fantastically realized game world brimming with clever design that will keep you motivated to uncover the secrets it hides.8 OUT OF 10 (GREAT)			"

They speak to me the most, fit my personality the most, are the ones I have the best mind for, and a pretty good one at that, at least I believe. It was while I was seeing if it was plausible to get a twitch streamer I use to watch to play a fav of mine, that one or two other watchers said in the chat that this game was the new hot point & click game to play. I prefer my point & click games to be ones where you socialize. Ones where you talk to people and are immediately told where you are and what the deal is. So I was off put at first that this game doesn't do either of those things. You're completely lost, isolated, and don't know where you are, and no one is around. It's a game where you're supposed to feel lonely. Since I suffer from chronic depression IRL, partly caused by loneliness, I really disliked at first this aspect. After the second attempt to play this is when I got successfully hooked.I hate the gamer mentality of ""I dub this game really good at being pretty, beautiful, and atmospheric, RIGHT NOW AS SOON I'M STARTING IT!"" It's pretentious, and puts pressure on people thinking of playing the game to display as much ""good behavior"" pretension. I say no, it's better to be an ""a**hole"", and appreciate the beauty and atmosphere, IDK, when your on your flippin' death bed, as long as it's after playing the game for a nice long time/well after you've finished it. I don't give an f when I first start it, no one deserves to get that much sucking up. It's better to never say the game is beautiful than to say it is at record speed.The memory I have of the feeling I got from the game after getting into it AFTER A GOOD WHILE OF PLAYING IT,  I liked quite a lot. That's what is suppose to happen. The key to games like this is suppose to be time, and a lot of it. I REMEMBER it being beautiful and atmospheric in a pretty solidly good way. It's mechanics and challenges took some getting use to, but they where pretty good too.My biggest complaint is the story. It's a good story up until the end. To keep this spoiler free, I'll keep it to just saying this: 60's and 70's folk music artists like Simon & Garfunkel, who sang regularly about how much it sucks to live in the big city and how they'd rather feel the earth beneath their feet, apparently where completely wrong according to whoever wrote this game. According to him, if you move out to the wilderness with your family, the adults you live with will apparently NOT WANT YOU to enjoy the earth beneath your feet. They rather you burn to death than experience the outside. So stop complaining and just shut up Simon & Garfunkel, the city is just fine to be trapped in. THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!!!!I recommend this game, just ignore to asinine writing toward the end.			"

												Great story driven game with beautiful sceneries. A bit short (less than 2 h if you find everything at once, maybe 3-4 if you explore a lot). There are times where I just stopped and had to look at the view.Inspired me to do my very first gameplay video on youtube.Is it worth it? Yes!Is it worth 19Euro? I do think so, yes, there are crappier games for same or more money our there which I played and enjoyed less.In short: great graphics, interesting story adventure story, supernatural twist. A bit short. Price acceptable.			"

												First of all, the most important thing about this game: It's a WALKING SIMULATOR. It's something you should definitely know about before you decide to purchase it. What do I mean with this term? The game has very little interaction ond the gameplay is limited to walking around, touching an occasional item or reading some notes. But most of the time, you're just walking, looking at absolutely gorgeous landscapes. . I have nothing against games, where you don't fight or which simply aren't very dynamic - one of my absolutely favourite games is Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and truth be told, I expected something at least remotely similar with Vanishing of Ethan Carter. Maybe not so dark, but with a similar level of interaction, story unraveling slowly by notes, letters or diaries, and the element of threat, which you can't fight directly. Found neither of these of course - there is little you can do in the world of the game, and the puzzles are either nonexistent, or very, very easy and linear. There were parts of the game which I completed without even trying to think about them - just touched the only interactive object around or followed something. So, is the game challenging? No, definitely not. The story is something, that should be the strongest point of such game. When you can't do much with the world and objects, there is no threat of any kind and no people to interact with (the game doesn't have a single npc, apart from watching the cutscenes from the past), it is the story's role to keep the player invested. And unfortunately, the game failed for me even here. The story, while it has its strong points and seems quite intriguing, definitely inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, isn't really mindblowing. Storytelling is rather clumsy, closed in few cutscenes <SPOILERS AHEAD> where the character witnesses the murders of various people or listens to short dialogues between Ethan and his family. The characters are the weakest point of the story in my opinion - they appear to be very, very flat. A mean older brother, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ uncle, timid father... they are all just black and white trophies, with rather questionable relationships. It's obvious that player should sympathize with Ethan, who is nice and likes to write stories, while his unkind, ignorant or cruel relatives are supposed to be the antagonists. It's a very naive sort of a story, even with a nice twist at the end, I wouldn't call it well-written or interesting. <END OF SPOILERS>What about positives? Well, the game is absolutely breathtaking. Beautiful locations, great atmosphere, a load of details showing the effort that was put into building the world... a lot of elements just makes the game visually gorgeous. There were many places where I just stood and looked at around, completely enchanted by how amazingly it all looks like. Music is almost a spiritual experience, it fits the locations and scenes perfectly, not to mention how beautiful it is on its own. Atmosphere, created by both visuals and music is the strongest point of the game for my opinion. Walking around the forest near the town or exploring the vale with the lake is a great experience, I was absolutely amazed by these locations and the tracks chosen for them. Overally, the game was an interesting, though rather disappointing experience, especially with so many positive reviews. I personally didn't enjoy it too much, felt rather frustrated by the specific storytelling and lack of challenge, but I liked the atmosphere, music and visuals. Exploring the valley is a great experience on its own, but I think it feels more like an interactive demo for Unreal engine, than actual game. There's little to no interaction for the player, you are there to witness, not to participate, which makes the gameplay very passive. You have no influence over anything, and the fact that you arrive after the events, being able only to see what happened, gives a feeling that you actually missed the story. It would be far more interesting if unraveling the past was combined with participating in some current events.Also, this game definitely isn't a horror. Is it even actualy scary? No. Disturbing? Not really. Intense? Definitely not. Quite eerie, but if you're looking for a scary game, look somewhere else. There is literally one jumpscare, but it's rather weak, resembling a bit the screamer videos. Also, walking right into it has no concequences and it can be easily avoided. If you like games like Dear Esther or Gone Home, you'll be delighted. If you're looking for something more interactive... think twice. Another thing to point out is how short the game is - it took me only three hours to complete it, and I'm the kind of player who tries to explore, find and see everyting.			"

												If you are unintelligent I highly recommend not playing this game. It requires thinking, and a lot of looking to finish this game. If you do figure out some of the tricky puzzles, and can use your brain for critical thinking then this is the game for you it has phenomenal graphics, and an even more incredible story! 8/10 - JSquilly			"

												This game is not meant for those who don't admire every aspect of the game.In no means are you meant to sprint through the story, but instead, walk slowly, investigate, and listen.The Vanishing of Ethan Carter tells the story of a boy long lost, but can he ever be found or will the remains of his story be a mystery?

												This is a roughly 4 hour game where you walk across Red Creek Valley, 'renact' connected murders along the way, by ordering a sequence/chain of events (usually). You do this by finding 'clues' in the area. There are about 8-10 of these scenes. I think it is apt to say that Ethan Carter is more an ""experience"" rather than a traditional game, where you do lots of stuff- there is an interesting story, breathtaking graphics, and nothing more. If you want something more than this, do not get this game.			"

												Completed fully the game within the span of 4 hours of gameplay, even after searching all the crooks and crannies, but still worth it.Firstly, it is an absolutely beautiful game. If you have a 4K screen, you really won't be disapointed with the high graphic settings. The landscape is quite similar to the dreamy pictures of certain alpine/european pictures I've seen on the webs.Will not give any spoilers (really, you need to experience everything yourself to truly enjoy it), but if anyone else has a phobia of zombies/ghost stuff, there's one part of the game where you might experience it (MIGHT since, you can pretty much walk past it). Gave me the absolute hibbie jibbies... but it's a short moment overall.So overall: Beautiful, can be quite creepy at times with the music, great new style for detective kind of games and most of all, wouldn't be as amazing if it didn't have a plot twist in the end ;)			"

												An honest review: This game looks fantastic and it runs great. The story is interesting and the twist at the end is quite nice.My only beef with this game is that it's quite short (took 3 hours to finish) and after the first few puzzles the investigation mechanics just seemed to make and the puzzles seem really easy and obvious.The game mentions that it doesn't want to hold your hand but I felt like the events in the game followed a pretty linear progression. Perhaps if the world was opened up a bit or if there were more events this might have helped.That said, it's still a great indie game.			"

												On the plus side, the game looks gorgeous, sounds beautiful, and is very well voice acted.  I won't elaborate on these, other than to say - look at those screenshots, they aren't lying.  I also like the investigative aspect; I appreciate games featuring detective player avatars ... that can actually detect their way out of a paper bag - Paul looks at evidence and actually comes to intelligent conclusions about what happened!  On the negative side, it was short, yet went on too long.  You can't beat the game without finding and solving everything.  Yes, finding, and some of the plot scenes are decently hard to find.  You can either (as I did) consult a guide, or play hunt-the-pixel in a 3d world.  Also, the investigations sometimes involve the same problem, hunting for all the hotspots in order to progress. I also take issue with the plot.  Basically, it isn't very scary.  Ethan Carter doesn't build tension well because the pacing is off.  You yourself are never in danger at all, so any tension would theoretically revolve around either a rush to save Ethan, or a burning drive to know what happened.  The problem is you barely get to know any of the characters, or see anything about their world, so it's hard to get drawn in that way.  The net effect is a moody story, but not really a very scary one.  Also, I did not really like certain spoileriffic aspects of the ending.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is the debut title from Polish developer The Astronauts founded by former People Can Fly (Painkiller, Bulletstorm) founder Adrian Chmielarz. As an adventure game with an emphasis on exploration and atmosphere without any combat whatsoever, it’s definitely a departure for the designer. The players assume the role of Paul Prospero, a detective with paranormal abilities who comes to picturesque Red Creek Valley after receiving a letter from a young boy named Ethan Carter. It is clear from the beginning that Ethan is missing, but everything else is up to you to uncover. There is no tutorial, there is no hand holding.The most striking thing about the game from the first second is how gorgeous it looks. You start off in a dark patch of forest, but very soon you’ll reach a bridge providing a breathtaking look at the valley. It makes a strong statement for realism and art being able to co-exist in a single beautiful package. The sense of scale is impressive as well. Even though in reality this is a fairly linear game, it is designed in such a way that it gives the illusion of grand scale. It masterfully escapes that ugly feeling that you’re being pushed down a singular narrow path. This is also reflected in the puzzles and storytelling. You can solve the puzzles in any order you wish and you’ll probably even miss some as well as you go along. However, you need to solve them all if you wish to see the very ending.There are two types of puzzles: solving a murder and experiencing a supernatural short story written by Ethan that you can find wandering about. Solving a murder revolves around finding a body and several key items and then piecing together the chronology of events which will then unfold before you. It is a really interesting and effective method of storytelling that ensures that the player feels involved in what happened even though he is just an observer. Both the murders and Ethan’s stories give small yet interesting glimpses of insight into the relationships within the Carter family and the strange and tragic events which took place. The puzzles themselves are fairly simple and the narrative is light, but the sense of immersion and atmosphere is very strong throughout. I will also provide a small hint regarding the puzzles which may prevent you from wandering around aimlessly too much. Each puzzle is a separate scene, this means that all of the necessary items and solutions regarding the puzzle are nearby, you won’t find an item in one location that you will need to use somewhere else.The terrific soundtrack and sound design are also a big part of the great immersion and atmosphere. A haunting piano melody or the soft rustling of leaves in the wind go a long way to establish a sense of presence, you really feel like you’re there yourself. It’s a game of contrasts. Beautiful and serene in one moment, creepy and uneasy in the second. You’re trekking through an idyllic landscape only to uncover abandoned, dilapidated buildings and mutilated bodies. And it all comes together in a refreshingly unexpected ending that will give you pause and provide you with something to think about even if for only a moment.The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a truly great adventure game with a fantastically realized game world brimming with clever design that will keep you motivated to uncover the secrets it hides.8 OUT OF 10 (GREAT)			"

												8/10A MUST HAVE even if you are not a fan of walking simulators/adventure games.Despite the strain on eyes (read below) I enjoyed the game a lot. It's a shame it is that short and feels like a part of a series (which I hope to happen).Pros:+Great story and storytelling+Eye pleasing graphics, simply running around and sightseeing is a nice experience+Interesting puzzle mechanics and gameplay+Good music and voiceactingCons:-The game is rather short (around 3h, I played redux, which you get free of charge, thats why it says 0.1h for me)-This might be personal, but the blur in this game is very straining on my eyes. Literally had to take breakes every 15-30 mins. And its not about the settings, game seems to immitate real eye view, so the middle of the screen is the sharpest while the edges are blurry.			"

												When it comes to me and my relationship with video games, Point & Click genre games are my main one. They speak to me the most, fit my personality the most, are the ones I have the best mind for, and a pretty good one at that, at least I believe. It was while I was seeing if it was plausible to get a twitch streamer I use to watch to play a fav of mine, that one or two other watchers said in the chat that this game was the new hot point & click game to play. I prefer my point & click games to be ones where you socialize. Ones where you talk to people and are immediately told where you are and what the deal is. So I was off put at first that this game doesn't do either of those things. You're completely lost, isolated, and don't know where you are, and no one is around. It's a game where you're supposed to feel lonely. Since I suffer from chronic depression IRL, partly caused by loneliness, I really disliked at first this aspect. After the second attempt to play this is when I got successfully hooked.I hate the gamer mentality of ""I dub this game really good at being pretty, beautiful, and atmospheric, RIGHT NOW AS SOON I'M STARTING IT!"" It's pretentious, and puts pressure on people thinking of playing the game to display as much ""good behavior"" pretension. I say no, it's better to be an ""a**hole"", and appreciate the beauty and atmosphere, IDK, when your on your flippin' death bed, as long as it's after playing the game for a nice long time/well after you've finished it. I don't give an f when I first start it, no one deserves to get that much sucking up. It's better to never say the game is beautiful than to say it is at record speed.The memory I have of the feeling I got from the game after getting into it AFTER A GOOD WHILE OF PLAYING IT,  I liked quite a lot. That's what is suppose to happen. The key to games like this is suppose to be time, and a lot of it. I REMEMBER it being beautiful and atmospheric in a pretty solidly good way. It's mechanics and challenges took some getting use to, but they where pretty good too.My biggest complaint is the story. It's a good story up until the end. To keep this spoiler free, I'll keep it to just saying this: 60's and 70's folk music artists like Simon & Garfunkel, who sang regularly about how much it sucks to live in the big city and how they'd rather feel the earth beneath their feet, apparently where completely wrong according to whoever wrote this game. According to him, if you move out to the wilderness with your family, the adults you live with will apparently NOT WANT YOU to enjoy the earth beneath your feet. They rather you burn to death than experience the outside. So stop complaining and just shut up Simon & Garfunkel, the city is just fine to be trapped in. THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!!!!I recommend this game, just ignore to asinine writing toward the end.			"

												Great game and awesome experience. Look's and feel's great, but has some optimization issues which cause fps drops. I give it 7/10 because said issues, and the fact that it's really short, took under 5 hours to do and explore everything it has to offer.			"

												Being a fan of games like Dear Ester, Gone Home, and the likes, I had very high hopes for this game. Alas my disappointment was big. Very.After several annoying bugs I finally got the game to work and was set for a few hours.The atmosphere Red Creek Valley sets is perfect. It looks beautiful, it sounds perfect and your goals and how to find them become clear soon enough.But then the flaws begin to trickle through.Red Creek Valley is big. Too big. All too soon you find yourself searching for a needle in a haystack.Oh, did you miss that? Well, better go back or you won't be able to finish the game!To me, that's not the game's disclaimer ""not holding your hand"", that's developers being to lazy to create something that makes sense as a whole. It's like a world with very few random interactive spots thrown around, to not distract you too much from their beautiful graphics simulator.And when you finally find something to keep you from falling asleep during those long hikes, it's equally boring and unintuitive. Puzzles, if you can call them that, are way to easy and are a mere distraction. And when you are backtracking a story you find yourself running around looking for items like a fool, in places these items would never be. Tedious.As far as the story itself, there are parts that are very creative, and made me regain my interests, and then there are parts that made me go: ""Oh dear."" Especially the ending, which, to be honest, turned an OK story into a pretty silly one.All in all, I would only recommend this game if you could get it in a sale, and want to run around in beautiful Red Creek Valley. Don't bother about the story, though, you'll just get annoyed.			"

												Without the help of the walkthrough, I would have given up early. There was no explanation such as having to go back to a body several times as the discoveries mount. Also, I may not have a powerful enough game card on my laptop and my mouse cursor could not keep up with the hand movement - constant over correcting. I could not complete one challenge  because I could not keep up with the astronaut, thus I could not get the final scene of the game. Yes, as other reviews have stated, the scenery is beautiful, but there is a lot of fruitless walking around for very little discovery.Most  puzzles are not challenging once you know the formula, but the scenario is unique. A very inexpensive puzzle game and you are getting exactly what you have paid for.			"

												I'm a photographer - this is the only unmodded game I've actually spent time setting shots up like I would on a real photo shoot. It's gorgeous.  (Skyrim with mods also).After that, it tells you right up front it's a narrative without handholding.  You will get no 'next item' markers telling you where to go. But it's not actively hiding anything from you, where you have to pixel hunt. If you get near something it'll pop up a prompt - just cover the area and you'll be fine.The puzzles are fairly decent, the narrative's great (when you piece it together) and the horror's even better since most of the game takes place in broad daylight. What more do you want? "

												""The Vanishing of Ethan Carter"" is a masterfully crafted and very beautiful game - but certainly not one for everybody.If you are looking for a game with tons of action, loads of weapons, and hundreds of tasks and missions, then ""Ethan Carter"" is not for you.There is almost no action, and there are no weapons. And there is actually very little to do, except following the story (which isn't always easy, as the game does not tell you where to go and what to do) and solving fairly easy puzzles.Also, it's quite short. I finished it in some 5 hours, without the help of any tutorials (but with the help of a friend).And still, for me, it is one of my absolute gaming highlights in 2014. The graphics are simply the best I've ever seen in a game, the story is masterfully crafted, and the end has me thinking about it long after I finished the game. Hats off to The Astronauts for this masterpiece.For everyone who sees computer games not just as entertainment, but also as an art form, ""The Vanishing of Ethan Carter"" is a must-have, plain and simple.

												The atmosphere is great and the visual design is amongst the best I've seen, although this is not enough to carry this otherwise underwhelming game. You're thrown in the woods and left to figure stuff out by yourself. In principle this is great, except that the game still has you on a leash. An invisible leash, which translates into you to randomly go to places in the hope of triggering some progression. The little snippets of story you uncover are nice, and the first section of the game is consequently strong, yet falls quickly into a lull when you arrive to the main storyline which pretends to be deeper and more complex than it actually is, using the unreliable narrator scope and flashbacks to convey a very superficial story. Furthermore it makes no sense internally, how the first half of the game ties in with the latter. Wrapped up with underwhelming and repetitive gameplay, the game is an overall lackluster. As mentioned, you are to walk around the map looking for items and then place them in the correct spot. There are some guessing games in which you reconstruct the chronology of an event, and there is a horribly designed maze game. Story games can be amazing, and I'm amongst the ones who enjoyed the likes of Dear Esther and Gone Home. This game fails horribly in even being close to a decent narrative game.That being said, the visual design is top notch and the atmosphere is great. The map is well designed, interesting, and the landscape is pleasing. The music contributes greatly to the game, and gives it a somewhat eerie feel. Unfortunately the poor storyline drags the atmosphere down around the second part of the game. Altogether, I'm left feeling very unimpressed by this game.			"

												There is a phenomenon that when something is done too well, it fails to impress.I vacillated about whether to recommend this game, but I ultimately decided that my experience of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, unfortunately, is subject to that phenomenon. The Astronauts did a wonderful job with this game from a technical perspective, which is something everyone should support. The graphics are fantastic, the music hauntingly beautiful, and the voice-acting emotionally wrenching. That being said, the story is lacking and even the beautiful world doesn't give the game enough depth to make up for the weakness of the plot, particularly the ending. There was something about the world that just didn't draw me in--perhaps they walked the line between real and surreal so well that I was never convinced it was either. The ending is both twist and ambiguous, and I wasn't surprised by the twist and I hadn't been drawn in enough to care about the ambiguity. It just didn't leave a mark, positive or negative.After giving it some more reflection, (I’ve updated this review) I can say that my problem with the plot of Ethan Carter is less a problem with this game itself (though I have given my complaints) and more likely a problem with the genre. To me exploration felt more like looking at a painting than actually stepping into a real world, and following the story felt more like checking off a list than solving a mystery.That I don't recommend The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is my statement that if I had the opportunity to do it over, I would have done something different--entered a different story in a different world if you will. But most importantly, I would have done something in a different format—like reading a book—a clear indication of my dislike for the genre. I will be watching the future developments from The Astronauts and I do hope for another opportunity to play another game made with the same rare technical skill as this one.Bottom line: if you like walking simulators (and this is a bit more than just a walking simulator), get this one. If you are unsure of the genre, Ethan Carter is unlikely to change your mind.			"

Really boring rubbish game which does not help you one bit on how to play it and alsok no directions of where to go next, plus its an open world game, so if you wish to hunt for small needles in a giant haystack then this may be your thing. For me all the game needed was instructions and just a little bit of direction, it did not have this and i dont partically like googling a walkthough as i find that is cheating, but the only option to finish this game is to do this, so im sorry only 1/10 as a game from me, appallingly boring and i like adventure games.

												My girlfriend and I went through this game in one sitting, which took us about four hours. We used a walkthrough to guide us through portions of the game, so that might mean we lost an hour or two - but I don't feel that these additional hours would have been well spent. The biggest mistake this game makes is giving you repetitive searching and fetching tasks, some of which are just overly tedious and out of place in a game that is so focused on telling a story. I don't want to search for a little bloody rock hidden behind high leaves of grass to advance the plot or wander through a maze looking for five identical corpses so I can open a cryptic puzzle. No, this puzzling and combing of the vast landscape this game has to offer was not fun at all. The developers seem not to understand how to create gameplay that engages instead of distracting from the story. In a game that exists primarily to tell that story, I would actually expect less involved gameplay, so if I (as a ""core"" gamer of many genres) am faced with an attempt to challenge my gaming skills, I want this challenge to be fun and the opposite of tedious and grinding, but the latter is what this game offers and not much else besides the story.So is the STORY any good? Without spoiling anything, I have to say my girlfriend (who cares deeply about well-written stories) and I were both surprised at how it ended, but that ending made the whole endavour kind of pointless and just threw up more questions than answers. It's basically just a story of supernatural powers and multiple murders; you use the former to solve the latter nine times throughout this game, piecing together what happened to this Ethan Carter boy. But the end result just seems to invalidate it all and makes the supernatural aspect, which I highly disliked from the start, even more ambiguous.Dammit, if you write a story for a game soley to tell that story, then please make it a GOOD one that I can actually grasp and follow, and that is BELIEVABLE most of all! And if you start your game off saying ""this game does not hold your hand"" (which is rare these days and usually a good thing!), then make sure I understand how to play it because when I spend the first fifteen minutes wandering around aimlessly and have to consult a walkthrough to understand the mechanics, you've done something wrong by game design standards.I had heard only good things about this game and while I don't want to say that I regret the 10 bucks I paid for it on sale, I do wish that all the positive press and personal recommendations had actually held true in the end. I fail to see how so many people love the game when there is not much here that would make it that great.Pros:- well utilized Unreal Engine 3 with very convincing architecture and landscape- free roaming ""open world"" gameplay makes for great immersion- good music and convincing voice actingCons:- occasional stutters while otherwise perfectly fluid- puzzles are rarely easily apparent and require lots of searching/trial and error- story itself is not very good (personal preference) and illogical at times- this game is more of an artistic showcase than a well presented storyBuy if you liked Dear Esther and other more artsy, mysterious games that move away from traditional routes. Be prepared to do some tedious *very much traditional* puzzling and searching. Keep a guide handy to enjoy more of the actual story. Go in with low expectations.			"

												I bought the game, becouse many of my friends recommended it to me. To be honest, I actually regret purchuasing it. Don't get me wrong the story is intriguing and the game is very atmospheric, however there is just too many things that are plain wrong. 1) The game doesn't really give you any clues on what to do or look for, you can just walk along the path and finish the game without getting involved in the story at all. 2) If you want to get to know the story better but didnt spend time looking around the woods at the end of the game you have to go back and forth for each story that is actually irrelevant now to the main action. 3) Scene in the mine with the zombie was completly unnecessary and unexpected and left me with almost heart attack. 4) Gameplay is pretty short in correlation to the price.And lastly, although this is just a personal preference, even though environment was very nice I did not like the atmosphere at ALL, also I got massive motion sickness from this game.

												It's pretty, very pretty, but that's the only good thing about this game. The game mechanics are not properly introduced, so you end up having to read walkthroughs just to figure out how to play, by which point you may have skipped one or two puzzles already and have to backtrack on foot. The half baked save system is checkpoint based, and the checkpoints only keep track of completed puzzles, if you quit or run out of the puzzle area before completing the puzzle you have to redo the same damn puzzle from the beginning. Took me about five hours to finish this game, probably spent over half that time just running across the landscape, because that's the only way to get anywhere. There's no quick travel system of any kind until you get to the end of the game, and even then it's only one way travel.This game is not worth anywhere near full price, and it's not worth the sale price I bought it at (66% off).

The Vanishing is basically what happens when the developers of a visual novel decide to make stress on the 'visual' part. The game's surroundings are relatively small but almost any inch of the landscape can be a spot for a lovely screenshot. That part is adorable and the environment is very picturesque.Unlike many other visual novels, this one has a first-person view and freedom of action. It involves you into the game's world yet more. Seeing a path is one thing, walking it yourself is quite another. Moving around slowly and quietly, exploring, pondering over matters, watching for details that need attention - and that's all as if you were there. Nothing threatens you. Nothing disturbs you. You have all the time in the world to go where you want to go and see what you would like to see. My explorer's nature was deeply satisfied.The plot is curious. I won't say that it's entirely original - the basic idea around which all the events circle has already been seen in a certain game, - but it certainly doesn't mean that you will easily understand everything from the very first minute. There will be no instructions on where to go and what to do next, no maps, no journals with careful recordings of each step. If you want to rebuild the story then use your memory and look for hints in what you have already seen.The bad part of it is that the game is painfully and heartbreakingly short. 4 hours of gameplay is the best you can get from it, and it generally looks more like an exercise in game building - like, ""look what we could do with the engine"". I was feeling like the developers had initially planned something bigger and more complicated but circumstances forced them to cut their ambitions short. Small amount of gameplay time is in part based upon the lack of real content. The protagonist has come to the area for investigation but in fact he hardly investigates anything. When he actually does, the solution is often ridiculously simple, as if the game creators didn't want to bother their players with too much of intellectual business. It becomes more and more obvious as you progress towards the end of the game, and it often feels like the developers were getting tired of their product and were trying to get it finished as soon as possible.You will like it if you are fond of walking meditatively around an area and exploring. For a couple of hours you will be living in a beautiful place with a touch of weird mystery about it.You might also like it if you prefer visual novels and if you don't mind composing a story out of bits and pieces instead of following a predefined storyline.If you want to feel like a detective who tries to solve a number of challenging cases, you will probably be disappointed.

												Unfortunately, this game falls under that category of ""games that can't decide what they want to be.""As a lot of people have already said, this game has great atmosphere and visually stunning. I grew up in a small town with crumbling buildings like Red Creek Valley, so I had a heavy dose of nostalgia going for me the entire time I was playing.The way you investigating ""crime scenes"" was also what appealed to me about this game. It's about as close to experiencing Sherlock Holmes's ""mind palace"" as I've gotten in a game. This is where I'm going to get into spoilers. The first issue comes up when you're walking through the forest and suddenly you come across these beacons, and you have to find each of the beacons to unlock another piece of the puzzle of ""what happened to Ethan?"" Once you find all the beacons, however, you're launched into this science-fiction vision of space, which is (again) very visually captivating, but suddenly I've lost track of whether I'm in a detective game or if the game is starting to suggest that aliens are responsible for Ethan Carter's disappearance. There's also a ""unlocked"" scene that places you underwater, and you're looking up at this Cthulhu-like creature, as well as a sequence that places you in a mine shaft with a zombie who instantly kills you if his lantern shines on you. For both of these sequences, I found myself saying ""Okay, is this Lovecraftian? Zombie? I don't care what it is, this game just needs to decide what it wants to be instead of throwing every genre at me.""The other thing is that, unless you're a completionist and absolutely want to see the ""final ending,"" you don't actually have to go through all of these sequences. You can still solve the mystery of Ethan Carter's death without solving all of the other puzzles. ""The Vanishing of Ethan Carter"" came out in the aftermath of ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"" and it very much feels like it's trying to be a lighter version of that game. There's that same Lovecraftian feel, as well as the feeling of hopelessness because--unlike so many first-person games--both Amnesia and Ethan Carter don't give you a weapon. But unlike Amnesia, there's barely any real threat to you in Ethan Carter. It's basically like reading an interactive book--the reader might be scared by it, and it may even be powerful enough to effect how he lives his life, but ultimately it can't harm him.All of this being said, there are a lot of good gameplay elements in this game that could provide the building blocks for an amazing game in the future, if put into the right hands. As said above, the way you investigate crime scenes in this game was very interesting and the only other game I can think of where I've seen something like it is the ""Batman: Arkham"" series. The replay value, however, is very poor, if it exists at all. In the two years since I've played this game, I've never had a moment where I've thought ""You know, I should reinstall The Vanishing of Ethan Carter so I can play it again.""If you're still not convinced that you're better off spending your money on something else, then at least wait until the game goes on sale. For one, the game isn't that long--you can probably beat it in a day if you have nothing else to do. That alone makes the $20 price tag seem ridiculous. If you must have Ethan Carter, wait for it to go on sale. If you pay anything more than $5.99 for it, you're getting ripped off.			"

												Well after buying this game while it was on sale and playing it, all I can is ""ehhh it's ok for the right price,"" I was personally disappointed with it pros: 1.Some of the best graphics I have ever seen in any game ever2.Certain people had problems with the ending, but I actually thought it was very well donecons:1.The save system...it's horrible, it doesn't allow you to manually save your game for some reason...if this was intentional then it backfired2.One of the puzzles in this game is just trial and error...it was very frustrating and hurt the game3.The mines were a bad addition to the game, it took the player out of this incredible world and threw them into this dark and bland place4.Probably the most pointed out flaw by many people: the game length, it was pretty short, my time spent say's six hours, but I spent 1 hour afk, so it took me about five hours to beat the game, and that was me taking my time5.Has practically no replay valueOverall, I think this game could have been much better, it just felt like a disappointment to me "

												Pros:+ Amazing graphics, the best I've seen in any game -- Ever.+ Intriguing story.+ Fun, and non-frustrating puzzles.+ Like nothing you've ever played before. A breath of fresh air.Cons:- 95% of the world has absolutely 0 interactivity. I wish there were more newspaper clippings, letters, or Ethan's notes or stories scattered throughout the world to reward exploration. The world is amazingly and jaw-droppingly beautiful but since there's almost nothing to discover, you end up just running at full speed through it.Neither Pro nor Con:~ The game is 4-5 hours long. That can be good or bad depending on what you're looking for in a game. I thought it could have been just slightly longer, maybe one more puzzle area. But overall, I was in the mood for a short game and this filled it perfectly.I purchased this for about $15 and I felt like I overpaid slightly. Anything under $12 would be a great price point to purchase this. I would recommend this if the style of the game suits you, and you pick it up on a Steam sale.			"

												This is a very pretty game.  I didn't understand that there are areas of puzzles.  I started walking, found a couple things.  They seemed interesting, didn't find anything else and kept walking.  I had gone through 3 or 4 areas before I started to realize that you had to find all the objects in each area and than they wrap up in a scene about the story.  It was a graphic novel.  Think I paid too much for it, even on sale.  I don't hate it, but it was way too short.  10 puzzles and done.  Oh... and if you look at my play time, it is WAY higher than reality.  The game only saves after you solve a puzzle.  Sooo... I didn't turn it off.			"

												I was pretty disappointed with this game. The graphics are lovely but the story is a complete disappointment. The puzzles in this are really arbitrary, regarding finding 1 or 2 items and replacing them and putting the scenes in order to advance the story. I really wanted to like this game but I found the storyline a complete let down. It builds you up a little, but the game is not very long - only about 6 puzzles, and the ending drops you off a cliff with a shockingly bad ending. There was very little challenge in this and due to it's length as well I don't beleive it's worth the sticker price. Bargain bin, 4 hours when you have NOTHING else to do on a Sunday and wan't to kill time while savagely hungover. "

												I played this for over an hour and that is time I will never get back, because as there's no manual save and despite finding a whole load of stuff and entering one of the buildings, I didn't hit a single automatic save. I want my money back, because all that this game has done for me is waste my time.Whether I do it all again now or come back later after finding a save point I'm still faced with the fact that when I've done it it probably won't be saved, and I face I don't know how many more examples of my option being do it all again or leave the program running. I should live so long.Would it have been so difficult to give us a configurable quicksave button or to automatically save whenever we achieve something? Definitely not. Clearly the programmers aren't incompetent which means they made a conscious decision to leave this huge gaping flaw in this otherwise cool looking game.It seems like pure bloodymindedness, like once they'd seen how cool and pretty it is they decided that they should also judge what the right and wrong ways to play the game are. It seems I fell on the ""wrong"" side, but I was just exploring. They've made this huge beautiful environment and they expect us to just rush through it to hit the savegame points before we get bored or run out of (real life) time – How does that make sense? They haven't decided the right or wrong way to play the game – They've shown us the wrong way to make the game. They've got my money, but hopefully it's not too late for you.Avoid.			"

												There is a phenomenon that when something is done too well, it fails to impress.I vacillated about whether to recommend this game, but I ultimately decided that my experience of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, unfortunately, is subject to that phenomenon. The Astronauts did a wonderful job with this game from a technical perspective, which is something everyone should support. The graphics are fantastic, the music hauntingly beautiful, and the voice-acting emotionally wrenching. That being said, the story is lacking and even the beautiful world doesn't give the game enough depth to make up for the weakness of the plot, particularly the ending. There was something about the world that just didn't draw me in--perhaps they walked the line between real and surreal so well that I was never convinced it was either. The ending is both twist and ambiguous, and I wasn't surprised by the twist and I hadn't been drawn in enough to care about the ambiguity. It just didn't leave a mark, positive or negative.After giving it some more reflection, (I’ve updated this review) I can say that my problem with the plot of Ethan Carter is less a problem with this game itself (though I have given my complaints) and more likely a problem with the genre. To me exploration felt more like looking at a painting than actually stepping into a real world, and following the story felt more like checking off a list than solving a mystery.That I don't recommend The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is my statement that if I had the opportunity to do it over, I would have done something different--entered a different story in a different world if you will. But most importantly, I would have done something in a different format—like reading a book—a clear indication of my dislike for the genre. I will be watching the future developments from The Astronauts and I do hope for another opportunity to play another game made with the same rare technical skill as this one.Bottom line: if you like walking simulators (and this is a bit more than just a walking simulator), get this one. If you are unsure of the genre, Ethan Carter is unlikely to change your mind.			"

For one, the game isn't that long--you can probably beat it in a day if you have nothing else to do. That alone makes the $20 price tag seem ridiculous. If you must have Ethan Carter, wait for it to go on sale. If you pay anything more than $5.99 for it, you're getting ripped off.			"

												A decent concept poorly applied. A game that touts it's graphic fidelity had me worried. The only fault of graphics in this game were the god awful character models and hair that looks like they belong in Skyrim. The voice acting is rubbish and the animations at times can be extremely disgusting. The location and setting of the game are amazing. The ability to pick and choose which segment you playthrough before traversing Red Creek to the next can allude to a false sense of freedom. Red Creek is a beautiful environment to explore, despite the backtracking and absent gameplay (I mean really? Even for a game of it's nature there could have been more indepth gameplay than playing ISpy with items in the world. And then going on to set a series of events in order.) The Vanishing of Ethan Carter in it's first 30 minutes can be breathtaking and though provoking, but ultimately disappointing with a weak and lazy ending. The redux does very little to help. If a game where you walk around a beautiful environment investigating late 19th century structures is your preference, then by all means purchase it. But only on sale.			"

												I do not recommend this game at all, i would give it 9/10 for graphics, as for a game, if you wish to run around for hours on end with no clue what to do then be my guest, when you do eventually find someone and piece the clues together, it seems to tell a good story until the end of that clue plotline, then it is 'lets run around for hours on end to try find the next clue. Really boring rubbish game which does not help you one bit on how to play it and alsok no directions of where to go next, plus its an open world game, so if you wish to hunt for small needles in a giant haystack then this may be your thing. For me all the game needed was instructions and just a little bit of direction, it did not have this and i dont partically like googling a walkthough as i find that is cheating, but the only option to finish this game is to do this, so im sorry only 1/10 as a game from me, appallingly boring and i like adventure games.

												This game is at the same time deceiving but worth playing. Let's start with the positive sides; it has really nice graphics, interesting game mechanics and a very original story. This game has a huge potential. On the other hand the short time you spend playing this game is in my opinion not fair regarding the price (I took 5 hours to complete the game even though I struggled at certain points) and the end felt slightly rushed. As a conclusion i would say that this game is a piece of art, but a very expensive piece of art. I would recommend to only grab it on sales :).			"

												My girlfriend and I went through this game in one sitting, which took us about four hours. We used a walkthrough to guide us through portions of the game, so that might mean we lost an hour or two - but I don't feel that these additional hours would have been well spent. The biggest mistake this game makes is giving you repetitive searching and fetching tasks, some of which are just overly tedious and out of place in a game that is so focused on telling a story. I don't want to search for a little bloody rock hidden behind high leaves of grass to advance the plot or wander through a maze looking for five identical corpses so I can open a cryptic puzzle. No, this puzzling and combing of the vast landscape this game has to offer was not fun at all. The developers seem not to understand how to create gameplay that engages instead of distracting from the story. In a game that exists primarily to tell that story, I would actually expect less involved gameplay, so if I (as a ""core"" gamer of many genres) am faced with an attempt to challenge my gaming skills, I want this challenge to be fun and the opposite of tedious and grinding, but the latter is what this game offers and not much else besides the story.So is the STORY any good? Without spoiling anything, I have to say my girlfriend (who cares deeply about well-written stories) and I were both surprised at how it ended, but that ending made the whole endavour kind of pointless and just threw up more questions than answers. It's basically just a story of supernatural powers and multiple murders; you use the former to solve the latter nine times throughout this game, piecing together what happened to this Ethan Carter boy. But the end result just seems to invalidate it all and makes the supernatural aspect, which I highly disliked from the start, even more ambiguous.Dammit, if you write a story for a game soley to tell that story, then please make it a GOOD one that I can actually grasp and follow, and that is BELIEVABLE most of all! And if you start your game off saying ""this game does not hold your hand"" (which is rare these days and usually a good thing!), then make sure I understand how to play it because when I spend the first fifteen minutes wandering around aimlessly and have to consult a walkthrough to understand the mechanics, you've done something wrong by game design standards.I had heard only good things about this game and while I don't want to say that I regret the 10 bucks I paid for it on sale, I do wish that all the positive press and personal recommendations had actually held true in the end. I fail to see how so many people love the game when there is not much here that would make it that great.Pros:- well utilized Unreal Engine 3 with very convincing architecture and landscape- free roaming ""open world"" gameplay makes for great immersion- good music and convincing voice actingCons:- occasional stutters while otherwise perfectly fluid- puzzles are rarely easily apparent and require lots of searching/trial and error- story itself is not very good (personal preference) and illogical at times- this game is more of an artistic showcase than a well presented storyBuy if you liked Dear Esther and other more artsy, mysterious games that move away from traditional routes. Be prepared to do some tedious *very much traditional* puzzling and searching. Keep a guide handy to enjoy more of the actual story. Go in with low expectations.			"

You play as a detective solving a case, which sounds fun, but really isn't.It took me 5 hours to beat the game, which isn't much but I don't mind since the game is so cheap, BUT:this includes 1 hour of bumping into invisible walls. 3 hours of hiking to find clues, putting back items orwalking across the entire map because you forgot something (they couldn't bother giving the player a simple quick travel method).And the remaining 1 hour is gameplay, but this isn't even fun since the actual gameplay and puzzles are very easy when you understand the mechanics of the game. They fool you into thinking the puzzles are hard or clever by making you walk a lot until you bumb into a clue.			"

												It was visually stunning, but to me it felt like this game didn't know what it wanted to be. Even when the mystery started unraveling and I thought it could have an interesting plot, or that I was about to do something fun and interesting, the game took it away from me and gave an unsurprising, boring, safe ending. A lot of work for not a lot of payoff.Gameplay wise, the puzzles are far too simple, but if you miss one part you'll spend ages trying to figure out what went wrong. Skipped or didn't notice a puzzle? You find out at the end you'll need to walk all the way back and solve it. I had no idea there was going to be a horror maze in the middle that was required to see a cutscene that was irrelevant to the end of the game.I liked Dear Esther and Gone Home (similar in that they're creepy, long, lonely walks through a pretty environment), but wasn't a big fan of this. In theory, it's really cool. But in practice... maybe watch someone play it online?			"

												This game is 90% story, 10% puzzle and atmospheric. The atmosphere is done very very well, and the story is engaging and entertaining, and does a great job of making the puzzles part of the story.  There are definitely parts where I slowed down and just appreciated the music and well-made scenery and lighting.  **From here I state my dislikes, which may be spoilers if you are going to play the game**  But I can say that the ending to the game made the rest of it not worth it. It's incongruent and feels very rushed. It's not a twist or exciting, it just feels like they couldn't come up with a proper ending to the game.  Classic noir, and that's why most of those movies don't hold up.  The good ones were good because they didn't follow this silly formula.			"

The mechanisms for triggering exposition was just not clear enough for me. A little bit of nudging would have been really nice. Wonderful visually, and a really great mechanic for story telling, but overall just seemed empty for such a lush environment. The narrative moments are few and far between, but comprise the ENTIRE game. Aside from the...what...10 moments of plot, the entire game is walking down paths that do not serve the plot or illuminate much of anything going on. And I do get tired of story telling that keeps me wondering, wondering, wondering what could possibly be going on!!? only to find in the end that ....oh.... it was that... the whole time.... cute....Great as a study of plot delivery in games. Not much fun as an experience for a player.			"

Red Creek is a beautiful environment to explore, despite the backtracking and absent gameplay (I mean really? Even for a game of it's nature there could have been more indepth gameplay than playing ISpy with items in the world. And then going on to set a series of events in order.) The Vanishing of Ethan Carter in it's first 30 minutes can be breathtaking and though provoking, but ultimately disappointing with a weak and lazy ending. The redux does very little to help. If a game where you walk around a beautiful environment investigating late 19th century structures is your preference, then by all means purchase it. But only on sale.			"

												The game felt really cool and great, right up to the ending. I really liked the atmosphere though, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. More of a play-through experience than an actual game. Very straight forward with a few puzzles here and there. AND......If you miss an achievement, you have to go all the way through the whole game to search it up. No chance of teleporting to the speficic area.This game could have been so much more. I mean... this is the most beautiful game I've ever played, but it lacked content. Though I'm looking forward to the next game by these guys.			"

												Really interesting story, great graphics, and genuinely captivating. It keeps you curious and interested throughout the entire game, and the ending wasn't as dumb as one would expect from this genre (Outlast -cough- -cough-), it actually felt like they tried. Only about 3-4 hours of gameplay, but I think it was worth playing. Not sure if it should be $20, though, considering that means you're paying $5 an hour to play and finish this game. Lol.

												A wonderful photorealistic narrative story. The graphics are the essential basis of the complexity. The story is a bit short and narrow as you are just an inspector of what had happened so you cannot interact the story in any way, the price thus shouldn't be as high it is. All in all, as a narrative, close to perfection.			"

Although the game is pretty short (depending on your puzzle solving abilities), the story is well crafted and there are visually stimulating moments throughout the game that make you pull a Keanu Reeves, ""woh"".

												Oh sweet lord. How do I begin? This game was fantastic. I didn't want this game to end. I binge played it in two nights,  This game was fantastic. I know I already said that but it needed to be stated again. I waited till this game was on sale, but I would happily pay full price for this game, now that I have played it. The game has a very meloncholy and mysterious air to it. The challenges faced in the game are difficult, but fun and interesting. The main character has an amazing voice. Not to mention the graphics. Wow. The graphics on this game are astounding. Simply lovely. I spent ten minutes just staring at the sunset on the lake. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves challenges, puzzles, and mysteries. *SEMI-SPOILERS* /Some might claim the ending is confusing, but for those that pay attention and gather the full details into their thoughts, it makes perfect sense. To be honest I predicted the ending, but that didn't make it any less good!/ I want a sequel to this game more than I want world peace. I would sacrifice my first born son in order to have a sequel, but I understand if that isn't possible. In my opinion I felt the game was somewhat short, but when I take into account how fast I solve puzzles, how interested I was in the story, and what the storyline generally consisted of, the amount of time it takes is more than appropriate. Fun 5/5, Graphics 5/5, Maturity 4/5, Play again 5/5. Worth the price: Yes			"

												This game is hands down amazing. I played for four hours, but it had the intensity of 8. The story grips you, the mechanics flow, the visuals stun you and the audio makes your hands stand on end in dread or in awe... Okay, perhaps slighty exaggerated, but whatever, it's awesome!This game does come with some cons though.- It's very short. If I hadn't gotten this on 50% sale, I'd been dissapointed - though a good 9 seems to be a fair price to me.- The ending is a plot twist, mostly because of how cliche it is. I didn't like it at all, and I'd definitely like to rant about it, but that would spoil it. It drew similarities to a Twillight plot device, along with plot devices used by all sorts of rookie storytellers, let's put it like that. Luckily, this 'end' lasts about 5 minutes tops, so it's not great loss. Note: The end does make sense though, and does tie all the loose ends together - and even then I'd still think it better had the loose ends not been tied up.- In the beginning, it said it wouldn't hold my hands, so I thought the game would be difficult. It wasn't. It wasn't at all. At least not to me. I see others disagreeing with me, saying you 'might miss something', and granted, I didn't get 100% of all achievements... But I don't see where they're coming from. Then again, I love mystery games and PoC games, so that might be why.I can't think of any other con, so yea. It rocked. Big time. =)			"

												The atmosphere is great and the visual design is amongst the best I've seen, although this is not enough to carry this otherwise underwhelming game. You're thrown in the woods and left to figure stuff out by yourself. In principle this is great, except that the game still has you on a leash. An invisible leash, which translates into you to randomly go to places in the hope of triggering some progression. The little snippets of story you uncover are nice, and the first section of the game is consequently strong, yet falls quickly into a lull when you arrive to the main storyline which pretends to be deeper and more complex than it actually is, using the unreliable narrator scope and flashbacks to convey a very superficial story. Furthermore it makes no sense internally, how the first half of the game ties in with the latter. Wrapped up with underwhelming and repetitive gameplay, the game is an overall lackluster. As mentioned, you are to walk around the map looking for items and then place them in the correct spot. There are some guessing games in which you reconstruct the chronology of an event, and there is a horribly designed maze game. Story games can be amazing, and I'm amongst the ones who enjoyed the likes of Dear Esther and Gone Home. This game fails horribly in even being close to a decent narrative game.That being said, the visual design is top notch and the atmosphere is great. The map is well designed, interesting, and the landscape is pleasing. The music contributes greatly to the game, and gives it a somewhat eerie feel. Unfortunately the poor storyline drags the atmosphere down around the second part of the game. Altogether, I'm left feeling very unimpressed by this game.			"

												There is a phenomenon that when something is done too well, it fails to impress.I vacillated about whether to recommend this game, but I ultimately decided that my experience of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, unfortunately, is subject to that phenomenon. The Astronauts did a wonderful job with this game from a technical perspective, which is something everyone should support. The graphics are fantastic, the music hauntingly beautiful, and the voice-acting emotionally wrenching. That being said, the story is lacking and even the beautiful world doesn't give the game enough depth to make up for the weakness of the plot, particularly the ending. There was something about the world that just didn't draw me in--perhaps they walked the line between real and surreal so well that I was never convinced it was either. The ending is both twist and ambiguous, and I wasn't surprised by the twist and I hadn't been drawn in enough to care about the ambiguity. It just didn't leave a mark, positive or negative.After giving it some more reflection, (I’ve updated this review) I can say that my problem with the plot of Ethan Carter is less a problem with this game itself (though I have given my complaints) and more likely a problem with the genre. To me exploration felt more like looking at a painting than actually stepping into a real world, and following the story felt more like checking off a list than solving a mystery.That I don't recommend The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is my statement that if I had the opportunity to do it over, I would have done something different--entered a different story in a different world if you will. But most importantly, I would have done something in a different format—like reading a book—a clear indication of my dislike for the genre. I will be watching the future developments from The Astronauts and I do hope for another opportunity to play another game made with the same rare technical skill as this one.Bottom line: if you like walking simulators (and this is a bit more than just a walking simulator), get this one. If you are unsure of the genre, Ethan Carter is unlikely to change your mind.			"

												Unfortunately, this game falls under that category of ""games that can't decide what they want to be.""As a lot of people have already said, this game has great atmosphere and visually stunning. I grew up in a small town with crumbling buildings like Red Creek Valley, so I had a heavy dose of nostalgia going for me the entire time I was playing.The way you investigating ""crime scenes"" was also what appealed to me about this game. It's about as close to experiencing Sherlock Holmes's ""mind palace"" as I've gotten in a game. This is where I'm going to get into spoilers. The first issue comes up when you're walking through the forest and suddenly you come across these beacons, and you have to find each of the beacons to unlock another piece of the puzzle of ""what happened to Ethan?"" Once you find all the beacons, however, you're launched into this science-fiction vision of space, which is (again) very visually captivating, but suddenly I've lost track of whether I'm in a detective game or if the game is starting to suggest that aliens are responsible for Ethan Carter's disappearance. There's also a ""unlocked"" scene that places you underwater, and you're looking up at this Cthulhu-like creature, as well as a sequence that places you in a mine shaft with a zombie who instantly kills you if his lantern shines on you. For both of these sequences, I found myself saying ""Okay, is this Lovecraftian? Zombie? I don't care what it is, this game just needs to decide what it wants to be instead of throwing every genre at me.""The other thing is that, unless you're a completionist and absolutely want to see the ""final ending,"" you don't actually have to go through all of these sequences. You can still solve the mystery of Ethan Carter's death without solving all of the other puzzles. ""The Vanishing of Ethan Carter"" came out in the aftermath of ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"" and it very much feels like it's trying to be a lighter version of that game. There's that same Lovecraftian feel, as well as the feeling of hopelessness because--unlike so many first-person games--both Amnesia and Ethan Carter don't give you a weapon. But unlike Amnesia, there's barely any real threat to you in Ethan Carter. It's basically like reading an interactive book--the reader might be scared by it, and it may even be powerful enough to effect how he lives his life, but ultimately it can't harm him.All of this being said, there are a lot of good gameplay elements in this game that could provide the building blocks for an amazing game in the future, if put into the right hands. As said above, the way you investigate crime scenes in this game was very interesting and the only other game I can think of where I've seen something like it is the ""Batman: Arkham"" series. The replay value, however, is very poor, if it exists at all. In the two years since I've played this game, I've never had a moment where I've thought ""You know, I should reinstall The Vanishing of Ethan Carter so I can play it again.""If you're still not convinced that you're better off spending your money on something else, then at least wait until the game goes on sale. For one, the game isn't that long--you can probably beat it in a day if you have nothing else to do. That alone makes the $20 price tag seem ridiculous. If you must have Ethan Carter, wait for it to go on sale. If you pay anything more than $5.99 for it, you're getting ripped off.			"

												This game had soooooooooooo much potential. The graphics, scenery and music were beautiful. However, I started out confused. It didn't really give much direction on what to do. I started off passing 3 stages and having no clue what I was doing. I had to read some walk throughs to understand the point on the game and what to actual do. Once I got with it, I though ok this will be good. Started to enjoy the story..... boom it was over. The ending left me even more confused. Some many parts of the story did not match up and I never really got what the ""SLEEPER"" was. I will do some research into the game to understand it better, but that is sad since the game didn't give me any anwser.. I do not recommend this game. Highly dissapointed.			"

												I bought the game, becouse many of my friends recommended it to me. To be honest, I actually regret purchuasing it. Don't get me wrong the story is intriguing and the game is very atmospheric, however there is just too many things that are plain wrong. 1) The game doesn't really give you any clues on what to do or look for, you can just walk along the path and finish the game without getting involved in the story at all. 2) If you want to get to know the story better but didnt spend time looking around the woods at the end of the game you have to go back and forth for each story that is actually irrelevant now to the main action. 3) Scene in the mine with the zombie was completly unnecessary and unexpected and left me with almost heart attack. 4) Gameplay is pretty short in correlation to the price.And lastly, although this is just a personal preference, even though environment was very nice I did not like the atmosphere at ALL, also I got massive motion sickness from this game.

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is decent if rather short indie first person adventure/mystery game. I played through the Redux version, so I have minimal playtime listed for the base game. The redux version is simply a remake of the original game in Unreal Engine 4 with improved graphics and few minor gameplay tweaks.The graphics are definitely the highlight here. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter has some of the most impressive nature scenes ever seen in a game. It's also a very atmospheric and immersive experience with pretty minimal handholding.Unfortunately the gameplay is somewhat disappointing. While the core mechanic of reconstructing murders by finding and ordering the clues is interesting enough, the game could have taken this much further. As it is, almost all the puzzles are on the simple side and way too much of your playtime is spent hunting for the puzzles themselves and any clues you may have missed.Overall, the Vanishing of Ethan Carter felt more like an impressive tech demo than a full game. I'd still recommend it, but only during a sale.The good:- Extremely beautiful natural environments- Atmospheric and immersive- Reconstructing the murders is an interesting mechanic, even if the game should have done much more with thisThe bad:- Quite short- Most puzzles are pretty simple- Too much aimless wandering looking for both clues and the puzzles themselves- The story is not that good			"

												This is a game with a captivating story that is fun to play when you have a guide. The reason I say with a guide is that this game literally does not provide any help whatsoever on what to do in this world. There is no map (except at the end! Lol!), no tutorial, no help/hint system,  no indicator arrows, etc. The map is truly open and you can go in any direction you want. The voiceover is used only for the story and provides no help on what to do next. The scenery and music is beautiful. I enjoyed walking around this world and unraveling the story. It really does have a nice atmosphere to it. I considered only one part of the game scary. The rest of it I considered light and mysterious (although it tries to be dark, but how can you be scared/dark in such beautiful surroundings! :) ).I actually spent 6.4 hours (6.2 redux and 0.2 original) on this game in total, but it is not reflected in my stats because I played the redux version for the majority of the time. I found it better than the original in its graphics and save system. Also, this 6.4 hours was me running around the world enjoying the scenery and not knowing exactly what to do (I tried not to use the guide as much as possible). The actual game time is around 4 hours including getting all the achievements.  "

												This game could have a bike in it. Just sayin. One bike.The story is alright I didn't enjoy it so much.  The gameplay is a sequence of getting to a place(walk?) see some interesting things, maybe collect some item and figuring out what happened in a pretty cool way. Some puzzles doesn't feel rewarding and I hate one in particular... Game is short, if you don't miss things early on in the game like I i did and having to ..ahem walk back to the beginning I suppose its 2.5 hrs-ish. One small advice: things are completed in each area, there's no waiting to find some vital clue later on then coming at the earlier area to solve things. IF you like narrative experience, various puzzles, and is okay with finding stuff (swear to god I could never find somethings without looking it up) this game is alright.  a 6/10.			"

												The dark storyline keeps you on your toes with every step, and pulls you deeper into it’s endless depth. The overall craftsmanship of this game makes many others seem shallow and empty in comparison. Overall the game is a wonderful narrative wrapped in a fully realized world that seems as full and vibrant as reality itself. Truly outstanding, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter would merit a 9.8 out of 10.For the full review please visit http://www.thebudgetgamer.ca/wpTBGB/?p=53 "

												I enjoyed every single minute that I have spent in this game: Foremost due to the extraordinary graphic and a marvelous dynamic soundtrack I found myself spending at least one hour simply walking around, absorbing the atmosphere and being stunned by a phenomenal presentation of an equally beautiful and meticulously detailed landscape.The story was very interesting and progressed bit by bit while the player investigated puzzling and mystical incidents or locations in order to understand what has happened to Ethan Carter. Even though the story can be finished in a relatively short amount of time (I'd say approximately three to four hours), quality-wise The Vanishing of Ethan Carter was worth every cent of the 20€ that I have paid for this game. Hence: highly recommended.			"

												Good game with a great story. If you are a fan of puzzles and mistery solving games, well this might be a product for you. Game is not hard but you must not rush it (like I did in the first place) or you risk missing some useful informations including puzzels needed to finish the game.Pro: - amazing graphics- amazing atmosphere- the narrator's voice fits the whole game perfectly- good story with a mind blowing endingCons:- no option to save- I play at Medium to High graphics with constant 50+ fps but sometimes when the game loads it just freezes for 1-2 seconds and that is incredibly annoying- 2 achievements are quite hard to get: ""Unfinished stories"" and ""The curse of the sea-thing"" For the first one you must be extremely lucky to find certain items to accomplish it and I needed to google it in order to complete this one. As for  the ""Sea Thing"", well, I must be honest I've never been so frightened in my life. I played Outlast, Slender The Arrival, Amnesia, FEAR 2, and I can swear i've never been so panicked in a game.All in all, I highly recommend this game, not only for detective-type persons, but also for those who just want to enjoy a very polished world with the best atmosphere ever.(sorry for bad english)			"

												It's been a year since I first played this game and I am still in love with it. Unlike any other game, this stunningly unique piece of art will have you in awe. Beautiful graphics, simple controls, a tense atmosphere and, most importantly, an emotionally and psychologically engulfing story -- absolutely worth your time. Goosebump guarantee!And without spoiling too much, I would like to have a quick word with those of you who claim that the ending makes ""any analysis of lines of dialogue, narrative, and story telling null and void"": You obviously don't understand much about human psychology. Everything you experienced in the course of the story does matter. It is a display of human relationships and emotions, of pain and abuse, of how a child feels under certain circumstances within the boundaries of their family and expresses their feelings and finds a way to vent in order to escape said pain. Ultimately, the tragedy unfolding before your eyes explains everything you saw, heard and felt prior during the course of the story. The mystery part is just a nice bonus to it all. If you aren't capable of understanding nor feeling that, then you must be quite an unempathic human being and this game is not meant for you.			"

												Kind of a ""Blair Witch Project"" thing. Atmosphere, horror, a few jump scares. Very beautiful world (Unreal Engine 4) with nothing to do in it. Shockingly low on content and gameplay elements. Very short too. Background story is a crude horror/mystery tale about a family possessed by a ghost and killing each other, largely told through a narrator and letters strewn across the game world (lame excuse for lacking real content and interactivity).Your job is to reconstruct who killed who, and this is how it goes:You run around and come across typical adventure items (a lamp, an axe, a dead body, etc.), but you cannot interact or do anything with them. All you have to do is find all items in a certain area, which automatically prompts a flashback scene with 5 story elements and you have to guess the sequence of events, like this: (1) he picked up the axe, (2) he talked to his brother, (3) he went over to the chapel, (4) he killed his uncle, (5) he talked to his mother. That's it. Then you head to the next area, find all its items, flashback pops up..... You do this guess-the-sequence thing for the fate of each family member. That's all there is, basically.""This game doesn't hold your hand.""What game? At best, this is a 3D tech demo for UE, not a game. Shame on the Polish developers for charging money for a demo. "

												This game has environments that look better than the average game. Nice environments make good screenshots but once this game is in motion, you'll find that the majority of those visually impressive things loose some charm with their static nature. Rocks don't tumble and you just float through things instead of them reacting to you colliding with them. The moving branches and grass are the same 2D images that have been in many other games, which look out of place next to everything else. There are two exceptions in the form of small railcars that are operated to solve two puzzles, which are nice. Personally, photo visuals don't impress me, I am always more impressed when terrain reacts in cool ways, like sand moving, mud squishing, or boards swaying when walked over. I just mention that because I would say the visuals are the major selling point. This could lead to the game becoming more and more unimpressive as time goes by. (Additional note: There are many invisible walls)Gameplay had some good ideas but shallow execution. It is a detective story, with the gameplay insert (primarily) being figuring out the chronology of events at a crime scene. This is fun and in one instance I figured it out by looking at the position of a person's feet to determine movement direction. However, the most events you ever have to order in a sequence is 6. The final one only having 4 events that need ordering. One of the crime scenes was just a straight line. Overall there are only 5 crime scenes that you investigate. Additional gameplay involves the discovery of 5 locations that open up dialog. 2 of these locations have small puzzling sequences attached to them. But there is no gameplay climax moment that leaves you with satisfaction as you transition to the end.The narrative doesn’t mesh well with the atmosphere, I feel. I guess it is supposed to be a creepy story, but you are in the bright cheery outdoors. That can be unsettling when done properly, though nothing quite sells it here. Character models, their animations, and voice acting are quite average and damper the story (I do appreciate that character are actually seen, as many of these exploring games cut out people from the equation). One sequence is super silly, which also makes it so if you didn’t see the ending coming, you’ll know what it is after that. Much of your time will be quite quiet as the game takes place in a large reasonably-open valley with only a few narration triggers and pieces of paper scattered about. I am actually quite confused, or I guess unappreciative, about this large environment as it doesn’t seem to accomplish much. I timed it, and you can go 3-5 minutes of just walking down a path to get from one location to another with just light music and ambient noise to accompany you. Since the majority of the assets are just rocks and trees, there really isn’t much you can take from the environment that fills you in on the events of the past. In the underground, I thought I was actually going down an endless staircase. It seems big for the sake of being big, or it could have used more tiny things scattered about that had more significance. Overall, this game was a solid ‘eh’. "

												Note:  This is a spoiler free review, as such you might find the review vague.  That is an unfortunate side effect of being spoiler free.Synopsis in 10 words or less:  Its Dear Esther with bad puzzles.I had high hopes for this game, and was ultimately very disappointed.Regarding the graphics:  Pretty average.  Nothing special and nothing we haven't seen before.  I give the game kudos for being very photogenic, as there are plenty of nice locations and venues for landscape screenshots.  However, since the gameplay so often has you looking at the ground or nitpicking over objects you really will begin to notice that a lot of the environmental texturing quality is inconsistent.  I also noticed that pretty much the only visual filtering they used was sunbeams during the first few minutes of the game, and during the short yet enjoyable phases when following Ethan's writings.  The rest of the time the visual effects were static or just... more sunbeams.Regarding the narrative:  Let me put it this way; the premise is not what the game really is about.  Granted, the first hour or so feels pretty good, but then things start to get... well there is a noticable drop in quality.  Its as if for the first hour they were trying to make a game based on the original premise, and in the second half of the game they suddenly scrapped it and changed writers, but JUST BARELY managed to get a coherent story out for the end.  However, it was RIDDLED with plot holes, fridge logic, and hand waves.  It feels like a series of random events happening one after another in no real coherent pattern.  I do give them points for actually finishing the story and making a (barely) coherent narrative, but its the sort of thing that sneaks up on you on the last minute or two of the game and makes you go all ""well that felt pointless and empty.""  Regarding pacing:  Horrible.  Level design noticably decreased in quality during the course of the game.  At first, a lot of things were close together and there was environmental abiance after triggered events, such as distant rolling thunder over the mountains and the sky becoming overcast and such.  There is also a veeery interesting story by Ethan in the beginning.  GOOD!  However, that all just goes away after the first hour.  After that first hour, you can tell the developers tried to ""lengthen"" things by making a lot of space you could walk around in that was utterly empty and devoid of anything, especially between locations.  Like I said, its like they lost half their staff and needed to get out a game or something.  The worst part is that the gameplay encourages you to look in every nook and cranny because if you don't you'll probably miss something.  Regarding the Gameplay:  I'll be honest, an adventure game that doesn't hold your hand is an interesting concept but ultimately all this game does is prove that it makes for a frustrating experience.  What the game did well during the first hour or so was the feeling of exploration; the valley was big and interesting, with abiance and texture.  Buuuut that came to a grinding halt since you realize pretty quickly that the game is completely linear.  There are a lot of times when it is clear what you are supposed to do but you have no idea where something is, and many objects are placed so they blend in perfectly with the scenery (hense the immense amount of time staring at the ground and walls).  The game mixed two things together which simply don't go well together; linear experience where the only way to progress is to solve the puzzle, yet the puzzle involves finding something.  Okay, but the game doesn't give you any clues to where those things could be.  In other words, most of the time you will be wondering around aimlessly, without clues, trying to find the next thing to do in the game.  Its a lot like Dear Esther gameplay wise, with some puzzles thrown in with utterly no explanation on how to do them, and (at least after the first hour) instead of a stunning visual journey it just ends up as the same dirt corridor lined with rocks and pine trees, and houses that turn out to be a lot less interesting than they could be.  Regarding the sound work:  Average.  Music was forgetable but not unpleasant.  Pretty much all the same sound bits are recycled throughout the game, there is not a lot of variety.  Most of the sound effects are within the ambiance.Regarding the Characters:  Utterly and completely forgetable.  Nobody in this entire game stood out, at all.Replayability:  None.  The game's strongest point is being exposed to it for the first time and the feeling of exploration encountered in the first hour, after that it gets dull and boring and repetitive.  After getting kicked in the gut with the narrative at the end, replaying the game would just be a painful, predictable, slow experience.Value:  I wouldn't pay more than $3 for this game, the $20 price tag is ridiculous.  All things considered, this game has virtually no content.  The only reason I have 7 hours on this game is because 2 of those hours were AFK time, and the rest of that was just walking around to every nook and crannie trying to find♥♥♥♥♥♥  I'd say the actual real gameplay in this game is a little over an 1 hour, the rest of the time you will be just trying to find stuff.  So, 1 hours of real gameplay, 4 hours spent searching for♥♥♥♥♥♥ and 2 hours of AFK time.  Not worth $20 in any sense.In summary:  The premise is not what it seems.  Everyone in this game is forgetable, everything about this game is forgetable.  Its like Dear Esther (walk through the park type game) except added in frustrating gameplay and it literally just stops drops its strongest point, the visuals and the ambiance, after the first hour.  So you might have fun for an hour, but after that hour its just a boring, frustrating game.  This game is definitely not worth $20, and if you want a similar yet much better game go play Dear Esther (its free too).			"

												As a technology showcase for the Unreal engine this game does a fine job as it is exceedingly pretty and fabulously detailed even on modest hardware; but as an enjoyable narriative experience it's singularly lacking.It starts off on the wrong foot by boldly proclaiming ""This game is a narrative experience that does not hold your hand."" What exactly is the purpose of this? Is it a dig at other games? An attempted disclaimer against this sort of criticism? Are they not confident that the nature of the game will become readily apparent through playing it? It's up to the gamer to decide what the experience means to them, so stating ""this is a narrative experience"" comes across as somewhat presumptuous.Also, what's wrong with a linear narrative? That's how narratives have worked for countless ages -- you're taken through them by some other agency. Whether you're listening to a story, reading a book or watching a film, you are led through the narrative. The interactive nature of games opens up unprecedented opportunities for non-linear storytelling, but that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with the old sort.Anyway, the game. It opens up in a pretty, forested, mountainous and remote setting. Right away there are creepy traps and a gristly murder scene, which sets the scene as a sort of less-subtle Stephen King knockoff. There's an obvious puzzle - as in, something that is obviously a puzzle - and yet it became quickly obvious that solving it was optional, and that one could press ahead if one so wished.A sinking feeling that this was the narrative-delivery mechanism made me stick around to try and solve it, because I knew that I wasn't going to want to come back. One of the things you need to find is a small rock. Your unspecified spidey-sense does not help with the location of gameplay objects. The environment is filled with rocks. After a few minutes another sinking feeling that locating hard-to-find objects played a big part in this prompted me to a walkthrough, which disappointingly confirmed my suspicions on both counts. After moving the tiny rock a few yards, you then have to reassemble some fragments of a cutscene into the right order, so that the cutscene will play, something which serves no purpose other than wasting time.Not holding your hand though a narrative is one thing, but denying you that narrative until you jump through the relevant arbitrary puzzle hoops is unforgivable. A well designed puzzle is one which you feel that you *want* to solve for no reason other than to solve it. When you can see what you have to do but don't want to do it -- that is a poorly designed puzzle.The narrative segment itself was largely implausible, as those which centre around killing someone by running them over with a train tend to be.Each 'section' follows the same basic premise; there's been a horrible moider, you need to find a specific object, move it a few yards, use your spidey sense and then assemble the pieces of a cutscene. One of the sections features a completely out-of-place jump scare (which does nothing other than to push you back to the start of a maze section and destroy and immersion which you may have managed to accumulate) and then cumulates in the sort of symbol arranging pseudopuzzle that at least had the good grace to always have the same solution so that the walkthrough screenshot would solve it.The story was working towards a fairly generic sleeping-horror-must-not-be-woken kind of deal but I quite like those so stuck with it; but then at the last moment it faked out with an epically lame twist, and the credits left me feeling profoundly disenfranchised -- and that is the sole reason for my 'not recommended' review; it left me feeling like I'd wasted my time playing it.

												1: Lack of a Map.2: You get thrown in the game, without any explanation.3. After the first 'murder scene' it takes some time before you encover something new.4. The game gives you the illusion to create an 'open world' experience but it isn't. It's linear but covered up under some     neat make up.5.No HUD overlay, if you pick something up it would be handy if you could see in your inventory though6.Game time 3,3 Hours -> For 18.99 € it's a rip off. I have DLC who costs less and you get more worth for your money.			"

												The concept for this game had a lot of potential, but the story was severely lacking in depth and left you feeling jipped. The main focus of the game semmed to be on the aesthetics, which was impressive. The story, however, made an attempt to be complex and interesting, but it did not quite hit that mark. In addition, the voice acting was poor to the point that it took away from the experience. I was anticipating the release of this game, but ended up being disappointed. The open-world aspect of the game is limited and all it really affords the player is potentially unfolding the story in a mismatched order, which can definitely lead to a confused individual.Overall, while this game is very pleasing to the eye, it had a restrictive and convoluted flow that, for the most part, did not allow for the gamer to use the current scene at hand to determine where to go next. Instead, you have to wander around, hopefully finding all of the places in the ""open-world"" map.			"

												★★☆☆☆ - ""Average at best, Id give it a miss"" PROS:- Visually stunning, the game is beautiful. The textures are incredibly detailed and realistic and theres a atmosphere similar to that from Naughty Dog's 'The Last of Us'.- Room changing and Maze puzzle. This game has two terrific puzzles which whilst not difficult, worked brilliantly. The latter provides a cheeky little scare also.-Soundtrack completely sets the tone and reflects on the areas you visit and helps with immersion.CONS:- Puzzles, I only mentioned two cause in my opinion they were the only ones. For a game heavily labelled with the genres 'Mystery' and 'Detective' its completely unjustified. The detective elements are shallow as hell, they're almost insulting. At first with the traps I thought the game had pulled me into another world but I soon realised it simply tells you where to go with images not hard to work out. When you start the game it tells you, 'We will not hold your hand'..this is a lie. Whilst they are no checkpoints or mission icons the mystery elements give you everything you need without allowing you to solve a thing. There could have been real clues to make you think and lead you to the next area but instead you're told by a series of words and in some cases you line them up using the camera.- Story, this just about makes a Con cause reflecting back I did actually want to know what was going on, but do I even now? Not really, its so vague and difficult to understand not because its complicated but because its such a daft premise and it has a terrible ending.- Choose the Order of the events..okay so this is the games main mechanic. What happens if you guess incorrectly? Nothing. You try again. In some cases its insultingly easy and the stances or animations are nothing, they feel like they're put in just to make up time and gameplay. Frogwares recent Sherlock Holmes instalment 'Crimes and Punishments' has this mechanic however it only utilises it on 3 occasions during the game and its done better. That game is made out of repercussions of decisions, mini game puzzles, interrogation and real detective elements.- You feel like you achieve nothing, I didn't feel in control of anything as a detective, its more of a walking simulator like Dear Ester and more importantly like reading a book. Theres nothing wrong with that other than its not what is says on the tin.- £14.99 for 4 hours of gameplay, no thanks. Thankfully I paid £3 and thats all its worth I'm afraid.VERDICT?Its important that I inform you I planned on giving this a recommendation when I set out with this review, for the first time I have change my mind whilst writing. Thats how on the fence I was, however on reflection this game has a real lack of substance and in my opinion lies about its detective elements and about offering you a difficult thought provoking experience without much guidance. I was totally disappointed with this game.			"

												This is an interactive story, NOT a game. While the story was nice, was able to forsee the ending. Only like 10 puzzles in the entire story and a crap ton of walking around. The game just has a lot of filler to make it self feel worth your time. I wouldn't call this a game and I wouldn't suggest playing it unless you want to walk around and solve some simple puzzles. Go read a book instead of playing this interactive story, you'll thank me.			"

												Walking simulator with a really ♥♥♥♥ing stupid story. The trailer leads you to believe it's spooky but it isn't and I was bored more than anything else. Completed in 4 hours and that's counting all the time I had to backtrack because it didn't tell you how to work the key mechanic of the game and let you wander without completing objectives in a certain order. It also doesn't let you even finish the game unless you go back and do every little thing how it wants.			"

												It is a beautifull game for sure but the story never really gets finished. Also it is actually mutliple storys with 1 overarching but that makes everything quite confusing. And even if you find out why it is like that at the end it doesn't really make it better. You don't have any impact on the world you are just watching it. Which means there is no development what so ever in the story or your character. The side storys are way to short to have anything interesting happen.			"

 Backpedaling on VR support....I bought this game after reading about it's ""upcoming"" VR support here: https://twitter.com/adrianchm/status/642792961856696320?s=09The title was then announced on March 16th, 2016. As an Oculus Launch Title....when asked on the forums if VR support would still be added to the Steam version of the game and not just the Oculus Home version the developer said:  we are working on a tailor-made Virtual Reality version of the game. It is taking us a lot of time and effort to make it a great experience for VR and it is going to be released as a separate game. So basically if you bought the game after learning of pending VR support your screwed....Edit 1: Other developers on Steam who are going to have Oculus Home games have already stated they will provide free keys...so this developer has chosen not to...http://steamcommunity.com/app/302710/discussions/0/392183857624856326/ BLAZERUSH: “Yes, there is such plan.

												The Vanishing of Ethan CarterMäng mis tuli välja 26 september 2014. Tegmist on adventure, ulme ning horror mänguga. Endapoolt lisaks walking simulator. Mäng mis sai väga häid hindeid: Metacritic andis 82/100, Eurogamer 9/10, GameSpot 9/10 jne. Kas tegemist on väärt mänguga? Kas see raha tasub ennast ära?Enda poolt ütlen kohe ära, et mäng on kõvasti overrated. Miks see overrated on? Täpselt ei oska öelda, aga arvan et just enda graafilise väljanägemise poolest. Jah, pean tõdema, mäng näeb ilus välja, aga mitte midagi ulmelist. Ilusad värvid, mets on kena jne. Kuna tegemist oli mingit moodi open-world mänguga, siis see kaart oli küll väga väike. Kui nii vähestes majades sai käjja, siis ega alla sellise taseme see graafika olla ei tohiski. Lugu põhineb sellel, et sina oled eradektetiiv Paul, kes hakkab uurima Ethan Carteri ja tema pere kadumist. Ethan Carter on väike poiss, kelle unistuseks oli saada kirjanikuks ning tema pere saab mingil moel mingisuguse needuse. Nõiutud peres hakkavad suhted pigestuma ning inimesed surevad. Story iseenesest oli väga huvitav just siis kui oled horror fan. Aga see kuidas see mängijani toodi oli paras sitt, sry. Gameplayd oli väga vähe, vähem kui 4 tundi. Mulle väga meeldib, kui mina karakter monoloogi loeb ja storyt edasi kannab, aga kui seda terve mängu jooksul umes 7 korda tehti, siis on asi ikka nigel. Iga monoloog oli umbes 2 lauset, tõesti kas oli neid raske sinna lisada v? Ma saan aru, et mängu on tahetud tuua sisse tõeline dektetiivi tunne jne, aga no faking mõned vihjed võiks ikka mängu panna. Mängus pole mitte ühtegi õpetust, kuidas, mida, kus millal tegema peab! Alguses ei saanud mitte midagi aru, väga keeruline ja sisutühi tundus kuidagi. Mängus on siis pusled, tüüp olukord oli see, kui uurisid, kuidas keegi suri. Asi oli lihtne, pidid sündmuskohalt mingeid esemeid korjama ja see järel tekkisid sündmuskohta mitmeid erinevaid inimeste kivikujusid. Samad inimesed, erinevates kohtades, erinevad tegevused. Sinu ülesanne oli need tegevused õigesse järjekorda panna ja siis videot vaadata. Mäng kõige raskem pusle oli kohe alguses. Naeruväärne, see oli liht väga ebaloogiline ja raske, järgmised pusled olid liiga kerged, kõik tundus kuidagi liiga ilmne, mingit deektetiivi tunnet küll polnud. Ega sellist mängu 12-aastasele pole mõtet ette anda, see on liiga challenging. Mitte pusled pole challange, vaid see, et sa ennast mängima sunnid ja selle läbi teed on challange. Veel märkasin seda, kuidas lõpus keskkond kuidagi käest lasti, kiirelt tehtud. Viimase maja ümbrus tundus kuidagi lage ja kiiruga tehtud. Ülejäänud jõed jne olid väga ilusad. Kui story lõpust rääkida, siis kõik lõppes kuidagi liiga kähku ja arusaamatult. Mina tõesti ei saanud aru kas Ethan leiti elusana või surnuna. Kokkuvõtteks võin öelda, et mäng on veits ülehinnatud(rahaliselt mõtlen). 19 eurot ja 4 tundi, hmmm, paneb mõtlema. Kui nii suur summa, siis need peaksid ikka väga väga kvaliteetsed tunnid olema, mida nad paraku ei olnud. Ma maksaks umbes 6 vb sellise mängu eest. Aga kindlasti on ka inimesi, kes on minuga täiesti vastakuti, kindlasti see meeldib paljudele. Ka mulle meeldis! Aga alati saab paremini, pean lihtsalt halvad asjd välja tooma. Annaksin mängule 6/10.			"

I would have to say go ahead and read Supercat!'s review the game looks pretty and everything but was lacking a lot of things however was a nice walk through the woods. Feels like they put most of there work into the lanscaping and art more then anything else. I suggest using your money on a different game unless you are hunting for easy achievments.			"

												This game has as much ""game play"" and ""depth"" as a a typical graphics benchmark, such as ""Heaven Benchmark"". It looks pretty..., but I am afraid that it is as far as it goes from what I've been able to play.The game world is literally dead. There are no NPCs, animals, or anything to interact with. Nothing lives in that word. But you'll get lots of trees. Wonderful trees. Beautiful trees. And water. Trees and gorgeous scenery. If that's what you like and expect from GOOD GAME ...And you run around for hours and literally nothing happens. The story/plot is cringe-worthy, it seems to be a very stereotypical ghost/paranormal story. All that would be acceptable if the game would actually be motivating, if something, ANYTHING would happen. But it doesn't. Instead you wander around and encounter relatively mindless and ""forced"" seeming puzzles interwoven with that stereotypical ghost story.  But sorry, I have absolutelly no motivation to continue ... :((			"

												Can't say it's worth playing for anything than the beautiful visuals, which is a shame really. I thought this game had massive potential but it only took me 3 hours to get 100% achievements with no reason to play again, and the time I spent with it was pretty mediocre. The story was drab - which is vitally important for these kinds of games. The puzzles were extremely simplistic in a 'find the hidden object' kind of way. I'm honestly kind of baffled how this has such a high score.I grabbed it in a recent sale for a decent price so I don't feel cheated but I don't think it's a must play title or anything. Definitely not worth full price. Maybe $5 on sale. It's better than Dear Esther at least, but that's not saying much.If you want a good 'walking simulator' then really you should just play The Stanley Parable and skip this.Anyway this game seems designed for a very particular kind of person and mindset and apparently I'm not that person.

												If you had told me this game was anything other than a graphics showcase or a demo I would not have believed you. After beating the game, I just thought I had completed the intro and there was much more to come. But no, 1 hour and 20 minutes of gameplay and it was over. With a good speed run the game could easily be done in under an hour.The game is really beautiful and I would definitely call it unique, even had some pretty cool moments but for the lack of gameplay overall it gets pretty poor negative review from me. I bought this for 80% off during a sale and I still don't feel like I got my money's worth. I think you're just expected to stumble around and do things slowly and out of order, but even then I can't imagine getting any more than 4 hours out of this.On the bright side, it's probably one of the fastest and easiest games to get a perfect game for achievements with :p I'm not really sure if that's a good thing, but there it is.

												Nonsensical story masquerading as pretentious literature. Extremely straight-forward ""puzzles,"" an hour's worth of forced walking from one place to the next. It may look and sound gorgeous, but not one element of the game serves to enhance another. A typical example of a ""story-driven game"" that has neither a game worth playing nor a story worth engaging with.			"

												i came into this game thinking i might play 30 minutes and go to bed.... it has been 5 hours and its 1:30 in the morning, i was hooked all night and could not stop playing until i finished. this game is like reading a well written book were you can control the main character and see through his eyes. this game is a bit slow and not so much about high octain action, its a mystery adventure game with gorgeous graphics other than that i should not say. 9/10   ps. well worth the 20$ asking price "

												Oh where to start? I just finished the game which according to Steam took me 7 hours and all I can say is that I had no clue I'd been sitting here that long. No wonder I'm hungry. Right out the gate, now that I've finished it I can see why they are only charging $20 bucks for it.While the game can be as long as the 7 hours I took and possibly longer if you really have to see every single rock in the game, the game can also be ran through and beaten a lot quicker if you're not too busy stopping to admire the view along the way. In my opinion they made a mistake including the ability to run because while you do have to cover large distances to get from one plot point to the other, the game is so breathtakingly beautiful that it's nice just to walk through it, looking around and taking your time. I must say I'm in love with the tech they used for the graphics. The Next Elder Scrolls game could learn a thing or two from The Astronauts if you ask me.Graphics - Doesn't need much of a review. The screenshots and videos speak for themselves although Youtube's compression really doesn't do it justice. Ran the game on High settings at 1920x1200 using a GeForce GTX 560 and the only time I really experienced any stuttering was when I was running. (Another reason I chose to walk everywhere) They made a great choice using the Unreal Engine because in my experience Epic's engine is one of the most optimized game engines ever. You get a lot of graphics bang for your buck. Probably why so many games use it.One thing I did notice about the graphics because I looked very closely at everything is that despite them saying you won't see any tiling textures in the game, you do indeed see some throughout the game. One completely obvious and unfortunately not that well done texture that you can tell is tiled is on the train at the beginning. As you walk up to the front of it, if you go to the left and look at the cab you can see the same texture tiling over and over again horizontally wrapping around the cab of the train all the way to the other side until you get to the door. Also there's an area I think on the way to the cemetery where you can find some dead trees that are reletively in the same area and every single one of the dead trees is the exact same model just rotated a little bit around the Z axis a little from the others. I don't know if I just catch these because I 3D model or they are this obvious to everybody but I was assuming that I wasn't going to be seeing stuff like that. I mean how hard is it to apply a bend modifier to a few branches to make a few variations? Those types of things were the only part about the graphics I had a problem with and only because they made a huge deal on their website about how their game wasn't going to do that kind of stuff.Voice Acting and Story - They are both top notch. The story is pretty melancholy. The ending made my eyes water up a bit but that could be because I've been sitting in a pitch black room staring at a bright monitor for 7 hours straight. There are two different types of plot points to find. There are story pages and crime scenes. While the crimes scenes helped to piece together the storyline, the story pages are where this game really shined for me. I just wish that the story pages were more drawn out. They had some amazing scenes but unfortunately just like the main valley they were mostly aesthetic.Gameplay - If you enjoyed Gone Home or Dear Esther then you're probably going to like this game. I'm a bit more action oriented myself and while I love a good mystery and story this didn't really provide much gameplay for me. The game basically consists of looking at pretty stuff and solving around 8 puzzles (random trial and error in some of the puzzles probably increased my playtime.) Also, while the game does appear to be some sort of open world there is an obvious path to take and branching off the beaten path usually just rewards you with a wall of impassable boulders or trees and occasionally a steep cliff. There's no jump in the game so some of the large boulders that aren't used as barriers you can walk right up and over which is weird because some boulders the same size being used as barriers you can’t. Also if you encounter an elevator and the button isn't working you can walk off the edge and fall 3 or 4 stories and nothing happens to you. The problem with doing this is that you'll see all the plot points in reverse. While doing it is immersion breaking it isn’t game breaking to my knowledge. I personally reloaded a checkpoint before I fell down to the bottom so I could be wrong about that though.[Edit] Apparently a day after it was released, enough people (me included) e-mailed them about the elevator shaft bug and so they have gone and fixed it so that you can no longer fall down it. Glad to see they are listening to the fans. Awesome job Astronauts!Sound - Sound can be a big part of a game if it's done right and in this game they definitely got it right. Using 7.1 surround sound headphones I found myself turning around in a panic several times because I heard some strange noise behind me. The game definitely has some atmospheric moments where you're wondering what's going to be around the next corner. Oh and the music is pretty great as well. Works with the story. Not my cup of tea music wise but it was what this kind of game needed. I probably wouldn't listen to it outside of the game though so the digital soundtrack I got for preordering is going to be useless to me. So will the digital map for that matter now that the game is over for me.Controls - You walk, you run, you crouch once or twice, you click, and you press spacebar to perform scene skips and such. It's hard to screw that up and luckily they didn't. I did find myself hitting spacebar a few times only to smack myself in the head after remembering there is no jump for the 10th time.Replay Value - Extremely Low. Besides jumping back on the game to show it to a friend, screen grab some wallpapers or just to stare at a forest for a while because like me you live in an ugly desert there really is no reason to load it back up. A modding tool or story editor would have added to this games replay value immensely. They should have taken a cue from Amnesia. Heck, they mention Frictional Games in the credits so hopefully at some point they'll create some sort of editor to increase the replay value.Things I would have liked to have seen but didn't - Varying weather like rain and thunder storms and a day night cycle. Guess without giving our protagonist a flashlight the night cycle would have probably detracted from the beauty of the game by hiding a majority of it in darkness. But the rain, thunder, flashes of lightning, and high winds would have been cool especially in the graveyard area. You kind of see the high wind effect when he's doing his whole psychic thing but not to the extent I would have liked. I'm just a big fan of rain because I live in a desert though.Should you buy it? -  If you can afford to drop $20 bucks on a game with pretty much no replay value and it looks interesting to you then I'd say go for it. I personally sort of wish I had waited until the price dropped to something closer to 10 bucks (I’m a cheap♥♥♥♥♥ but at the same time this game was so absolutely beautiful that the hard work the developer put into this game is most definitely worth the whole $20 even if the game itself isn't. Retopologizing high poly models is a PITA (I know from experience). Support hard work and innovation. I was hoping this was going to keep me preoccupied until Alien Isolation and The Evil Within came out but it's really a one sitting and done kind of a game. I probably won't go back to it again if they don't add anything new or enable us to mod it.All that being said I'd give this game an 8 out 10. Would have been a 9 if there was more to do, a 10 if it had replay value.			"

However also because of this concept you can be left struggling and clueless for some time.

												Granted, the Vanishing of Ethan Carter was among the best scenery graphics I have ever seen.But then there is a puzzle in the mine that has a game-breaking bug that makes it NOT able to be completed. After the initial animation, it never transitions you to the next map. It doesn't even teleport you anywhere. It simply sits there with the animation looping forever, until you press Ctrl+Alt+Del. The only way around it is to put the game to windowed at 800x600 until you reach the next scene. And even after nearly a full year, the developers have STILL not fixed it.And to make matters worse, the Developers specifically stated that pre-orders would include special features that would be EXCLUSIVE to pre-orders, and then Release Day came along with the addition of The Collector’s Edition DLC, which was all of the stuff they stated was going to be EXCLUSIVE to the pre-orders.So for Developer dishonesty to their customers, and for not bothering to fix game-breaking bugs, this game gets a Fail grade from me.

												First off, let me say the graphics and music selection are outstanding; they're truly top notch. On that aspect, you get what you pay for. That being said, I have to give the game a negative rating based on the fact that it allows you to skip entire sections of the storyline and proceed to later events without ever telling you so. In a game where you're already faced with searching for clues and collecting obscure information, it would be nice to atleast know you're in the right place, or experiencing the game in the right order for that matter.

It will only save if you finish one of the puzzles and if you're not lucky that can take 30 minutes or more.

												Not diminishing the work on the visual aspect of the game, I would still like to point out that this title lacks the actual gameplay. The situation here is similar to Dear Esther. A marvel to look at, but a real bore to play. Save system is very strange. It does not save the progress on the riddles, it can only remember if you solved a puzzle or not. The investigation process is never explained and I think it serves to artificially extend the already short game. If it were not for backtracking to the very first puzzle and a subsequent run through the mines to the final basement my gameplay would be rather shorter. All in all, the situation with this game's reviews looks like a circlejerk where the participants secretly agree that this game is a waste of time and not a game at all, but are too afraid to voice it in public for fear of  peer pressure. Therefore, we see this hype ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like ""marvelous, thought provoking"", etc.WTF is the astronaut tag game? WTF is the ending? The first is obviously the homage they pay to themselves as a game developer. And the second is like a slap in the face of the player.One thing is for certain - the devs can only handle mindless shooters like Painkiller and I would gladly settle for it.

												I cannot recommend this game, because it in my opinion doesn't qualify as a game.It is more like an interactive story, but the interactivity does nothing to improve on anything.Since there are no game elements - there is no way to ""lose"", for instance - the choice to not include a simple way to navigate between the ""chapters"" of the story, or something as simple as a map, mystifies me. Instead we are forced to wander back and forth across the albeit gorgeous landscape, searching for what to experience next. The fact that you can find these things in the wrong order and have to go back looking for the rest of them in order to ""finish"" the story only adds to the aggravation.At risk of spoiling things, and you may not want to read any further if you don't want to be spoiled, it seems strange that the makers of this program didn't include a ""fast travel"" option that would let us instantly go back to places we had already visited. After all, one such fast-travel mechanism is introduced at the very end, when everything is pretty much over. Strangely it is only usable from the most remote part of the area, so once you have used it you are still forced to walk all across the landscape over and over if you need to use it again. The landscape is marvellously beautiful, but I still find myself permanently pressing the ""run faster"" button in order to get around at a reasonable pace. The mood of the story would have won a great deal if running wasn't always possible, but instant relocating was.I suppose the puzzles in the story could be called a game, but since they can all be solved with brute force with little need to think or find clues, I don't know if I can agree. Once again, there is no way to ""lose"", which I think is a critical part of a game. Since nothing you do has any effect on the story whatsoever, the idea to wrap the story in a very pretty environment and sell it as a game is a bit strange. Presumably the market for barely interactive puzzle adventures isn't that great.			"

												I cannot begin to describe how boring and tedious this game was to navigate.Notice that I didn't say play.While there appear to be some inventory management puzzles, these merely amount to a checkpoint system. Go click on one thing, watch a bunch of words circle around; then, go click another thing. Some of these things that you click give you puzzle pieces of larger visions. But collecting all the parts of these visions involve long meanders across very similar looking terrain. It is all very green or rocky, or occupied by dilapidated structures and abandoned buildings, but all so very empty.The stretches between finding something, anything, to interact with are painfully long and litter the aforementioned overgrown and homogenous landscape. Now don't get me wrong, the settings are very pretty and detailed. The music creates a sense of foreboding and mood. The sound is composed of subtle authentic sounding forest noises: wind rustling branches, distant lonely birds and so on.There is a large amount of real estate to traverse and you only have two speeds of travel: excrutiatingly slow and merely painfully slow. There is no fast travel; though, for reasons I never discovered, you can crouch.I thought maybe the crouch move would be for some stealth elements or to get into low places, but since I encountered not a single other soul and didn't go inside anything other than a train car, I couldn't figure out a purpose for the key other than simulating my character napping from all the boredom.Probably the most absurd moment is right at the beginning when the game announces that it won't be holding your hand. Immediately, anything you encounter simply involves holding the mouse button and then words swirl on the screen quite literally telling you what to do. (i.e. Old train engine with a connection for a crank? Go find crank: check.)Not holding my hand, as best I can tell, is a reference to the sprawling, mostly empty, landscapes that you must travel without the aid of an automap function. Wandering in circles hoping to bump into the next thing I'm suppossed to stand in front of and hold a mouse button to activate isn't my idea of fun.The voice acting is good, but the few things that the narrator (presumably your character, though I didn't hear/see that definitively stated) are noir platitudes. The character talks about working hundreds of cases as a detective, but we don't get any details. The character talks about the darkness of the locale, but no sense imagery is used. The narrator mentions going to the 'other side' and leaving parts of himself there. Beyond leaving his automap there, I had no idea what that really meant or why I should care.In the end, I simply dashed around as much of the environment as I could. The few locations that looked even remotely interesting or promising were closed, gated or had no obvious mean of approach, which seems like an appropriate metaphor for experinecing this 'game'.The Vanishing of Ethan Carter sounds nice and looks pretty, but it is vapid and empty, grasping at mood and a random and distant scattering of things to click on, instead of providing any interesting characters and the promised narrative experience.

												I wanted to like this, you know. A Very intriguing setting, as I really like mysteries and the process of uncovering them. But for me, the Vanishing of Ethan Carter fell a little short. I won't debate the price of it or existence as a game. I won't go very into this. Probably. The world of Vanishing of Ethan Carter is absolutely stunning. I noticed I spent most of the time just looking at the beautiful landscape, seeing the love and work put into this. I felt like I was physically there, in Red Creek Valley, my feet at the grass and running on the dirt roads. Atmospheric isn't an adequate term to describe it. Never before I have been so immersed. It isn't even the realistic style behind it – I can get immersed into a world made of pixelated graphics or simple colors. It's really hard to say what pulled me in. The soundscape, perhaps.Oh, the music in this is very lovely and also very creepy, carefully put in the right places. I felt delighted every time the music started playing.Collecting notes and miscellanous items throughout the game was interesting to say the least. I'm a sucker for those, always yearning for knowledge and the game lore. And I really loved the fact you start the game with ""We won't hold your hand"" type of text. It felt like a challenge, and I was thrilled.The mechanic behind solving the murders was simple and often times I felt like the puzzles weren't very challenging (with the exception of the mine caves because hahah, I wasn't prepared for that......). In the beginning I was a little at loss what to do but I got the hang of it pretty soon. I won't debate the easiness of puzzles though, because everyone experiences them differently. At this point when I fully understood what the game wanted from me (this was probably at one hour point) I felt like a part of the game's charm stopped. I didn't feel challenged anymore, I didn't feel excited anymore.Where the world was immensely immersive, I found it hard to learn the characters and actually to get interested in them. Even at the end I felt nonchalant, even towards Ethan. They felt hollow, like ghosts which is ironic. The voice acting was good, so there is no problem in that. I would say the problem is in the setting because the narrator is an outsider. You're not being given information purposely – but as he has the power to experience the last moments of dead people, shouldn't there be some way to experience it a little more thoroughly? This is just my opinion but as a really empathetic person this is weird that I didn't get to feel as much as I wanted to. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter has a way of immersing people but not enough. Like I already said in the beginning, it falls a little short. It never rises to the excellent category, at least for me. The space scene was amazing though and I will give it its well-deserved credit. The game begins strong but ends up toning itself down too much.And no, I'm not saying you shouldn't buy this game despite giving it a thumbs-down. Everyone feels differently, experiences differently. Maybe you will like this more than I did.			"

												Though Ethan has vanished, this game will surely not vanish from my mind for a long time. Through this review i want to make a short description of the game without spoiling it and also compare it to several games from which resemble it.First of all the thing that strikes you is the graphics. Everything is amazing about the graphics. I always have been of the opinion that just by looking at the water you can observe how marvelous a game is and it's certainly the case for The Vanishing too. Shortly and as ""spoilerless"" as possible, the plot is about finding Ethan Carter who, of course, has dissapeared. As the game is too deep i won't reveal more about the story. The gameplay is not about how long it takes to beat it. It's a game about exploring, a game where you take you time, you go at your own pace. Also the story is not linear and every puzzle can be solved in any order(it just takes you thinking to figure out which event happened first). A great comparison would be Dear Esther which comes close to the idea of this game. Speaking about how deep the game is, well...Bioshock Infinite-deep. To be more precise, even deeper. I have not been more mind blown by a game than by The Vanishing...not even by Bioshock Infinite. Of course, it is the kind of game where everything makes sense only at the end, so don't try to understand too much of the story.Being classified as horror i was skeptic at first. Not that i don't like horror games, but it certainly didn't look like it. Oh boy how wrong i was! It has a few jumpscares (inevitable, but unexpected) and the game also made me realise i have a phobia for abandoned places, a fear of the unknown. The atmosphere works great for freaking me out. A better understanding of how great and creepy the atmosphere is is to give an example of a game. Well, i'm going to give 2 examples as they both fit: Silent Hill and Gone Home. Gone home tends to be more like The Vanishing, as it is set on exploring and self-discovery of the events. Silent Hill is best to describe the fear the game gives you while exporing it.As for the mechanics of the game, the murder-solving part gave me the impression of Murdered: Soul-Suspect, though a little bit different in reconstructing the crimes. I must admit the cases were really easy to understand and there was nothing special at all but hey, they contribute to the mind-blowing ending.All in all, if i were to give it a mark, it would certainly be a 10 out of 10. The game is fantastic and give you a chance to truly become one with Paulo Prospero (the main character). Hope i haven't spoiled any of the fun (actually i'm sure i didn't) and i recommend this game to every player out there (unless you have a heart disease or something).			"

												Very short (3-4 hrs) yet beautifully rendered and quite... an empty game. There are a few puzzles, mostly easy and a general feeling of oldschool adventures. Tho, it's decieving. It starts to repeat itself after the first scene until the very end.7.5/10			"

The mechanics are amazing and desirve an award on their own. The story was utterly fantastic. The game has it's tense moments but is truely a detective mystery in the same vein as H.P.

I personally recomend it 10/10  Ok starting off i waited until around 8pm to play this game, I woke up at 8am and checked almost 4 times an hour to see if it was avaliable. Finally i was able to download it, i booted it up and held my breath. Let me tell you after that my breath was taken away the amount of detail in this game is down right art its stunningly beautiful and the best graphics i have ever seen in video games to date. The story is so gripping and intriguing that youre afraid of whats going to happen next but you cant help but keep playing. You start to unfold the games plot but for every answer you are left with three more questions. This game is a masterpiece definately worth 20$ heck id pay 60$			"

												Obviously this game is stunning.  Gameplay it's very slow paced, but intriguing and engaging if in the right headspace for this sort of thing.  Mostly you just wander around until you stumble on a puzzle or murder, and then put clues together to figure out what happened.  I lvoe some of the weirder and darker turns the story has taken. I also really appreciate that, as the game warns when started, this is a narrative EXPERIENCE with ZERO HAND HOLDING.  Don't expect a single hint as to where to go or what to do.  One puzzle in particular really stood out as feeling worthwhile once I figured out what exactly I was supposed to do completely on my own.  In any other game it would have been an empty exercise because they would have told me how to do it, but genuinely figuring out the puzzle from mechanics to completion was rewarding.  Overall well worth $20 but not certainly not for everyone.  Minimal ineraction with environments, no enemies, no inventory, no weapons.  Just using your brain.			"

The way the game starts out is very unique, and i liked it a lot better than how most games start. there is no tutorial, but the controls are pretty standard so its not hard at all to get used to! but yeah! you should buy this game! the graphics alone already push it to be worth more than 20 dollars, and the story and the concept is fantastic! i would say more but you gotta find out for yourself!

Gameplay is a bit chippy, movement isnt as smooth as one hoped it to be, but Ive seen worse. I havn't played the game enough to write on the story and concept, but my first impressions were very positive. As I explored the world more, the non-linear gameplay seems a bit strange. The puzzles are sometimes very challenging, althought when you get the hang of it it gets more logical. A little help where to go next would make the progression easier(pointers, clues of various sorts). I still like it, the game makes you think which makes you more immersed in the game.

There was a few things in the game that came off as weird after beating the game, that didnt have any real relevence for the game. I would still recommend it because it's fairly pretty and the mechanic of the game are fairly well done though, overly easy and kind of tedious sometimes, IMO.

												Very pretty albeit somewhat hollow exploration adventure. This new genre of story-focused adventure games without any tricky puzzles seems to be gaining traction lately, and I'm all for it. However, problems arise when the actual story isn't particularly strong, which I feel is the case with The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.You play as Paul Prospero, a kind of a psychic private detective sent to investigate a disappearance in Red Creek Valley, a small rural community that looks like it could exist somewhere in British Columbia. You quickly find out that the whole place is deserted, and your task is to piece together the fates of the inhabitants by the means of your paranormal abilities. You can't directly commune with the otherworld, but instead have to gather various clues which in turn enable you to construct a timeline of the events.None of the detective sequences are particularly taxing on the little grey cells, and they're not meant to be. The game strives to build a strong atmosphere, and for the most part it definitely succeeds. The drop dead gorgeous graphics do help immensely with the suspension of disbelief, but I felt that the narrative just wasn't on par with the rest of the game. Some of the story strands were just a little bit too ridiculous and childish for my liking, but the cardinal sin is the attempt to explain away the shortcomings of the tale at a late point in the game.Nevertheless, I was entertained and intrigued by The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and didn't feel shortchanged after the credits rolled. The game is good, but it could've been something even better with a less pulpy script.			"

Interesting story with twist that could be predicted or not ;P After all facts gathered i was rethinking whole game - that's good for adventure game i think.Technical stuff is very easy to review - MASTERPIECE the best graphic on the market thx to unique technology.

												You have only made a few steps in the forest that you are already struck by this disturbing, mysterious and dream-like atmosphere. You will discover little by little all by yourself (there is no objective marker, there is no map at all till the last minutes) the valley and its secret through story pages left by a young boy that you are tasked to find.Puzzles are rather simple, very intuitive but the strength of the game is making you plain actor of their resolution : you will collect clues and then reassemble events that form a whole that looks surrealist at first and plainly makes sense in a conclusion that kept in store a clever and moving twist.As someone who always loved writing stories since childhood this game definitely rings a bell and capture the beauty and power of imagination.

												Killer graphics and world design. Concept was difficult to follow and without a tutorial made the game difficult but not impossible. The side plots were strange and incredibly non-linear. Save yourself some time and just avoid them altogether. The music was almost compltely unecessary and I turned it off...it just didn't fit with the world. Don't pay more than $5.00 for this game. You will get around 5 hours of play out of it....if your a decently skilled gamer. It has ZERO replayablity. While the initial story was great, the ending was quite possibly one of the worst I've seen in a long time. It was a complete and total debacle, which essentially ruined the game for me. Also, because of the nature of the game, once you've figured it out, there is literally no point in playing again.			"

												Pros:-Beautiful graphics-Interesting puzzle concept.  You're pretty much playing CSI.-The house puzzle was pretty cool once I figured out what the hell I was doing.-All the short stories are interesting.-Got to go into outer space.-Voice acting isn't too bad.-Great unsettling atmosphere.-Music really sets the mood.Cons:-A bit buggy while I was trying to solve the puzzles.-No option to save at will.  You'll have to redo things if you need to quit before it's autosaved, which only seems to happen after solving a puzzle.-While an interesting concept, the CSI type puzzles get super easy after the first one, since they all follow the same steps.-Although realistic in distances between things, it gets old really quickly when you have to walk forever to get back to a place.  That mine didn't need to be 10 flights of stairs down.-Story line was really confusing until you got to the end, and then it's kinda a lame explanation for it all.-Too short for the price I paid, imo.-Says it doesn't hold your hand, but I was most frustrated just finding where to go for the next puzzle.  The puzzles themselves seemed to outright tell you where to look for things to solve them.All in all... it's not really a bad game.  I just feel disappointed in what I got for the price.  I feel like the CSI type puzzles could have been more in depth.			"

												I would not recommend buying this game. If you're curious, you can watch some gameplay online. The game is GORGEOUS, I'll give it that, but then it falls flat. The puzzles are frustrating and easy at the same time, the plot is non-existent, the characters are forgettable. I didn't feel immersed at all. They promise an open world and open it is, but there is literally nothing there. I found a grenade somewhere in the woods, that's it. I don't know if that was intentional or not, but I see no point in creating this beautiful, detailed scenery with nothing to do (apart from the obvious puzzles).I wish they focused more on the plot, instead of the world. Same graphics, smaller locations plus a decent plot and I would probably like it. For now, I think of it as a running-through-the-forest simulator with some spooky spooks somewhere in the background.			"

												Not for everyone. Not a exactly a game, but rather an interactive story, a slow paced one. My personal opinion as a veteran hard core gamer is that  this game is - BEAUTIFUL but..... boring (for me). No hard feelings, it is just a personal opinion. If you like to play it, repare for something different and approach it with no expectations... who knows, you might like it. Especially if you are patient player who does not mind exploring beautifull , lonely environments looking for clues for the story to move on.			"

												While this game may be quite short (took me 4 hours to 100%), what it lacks in length it makes up for in it's story. This game is outstanding. You play as a mysterious detective, searching for a young boy who vanished name Ethan Carter. To tell anymore would spoil the story. The graphics are spectacular, absolutely stunning, as well as the soundtrack that fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the game. But be warned, this game is quite difficult due to the fact there is literally NO HANDHOLDING. You are thrust in the game to do as you wish. It's the least linear game out there. All in all it is a fantastic experience and is worth $20 easily, most definitely the $11 it is on sale right now. What are you doing still reading, buy the game.			"

												Ethan Carter is something unusual and memorable.  Equal parts beauty, desolation, and atmosphere pregnant with uncanny menace, it is one of the few games that has made a lasting impression on me.The core of the game is its story, which could have made a fine short story in its own right.  It's tight and surprisingly emotionally charged for a work of weird fiction.  The storytelling is tight and clever, rewarding attention to detail and encouraging contempation of what you have just seen and what you are not seeing.  The story was genuinely engaging, and had me actively trying to work out what was going on rather than just letting it unfold.The gameplay supports the story.  Unlike other games of the exploring/ puzzle-solving variety, these puzzles are not mere obstacles to the unfolding of the narrative.  They aren't fiddly locks that bar your progress, tempting you to find a solution online just so you can get on with it.  These puzzles would not make sense without the story, and the story unfolds through the puzzles; they're an integral part of the narrative and do not take you out of the world.  They were not difficult or arbitrary, and I was satisfied to tinker with them when necessary, which it rarely was because everything made sense.  One of the game's few weaknesses was the ease of most of the puzzles.The only other was its shortness -- I just wasn't ready to leave Red Creek Valley yet. However, these weaknesses are trivialities.  I cannot recommend it enough and I look forward to playing it again some day.			"

												Note: It looks like I only played this game for 49 minutes, but I actually played entirely through on the Redux version. Unfortunately, Steam will not allow me to review the Redux Version and would not let me review this game until I installed the original version and let it run.Pros: - It is a pretty game.- The mood is downright creepy at times.- The investigation mechanics are interesting and organically motivate the player to solve what happened and continue their investigation. Cons: - I disliked the ending of the game.Long discussion regarding the ending: I was linked to an article which discusses the ending of the game at length, and I've had some more time to think about it. I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with ambiguous game endings. They can be done very well. For example, in Ocarina of Time, when young Zelda turns to face Link we are left with a big question: Does Zelda remember anything at all about all of the time travel and hardships that we have gone through to save her? Or have we permanently erased all of her memores of that by saving the world?I also don't think there is anything inherently wrong with having a twist either. Twists can be very effective. Look at Psycho by Alfred Hitchcock. When I first saw that movie, I was completely freaked out by meeting Norman Bates' grandmother.I think the twist or amgibuous ending is not effective in this game is because it erases or invalidates the agency of the player.Up until the ending, we (Paul Prospero) have done a lot of legwork. We have solved multiple murders by dipping into the spirit world. We have evaded a monster in a stressful stealth section. For all of our work, we are expecting a payoff.Our overall goal: Saving Ethan Carter's life. The game never explicitly tells us this is the goal, but we don't need to be told. We want to save Ethan, for multiple reasons:- The murder segments portray Ethan as an innocent kid. We feel bad for him.- The internal monologue portrays us as a detective or investigator of some kind. An intelligent, analytical type. Probably the sort who would rather save a child than kill a child.- The internal monologue states that Paul knows about the evil in the valley. He describes it in negative terms, so he likely wants to foil it.- The murder segments show that Ethan is being pursued by people with evil intent.- The murder segments show that Ethan continues to narrowly escape death. We admire Ethan's resourcefulness and ability to stay one step ahead.- We are not given a timeframe for when these events occured, how long ago they happened. It may be too late if we don't hurry.- All of our actions and footsteps lead us closer to Ethan.So, given our goals and the assumed persona of Paul Prospero, an ideal ending or payoff would resolve Ethan's situation due to our actions. Our agency had some sort of result, for better or for worse. The ending does not work well in Ethan Carter because it destroys our agency and it makes our work irrelevent. Since there are multiple interpretations on what the ending means, I will show what I mean for several of them:Interpretation 1. If Paul is only in Ethan's imagination, then we don't exist. All of our hard work and actions (walking around, sleuthing, evading monsters) did not happen. We are fictional. Ethan dies in a fire (most likely) and there is nothing we ever did about it. You had no agency.Interpretation 2. If Paul is Death or an Angel transitioning Ethan to the other side, then the legwork we accomplished (sleuthing, solving crimes) is incongruous to the end goal. Remember that all of our actions have been moving towards saving Ethan's life, or at least resolving the ""sleeper"" situation. We are again told that all of that legwork does not relate to actual reality. All of the murders we solved never occured in real life. While we do save Ethan's ""soul"" or transition him to the after-life, it is not rewarding because we, as Paul, never worked at doing that through the game.Interpretation 3. If the entire game is also just a story of Ethan's, then we don't exist. We had no agency. Our legwork did not matter.I think there is a lot of frustration with this game not because of a twist or an ambiguous ending, but because the game rips away the agency of the players at the worst possible moment, after all the work to reach the ending. There is no payoff. In fact, it tears down the work they did to reach the ending.This ending might have actually worked well if ""The Vanishing of Ethan Carter"" was a movie or a book, not a video game. In a book, I would just read about Paul Prospero's actions. I would be along for the ride, not deciding what he does. If he was fictional in the end, that would not bother me. It's Paul's problem, not mine. In a film, same thing. However, in an interactive video game, the ending pokes the player directly in the chest and boldly declares ""YOU DO NOT EXIST"" or ""YOUR ACTIONS DID NOT MATTER"".That said, any game that can make me empathize with the protagonist and become him for several hours is not all that bad. I was honestly extremely interested in the supernatural detective bit, taking on a Cthulu-level crisis. It is a shame they wasted what had been, up until the ending, a very engaging and intense gaming experience. Paul Prospero is awesome. It is too bad he never existed. "

												Many people hyped the game because of its great graphics so I bought it at steam sale. Here is my experience with this game:Positive points GraphicsThe game looks pretty sweet. I expected a little bit more after the big hype about the graphic but the game looks good enough.AtmosphereVery good! I really like the feeling while I walked around the world. Some people complain that the world is dead (for example no animals in the fortress) but I like that because it fits to the game atmosphere.PuzzlesThe puzzles are quite good! They are not too hard to solve but you have to think about what you have to do next. Good mix for casual puzzle player. Hardcore puzzlers may find the puzzles too easy.Neutral pointsStoryThe story is one of the most important points of the game. I enjoyed the tour but the ending was.. well it could be better. The story is also not that long. I completed the story in about 5 hours - without rushing. You can discover everything and you can also get all achievements in this 5 hours without having a time problem.BugsNot many. The elevators are the main source for serious bugs (glitching through the elevator) and also got some vision bugs at a cut scene but at all I didnt have many bugs found.GameplayWell this game is more a interactive movie than a real game. It doesnt have real gamplay and you will spend a lot of time with just walking around.Negative points Save SystemSave points are badly placed. No option to save the game on your own.ReplayabilityAfter you finished the game you will have no real reason to play it again. There are no alternative endings. The only reason to start the game again is to get the achievements (you will get nearly all if you just complete the game).In the end I have to say that the game is not worth 19€ because of the lack of content. If you enjoy games like this you should definitively buy and play this game but wait until it is on sale. Suggested price is 5-8€ in my opinion.			"

												This game is a playable mystery movie. It is not about action, it is about watching the plot unfold as you solve puzzles. Your character has very limited abilities in the ""movie"" - you can walk/run, view things, interact with things, and crouch. Everything is in first-person view. There is no real ""action"" - you won't be shooting at things, or ducking, or anything like that. You will be moving from puzzle to puzzle in order to advance the plot.Graphics are very pretty (Unreal engine), and when everything is turned up to max it can cause even a beefy system to jitter every now and then. Sound consists or eerie music and environmental sounds, all of which are good.I find it hard to say if the game is good or bad... The very first words you see upon running the game tell you flat out that the game does not hold your hand. Simple puzzles are just that, but more advanced puzzles are not self-evident. If you like puzzle games, you will probably like this game. If you like playable movie games, you may like this game.I like puzzle games (e.g., Portal, Portal 2, Limbo, etc.). I don't have much experience with playable movies, although the PlayStation Drake's series feel that way. This game just hasn't drawn me in. One annoying feature of the game is savegames. The game only does saves at certain checkpoints, and those checkpoints, from what I can tell, are at the beginning of each puzzle. Some puzzles take a while to complete, so if you do 80% and then need to close the game, when you load the game up you lose all your progress. I really hate that.As a result of all this, I won't give the game a global recommendation. If you like puzzle games and playable movie games, you may like this game. I would keep a walkthrough handy if I were you...Rating: 3/5			"

												The save system completely ruins the game.

												Beautiful environments and a mildly interesting storyline. That's all this game offers.The gameplay is abyssmal; it's like a massive scavenger hunt without any list of what you're scavenging for. You literally run all over the place looking for something that you can click on to inspect, then something else you can inspect, and then you'll get to solve a mediocre difficulty puzzle, and you rinse and repeat this process about 5-6 times throughout the game.I truly wanted to like this game. It's an interesting concept. The execution is simply poor.The only reason this game is 3-4 hours long is because you'll spend a good hour or two just running all over figuring out what the hell to do next.""Doesn't hold your hand"" is code for ""Provides no direction whatsoever, and wants you to find miniature items that blend in completely with environments. Have fun!""Literally, you at one point need to find a rock. A *rock*. Oh and guess what you're next to? A river bed. Which is absolutely covered in rocks. 3/10, would not pay full price for it. Only reason I'm not furious is that I got it on Steam sale.Developers could *really* do better than they did here and I'm pretty sure they know it.			"

												I'm not quite sure why this game is getting all these good reviews. I can not really recommend it. There is way too litte gameplay here. All you do is play as a camera moving through the world and doing very simple interactions. That is if you can actually find the interactive pieces. This can be quite unfun, in fact, when you are looking for the proverbial needle in the haystack. Many things are obvious but there are also several annoyingly hidden things that are quite easy to miss and it is simply not fun to pixel hunt in a world of this size when you don't even know whether to look close by or far away.The game definitely should have had a short example murder case separate from the story as a tutorial to explain some of the basics. It is easy to miss the forest for the trees and get confused about how to progress in the beginning (the ""no handholding"" thing is not a good excuse to not explain at least the fundamental gameplay stuff).Exploration is a massive waste of time as most of the world is empty. The lack of any real save feature is also irritating to say the least.On the plus side we'd have to acknowledge that the visuals are beautiful. Very nice and atmospheric. The only problems I noticed were that my MSI Afterburner showed thousands of FPS in DirectX 9 mode, even though the game was actually stuttering quite a bit at the highest details with 8x MSAA turned on @ 2560x1440.The story is interesting and was the only thing that motivated me to keep playing. Unfortunately, it was also fairly confusing at times and pretty weird with that sleeper and some of the supernatural stuff that did not really match with the whole setting very well. It did come together OK in the end, however, and it was fun reading about others' interpretations of the events and the ending on the forums. On a whole I just can't recommend this game. Maybe when it's on sale for €/$ 4.99 but anything above that and you risk severe disappointment. You can spend probably between 5 and 10+ hours playing the game if you don't know what to do and have to search, pixel hunt and trial&error a lot but if you know what to do then the actual content is only about an hour or two MAX and that's just because -even when sprinting- it will take lots of time to cover the long distances in the game world. Some people might consider the pixel hunting and trial&error fun but to me it was just a waste of time at some point so I admit I used a guide every time when I couldn't figure something out after a few minutes.A possible sequel needs:- A proper tutorial (separate from the main game, maybe even just in text form accessible from the main menu)- Way more gameplay and interaction with the world, NPCs and objects - A less empty game world where exploration is more rewarding- Maybe a journal with optional basic hints on how to proceed and maybe with a map, too- More risk (for the MC to die)- A save feature - ideally save anytime/anywhere quick saves for people with RL obligations			"

												This is not a game. Unless you like mystery games, this game can quickly become boring. The game prides itself on not holding the players hand although I found this to be irritating. the game mechanics have to be accidently discovered as well as what you're s'pose to do in game. A very basic turtorial or text objective would go a long way. By the time the player works out why question marks are all over the screen the player is about half way through the games map. This means that you have to return to the start of the game to look for all the puzzles you missed. positives of the game include a creepy immersive world, innovative gameplay, Beautiful scenery and a grsbbong ost. The mystery solving aspect of the game will engross anyone who likes a mystery. For the rest of us who like a good balance of gamplay and story, I recomend giving this one a miss. if you are going to buy it, find a tutorial or walkthrough before playing.			"

												Although the graphics and texturing were beauitfully done, the gameplay was so ridiculously short it is not worth the 20 bucks I paid for it. I finished the game in less than 6 hours, and unfortunately with this game once you finish the game there's nothing left to do. With games like the GTA series you can at least get stuff you missed, play multiplayer, do mini games etc but here once you finish you're done.			"

												Beautiful. But that's it pretty much. I wanted to love this but it could've been so much more, and better. The story was objectively ok but subjectively not pleasing enough. The feelings of mystery and suspence fade when not understanding what to do, backtrack and finally play the game with walkthrough on alt tab. This cannot match the fabulous Dear Esther.			"

												The game looks beautiful, but there is something about fov and view itself which is wrong. I got literally sick after 40-50 minutes of gameplay. I finished Far Cry 3, which had similar issue, but it was much weaker and reducing fov helped. In The Vanishing of Ethan Carter I reduced fov to minimum (70) and turned off smoothing, but it didn't help. I have never experienced this amount of motion sickness from a game. It made the game unplayable for me.			"

												Easily best described as similar gameplay to that of Dear Esther. This beautifully developed and detailed toss into the life of Ethan Carter can only be experienced; not just written about.Within the first minutes of the game I had already had several jump frights which got me on edge expecting what more could be coming. From blood, gore, and the detailed story that follows with it; you play a detective looking for the missing Ethan Carter. You travel through the fantastic world (and Yes... I stood in awe - See the screenshots I took) trying to solve the case.Through the eyes of the detective you find a world unexpected and a family in turmoil.As this is your last case... it will certainly take you on a rollercoaster through the life of a young boy, scorn and outcast.Highly Recommend!

												Ethan Carter is something unusual and memorable.  Equal parts beauty, desolation, and atmosphere pregnant with uncanny menace, it is one of the few games that has made a lasting impression on me.The core of the game is its story, which could have made a fine short story in its own right.  It's tight and surprisingly emotionally charged for a work of weird fiction.  The storytelling is tight and clever, rewarding attention to detail and encouraging contempation of what you have just seen and what you are not seeing.  The story was genuinely engaging, and had me actively trying to work out what was going on rather than just letting it unfold.The gameplay supports the story.  Unlike other games of the exploring/ puzzle-solving variety, these puzzles are not mere obstacles to the unfolding of the narrative.  They aren't fiddly locks that bar your progress, tempting you to find a solution online just so you can get on with it.  These puzzles would not make sense without the story, and the story unfolds through the puzzles; they're an integral part of the narrative and do not take you out of the world.  They were not difficult or arbitrary, and I was satisfied to tinker with them when necessary, which it rarely was because everything made sense.  One of the game's few weaknesses was the ease of most of the puzzles.The only other was its shortness -- I just wasn't ready to leave Red Creek Valley yet. However, these weaknesses are trivialities.  I cannot recommend it enough and I look forward to playing it again some day.			"

												Note: It looks like I only played this game for 49 minutes, but I actually played entirely through on the Redux version. Unfortunately, Steam will not allow me to review the Redux Version and would not let me review this game until I installed the original version and let it run.Pros: - It is a pretty game.- The mood is downright creepy at times.- The investigation mechanics are interesting and organically motivate the player to solve what happened and continue their investigation. Cons: - I disliked the ending of the game.Long discussion regarding the ending: I was linked to an article which discusses the ending of the game at length, and I've had some more time to think about it. I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with ambiguous game endings. They can be done very well. For example, in Ocarina of Time, when young Zelda turns to face Link we are left with a big question: Does Zelda remember anything at all about all of the time travel and hardships that we have gone through to save her? Or have we permanently erased all of her memores of that by saving the world?I also don't think there is anything inherently wrong with having a twist either. Twists can be very effective. Look at Psycho by Alfred Hitchcock. When I first saw that movie, I was completely freaked out by meeting Norman Bates' grandmother.I think the twist or amgibuous ending is not effective in this game is because it erases or invalidates the agency of the player.Up until the ending, we (Paul Prospero) have done a lot of legwork. We have solved multiple murders by dipping into the spirit world. We have evaded a monster in a stressful stealth section. For all of our work, we are expecting a payoff.Our overall goal: Saving Ethan Carter's life. The game never explicitly tells us this is the goal, but we don't need to be told. We want to save Ethan, for multiple reasons:- The murder segments portray Ethan as an innocent kid. We feel bad for him.- The internal monologue portrays us as a detective or investigator of some kind. An intelligent, analytical type. Probably the sort who would rather save a child than kill a child.- The internal monologue states that Paul knows about the evil in the valley. He describes it in negative terms, so he likely wants to foil it.- The murder segments show that Ethan is being pursued by people with evil intent.- The murder segments show that Ethan continues to narrowly escape death. We admire Ethan's resourcefulness and ability to stay one step ahead.- We are not given a timeframe for when these events occured, how long ago they happened. It may be too late if we don't hurry.- All of our actions and footsteps lead us closer to Ethan.So, given our goals and the assumed persona of Paul Prospero, an ideal ending or payoff would resolve Ethan's situation due to our actions. Our agency had some sort of result, for better or for worse. The ending does not work well in Ethan Carter because it destroys our agency and it makes our work irrelevent. Since there are multiple interpretations on what the ending means, I will show what I mean for several of them:Interpretation 1. If Paul is only in Ethan's imagination, then we don't exist. All of our hard work and actions (walking around, sleuthing, evading monsters) did not happen. We are fictional. Ethan dies in a fire (most likely) and there is nothing we ever did about it. You had no agency.Interpretation 2. If Paul is Death or an Angel transitioning Ethan to the other side, then the legwork we accomplished (sleuthing, solving crimes) is incongruous to the end goal. Remember that all of our actions have been moving towards saving Ethan's life, or at least resolving the ""sleeper"" situation. We are again told that all of that legwork does not relate to actual reality. All of the murders we solved never occured in real life. While we do save Ethan's ""soul"" or transition him to the after-life, it is not rewarding because we, as Paul, never worked at doing that through the game.Interpretation 3. If the entire game is also just a story of Ethan's, then we don't exist. We had no agency. Our legwork did not matter.I think there is a lot of frustration with this game not because of a twist or an ambiguous ending, but because the game rips away the agency of the players at the worst possible moment, after all the work to reach the ending. There is no payoff. In fact, it tears down the work they did to reach the ending.This ending might have actually worked well if ""The Vanishing of Ethan Carter"" was a movie or a book, not a video game. In a book, I would just read about Paul Prospero's actions. I would be along for the ride, not deciding what he does. If he was fictional in the end, that would not bother me. It's Paul's problem, not mine. In a film, same thing. However, in an interactive video game, the ending pokes the player directly in the chest and boldly declares ""YOU DO NOT EXIST"" or ""YOUR ACTIONS DID NOT MATTER"".That said, any game that can make me empathize with the protagonist and become him for several hours is not all that bad. I was honestly extremely interested in the supernatural detective bit, taking on a Cthulu-level crisis. It is a shame they wasted what had been, up until the ending, a very engaging and intense gaming experience. Paul Prospero is awesome. It is too bad he never existed. "

												""Vanishing"" is a uniquely beautiful game.  It opens with a wonderful vista of a lakeside town.  As the game progresses it is clear that the art team did an excellent job with well designed houses, perfect atmospheric effects, and a sense of light despair (the whole game runs at just before sunset it seems).The voice acting is where things first get choppy.  The lead, Prospero is good, but the other actors don't do as well.  One can hardly blame them, they've been given dialogue that isn't exactly inspiring.  There seems to be an enormous amount of yelling ""Ethan!"" and not much telling of a story.  The characters are also more than a little thin.This of course is due to the game's conceit.  It is diffcult to write much of a review about the conceit without spoiling the story.  However, let it be said that the game itself produces little in the way of real clues since the ending is a lie.  And that is what convinced me to negatively review this game.  The ending isn't so much a twist but a knife to the heart of anything in the mystery genre.  It effectively renders the clues meaningless and makes the effort of the protagonist pointless.Find a different game.  Like that spider game for iOS which tells a better murder mystery with no words.THE FOLLOWING IS A RESPONSE TO ADRAIN PALMA'S COMMENT.  I POST IT HERE DUE TO THE 1000 CHARACTER COMMENT LIMITI'll be blunt in my response.  As the review mentions the artwork itself was well done.  There were good things in the game.  The writing, however, was not one of them.  And in a narrative game that is important.Your writers argue in the essay that you linked that there is a twist and ambiguity.  A twist suprises the audience and reveals a deeper story when well executed.  You make mention of Sixth Sense which does exactly that.  Again, I don't want to reveal here, because it isn't the place for it and some may like the game, but I don't feel your twist accomplishes that goal.In Ethan Carter the twist _removes_ the characters.  The mother in particular makes no sense after the reveal of the twist.  Her motives in the original plot line are clear in the twist plot line she is at best vague.  Likewise Ethan's brother goes from passable and reluctant villian to vile in the twist.  The grandfather and the father are the only two that preserve any character and that because they are both effectively passive and weak.The biggest confusion though is the sleeper.  The entire pre-twist storyline makes him the antagonist and the motive for all of the chacters actions.  He _makes_ them evil.  The post-twist storyline though completely inverts this without any explanation.  For that reason I find your reasons (1) and (2) lacking in any emotional depth and narratively confusing.(3) is the biggest departure.  If true three makes the twist even more cheap and is equivalent to the, ""and then the holodeck malfunctioned, and he was back to reality"".  At that point we have no justification for having any feeling for any of the characters at all because they are so thoroughly meta'd as to be meaningless.And that's the problem.  You set your audience up to listen to a certain type of story and then effectively lied to them in order to pull of your ""smart"" trick.  That's cheating and your audience will react appropriately because you've asked them to invest in a story that you have declared non-existant.  It is the saddest of post-modernist constructions.Consider, off the top of my head, that the twist was that Ethan was the bad guy.  The visions are mind control tricks, and the stories are talismans that he uses against Prospero.  The visions are all cluttered reworkings of reality that he must bind with truth phsically such that there are always clues nearby of the real story.  That would have been a twist that would have been faithful to the characters and the setting.  Instead you _undid them and your setting_.  Probably most disappointing is that it works with the endlessly over done bookish younger brother is picked on by world only to be the breath of life in the whole universe.  One misses Poe's and his friend Howard's far more masculine protagonists.  I actually found myself dislking Ethan by midway through the game.  That dislike was only strengthened by the end in which  he fails to run over six feet of flame to save his life and effectively curls up in a ball and dies to satisfy the story.  Our protagonist has all the spark of life of a damp rag.  He is not like, again to mention him, Howard who went from a rather limp man to a competive boxer who challenged his parents and made an independent living for himself.  Instead Ethan folds and dies.So I appreviate the beauty.  I wanted to _live_ in that valley after I was done.  The story though was not equal to the artists work and undermined the entire game.			"

												This game is a playable mystery movie. It is not about action, it is about watching the plot unfold as you solve puzzles. Your character has very limited abilities in the ""movie"" - you can walk/run, view things, interact with things, and crouch. Everything is in first-person view. There is no real ""action"" - you won't be shooting at things, or ducking, or anything like that. You will be moving from puzzle to puzzle in order to advance the plot.Graphics are very pretty (Unreal engine), and when everything is turned up to max it can cause even a beefy system to jitter every now and then. Sound consists or eerie music and environmental sounds, all of which are good.I find it hard to say if the game is good or bad... The very first words you see upon running the game tell you flat out that the game does not hold your hand. Simple puzzles are just that, but more advanced puzzles are not self-evident. If you like puzzle games, you will probably like this game. If you like playable movie games, you may like this game.I like puzzle games (e.g., Portal, Portal 2, Limbo, etc.). I don't have much experience with playable movies, although the PlayStation Drake's series feel that way. This game just hasn't drawn me in. One annoying feature of the game is savegames. The game only does saves at certain checkpoints, and those checkpoints, from what I can tell, are at the beginning of each puzzle. Some puzzles take a while to complete, so if you do 80% and then need to close the game, when you load the game up you lose all your progress. I really hate that.As a result of all this, I won't give the game a global recommendation. If you like puzzle games and playable movie games, you may like this game. I would keep a walkthrough handy if I were you...Rating: 3/5			"

												This game is pretty medicore and semi buggy. It start off without any instruction. You wander a fairly open map of a mountain side, a dam and a homestead. What you eventually figure out is you are punished for wandering the entire map. The way to move forward is to stay in a single small area exploring everywhere and collecting clues and not leaving that area until its solved. I spent a good half hour wandering around one area, wondering what I was missing, until finally consulting a guide. As it turn it was a poor programming( a bug?) that kept me from completing it. On the second mysstery, near the train crank, I had stuttered my click instead of holding click. The game decided i had viewed the vision and never let me see it again. Time to load my game. This was the first time for this type of event (the swirling word match) and it doesn't explain how its suppose to work. So if you misclick, your game is over and you don't know it. The challenge should be in the puzzles or story, not in battling buggy game mechanics.			"

 Slight contains spoilers 6/10This is a hard game to review. It certainly had some good elements, but it did also have its lows.Highs:  Great visuals  Nice scenery  Good voice-acting  Okay-ish story 7/10Lows  Very minimal gameplay  minimal soundtracks  Bad puzzles overall  Expensive  Puzzles First off, the puzzles were just plain bad, the first 2 were 'difficult', but the rest was just plain simple. There also is a random zombie dude where you need to run through a maze to collect♥♥♥♥♥♥ It just didn't feel like it was part of the game, but the devs added it to make it more interesting or something like that. Soundtracks The soundtracks were not that great. Felt scary most of the time, but nothing scary happens 90 % of the game. But it made you feel like there could be jump scares every 5 minutes or so which made the game weird. Like the soundtracks where just picked at random.  Gameplay The gameplay was minimal. I know the game is supposed to be that way, but if that is the case the devs need to keep it interesting by added more narrator things. Which didn't occur often. Story The story was okay-ish. It keeps intriguing you, because it keeps evolving every scene you solve. The main thing I didn’t like was that there is absolutely no background on the Paul, which I kind of understand. But it would add more dynamic to the story if they did add it. Expansing DLC I would love to play this through on the VR(currently without one, but hey it would be nice.). But then you need to pay an extra 9 euro's.. Overall worth playing, but gets boring quick.			"

												A beautiful, poignant, yet somber game wrapped up in a short but bitterly sweet story. The first thing that will jump out at you for this game is the visuals. Thanks to photogrammtery (photographing real world objects and then using tools to translate them into 3d objects) the game has some of the most beautiful and detailed textures in any game to date.The game at heart is about exploration, puzzle solving, and a short but memorable storyline. You are free to explore the world however you wish from the start. The goal of finding stories or solving murders as you come across them. How and in what order you do this is entirely up to you as you roam around the landscape. There is absolutely no hand holding in this game and that makes it all the better as you figure it out on your own accord.The few minor drawbacks for me were:1. Invisible walls and lack of a jump button. The world, although ""open"" is a bit limited in scope and with the lack of a jump button you feel glued to the landscape and can't jump over short objects which you might be used to doing in many exploration games. 2. Voice acting was a mixed bag. Some characters sounded great and fit their part, others seemed out of place and a bit hammy with the line delivery/emotions. However neither of those took away from what to me was a very enjoyable game.  The storyline was short but sweet, the graphics are some of the best in a game to date, and the overall game, although short, was well worth the price tag. If you like adventure games with puzzles and story focused games that don't hold your hand then this game is for you.			"

												Beautifully rendered and composited imagery and stories.  The developers weren't joking when they said there's no fluff in this game.  Very lovecraftian and one puzzle was scary enough that I said ♥♥♥♥ it and started guessing at the answer without gathering all the puzzle elements.  Completely worth $20.  Bravo, guys.			"

												Just a heads up....I played for 1 hour and 10 minutes, solved the whole first murder on the tracks, ran the sequence perfectly and went on to the next area. I assumed some form of auto save would have kicked in since there is no option to save in the menu. . How ever it did not, no save at all, no way to save that I know of yet. I must start all over from the beginning again. Is saving part of the mystery? Other wise looks wonderfully emmersive, I just dont want to start over each time? Hello?			"

												This is probably what people will call a ""walking simulator"", not that that's a bad thing. While there are puzzles and a plot to piece together, a lot of the experience is in the atmosphere - and what an atmosphere it is!Good:+ The game looks and sounds absolutely beautiful, even on my 5-year-old PC. Fantastic effort from a small team.+ Puzzles that require some thought - a good challenge without being frustrating.+ An absolutely huge and detailed map with no loading screens (except the very start). Very open.Bad:- Some (few!) game-stopping bugs - for me, one progress-critical valve was unusable until I reloaded the game.- I can see people struggling with the size of the map - if you explore everything (like I did), you won't have to backtrack. But if you have to backtrack, it might take a while to get from point A to B.- The game uses only checkpoint-saves, and only seems to have one slot.Other:~ The game is short. I finished in about 5 hours' time, and I can see people sprinting through faster. Not a bad thing, necessarily, but if you really care about the length-for-money thing, keep that in mind.~ Very slow-paced. It's not about a run-and-gun private eye, but a guy trying to piece together a string of crimes. No explosions, gunfights, or interrogations. Again, not bad, but if you're looking for that, this isn't it.~ The plot takes some thinking to piece together - each crime is a part of the whole story, and you probably won't run into them in order. Then the ending complicates things further.tl;dr: Slow, atmospheric, interesting and confusing story. I enjoyed it, but others might not.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a revelation. It has the beauty and depth of Dear Esther, but with intriguing and dynamic gameplay mechanics. The world is absolutely gorgeous and exploring it is both grand and somber. TVOEC manages to accomplish something quite amazing in that it is a narrative focused game, with no combat whatsoever and yet it feels like a good ""game"". It sits near Ico and Shadow of the Colossus as something that gamers can proudly display to the world as evidence that our passion does indeed have artistic integrity yet it's also a complete joy to play as a videogame. If all you care about are kill counts, combos or scores you might not be up for it, but if you always wanted to be the center of an epic mystery or just want to experience something that truly feels fresh in the gaming world, Ethan Carter is a bright and shining game that will suck you in and stay with you even when you're gone.

												This game is stunning. As of this review Im roughly and hour and a half into it and ive just solved the first murder. It certainly doesnt take this long, its just the world is so immersive and beautiful I couldnt help myself to look around, yes, this game is open world. The only invisible walls ive came across are at the lake, and you cant jump so you cant scale large rocks etc. My first impressions are very basic, this game is creepy as ♥♥♥♥. Its not a horror game, nothing is going to pop out at you and theres not going to be a tall faceless man with a suit on following you in the woods, but it just genuinley feels like a horror game, thats not bad atall IMO but i know some people that will be put off with the fact its a creepy game. What makes it creepy you ask? The chilling soundtrack, the whistling wind, creeking trees and cawing crows are just the start of the insane atmosphere this game creates. If Shadow of Mordor and Far Cry 4 flop, this will get GOTY for sure. Ive never been so immeresed and caring about a game in the first 2 hours, lets just hope it keeps delvivering throught and has a long story.Summary; Good Game, Most beautiful vanilla game ive played, Great Detective type mechanics, Creepy but not Horror, Open world that is filled with detail, Great Story, GOTY contender for sure.

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, I have been egarly awaiting this particular game for a while. I will say the game is around 4 to 5 hours based off of what others and freinds have said.I will say this, this game once beaten will have virtually no replay value so make sure you are going into it with that in mind. This is a game to not be rushed and taken slowly. The voice acting, visuals and gameplay are all excellent. Also....i got a jumpscare from some traps in the woods -_-DEVS: This is addressed to you, I would love it if you guys could release the packs to allow for mods. Imagine the types of mysteries people could create with a game like this. There is great custom stories for amnesia out there, would be nice to have a murder/mystery version of the same. VoEC has a great base and content that could be build upon. At the very least I would like some more stories in the future seeing as how the replay value flies out the window after the game is finished :(Here Part 1 of my playthrough if you would like to see the first few minutes. No need to like or sub just for those that want a quick peak at the game without watching a full lets play.

There also is a random zombie dude where you need to run through a maze to collect♥♥♥♥♥♥ It just didn't feel like it was part of the game, but the devs added it to make it more interesting or something like that. Soundtracks The soundtracks were not that great. Felt scary most of the time, but nothing scary happens 90 % of the game. But it made you feel like there could be jump scares every 5 minutes or so which made the game weird. Like the soundtracks where just picked at random.  Gameplay The gameplay was minimal. I know the game is supposed to be that way, but if that is the case the devs need to keep it interesting by added more narrator things. Which didn't occur often. Story The story was okay-ish. It keeps intriguing you, because it keeps evolving every scene you solve. The main thing I didn’t like was that there is absolutely no background on the Paul, which I kind of understand. But it would add more dynamic to the story if they did add it. Expansing DLC I would love to play this through on the VR(currently without one, but hey it would be nice.). But then you need to pay an extra 9 euro's.. Overall worth playing, but gets boring quick.			"

												I didn't finish the ""game"" but I've seen enough to strongly disagree with the gamedesign of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. Here, I'm going to try and understand what happened in the mind of whoever did that. How did we end up with this ""game""?Basically, this product is absolutly blinded by its own concept.The author had an idea, a great idea. He had a story to tell, a world to show, he had a vision. Yet this vision wasn't (yet) playable, he figured he had to make a game to actually share it with gamers. So he went on and did it : he built a 3d world, he grabed some music, animated the thing, and voilà, he had... something. Not a game, but something really nice looking/feeling that he could pour a game into.Then he wrote the story, whatever happened inside that world, whatever he had to tell. But the story was subtle, fragile, it was precious to him. So he only told the very bare minimum of it, by strange fear it would collapse, maybe, then cut what was left from 80% of its content, and then some. When he was left with only a handfull of texts, a couple of bookpages, some remaining dialogs which survived the sacrifices, he managed to get some of it into the world.The product was shaping somewhat like the idea in its dreams but now it was real, not a dream anymore. Which was a problem because it wasn't like its dream. So he kept doing a lot of wrong moves and classic game design errors until he somehow figured that it was ""ready to ship"" (I know that because the game's binary is called ""AstronautsGame-Win64-Shipping.exe"", not because I played the damn thing). He either figured this out because nobody could work on ""that"" anymore or either because he ran out of things that he shouldn't have done in the first place.Somehow he remembered he had to do the basics : start, options, exit. He forgot to get rid of some leftover ""gaming elements"" so he put in some keybindings to do other things than just moving around. Someone must have told him very loudly that his game was TOO SLOW, so he placed a Run button just for the sake of it, not that he seemed to care.Whatever he had in mind stayed where it was. What he shipped to the world was a crude piece of nothingness. It really feels like there was something in the game, and then everything was removed before someone could enjoy it. That would have been far too... popular, vulgar. That would have been gross, ew! Someone enjoy himself! Thinking, reacting, choosing, playing! Yuk!Let's dwelve into the tenderness of doing nothing at all, instead. Let's hear noises, read few words, and virtually walk for miles. Let's not instruct anything to anyone, let's not prevent any player from missing the only point we had to make, and then let's call it elegance or any similar ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to top it all.What a sweet time wasted for everyone involved.

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a cyclical adventure game in the first person perspective featuring you, a detective tasked with unraveling the mystery behind the disappearance of a young boy who has witnessed bizarre and paranormal happenings in a small isolated town. The visuals are pretty and the ambient sounds, music, and narrator’s voice are quite cozy and form a nice kind of aesthetic to drive the player forward from area to area. As I mentioned earlier, the game is cyclical, however this is in an almost purgatorial sense in that you will be doomed to walk one gigantic circle until you solve every single puzzle in the game. How are the puzzles solved, you ask? Normally, when you come across a puzzle, you will be able to hold left mouse to reveal a shimmering and incomplete dreamlike overlay. By finding the right items and pairing them with their respective alcoves you can trigger specific events to expand that overlay until it covers your entire screen, completing the puzzle and unlocking the second phase of that particular puzzle. In the second phase, you simply need to discover and order a paranormal re-enactment of the events that came to pass (the game will allow you to proceed once you get it right).I’m going to be blunt here, this is basically a walking simulator tied to a very simplistic adventure game. Depending on how you enjoy this kind of thing you will either find it really relaxing or incredibly boring. The game has one section (underground mines) where the devs thought it would be fitting to shoehorn in some awkward and easily avoidable jump-scare mechanic which was kind of lame.Given the general lack of playtime I can hardly recommend this game at the prices it’s often seen at; considering I finished the whole thing half-drunk in about six hours total. Best to wait until it’s near-free and maybe with a VR headset to squeeze the water out of this stone.			"

												This is not really a game, but a piece of art which promised too much. The graphics are nice, the music suits the scene, but that's about it.I won't complain about the length of the game (went through it without walktroughs in less than 4 hrs), since I also can enjoy short games if they tell a nice story and the gameplay is fitting. The problem is this game lacks gameplay. The world is quite small and the gameplay is somehow linear (you are forced to solve a couple of puzzels in order). Moreover, the problem is that puzzels become EASIER as the game progesses. Whereas the first puzzel (train) and the house puzzle still take some skill, the others are just boring and too easy to understand. It is no challenge to put the chronology in order, etc. It does not require real thinking. The commented walkthrough promised that you have to combine information (e.g. ""You notice there is blood on the train, but not on the floor? This means the accident occured elsewhere ...."") You dont need such thinking to solve the game.Don't get me wrong. I don't think its a bad piece of software, but it just does not live up to its promises.			"

												Overall 7/10Pros+Interesting, Lovecraft-esque story.+beautiful scenery+clue finding system is great+the super♥♥♥♥♥♥your-pants spooky puzzleCons-There's an insane amount of walking back and forth you'll be doing if you miss anything,which becomes extremely tedious. this can really take from the experience.(eg. I got to the VERY last sequence to discover i had missed a single clue, had to back-track literally to the other side of the map to complete one thing, then walk all the way back to the other end to complete the game.)The whole free-roam/open-world clue hunting is both good and bad, if you miss anything important, which everything is, you'll be running back and forth wanderng what the ♥♥♥♥ you're supposed to be looking for, so it's best to solve everything as you find it to avoid having to go through the hell-tier walk I had to endure.Other than the painful walks the game is a solid 7/10 "

That said, it is still somewhat better than Dear Esther, however, I wouldn't recommend this game unless it drops to a few euros/dollars/pounds etc because of the overall length and snorefest-gameplay.I therefore do not recommend this game unless it's discounted on a steam sale.

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is the emotional and macabre story of a detective with paranormal powers trying to find a lost boy who led a troubled life. The overall visual atmosphere of the game is outstanding and the story itself keeps you hooked the entire game, dying to know what eldritch terror lurks around the next corner of Ethan's disappearance. The controls are very simple and the game is mostly straightforward without holding you by the hand and walking you along. Other than the interactable objects which make themselves known to you when you come close enough to them, the game gives you no direction at all as to what to do. It is up to you to follow the story and look out for the clues in dialogue/writing/etc. This really allows you to immerse yourself into the story and really separates this game from the typical ""box ticker"" storyline game we are so used to seeing these days. I personally found the ending to be kind of a let-down (not necessarily in the emotional sense but moreso in the writing aspect) but I would not say that it detracts from the overall experience of the game. I'm sure that most people were fine with it but I just expected much more... given the impressiveness of the rest of the game. That being said, I would give the game a solid 4/5 stars where the only thing keeping it from 5 would be my aforementioned issue with the ending and how short the game actually is. Other than those two issues, this game was absolutely worth my money and time.			"

												The full (German) review can be found here: http://www.jack-reviews.com/2014/09/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-review.htmlThe Vanishing of Ethan Carter is an absolutely gorgeous game with an interesting storyline that I'd rather not talk about as you have to experience it for yourself. The gameplay consists of you walking through a vast area and solving puzzles along the way, some of which might seem optional, but are entirely mandatory. Believe me, I had to backtrack from the ending all the way to the beginning because I missed something. So keep a look out for traps and a panel with four touchscreens!There's even an area that's somewhat scary with a puzzle that seemed hard at first. But it's not as long as you open your eyes. The same applies to all puzzles.All in all, I'd certainly recommend the game, but it would have benefitted from a smaller world. Yes, it's beautiful and feels real, but it's mostly devoid of life. You rarely see another living being outside of story scenes and spent most of your time holding the sprint-button down. I'm sure some players will be bored by it.			"

Thankfully, the game looks stunning. The environments are so well made it just begs for oculus suppot. I've put a few hours into it but honestly I haven't really done much to progress the story; I'm just exploring every nook and cranny. The narrative is also well put together, and the mystery game system works surprisingly well. I have no idea how long the game is but I have no intention of rushing through it; I will definitely want to spend as much time as possible in this world.			"

												A visually stunning game environment is irreparably mired by bugs, a total lack of any sense of direction, and an utterly depressing story concept. What begins with a great deal of promise, quickly spirals into confusion and then pointlessness, in what has to be the most epicly underwhelming borefest of 2014. The puzzles and environment have you mostly fumbling around in the dark until you give up and resort to a guide or figure it out by chance. There is nothing particularly intelligent or challenging about them, it's more just a case of ramming the peg into every hole until you find the one that fits. You walk away from each task feeling more like it was a completely unnecessary obstruction to the storyline than a sense of accomplisment. Despite the extremely linear gameplay, I missed a few of the ""stories"" by accident along the way, and as a result the game refused to let me finish. Instead insisting that I go back to them and grind my way through even more hours of figuring out what the hell I'm supposed to do next to find some actual content. I view this more as a failure of the game to captivate me and direct my attention toward exploring.Once it finally dawned on me that I'd completed the game and that the only way it was going to get any more ""complete"" would be by going back over the same areas, I found myself asking ""That was it? Really?"". I'd gotten a lot more joy out of walking around and admiring the landscape, and ultimately it felt a lot like the environment was compensating for the game. This was a prime example of form over function, a playable movie, into which the developer shoehorned hindering game-like elements that reeked of afterthought. Save yourself some money and go watch a full HD playthrough on youtube.			"

But the story didn't blow me away, and the puzzles are dull when they're not downright aggravating.

If you've ever had anything to do with H.P. Lovecraft you will be amazed.

I'm pretty happy with how it all concluded, and i would say that although it has about 3-5 hours of gameplay I dont feel cheated at the $19.99 price tag.If you're not really into noir-ish games that dont have any gameplay beyond detective type puzzles then this probably isnt for you.However, if you like great plot, breathtaking visuals, and a surprisingly pleasent music score this is definitely something you want to get.

												One of the most challenging games I've played in a while, there is absolutely no guides or anything in the game, you just basically have to look around and use your own brains to solve mysteries and figure out what it is that the game wants you to do.  At first it was really difficult to understand, but as time progresses, you get a better understanding of what the game is about and you look for the right things and all that.  A little disappointed that there are no achievements for this game, but nevertheless, I am in shock with how gorgeous the game is for jusing using the Unreal Engine.  The environment is surreal and everything moves, leaves, branches, the wind seems alive in this game.  Also the water looks amazing as well.Definitely worth the $209.5/10			"

												First the good:-I really like the the investigation mechanic in this game; it's something I've never encountered in a game before and it seems to work real nicely. My usual gripe with 3d adventure games have been that they often turn into frustrating hunt-the-missing-pixel games where you just grope around randomly looking for the clue that's cleverly hidden among ten patches of almost identical textures.-The game has a really nice atmosphere. I recommend not rushing through it but instead just taking your time savouring the scenery.Then the bad:-There seems to be a case of memory leakage or something hiding in the code. After about an hour of gametime the game starts getting random cases of choppiness, which can be a bit jarring at times.-There was one part of the game where I just ended up running around aimlessly for about an hour because I didn't realise that a thing I had done at one point had for little apparent reason made a part of the map accessible that wasn't accessible before. This ended up breaking me out of the immersion quite a bit, and would have been easily enough avoided if there had been some clearer indication that doing (spoiler) causes (spoiler) to happen, thus making (spoiler) accessible.And the ugly:-Looking at my total time played, it took me about 4 hours to play this game from start to finish. This included both me just happily and slowly strolling around, and that one part where I was frustratedly running around looking for something I'd missed. 4 hours is not a lot of game for something that cost me 20 euros.Summary: It's a really nice little game and probably one of the better 3d adventure games I've played. You should consider, however, if paying the game's full price for about 4-5 hours of gameplay is worth it.			"

												Literally paused the game to write this review as it's fresh in mind. First off, the Graphics and Ambience the game takes you into is jaw dropping. Seriously, lock your door, put headphones on and ask not to be disturbed. The game will suck you right in. The sounds will make you creep and turn around in a spaz. The photomaping tech pays off SO MUCH, it is breathtaking that this is Unreal Engine 3 and NOT 4! That's insane that UE3 has this much potentinal still left.To the gameplay. The game warns you when you launch, it won't hold your hand. This is correct. The story is well read the description. What the game does great in is making you figure everything out and the detective work/gameplay mechanic is amazing well done. Now with that said, I must say. At least ONE mission/quest would of been nice to hold your hand. To teach you how the game goes and controls (which are simple, but still). I say this as I write this and read other reviews of the same problem. That problem is the game is great at being a sandbox open world in a way. But if you miss one little thing for a clue, and go across the map you'll never advance the story or miss the plot due you forgot that one clue earlier. Hint: Just follow what looks right. The game has ""paths"" in a way, use common sense! Seriously DO NOT RUN! Take in everything! An area / clue wont be complete untill well, you'll know. Don't just find something and run across the map, the clues are around the area you found first one. Also the thing you need to solve is there too. (AKA, Don't run from Bridge to Dam at the start!)Beyond that, $20 for a story nartative game that is deeply breathtaking looking and plays great, why not. It's a movie in a game. Or a book in a visual masterpiece. Either way, its $20 and not $60. Price of a movie ticket + drinks. Grab one and play this game! TL:DR Do not run, Use common sense in pathing!			"

												Visually stunning and well scored game. The game certainly doesn't hold your hand. Expect some long walks, and searching for clues that dont exist, areas with no relevance aside from eye-candy in the game. The story leaves much to the imagination, and expects you to fill in the blanks and draw your own conclusions. Overall, I would recommend this game, but not to the gamer that enjoys fast paced game play and spoon fed story lines. Ratings:Graphics 8/10 - I did notice some areas with graphical anamoliesSound FX 9/10 - While wearing a mid range line of headphones Turtle Beach x-12 The FX were immersive, crisp, clean, and true to life.Score - Soundtrack 10/10 The soundtrack fit well with the game, and was timed perfectly to carry the feelings the game was trying to evoke. TLDR: Get the game if you like psychological thriller type games with great graphics and sound. Don't get the game if you are looking for fast paced action, and clear direction with a forced story line.			"

It's a visual experience that pretends to be a game!I'd have no problem with it, if it was not called a game (not to mention ""best game of the year"").There are good things about this ""game"", but the gameplay is not one of them. And to me, that seems like a REALLY BIG problem.While I like the gameplay's concept, the implementation is so rediculously easy and short, that it makes it completely pointless. That is, 90% of the time spent in the game is just walking around in almost/completely empty (but oh, so beautiful) places. (Empty gameplay-wise, not visually.)I'm not the biggest fan of the story, but there were interesting ideas. But also, there were some random (read unnecessary/useless) elements, that add nothing to the game and are there just so that you could see other beautiful visuals.I just read 20 reviews of this game and none of them mentioned the fact, that it's mostly a visual experience. No, seriously! It's a visual experience that pretends to be a game!			"

												I'm certain that there are quite a few people who will call The Vanishing of Ethan Carter a boring and pointless walking simulator. Well, they are partially correct.The Vanishing is not exactly what I would call a game. It's more like... an experience. If I had to name a similar “game”, it would be Dear Esther.Don't expect to run around and kill things here. What you will do is walk around and investigate the disappearance of a boy called Ethan Carter. You will solve some puzzles, find some ""hidden"" objects etc. Now... I'm not sure, but it may be possible to “finish” the game without solving anything, so far I have looked into every corner of the Valley I laid my eyes upon, found a few “secrets”, solved every puzzle and I'm not done yet, though I guess I'm not far now from the end.The game has absolutely phenomenal atmosphere. There is a sense of calmness but also you have a feeling that something is not right, and it might not be a good idea to stick around. That atmosphere is built by impossibly pretty visuals. Graphics are... let's just say: I made quite a few wallpapers for myself during very first minutes of the game.Apart from visuals the sound is also 1st class. Ambient sounds of the forest are very realistic, other places have their own specific ambiance. Also music fits the game perfectly: it is there, you are aware of it, but it's not too intrusive. Also it changes depending on your location.And there is the voice acting. The main character is perfectly calm, a bit bored detective who just wants to finish the job and go home. Other characters are voiced maybe not as well, but still I can't complain.Overall visuals and sounds are great.As for not so grand things:Save system is not good. Auto saves are rare and far between, there is no manual save, if you exit the game you loose everything since last save, and sometimes it's not easy to know if you will loose 2 minutes or half an hour. That being said, Game now downloads a patch that is going to improve that, so this point may not be very valid.And... well, that's it really.The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is not a long game that should be treated as an experience rather than an adventure. Fans of Dear Esther will love it. Fans of Call of Duty... won't. I'm the former.			"

												Amazing graphics and a really weird game. If you are not a fan of open exploration and puzzles this one might not be for you. So long story short you are a detective with experience in the occult. A small boy named Ethan Carter writes to you asking for help. You travel to his home town to unravel the mysteries that surround his town and how he disappeared. The puzzles are great and the game can be played at your leisure. Great game and I would highly recommend. "

Unique narrative style and cool gameplay mechanics.Cons-  Way too short (4 hours). No manual save, poor autosave.  Needs much more story elements.All and all I don't think anyone will regret getting this game (hell, screenshots alone of the world alone make great wallpaper!) but will be disappointed only in that by the time you really get into this game it's over.

												When I started this game, I enjoyed every second of it.  It has a dark, creepy vibe, makes you worry what you will find around the next corner without relying on jump scares.  The murders are brutal, and captivating, the story pulls you in, the puzzles reward you with a piece of the backstory each time.The problem is the last five minutes of the game.  M. Night Shyamalan would be proud.  It was so pointlessly trite that it ruined the whole game for me.  My advice?  Turn it off when you ""wake the sleeper"", before it gets stupid.  The last few minutes made an outstanding game feel like I have been trolled for about five hours.Considering the subject, the story still would have held together without that nonsense.			"

												I'm going to start by saying this is hands down the most beautiful game I have ever played.  The graphics are incredibly detailed, and it's smooth.  Very little lag throughout the game. However, the game is weird.  I mean, I couldn't figure it out unless i had a walkthrough to guide me weird.  You go through the game with the purpose of solving puzzles to reveal a story - great concept, but poor execution.  I missed the first three puzzles, couldn't solve one of them, found two more, and then finally figured out what the point of the puzzles was. Yes, I know it says it's not going to ""hold your hand"" and walk you through it.  *SPOILER ALERT*In the very beginning you're supposed to find the puzzle in the woods right outside the tunnel.  But there's no path, nothing.  I even looked around those woods without finding anything the first time, until I came back with a walkthrough in hand.  Then I found all of the pieces.  Parts of the story made no sense, like the entire first puzzle could have been left out and then the space thing?  What the crap was the point of that?  Maybe I'm missing the ""artistic themes"" or some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like that, but overall the story was not entertaining.  Cheap scares, storyline that makes no sense, all complemented with lovely graphics.  Almost like watching a Miss America peagant.  I'm pretty sad I wasted money on a one-time-playable game.			"

												The game has many elements that are very attractive but is relatively short and the story is not very deep. The graphics are very attractive and allows exploration of an intricate abandoned mountainous mining community. The mechanics for reconstructing a crime, murders in this case, are interesting. I found that the process for searching for clues could be in some cases seem very arbitrary, sometimes I had to go back and forth over the same area many times, even with the aid of a guide to find a clue. As mentioned in other reviews, the story is Lovecraftian. My experience with well-developed stories in this genre is that as understanding grows, the world becomes increasing bizaare, disturbing, and horrible. In order to work, though, you need to  have characters you care about. The shortness of the game and the particular view of the world you get (the last moments of ghosts) limit the depth of character development.At $19.99 I won't recommend the game; too short and not enough story depth. But for $10.00 I'd recommend it. The developers are skillful and they have interesting game mechanics that could serve well in the mystery/detective genre.			"

How did they mess up? well I beat the game in three hours, (I also was taking my time, and not rushing). So these amazing graphics and intresting story cost 7$ an hour. Even worse the game has no replay value. in the last twenty minutes of the game I was thinking, is it over, if so I hope this story has one of the best endings in gaming history, or else I am goign to complain about it on steam. well I am here now typing angrily. I was still planning to give the game an recomindation till the final cutscene. the ending is lazy. I am now going to spoil it so if you do nto want it spoiled, please avert your eyes from this review. You have been warned. imagine you have been waiting for a couple hours intently waiting to see the evil monster behind all the chaos, you walk into the room where the monster should be and you find out you are a story written by ethan carter and ethan crater dies suddenly in a freak accdent. roll credits.

												This is not really a game. It's a truly lovely made concept art of a game, probably a small demo project - I don't know. Yeah, the music is well made, the visuals beautifull, the story has some feel and grip and twist ... but everything is like only half of it. The story is short so is the audio and I guess a good graphic engine has done half of the great job for visuals here. To be fair there must have been a talented artist or two on the teaml. Still...Just keep the Shift key down and stay on the road here. Keep repeating that to yourself while playing, because it's so easy to get fooled again and again into exploring. Like there must be something in that corner... No, there isn't. And if you do miss something, you will be reminded about that before the ending and teleported straight to the point. So don't bother.Ghost stories - the further in the game, the easier their construction. The second one right after the bridge may well be the best one in offer. Or the Cemetery one. The rest - easy and pointless.Also no horrors here. 5 min in mine probably.Puzzles - they are quite well done. All two of them.For 5 $ probably. If you like this type of games.			"

												This is a review on the Redux version (finished in about 5hrs due to loving the scenery): (mild spoilers alert,.. nothing too big though:P )WOW,.. one of the best discovery driven games ever,.. and so beautiful (i don't think i ever took so many screen shotsin a game before,.. maybe Dayz is the only other) as a lover of adventure / puzzle solving games (amongst many other types) and lovcraftian lore (amongst Many other things ;P) this really hit home. I'm not much for find-a-note games, but when a ""walking simulator"" is this gorgeous it's hard not to wanna play it.the puzzles are not hard, but inteligent in design,.. and SO rewarding with the immersive AMAZINGLY detailed cut scenes from the mind of Ethan Carter.the game feels a kin to the stories of ""the burning man/Summers' Isle"" ""shadow over innsmoth"" ""dagon"" as in you are a detective reconstructing the scenes of the ""town"" when you arrive,.. no one seen but always feel like you are being followed or watched by the townspeople.until the end,.. then it takes a turn i didn't see coming,.. but should have. ;DPositives+atmopshere+all sounds and ambience+pacing (both in plot and in character speed)+level design+puzzle design (clever, although for a veteran adv/puz gamer they were quite easy.. but it is more of a visual novel)+the graphics/design (it is like playing artwork,.. sure upclose the textures on the trees are 2.5d on 3d structures but hell what game in Unreal4 isn't like that? calling this game bad or saying anything negative about it in anyway would be like calling the Mona Lisa an artschool project..)Negatives... nothing at allI only wish it was longerI bought this on sale,.. because that's how i found out about it,.. but it is COMPLETELY worth full price!!!if you like well thought out, clever, Lovecraftian tales and adv/puz/mystery solving games.. this is for you.PS: totally craied at the end			"

												Overall the game had a lot of potential. The art quality was high and the landscape was beautiful, but the storys/chapters were very disjointed which you'll see why at the end of the game but while you're playing you can't quite tell what's going on. Speaking of end of the game. Horrible. I'm trying to think of how to explain myself without giving out spoilers, so I'll just say that it was a big screw you to the players. Anybody that's watched a lot of 90's sitcoms or checked out any comic book character race will know exactly what I mean if/when they finish itI had high hopes for this game, but after finishing it, I'm just disappointed and you should never feel that way with a game. In the end it feels incomplete and disconnected			"

												This is a review on the Redux version (finished in about 5hrs due to loving the scenery): (mild spoilers alert,.. nothing too big though:P )WOW,.. one of the best discovery driven games ever,.. and so beautiful (i don't think i ever took so many screen shotsin a game before,.. maybe Dayz is the only other) as a lover of adventure / puzzle solving games (amongst many other types) and lovcraftian lore (amongst Many other things ;P) this really hit home. I'm not much for find-a-note games, but when a ""walking simulator"" is this gorgeous it's hard not to wanna play it.the puzzles are not hard, but inteligent in design,.. and SO rewarding with the immersive AMAZINGLY detailed cut scenes from the mind of Ethan Carter.the game feels a kin to the stories of ""the burning man/Summers' Isle"" ""shadow over innsmoth"" ""dagon"" as in you are a detective reconstructing the scenes of the ""town"" when you arrive,.. no one seen but always feel like you are being followed or watched by the townspeople.until the end,.. then it takes a turn i didn't see coming,.. but should have. ;DPositives+atmopshere+all sounds and ambience+pacing (both in plot and in character speed)+level design+puzzle design (clever, although for a veteran adv/puz gamer they were quite easy.. but it is more of a visual novel)+the graphics/design (it is like playing artwork,.. sure upclose the textures on the trees are 2.5d on 3d structures but hell what game in Unreal4 isn't like that? calling this game bad or saying anything negative about it in anyway would be like calling the Mona Lisa an artschool project..)Negatives... nothing at allI only wish it was longerI bought this on sale,.. because that's how i found out about it,.. but it is COMPLETELY worth full price!!!if you like well thought out, clever, Lovecraftian tales and adv/puz/mystery solving games.. this is for you.PS: totally craied at the end			"

												Went for a walk through the breath-taking scenery. The water looked amazing. The leaves danced on the wind and the grass swayed in the summer sun.Then I found a body and some skulls. It was quite disturbing. So I thought 'screw that' and continued my walk before logging off.Great graphics - boring game!Edit: Devs got in touch with me to discuss the game - which is pretty darn impressive. They do care about and work hard on the game which I think is really refreshing in this day and age.			"

												I strongly dislike that The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is lacking an essential feature that I have been made to expect in the redux version through past announcements on various blogs and websites: VR support.The developer states that this is a misinterpretation of said past statements, which I find hard to believe since the accidentally released baseline-VR-support of the utilized engine remained in the game for three days, ensuring that posts on VR blogs and in the /oculus reddit would generate additional sales and customers buying the redux version because of that feature would have enough time to play beyond the timeframe which would have allowed the utilization of Steam refunds.I therefore do not recommend buying Ethan Carter redux at this point.Please note that this recommendation isn't based on a lack of quality to be found in the game at hand and also if you do in fact give the developer the benefit of the doubt and believe him when he says that it wasn't his intention to mislead anyone you IMHO should interpret my recommendation in the following way:Judging from what I could see in the three days the game was playable with absolutely broken default-UE4-VR support without any optimization I dare to say that it is a bad idea to waste the experience of playing this game for the first time on the non-VR version ... and since the VR version has by now be announced to be a an entirely separate product there is also no point spending any money on this version while a superior remake which makes this version completely obsolete has been announced for next year.

												I played the Redux version of this game, which apparently has nicer graphics, for 94 minutes. However, as of this moment, Steam will not let me review that version, because apparently it shares the same store page as the normal version...and the normal version won't detect the playtime of the Redux version, so I had to manually load the normal version, keep it open for a few minutes, then close it to be able to review the Redux. So with that out of the way, here we go...This is a very pretty game, both visually, and its sounds. If that and rare bits of story popping in on occasion are enough to make you love a game, then this might be for you. However, if you want anything other than visuals, sounds, and some story, this game may very well leave you terribly unfulfilled, and/or bored. I had to push myself to play as long as I did. I needed something to interest me, and I could not find it, even when something the game presented as exciting occurred. In fact, I got bored with the ""exciting"" thing and looked away in the game to check something else out and missed a little bit of the scripted event as a result. If the stuff this game presents as exciting can't even keep me interested, its primary gameplay (wandering around and looking at stuff) which takes up the majority of the gameplay time, has no hope of entertaining me.One might say I hate ""walking simulators,"" but I liked SOMA, and it's almost a walking simulator, but it unfortunately features horror elements. Stuff trying to kill you in that game was my least favorite part of it, and I would have found the game to be better if none of that was in the game, with just the walking around, the dialog, and maybe a handful of puzzles at most. The philosophical aspects and world in that game were cool, and it's incredibly memorable. However, the parts that were unlike a walking simulator were the least enjoyable parts, and I would prefer the game without them, even if that meant no puzzles and a little more dialog, etc.			"

												The game is great; although it could use a little more back story as to who you are and why youre the only person in this town investigating a murder.  A simple voice over arial view intro of Paul driving or riding in a train into this town would have been great for the overall atmosphere.  As it stands, youre just plopped into a forest and off you go.  Investigating doesnt feel like youre piecing any clues together involved with solving a crime and your fundamentally on your own to poke around and discover things randomly.Its great that theres a decent open world / non-linear feel to the game and it needs to be mentioned, that its a visual masterpiece.  Had this game not mentioned its DX9 requirments I wouldnt have guessed this was a top of the line modern game.  The story itself is also wonderfully written and narrated with excellent voice acting throughout.The overall game is very short with only a handfull of elements to peice together to solve the crime. With such a lavish and wonderfully rendered world, the game should have been much, much longer; however for 19.99 its a worthwhile experience, and hoping for more of this type of game in the future. The game will stutter from time to time, even on a new i7 4930k with a 980 GTX; however there are no load screens or transitions, as the world seems to be streaming in as you explore, no doubt this can be refined by the developers.

												While some may find that the $20 USD price tag may be a little steep for the content, I can assure you, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is well worth the money. While playing the game, I often lose myself simply looking out on the horizon of the game world, astounded by how gorgeous it is. While you're not going to be spending months playing this game (Like final fantasy III or skyrim), you'll definitely enjoy every minute that you log into this game. On top of that, the game is extremely well optimized. Machines without a DX 11.2 Videocard can run this, so don't worry. While I encountered a few bugs, only one being game breaking, I cannot recommend The Vanishing of Ethan Carter more than I already have. If you enjoy mystery games with a breathtaking view and an underlying plotline that the game doesn't force you to experience if you chose not to, then this is definitely the game for you.			"

												With about three and a half hours into The Vanishing of Ethan Carter; it was truly an amazing game. The story not only being well written, with heart racing and tense moments in the game truly adding an intense and highly enjoyable atmosphere in the game. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter may be one of my favorite games of 2014; with the beautiful scenery and amazing story telling I will have to definitely recommend this game to anyone with a strong computer and with the desire of adventure and a feeling for above-average challenges within a game. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter does not fail to live up to it's expectations, in fact TVEC surpassed those expectations by quite a lot. I highly recommend this game for those looking for mystery and adventure.			"

												During the whole game, I was thinking I was in a story written by an 8 year old kid, due to the weak story telling, the poor grammar, the ridiculous font choice, the complete non-sense and deja-vu clichés (*), and gosh, I actually was.The authors of this game got about 45 minutes of gameplay, so they thought they'll just spread it like butter over a 10-meter bread by not telling the player how the gameplay mechanisms work, and hide some of the few indispensable hints in a vast but nearly-empty land.Yup, the landscape is beautiful and the gameplay got a couple of good ideas, but it was a bit thin to waste a few hours of my life on it, mostly walking aimlessly.Might be ok for you if you actually never walked in a real mountain nor have any interesting stuff in your life to look for except anti-depressing pills... ;-)(*) yup, it's a pleonasm, for emphasis.Note: I have played & finished the Redux version in ~4 hours (with some walkthrough help), but it's not counted with the non-Redux version.

												Okay, first of all: This game is good! It has an interesting concept of telling the story, a bautiful landscape and I found it really enjoyable to play. I would recommend this game, although it's not very long, BUT the finale of the story is just... bad. It's unsatisfying and plain, the build up with all the mystical stuff was too good for such an ending. I was also able to guess the reveal about 20-30 minutes into the story, if not even sooner, that's a bit sad, but I WOULD HAVE FORGIVEN THAT IF THE ENDING HADN'T BEEN SO UNSATISFYING.Then again, Prospero was also reduced to ashes, so I guess I shouldn't have been surprised by a story about a detective with the same name. But this game would have been cooler with space vikings in power armor, just saying. (Also, while I'm at it: The amount of ravens in this game had me expecting some pale, black-haired, tall guy to appear at least somewhere in there to make an Edgar A. Poe reference and then disappear, which leads me to give this game a 5/40k, very very disappointing.)Conclusion: If lame, bland endings that don't feel like you've accomplished anything in the game whatsoever and predictable twists are your thing, go ahead and buy it!

The most exciting thing I did in the game was prance around in the woods. There was a good scene that was all about space, it looked amazing and was very well done. The puzzels were a joke and sequencing was pretty arbitrary to the point where you just click all the things till it works kinda deal			"

												This was my most anticipated game in quite some time.  I was even following the developers on Twitter, reading their blogs, etc.  Having just finished it, ultimately the game left a bittersweet taste in my mouth.  The graphics are incredible, but even with a 3GB of VRAM and 16 GB of RAM, I was experiencing frame rate hiccups on high settings.  Lowering them to medium and turning V-Sync off helped some, but didn't eliminate the problem.  The atmosphere is great though and it really feels like the countryside.  Very immersive.  There also seems to be some kind of a weird bug in customizing your controls.  I like to use arrow keys instead of WASD to move around, but the left and right arrow keys would only turn the camera, not strafe.  After I tinkered with the .ini file I got it straightened out, but this should have been addressed before release.  Also, there is no ability to save, the game autosaves but it's pretty infrequent.  My computer crashed and I had to replay a solid 20 minutes worth of the game to get back to where I was.  The ability to quicksave or more frequent auto saves would be a nice patch idea.Music is outstanding, the soundtrack alone is almost worth the price of admission (if you pre-ordered).  Of course, this is an adventure/mystery game.  The gameplay mechanics are unique, and there's no tutorial or hand holding (it even warns you of this at the first).  So basically what you do is stumble upon a body, scour the area in search of clues/evidence, once you have found all of the evidence you can ""touch"" the body and it will reveal certain ""freeze frames"" in the sequence of the murder.  You then have to place the events in correct chronological order and once you do so the scene of the murder plays out like a movie.  You do this a few times throughout the game, none of it was overly difficult, and although there is no tutorial or explicit instructions, it's pretty intuitive if you've played video games before.  The story was certainly interesting, I won't put any spoilers in here, but the game takes 4 hours max to complete.  I was very disappointed in the length.  Felt like the game was just starting to blossom into it's full potential when the credits rolled.  All in all a good little mystery game, but the short length robbed it of it's full story-telling potential.   "

												I was really excited to play this game, investigating a paranormal mystery in a beautiful environment, it sounded so promising.My initial reaction was, “wow this looks great.” That was until I started moving then my reaction changed to, “oh god what is wrong with my eyes?” The motion blur on this game is horrific, it quite accurately recreates the way you eyes feel when you are so tired that you can no longer focus properly. This quite quickly gave me a headache but fortunately you can turn off motion blur and then you can actually enjoy the gorgeous scenery.Now getting to the actual game, it is like someone played Dear Ester and thought we should make a game like that but add some more user interaction like some puzzles or something. This in itself is an excellent idea and could have resulted in a great game but this is not it. Where Dear Ester subtly guides you along a fairly linear path and advances the story, this game just give you an expansive environment and makes you go and find tiny objects hidden about the place. You spend ages scouring the forest getting more frustrated, that is if you don't miss the puzzle entirely. This scenario needs a team of scene of crime officers to systematically search the area not a nut job paranormal investigator erratically running about the forest tampering with crime scenes. As you do manage to complete the puzzles it progresses the uninspiring story. Then just when I lost all interest in the story it surprisingly managed to culminate with a nice conclusion.So yes this is beautiful and the ending is quite good but in my opinion rest of the game make it not worth bothering with.

												Okay so if you watched the dev diary video you will see a short explanation of the game mechanics and hear the developer tell you that you do not need to comb the environment for clues because the unique game mechanic will alert you to them or whatever. Well that is true for about 4 clues in the entire game. The rest of the game however is nothing but walking back and forth looking for clues. Every single clue must be found before you can solve the mystery. How do you find these clues? Simple, the same way you do in every other game. Walk back and forth staring at the ground. Look at every single object. Do not stray too far because you probalby passed a clue you didn't notice and if your not careful you will have explored the entire map and not uncovered a single mystery. Terrible boring game that amounts to nothing but a big easter egg hunt with a lame story about a kid who writes even lamer stories.			"

												This game is really incredible.  Its beautiful, eerie, spooky and it will creep you right out.  Remember the origional Silent hill back on the playstation?  This game reminds me of the sense of fear that game provided.  I am pretty certain that I just died I won't spoil as to how but I seriously freaked out and I haven't had a game do that to me in years!  The game starts out and builds up a sense of dread.  Its the kind of game you want to sit down for a few hours and play straight in a dark room.  The sound track is really well done, very creepy.  I really like this game but I might have to take a break for the night so I can actually sleep because I have work tomorrow!  This weekend though I won't be sleeping!  The sleeper never sleeps!			"

												Admittedly, I have not played very much of this game, but what I have played has been amazing.The graphics are breathtaking, and every single step I take in this game I am in awe of how amazing the environment around me is.I've been taken away by the story as well, it's lead me on so much and has successfully made me care and curious about what happened to Ethan Carter.  I want to learn more about him and I want to experience the world around me.The greatest experience so far is when I came across a puzzle in a house.  Unsure of what to do, I read the text and decided to search for an interesting part that I had seen.  Upon Googling it, I found material related to this text and was able to solve the puzzle.  Puzzles with outside the box thinking are amazing, and I really like the ingenuity that went into creating them.I can't wait to keep playing, and if you start, I'm sure you won't want to stop.			"

												So far, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter has delivered on everything it has promised and more. This is everything that Murdered: Soul Suspect should have been but wasn't. The detective work requires actual thought, and the puzzles require you to actually take a moment and think about time, order, and the environment around you. Every other game I've played that has you in the role of a detective in a horror setting so far insists on leading you around by the nose, but not here. Here, you earn your story and when you unveil the narrative further there's a real sense of accomplishment...and looming dread, because this seems to bear the hallmarks of a Lovecraftian tale, where knowing too much means losing yourself to win. I'm eager to see how far down this mad rabbit hole goes.			"

While the game is beautiful to me it was too grindy and linear. Not what I was expecting at all. Major disappointment for me.			"

												It's basically a walking simulator with meh puzzles, bad saving system, some bugs (some of which even force you to reload to last save which means losing A LOT of progress). The only thing really going for it are the graphics, and even they look very gray-ish and could use some filterings (like a subtle dof effect, maybe a bit of saturation). Not fun for me and unless you liked, say, Dear Esther, I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone. Certainly not for any more than €5.			"

												[Note: I actually played the Redux version, but my review is here, because Review is not currently working for Redux.]Wow - this is a really short game! (less than 8 hours)The story itself is strange, confusing, and ultimately rather pointless. The puzzles are of varying difficulty, but mostly fairly hard. The first and most important puzzle, which makes it possible to play the rest of the game, doesn't announce itself, doesn't indicate your progress, and doesn't tell you why it's important, even when you complete it. Because of this, I was not able to get anywhere with the game until I looked at a walkthrough. Part of my problem was that I was misled by the trailer - don't watch it!The only really good thing about the game is the graphics, and even there you need a substantial GPU to have good enough quality to appreciate them.My rating: 3/10.

												9/10The only negative thing I could say it's that the game is short. But after the final scene it's easy to see it's not only a budget issue, the length fits the tale perfectly and prolonging it would probably be a bad decision.The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is slow-paced, beautifully crafted and the story is really intriguing. The final scene touched me deeply, The Astronauts should be praised and I sure hope they put out more games, I'll be waiting. If you decide to buy this game, bear in mind it's more of a tale you slowly uncover, and it is worth your time.			"

												Boring. Story tried to be edgy but comes off half baked. Just more artsy fartsy garbage that gets high praise from critics but in reality starts nowhere, goes nowhere and ends nowhere and takes forever to get there. Beautiful environments do not make a beautiful game. This isn't a game as interactions are sorely limited. It is a visual novel dressed up to look like a game but your time would be better spent reading a book, or doing chores, instead of slogging through this which was a chore in itself.Oh and the statement at the beginning about the game not holding your hand is really just an excuse for poor game design.

												This game was gorgeous. Its probably the first game I've played since portal 2 where i didnt feel scared to look to closely at textures or a stray clearing intended only for you to walk past. it has a nice style of linear storytelling, as there are none of the dreaded ""points of no return"" throughout. That part was great. Its also a great benchmark for your pc. But not really a ""game"". An interactive storytelling experince with mediocre voice acting? Thats a little closer. An interactive storytelling expeirece with mediocre voice acting, solid mechanics, invisible walls, only one puzzle that takes more than one try, and a glitchy ending scene that puts a splatter of incompetence on an otherwise above-average narrative? Bingo. Its worth $10, and I would say more if i didnt have to take a tf2 break halfway through to alleviate my mix of minor boredom and waining anticipation for any real progression.			"

												I really do not recommend this game, its an open world where you are not ""hand held"" by the devs (their words) but if you stray away from their narrative you will be punished by the game.There is a huge world to explore but it is empty. This is a walking simulator par-excellence, but be aware that if you go exploring and miss a save point you will lose a lot of progress, so DO NOT quit out until you see a Saving Scene message, even then dont be surprised if you progress has bugged out.Between the crap save system and lost game play because of this, motion sickness induced by the game, I have had to restart this game many times, so the time I have spent with this game is not a reflection on its length, but more of a reflection of its developers incompetence. A very buggy and annoying experience, not recommended at all.It is quite short (4-5 hours).			"

												rating: not worth playingThe only thing which is fun about this game is to look at it because it looks gorgeous, but it is a bad game, not terrible, but its not worth your time. There are so many other games you could play even if you are someone who plays tons of games. The story isnt bad as far as I played, but it is also not really motivating or interesting. Whats really weird is how the story is connected to the gameplay. The game tells you in the beginning that it does not hold your hand, which is weird it sounds like they are praising themselves for that, and first that sounds like a good thing but these devs did not understand what holding your hand means.As the player I did not understand at all why I am doing what I was doing in this game, or what the point of investigating these murders are and especially the game doesnt explain any of its mechanics. The problem about this is that the character you are playing as DOES know all of that. He knows that he has special abilities, but I dont know how to use them and that doesnt make sense. A game has to explain its mechanics, basic ruleset.Look at Dark Souls, Half-Life 2 or Portal 2. Those game do not hold your hand, but explain and teach the player how to use its mechanics.The funny thing is this game doesnt even have many mechanics, actually you could call it a walking simulator with a little bit of clicking. Exploration seems attractive at first, but there is nothing to find.The most weird thing about this game is that I didnt investigate the first murder, because I had no idea what to do, but I also dont have to do it. You can just walk past everything and you might even not know that you missed stuff. And that makes the game pointless to me, if these things dont matter for the game why should I do them?I cant recommend this to anyone.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is visually beautiful. The story is well done, but surprisingly short.Most of the time played was spent running aroundlooking for text I could interact with, which is sparse.The player cannot interact with the world in anyway save for in very specific locations in a very largearea. Want to look at that book? Nope. Open that door? Nope. There is a reason for this, but it detractsfrom the game play. There wasn't enough meat in thestory, for me, to support the end and the brevityof the story. Nor was there enough character connectionfor me to care very much about the characters. The endI got was interesting, but it could have been so much more.And for 20 buckaroos, it should have been.I recommend this game for its visual beauty and sound.Good for a sale. Otherwise, no. "

												THAT ENDING!!! GOD!!!!HEAVY SPOILERS AHEAD !!! If you have not played the game you should not read this review!!!!Hi Adrian,You are right, I should not have posted a negative review without trying to be at least constructive in my criticism but I was at that time very angry and my emotions got the best of me. So in order to rectify my statement I will try to expand my thoughts on the game in order to explain at the best of my capability why I gave to you a negative review. Let us start from the beginning: Yes, I am giving you a negative review just for the ending. I know that it could sound a little childish but let me try to explain myself. Your game is many aspects wonderful, the visuals are stunning, the game mechanics are basics but they serve at best the story which you have created. For no moment I have thought: ""Oh god those mechanics are awful"", but instead I was so invested in the story that the game has created that I cared very little for anything else. I just wanted to reach the end and see how this wonderful, well structured, misterious story was about to end. And that was the time when everything fell apart. If it wasn't for that ending I could have given you a positive review and a 9.5/10 but that ending! Why does it enrage me so much? Well, it is because that ending invalidates everything that the player has done during the game. We (the players) have investigated, tried to solve a mistery, sometimes we ran away in fear from monsters(btw that part made me jump on my chair, well done!) you have made us feel invested in this wonderfully crafted story and at the very end.........(spoiler alert)........one could sum it up in: It was just a dream, Prospero doesn't exisists, Ethan Carter is dying and the Chthulhuesque creature ""The Sleeper"" was just a dream manifestation of Ethan! So what you (the player) did, has never happened in the fictional world of ""The vanishing of Ethan Carter"" you were just a fragment of the imagination of a dying child and nothing that you have done has affected the world in any way. Well, at that time I felt actually betrayed by the game! So what I did was not real but just a dream all the misteries remains with the answer: ""It was a dream""? Really?!?!?! The lowest denominator of twist endings: ""It was a dream"" was actually used for one of the most interesting story and concept that I have seen for a very long time?!?! So yeah, that was it. That is why I am giving you a bad review, to sum it up: wonderful game, I despised the ending so much that I needed to express it with a bad review. I am sorry, I know that it couls sound very childish and not objective but I can not help myself. I think however that your company has created a very impressive game and I would love to try your future games.Sincerely,JackskelterP.S.: English is not my mother language so if you do not understand something feel free to ask me again to rephrase something in my comment:happymeat:			"

 I started walkingThen I had walked some moreI am so tired now. Absolutely terrible game. Review is for Redux version.It's a somewhat of a puzzle exploration mystery game in it's nature, however to call it that would be an insult to those genres. It's a walking simulator and I can never, ever put enough spite into those words to serve as a warning.I'd like to use my puzzle exploration mystery solving skills and deduce what led to this games creation:Scene: (Game studio heads discussing their next game)Exec 1: Did we hire the best talent for graphical design and level creation?Exec 2: Absolutely we did. Spend all the money we had, but we got them, sir.Exec 1: Great! What about writer?Exec 2: Well, with the money we have left, we can get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ writer for a year, or a great one that will write something for us while he is sitting on the toilet in the morning.Exec 1: Tough choice. But I heard that story matters a lot, lets get that great writer.Exec 2: Done!Exec 1: What about game designer? Do we have one?Exec 2: No, not enough money to hire anyone even remotely competent. Exec 1: Bah, who cares. We have about an hour worth of content here, just tell the team to make the area bigger, and prettier, and also bigger. Exec 2: Wouldn't gamers figure out that there is literally nothing to do in our game?Exec 1: No way. Our target audience is two-fold: morons who pre-order games and hipsters who will think any pile of trash is treasure because nobody normal would touch it. Exec 2: Sir, you are a genius. I bet we will even get everyone to praise us for this worthless time waste as innovation! A whole new genre: A game where you don't actually have to play or do anything but stumble around like a drunk looking for his car keys.Exec 1: Oh, oh, and don't forget to tell them that we are not holding their hand. This way they will refuse to believe that we just didn't do anything for this game  and instead think that maybe they are not good enough to play our game.Exec 2: Now lets go roll in our piles of money and laugh at the idiots who gave it to us.I can't emphasize this any louder: The game has 1 hour worth of content but you can spend 20-30 hours looking for it. I understand how some people can't spend 100 hours consuming 100 hours worth of content in games like Witcher, but I will never understand how people can spend 20 hours trying to consume 1 hour of content.If you are not a stupid hipster that follows the crowd of other hipsters bleating like a sheep, next time you hear words ""Walking simulator"", turn around and walk away. This will complete the experience of the simulation.However, if you are looking for puzzle exploration mystery game, I can highly recommend Murdered: Soul Suspect. THAT is how you make an interesting game.I just can't believe that this are the same people who made a fun loaded Bulletstorm.			"

												I was worried - I almost never pre-buy anymore (which has saved me considerably - Sacred 3 anybody) - that I'd managed to get suckerd by the chance to get the soundtrack.This game does not hold your hand.  It does, however, hold your reproductive organs in a vice.The visuals are as advertised - I was a Boy Sprout - and walking around this game makes one feel like they are nestled deep in the more creepy (yet beautiful) portions of the Appalachians.  Why do I say the Appalachians?  The mountiantops have trees.  Some of the views are so spectacular I want to send them to my Dad. The audio is top-notch, creepy enough that you get the feeling of audio-feedback before you die.This is a lie.  There is no audio-feedback before you die.  You ignore important warnings?  You die.  Horribly, but thankfully not explicitly.  Gorn would not fit, and thankfully is not shown.Oddly, falling 2 stories does not kill you (something I'm not 100% on board with), but [REDACTED] eating your [REDACTED] will certainly [REDACTED].Some users may wish to delay purchase for a few weeks until the FAQ/Guides come out.

BUT... 7 hours. 7 hours of roaming everywhere in the map and most of the time i was just standing admiring the dam. The story is not satisfying by any means, they tried to make it ""deep"" but it's not. Adventure games have puzzles, this game has about 3-4 and each one of them is ridiculously easy... The game is surely not worth the money.. Buy it on a sale for its looks,  or just leave it.			"

												I wish it was somehow made clear for non-tech-experts like myself that the game needs a very high-end system to run on. I'm sure it works fine for people with better PCs but when the mouse takes five minutes to get anywhere and on the lowest setting for everything the game is still unplayable, I really wish there was some kind of refund option.

												Beautifull, but this is not investigator game.Artists work 5+, good ambient music.Story... boring.It could be one of the many The Witcher 3 quest, not a whole game.Looks like devs make good tech demo then decide to create game from it.			"

												The Vanishing of Ethan Carter reminds me of a Stephen King novel.A fantastic start, excellent setting, and interesting concept.And then a really terrible finale.I know they say that it's the journey, not the destination. But when the destination is this eye-rolling, it makes the journey seem lame.			"

												I like a lot of the general ideas of the game but I have to admit, that I was a little dissappointed. The graphics are good, the story in general ,too. I think the game has a lot of potential and a nice atmosphere, but all in all it is just a walking simulator , as somebody else here already said. I´m not a big fan of jump scares and more of dense atmosphere and at the beginning this game delivers this a lot. But after a while it gets repetitive and boring: Oh another beautiful, lifeless landscape. For a meagre 4 to 5 hour gameplay (and this includes don´t getting one riddle for 30 minutes and running around 20 min because I didn´t know where to go next:-)) there should be more tension and more story. The exploration part is also not that well done, since you can explore a bit, but at last you have to follow the roads to get to next waypoint.All in all an interesting game, but if you like classical adventures or horror fps you won´t be satisfied. It´s more like an interactive movie with two surpirsingly difficult riddles (the others were really easy) and a lot of walking inbetween. I would give it 5/10, since I liked one puzzle a lot (my girlfriend hated it) and the really good graphics are more than impressing for an indie game.			"

												The Vanishing is stunning and huge, making walking around a pleasure. Unfortunately there's not enough to do in the world, and the ending is the worst kind of 'it was all just a dream' rubbish and ruins the game. The game's story is pretty creepy, though probably not in the way the writers intended - it's the kind you'd expect from an emotionally disturbed teenager. It mostly consists of  Ethan's fantasies about his family members murdering each other and committing suicide.  "

												It's insane to me such a nonsensical mess could charge 20 dollars. Now I enjoy ""walking simulators"" like Gone Home and The Stanley Parable but this game is directionless. It misses the charm or comedy those other games posses and has almost nothing to really interact with. As a detective mystery it's not compelling in the slightest. Whoever wrote this wants to be Stephen King but fails horribly. One of the worst games I've ever played.			"

												I wish to have an option of playing demo before I decided to buy this ""game"". It's just confusing walking sim. Game is constantly crashing and I lost my saves few times. Graphics? Oh well some people are too optymistic here. Music? Oh well it's a matter of taste. The worse spend money ever. But OH well that's only my opinion.			"

												I purchased this game through steam and it would not load.As usual there was no help so steam has returned my money.I saw the game on ""GOG"" so i purchased it from them hoping it would work, but it didn""t .Now every time I try to load, the game stops and takes me to the steam page.I have informed GOG of this but with no responce.Both steam and gog must be afiliated.Game is a dud and so is gog.

												Looks good but at just over 3 hours of gameplay its not worth $20 by any means. Also there's like one thing in the entire game you would consider an actual puzzle and not just 'walk around looking for something'. Give this stinker a wide berth until it's on sale.			"
