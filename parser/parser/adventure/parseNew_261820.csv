												The game is quite, a nightmare of a lone fisherman who wanders around a unknown island when he doesn't have a choice other than keep moving.I love this game. The graphics maybe not the best, but the sounds is pretty well-made, songs at certain situation bring the whole experiences of a area to a whole new level.The overwhelming feel caused by the game's effects, alongside with soundtrack probably makes this one of the best mods for Source Engine that ever created to bring me such a tense, deep, and still horrifying at place and times.

												The game is based on the Source Engine which according to some people it is getting old now but has been used well to create a good-looking game that ran without a glitch. The voice acting is pretty good. The mix of simple problem solving and combat is just right, giving the game a nice balanced feel.  Anyway the game has a nice story with some cool moments and it is not a long game.

												A short game, Estranged: Act 1 delivers a compelling performance of a fisherman, who gets stranded on an island during a storm. You meet several people: some good, some very bad, who will help or hurt you as you go along your path. The game is made on the source engine, and uses many of the Half-Life elements and features from it. Being a free-to-play game, I entered this game not expecting much but a few cheap dialogs and meaningless character development for the sake of it only being the first of the series. Surprisingly, the game delivered more than what it offered, such as an enticing tale of a man's struggle to help those who he encoutered and also kicking a few butts along the way. The game abruptly ends though, leaving the want for Act 2 to come fairly soon. I was honestly suprised by all of the elements in this game, as well as most of the visuals being such great quality. If you do try this game, I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.			"

												One of the main things I have to say about this mod is that it's music is really good at setting the mood/atmosphere for the game. Without it I think my opinion of the game would have been very different. Its a short exploration ""horror"" game (has a few attempted jump scares and tries to build up a very spooky setting. Its nothing amazing but does what it sets out to do fairly well and completed the game with a positive view on it in the end.Most of the achievements are there to reward exploration, but it has two achievements that require you to beat it in a certain way and the good thing is that both of those can be done at the same time. One of them feels like a homage to the classic rocket man achievement from Half-Life 2: Episode 2 or the Guardin' Gnome from L4D2.Time to 100%: 2½ hours "

 My Review :  Rate  : 7/10 Game Information :Title : Estranged: Act IEngine : SourceGenre : Adventure, Free to Play, Indie, Single Player, FPSPlatforms : Windows, Mac, LinuxDeveloper : Alan Edwardes Release Date : 16 Jan, 2014Estranged: Act I is a free Half Life 2 mod made using Source Engine. Its a pretty good mod and has amazing environment. Its free mod and you need to figure your way out by solving simple puzzles. I recommend it to all Half Life fans as it has a similar environment and puzzles.Pros : ● HL2 Mod but like a standalone game.● Source engine graphics.● Bit of horror when you are around zombies and enemies.● 8 simple steam achievements and one carry till the end achievement. Cons :● No boss fights.● Few types of enemies. ● I didn't enjoy the ending. :(● Human Enemies can kill you instantly.● Some maps are laggy and crashes sometimes. ● Bad lighting effects at some places like vents where you can see light rays behind the wall. Verdict : Its free so its worth playing, but let me remind you something. It is an episodic game so you'll have to wait for the next episode. It's not perfect and awesome game but as a standalone mod, it has potential.			"

												What a great simple game, it took me back to Half Life 2 and had some of the same feel but in a smaller shorter kind of way. I didn't like one of the achievements where you had to carry a stupid bucket around with you but I guess its an achievement to get,It was annoying to have that in my field of view the whole time. I wish the game was longer, the story left you with wanting more. The zombies freaked me out sometimes so I shot them in the head. The game was great overall!			"

												Estranged: Act I is a free to play game which is a plus to the game since the game don't really explain what to do and where to go and you then find yourself doing loops and doing the same things. The game is very confusing but the story lines get better the more you progress through the game. The atmosphere of the game is pretty intense. The game does give some good gameplay, but the registrations could be a bit better and the overall game could be more solid. The music that plays is also pretty good. It has some tense and creepy music, that gives the levels a dynamic eerie feel to the game, which is a bonus for a game that tries to give the scary feeling, which i think is half achieved. Although the game feels half finished, you can get some fun from this game, and the more time you put into the game, the better it is. The level design is good and it is generally a well half built game.			"

												Quite a short game. Easy to get confused, but if you have at least half of your brain you might be able to work out what you're doing. I've put some time into this game, and it's quite fun but also challenging. The aspect of working out what the Hell is going on is also a challenge in itself. Again, quite a short game but will be nice to see how the other Acts continue this game.			"

												Estranged is a mod based on the Source Engine. It tells its own story, which is not related to the HL2 universe.Basically you are stranded on an island and want to leave again, but there is a disturbing signal preventing you from reaching the mainland.While the mod doesn't last long, it's very entertaining. And there is even more on the horizon... this is only Act 1 out of 3!9/10 would translate again "

												Not much can be said about Estranged, since the experience is still incomplete, but Act I of this indie Source-ed game delivers bits and pieces of the Half-Life experience minus the triple-A polish. You are a marooned fisherman on a strange island that ends up infiltrating a major shady corporation, while navigating through a variety of, albeit oddly connected, locations.Sound design and a few musical vignettes are the highlight of this offering. Will be looking forward to see the remaining acts. 3/5			"

												This ""Addon"" for Half-Life 2 is very cool. It has its own story and voice acting, own models and textures.Story:The story in Estranged: Act 1 is'nt that large, 90% of the game you're by youself. You can find newspapers and other things on computers telling you about what has happened. The story is'nt set in the Half-Life world, which makes them have many new things to try.Character:The characters in Estranged: Act 1 have wonderful voice acting. The characters seem to give emotion to the player. The models for the humans arn't new, they are the same old citizen models. But for the zombies, they are new. The models arn't that bad, and also the zombies have a new animation. The animation is pretty good, but always room for improvement.Models:The new models in Estranged: Act 1 are well made. The models fit right in with the Half-Life 2 style. The new zombie, barrel and other models are fantastic. The new models give a new feel to the game, making a new experience for the player.Textures:The new textures in Estranged: Act 1 are also well made. The look realistic and fit in with the Half-Life 2 textures. The new textures arn't only on the new models though, they are also on the floors, wall and roof.Conclusion:In conculsion Estranged: Act 1 is a well made Addon for Half-Life 2. Even though the game is short, i recomend this addon for people who have Half-Life 2 already. It's not worth buy Half-Life 2 just for this addon because it's just to short.This Game (Addon) gets a 8.5/10Sorry for any spelling mistakes in this review.			"

												First off, this game was gorgeous to look at. It does its best to be pleasing to the eye however the age old Source Engine can. The Art direction was really nice. Reminded me of Silent Hill mixed with a bit of F.E.A.R, two of my favourite horror titles. The lighting in this game is some of the best I've seen. I liked the amber bounce lighting the flashlight emitted. The game is quick to build atmospher and quick to change it up which, along with its linear levels (which I loved), made it a really enjoyable 1 hour 45 mins of playtime. The combat was also refreshing and often times tactical. Furthermore, the puzzles were simple but enjoyable, although often times too short and too obvious. This wouldn't have been a problem if the combat was a huge aspect of this game but unfortunately there's not much going on. Besides that, It was only an hour and 45 minutes long but that doesn't matter since the time spent playing was a blast and let's not forget that the product is FREE! High Production Value, Good Stuff. Worth your time!			"

												Estranged Act I is a free-to-play game made with the Source engine and because it's free you can't really complain, right ? 'Because the best things in life are free', is what they say. I just hope this is not one of those things.I have to admit that I'm being a bit harsh here, because the game isn't bad at all. It's just uneventful, and while it only lasts about 75 minutes it unsuccessfully managed to pull me in. The puzzles are basic and simple, and physics based, and the combat boring. There's also not enough variety as far as the environments are concerned (the start and end of the game are the only exceptions if you ask me). Look at me, bashing a free game. I should be ashamed. I am a bit actually because at least someone made some effort to try and produce a game. Yes, it's flawed and there's plenty of room for improvements, but I honestly think you should give it a try and judge it for yourself. You have nothing to lose except for a couple of lost hours maybe.[Rating: 68/100]			"

												*SPOILERS* Great game! This game is a mod for Half-Life 2, so when you play through this game, you'll notice some of the same objects and textures that were in that game. Plus, Isaac Kleiner is a cameo in this game! The story is pretty nice but it's a little strange how an ordinary fisherman goes from a confused and estranged person from the rest of the world and comes to this island supposedly, and not even 10 minutes into the game, you're given a gun and you're already killin' zombies. Well, I can't blame them for making this guy directly becoming rambo, I mean afterall it's just a mod for Half-Life 2. Aside from that, the level design is great, the voice acting is also pretty good. Unfortunately, I did encounter some glitches. One of them is when you are given your first gun from the guy at the house near the boat and you continue walking out the house, he out of nowhere disapeares. Or when you go into the doorway past the shooting gallery to walk up the stairs, you get a loading screen and if you jump all the way down from the stairs again, the door where you came from is a brick wall with a door frame. But the only way you can see these glitches is if you just walk around everywhere. Another thing that I didn't really like was the ending, it was a little illogical but some people might be fun with this ending and some people might not. But look, it's a free game on steam so it wouldn't bother than if I had to pay for this game. If I did have to buy this game, I would expect this game to be longer. Totally recommend it for anyone who doesn't have any money on steam. 7/10			"

												10/10.Absolutely brilliant game, short but really fun. Great puzzle game, it's like playing half life 2 all over again. I really enjoyed it, and the fact that it's free makes it a completely unmissable game. Play it now.

												So, I have a lot to say about this game. First off, this game is GREAT. At first I thought this would be nothing but a Zombie-Shooting game, but I was wrong. Estranged: Act 1 is filled with beautiful graphics, an interesting storyline, and an intense atmosphere which always keeps you on edge. I loved the plotline, especially learning about Arque. Fun and optional things, such as being able to read the newspaper and interact with computers, only increases the feeling of being in a real-world environment. The only problem I had was Dr. Richmond walking really, REALLY slowly. I know this is because of Kliener's A.I., but it would have been nice not having to wait that extra bit for him to walk up the stairs. All things considered, this mod deserves a solid 9.5/10. I can't wait for Estranged: Act 2, and to return to the amazing world that the creators  have made.			"

												First-person puzzler with short bursts of action, soild voice acting and soundtrack. Just enough enemies to keep you on your toes, ammo must be conserved and sometimes it's better to run than fight. My only complaint is it's weird seeing Half-Life 2 characters re-used, but that's due to time constraints I guess. It's free, so if you've got a handful of hours, give it a go.Act 2 is in alpha here: http://www.moddb.com/mods/estranged "

												I just love it, it's a ""must try"" title. I played it through a few times, not only once. Not scarry at all, but it has it's own great atmosphere. And the music (especially that one during the warehouse shootout) is awesome. The only negative thing I could mention is that there're just a few enemies. I understand that primarily it's not an action packed story, but with a bit more to kill would be better. Can't wait for Act II.			"

												A standalone Source engine game, Estranged: Act I attempts to create a unique storyline with breathtaking details. Originally a mod for Half-Life 2: Episode Two, Estranged has finally been released onto Steam as a standalone game, so you don't need any other games in order to play it. The game even adds assets from games such as Counter-Strike: Source and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive showing that the team really went out of their way to make this masterpiece. So far, I am enjoying Act II's public alpha, however  I wish that Act II still used the Source Engine, but unfortunately it had hindered development too much...			"

												This is a free Half Life 2 mod with an interesting story - we play as a fisherman who gets stranded on an island after receiving a mysterious distress call. Naturally, we investigate and soon encounter the enemies in the small town nearby. Alan and his team took the effort to include a lot of new assets as well as new effects in the game. At times it's beautiful and it's difficult to believe the engine is more than 10 years old. The accompanying music at various sequences is also great. Initially, the game starts out as a horror story but later on the creators include more puzzle and action sequences. The only downside with Estranged is that it is - at this point - unfinished. Only Act 1 is available which can be completed in a mere 2 hours with all of its chapters. And whilst this was released more than 2 years ago I understand from various forum posts that Act 2 is in still progress - due to different circumstances, however, the development process has slowed down.If you do not mind playing an unfinished mod (that may never see its sequel) then Estranged is a good purchase. For me it is on par with Transmission and I consider it a great example as to what mods should be released from time to time.			"

												Expect something a bit relaxing with action? Nope this have a horror twist to it, in the way that you expect things from every corner and that you will have you'r shoulder's to you'r ear's in preparation of annything that want to get you with ill intent. Perfect environmental feeling and sure gives you the creep's. Makes you watch every corner and turn and twitch when there's a sound wich doesnt fit in, no ¨jumpscares¨ but the enemies you come across do come from unexpected place's. Allso the character's here are well done when it comes to voice acting. Recommended for those who can handle the tension of allways needing to be prepared for attack's in dark place's			"

												Estranged is a Half-Life Engine Mod FPS/Adventure, feels more like half finished. But it's for free! So don't say anything. It entertains you for a few hours and you'll get 9 achievements gifted - so easy. Most challenging was to carry a childs bucket through the whole game and not to collect any flashlights. The action sequences in the end/finale are quite good.  "

												Was a good game (mod ?) based on HL2's source engine. It's really valve-like, you have one precise path to take, you encounter many ""use-your-brain-to-figure-out-how-to-get-out-of-here"" parts and  you live each single event through the character's eyes. The scenario is good (from what we know till here) and there are many fun things such as cute cat videos and the fact that they used Dr. Kleiner as a totally random scientist in the game ! Moreover it has fun achievements. ^^ Bon jeu, basé sur le ""source engine"" de HL2. Typique du jeu Valve, un chemin précis à prendre, beacoup d'endroits ou il faut réfléchir pour trouver une solution, et on vit tous les evenements à travers les yeux du perso. Le scenar est bon (de ce qu'on en sait jusque là) et il y a pas mal de trucs marrant style des videos de chats et le fait qu'ils aient réutilisé le Dr. Kleiner pour en faire un scientifique completement sans relation avec l'original.En plus les succes sont simples et marrants. ^^			"

												Where's the 2nd act?! Estranged puts the player in a very alien environment with no backstory and lets the player deduce exactly what's going on with this island that you have crash landed at. The game precedes to take you through several situations in which you need to problem solve and find the best way out to survive, while providing some varying locations  and an interesting dynamic of storytelling through meeting other characters or even small things like reading the e-mail of an absent Arque employee. All of this enjoyment basically comes to an abrupt halt though with the game's ending. It provides an effective cliffhanger, but the only problem with having a cliffhanger is eventually finishing your story and provide closure for the player. This, sadly, has not been done by the creators of this game. Besides that, the game's visual presentation is done very well and makes the Half Life 2 engine definitely a force to be reckoned with. Great and thrilling experience, this game definitely warrants a sequel. I mean..... I enjoyed what this game had to offer a lot more than the original Half Life and if that doesn't say something, I don't know what does.			"

												I was mighty impressed with how the developers of this game/Half Life 2 mod designed their levels, gave hints with light and things dropping to draw attention, nice details, great sound design, music and voice acting. Having objectives, the occasional little puzzle, weapons, enemies & locales switching on a regular basis made for a thoroughly enjoyable couple of hours! Plus it has some genuine good humour!Sure, the concept isn't groundbreaking, many a story has had a similair start, and there a ""zombies"" and ""soldiers"". But the use of the source engine is epic. Of course, you will have the familiar issue of grabbing a chair when meaning to grab a battery and subsequently smashing said chair all over the room with clinking and clanking, but hey. It could be worse. AI is good, and facial animations and lip synching as well. I was pleasanlty surprised because I so seldom come across NPC's with voice acting and facial animations in small scale FP horror games. Now I don't know enough about modding to tell if that's inherent in the models and engine of Half Life 2, or if it needs to be created, calculated, programmed or calibrated for the mod to work, but fact is it is a nice end result in either case.When I finished Act 1, I was really pumped to continue on and get to the conclusion of this story. It certainly ends on a cliffhanger!			"

Additionally, I haven't even finished the game yet, so what I have seen are first impressions.  Definately check it out!			"

												Estranged: Act 1 is a short but sweet Mod. Clocking in at around 2 hours it gives a nice bit of story - and this is only Act 1.       Being a story driven - it held my attention quite well. I usually get bored if i'm forced to read something or if there's limited voice acting. But things happen that keep me intrigued. Who is my character? Where am i? Whats happening on this island? These were all important parts of the Mod that  took it from being good to interesting. Estranged has gotten alot better since the first time i've played it back in Beta stages, and i really appreciate the inlusion of achievements and Steamworks support. This is one to follow and I cant wait to play the rest of it!			"

												This brilliant mod is just phenomenal, I played it when it was still in alpha/beta and it was amazing now it is beyond words, they kept with the layout they first used on the beta levels and just bought it to life and the graphics is just supurb even my Nvidia Geforce GTX675M graphics card had a little trouble handling it at max settings which shows what people can do with Valve's Source Engine.

												Played through the early release and the current version. Had a great time with both playthroughs. Not too hard, not too easy, good level of tension. Makes good use of Source Engine mechanics and puzzle design. No unecessary loud noises, jump scares, light displays, or nonsense a lot of horror games attempt that kill headphone users and degrade game performance for no reason.<3 Would definitely play again			"

I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys a horror shooter.			"

												This was very enjoyable to play through. It sets the mood of a survival horror game without plastering the game with zombies. The zombies weren't my biggest worry though. Act 1 showed a lot of creativity. Throughout the game, there was a lot of empty rooms to explore. I kept thinking that the developers could have put a few supplies in them because I almost stopped exploring the rooms - but then again, it turns out I didn't need the supplies, and the empty rooms had a lot of fun little quirks in them (billboard with notes from staff meetings or computers with poorly written e-mails).I liked the fact that you could only carry one weapon at a time. There wasn't many options to actually choose between more than one weapon, but I'd like to see that expanded further in Act 2. After all, it doesn't really make sense that a random fisherman can carry 2 guns, 2 automated machine guns, a shotgun, 5 grenades, a railgun and a rocket launcher, does it? ;)I am very much looking forward to Act 2!

												When I saw the screenshots, I was hoping it'd be one of these adventure games where you don't shoot your way to end, but rather taking your time explorating and stuff like that.Only for me to be little mislead... well you don't really gun your way out until later on in game, and it doesn't really last long (nor  hard, it's fairly easy as you play it carefully) but the starting is really good in eerie way, and the graphics are pretty great.  For deaf gamers, you'll be glad it has closed captions, but then again this is Half Life 2 mod and Half Life 2 games has been amazing for those who are deaf / hard of hearing. Overall, if I'd have to be bluntly honest, it's nothing too special but personally as it was free, and I had fun of three hours (two playthroughs, one natural another achievements) and the story (from what there is anyway) seems pretty decent, although I'd assume Act II is when it shines.So yeah, if you happen to enjoy adventure games with little amount of gunplay and mainly exploration/the story, give it a try at least. It's free, so it's not hurting your wallet anyway.			"

												Estranged is a really good source mod for Half Life 2.  (Just Saying...)The Story: is about a dimwit like you crashes a boat and goes into a little town. Meet a couple of british and american people and boom you're done. (2 Hours Of Game Time)The Gameplay: isn't really nothing at all. It's still killing zombies and humans with weapons and hammers. There's also one slot for weapons which is a damn pain in tha♥♥♥♥♥ I tried to open a vent (SPOILER!!!) when me and this guy called george told me to go to the lighthouse or town or something. I couldn't even open the facking vent. If I had the hammer with me instead of nocliping into the vent, It would've been easier. There is guns in the game and you need health when you get hit by people and zombies. You also need batteries for your flashlight too, but you don't really need it if you turn the brightness up a bit. (You can get a achivement from it too) This makes you want to explore! And look behind box's and look behind every nook and cranny and door. It's really gewd.If you seen the title, this game has ""Acts"". (Chapters) Keep in mind that the game is two hours long.Graphics: look sorta good. When you go to the offices in the game, it looks pretty good. ! It looks like Stanley Parable graphics. !Verdict: is that the game is okay and good at the same time. It has its up and downs but still is a very good source mod. I still can't wait for Act 2!

It runs on the Half Life 2 engine but has been edited to make the lighting more dynamic and it has some great particle effects.

												Amazing game! It's just great! I guarantee you'll love it, even if you're no fan of the Source Engine. Honestly, the beta was better, and I liked the layout of the beta more, but still, Estranged: Act I is legendary.Totally recommend this game.			"

												Kudos to Alan Edwardes for producing a great little mod that’s both polished and enjoyable. The source engine has been used well to create a good-looking game that ran without a glitch except for one problem with an achievement which I managed to fix but was a little annoying. The voice acting is pretty good. The mix of simple problem solving and combat is just right, giving the game a nice balanced feel.			"

												Estranged: Act I is a Half-Life 2 mod that has been developed using the Valve Source Engine. Half-Life 2 is not required to play this game. In Estranged, you play the role of a lone fisherman whose ship crashes during a bad storm. You end up on a mysterious island which seems to be abandon, or so you think. An outbreak of an unknown zombie-like virus has occurred on the island leaving you with very little ways to find help. This horror game will allow you to uncover facts about what has happened as you try and find your way back to the mainland.I personally have earned every achievement in the game along with completing it. I had a lot of fun earning all the achievements along with playing the game itself. Yes, this is a horror game. I can tell you there are a few parts in the game that  are considered jumpscares, small ones though, it all depends on how you view them. Don't worry though, if you're not the type for horror games, I recommend trying Estranged: Act I. You should find that the story in the game is very interesting and that the developers put a lot of effort into making this mod. There are parts where there is a lot of shooting action, but it shouldn't be too hard for anyone. The puzzles in this game are simple to figure out, I did not find one puzzle during my playthrough in which I was stuck on for a while. Overall, this is the best Half-Life 2 mod I have ever played. This game is like a story book, but instead of reading, you are actually playing it virtually. The developers put a lot of time and effort into creating this game, and I can't wait until they release Estranged: Act II. If you have some free time, try this game! It's free, and it will keep you occupied for a good amount of time, it only took me about 2-3 hours to complete the whole game, but that was because I was taking my time and exploring a lot.			"

												So I'll explain the story of the game. Basically what you have to do is, carry a bucket from the begenning to the end of the game and in between you encounter infecteds and people who want to kill you and various puzzles. And you will need to protect the bucket with your life. I actually started to have an attachement with that bucket.10/10 would definately carry the bucket again.			"

												Estranged Act I is the first part of a horror story involving a fisherman's quest for survival and answers after being washed ashore on a small island. The island is very reminiscent of a small New England town. Expect monsters, simple puzzle solving (HL-style manipulation), compelling story, good game play (including the appropriate use of swimming), good soundtrack, and engaging visuals. The use of graffiti on old industrial complexes and the newspapers seen in passing help give the gamer a real feel for the area.Atmosphere is key and Estranged pulls off tension and mood perfectly.  The achievements are a mixed bag. To get 100% you'll need to change the way you approach the game: one achievement has you literally carrying a bucket through entire game while you’re not attacking foes or using objects. They’re generally fun. Read the achievement list prior to playing if that's something that matters to you, they aren't unlocked instinctively. From what the developers have released, we should be seeing Act II soon. The new game should be based off the Unreal engine instead of the visually and mechanically limiting Source engine. This is an awesome time to get in on the action.			"

												Completely free linear FPS in the Source engine. Sticks to the Half-Life nuances very loyally, right down to the trains.The environment has a lot of attention to detail. Everything feels very immersive and interesting. The game exhibits a very forboding atmosphere throughout and keeps you going/interested in uncovering the next portion on your steps to civilization. The combat is simple, but it's at the level that works best for the game. I wish that the game was longer, but given the level of detail and satisfaction from the little time I spent with this game, I could tell that the game length is not a result of the developer's laziness. I would have paid money for this, honestly.Unfortunately, as a Source engine fanboy, I'm sad to know that Act II will be created on the Unreal Engine, but it should all still be great. This developer is very active with the community and Act II should be exceptional!			"

												Estranged: Act I is a MOD for Half Life 2, it requires that you own any game which is built on the Source Engine.The game feels very much like a Half Life game, The Protagonist, a fisherman lost at sea, is a mute. You make landfall on a strange island and as you move through the island to find help, you meet people they help develop the story further. You find weapons with limited ammo, enemies and there are even occasional puzzles for you to solve before you can continue the journey.Voice acting throughout the game is excellent, the game builds immersion instantly and the soundtracks are 10/10. However, the enemies are of limited threat, and the character model for some of them looks like something from back in 2002.Although the game is relatively short (it took me 86 minutes to complete) I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is evident that this is only Act I and there are more Acts to come!4/5 – Great Experience.			"

												An enjoyable well designed suspenseful adventure that plays like Half-Life (as you can imagine).  Though its over quite quickly the game length was actually longer than I expected.  Its does an admirable job to keep you going forwards, using loneliness to generate trepidation and build anticipaction despite its solely linear areas.  Even though gameworld interaction, puzzle solving and narration is limited, there is enough variety in the visuals combine well with the few action set-pieces to create an entertaining experience which is augmented by the very stylish use of music scores at key moments in gameplay.  Currently the game is free to play but consists of the first act, totally three chapters.  There are plans for three acts and a total of nine chapters.  My view is that now is the time to try it out cause and see if you like what you see.  I definitely did and  even though the game isnt designed to be replayable with any surprises, the achievements will likely mean you playthrough at least twice. A thumbs up from me for a HL sourced mod-based game.  Good effort.			"

												Haven't finished it yet, but I'm very impressed. You're a fisherman, crashed into an island, and now you have to find a way out somehow. The gameplay is okay for the most part. Good ol' HL2-like combat, except you have very limited ammo. The story is more of a mystery thriller, but they definitely nailed the atmosphere. The areas have a good feel to them, spooky and mysterious. The soundtrack and V. Acting is actually pretty swell, especially for a free game. It's nice to see another good HL2 Mod nowadays. If you have the time, you should definitely check it out.			"

												Reminds me of They Hunger, though the pace is considerably slower in Estranged (not a bad thing). I really enjoyed the survival horror feel to it, though when the action picks up it does feel a bit out of place. Regardless, an enjoyable game with a bunch of potential. Looking forward to the next act!			"

												Graphics: The Source engine is very limited to graphics. Estranged has really great graphics. There's Depth of Field, HBAO, film grain (I think this is already part of Source SDK 2013) and more. DoF and HBAO are really laggy if you're on an old PC (like mine :( ) so I recommend turning them off. Those two options are also Nvidia only, so if you want supah realistic graffix, get an Nvidia card. ATI/AMD (or whatever) cards are pretty behind in technology tbh. The game will still look good without HBAO and DoF on.Gameplay: The gameplay is pretty fun. There's zombies running at you trying to kill you. You can close yourself in a room so they can't reach you, or just kill them. The weapon variety is really small, there's only three weapons to choose from, and you can only carry one weapon. A pistol, an SMG, and a hammer. The pistol is pretty powerful, it can kill a zombie in 1 hit (headshot) and in 2 hits (body shots). The SMG is pretty weak, but it's fully automatic. The hammer is probably the worst weapon in the game (seriously xD) It's a melee weapon (obviously) and it can kill zombies in like 3 hits, but they can hit you first if you aren't careful. The weapons use the default HL2 animations, so that sucks. The pistol sounds like it's air, the SMG's model remains unchanged, and the hammer is a hammer. Nothing to it :D. There's also humans trying to kill you, and they can kill you pretty fast, so be careful. The game is pretty short, it's only like 2 hours long or so. Ever since the beta mod, they extended the ending a little bit and made it make more sense. There's also 9 achievements, and some of them can be annoying since they force you to go through the whole game again @_@Since i'm really bad at reviewing games, I only made 2 categories because I suck xDAnd the final verdict is: 9/10EDIT: Got a new graphics card and I can play with DoF and HBAO on, can't wait for Act 2 :D			"

												Well, hello there. You've probably stumbled upon this mod in the newest releases, haven't you? Well, I'll tell you, this mod might just make your day.The atmosphere was quite unsettling and spooky, a genuine part of a horror game. Although the scares are more mild than say Dark Ascent, at least in my opinion, I felt like I needed to check every corner to avoid a jump scare although unecessary. This Horror-Survival-Shooter mash up made me conserve my ammo, as it might be a good challenge for some.   The acting and story telling is quite phenomenal for a mod, and I'm extremely eager to see the next Act in the series.I'd give this lovely mod a 10/10.It's free, guys! Try it now!			"

												Estranged: Act IA free first person adventure game powered by the HalfLife 2 Engine. Correction, a Free First person Survival Horror game. The reason I corrected myself is, before I downloaded Estranged, I was under the impression it was going be one of those first person interactive stories. Well, I was wrong. Basic story is, you receive a distress call on your boat. Something about they"" have taken over the island. NExt thing you know you are floating in the water looking at your boat on fire right next to shore. From then you travel inland learning the jump, sprint, push, throw and other commands. The story progresses as you met a man who seemingly just murdered three people. He gives you his gun and away you go again. The atmosphere is eery and the sound a little jumpy. I unlocked my first achievement (yes this has achievements.. doesn't everything now?) when I found the lightswitch for a lamp in one of the cabins I came across. A moment later is where I came across my first Zombie. Equipped with glowing eyes and running full speed at me.This game requires a little bit of thinking to get past each area. There is a barrier and you have to examine the scene and determine what is missing. Once you figure it, usually by interacting with the environment or placing an object in a certain place or pattern you can move on.  I eventually got stuck. About eight Zombies at once attacked me. I killed all but one when I ran out of ammo. I was able to evade him but couldn't find out where to go so eventually gave up.The AI isn't too bright. One of the Zombies ran straight into a train and died. It wasn't as cool as it sounds though. The train wasn't moving.The game is free so I do recommend giving it a try just don't have high expectations.

												While the game Estranged: Act I is short, it is still a very well-crafted game.  It develops a strong atmospheric tone through the use of its really good visual presentation and a rather awesome soundtrack that takes some of its best queues from that of classic sci-fi horror films (Some of the queues reminded me of Alien, thank you for those subtle auditorial throwbacks!).The game peaks your curiosity with a good balanced pacing of story, action, puzzles, and locations that all just make sense.  All in all, it is a decent indie action/adventure/survival game and sets the tone quiet nicely for being 1 of a supposed number of acts to come.  Definately looking forward to a second act!			"

												Estranged: Act 1 is a Half-Life 2 Standalone Mod. The game has a Half-Life 2 meets a zombie apocolypse. Graphically its dated with some voice actors being pretty good and other being pretty poor. Do not expect to spend hours upon hours since it's a play once experience. Try it out for yourself, its free and who couldn't pass up something that's free.			"

												How to describe this Source Mod of Half Life 2...Well first, it's quite a unique game, one that you don't see too often anymore. Purely atmospheric, with some very appealing lighting and graphics. There is little to no music in the game, leaving you walking through a quiet and somewhat eerie area. Even so, this sets a perfect atmosphere, calmly, yet it still keeps you on your nerves.Admittedly, the story is somewhat cliché, but is still portrayed quite well. As you progress through new areas, you meet a few new people who give you small tasks that help you towards getting off of the stranded island you are on, with an unknown company blocking any outer communication. These characters are not always friendly, some attempting to kill you, just trying to survive in this perilous land. The voice actors are brilliant, bringing life to the game and to the characters they play.The graphics in this game are, while not perfect and somewhat buggy, still quite beautiful. There were multiple occasions where I would sit there for a few minutes and gaze out into the virtual horizon, taking in the quiet beauty. The lighting used in the maps are just worthy of a comment in itself. Dark areas have a dark glow to them, while the happier, lighter areas have a nice bright tinge to them. The infected are somewhat bland, looking as though they came from Star Trek and just have glowing yellow eyes, but they don't pose a threat, they are more there to remind you of the reason that you are there.As a total game, I found this to be quite impressive. I HIGHLY recommend this game to those with a passion for atmosphere. Considering this was made with the HL2 engine and is only the first Act of many to come, I can only wait in anticipation for the next few Acts. This game has impressed me quite a lot, with it unique atmosphere and dramatic music. As a total, this game brings back what was missing in the gaming community; Atmosphere. Modern games incorperate as much action as they can, sometimes not letting you take a break and take it all in, but this game let's you play and take it in at the same time. Very impressed with this game, can't wait for the next Acts.			"

												Really good level design. Really really reminiscent of Half Life 2 in term of level design (environment / puzzles) and global pacing / storytelling. The only things that prevent me from actually saying it's a good mod is the fact that it lacks something. Polishing in terms of animations, perhaps a bit more story polishing would have been better (such as reactions of the NPCs to the player, story wise (I'm thinking about the first meeting)), and a bit less of action was needed. The thing is you really feel all powerful, so the foes don't scare you as much as they should, in my opinion! Waiting for the Act2, and hoping the devs see my review and think about that. Estranged, is actually a HL² worship mod that could turn into much, much more.			"

												An odd one to say the least. A mod with an attention to detail that matches any ""real"" game. It's a fairly bland story, but the level design is simply superb. Even rivaling the game this is a mod of. It looks beautiful, which is odd as it is a mod of Half-Life 2 which even with the updated texture packs still shows its age. This mod on the other hand gives a fairly large overhaul (enough to distract me from the thought that it is a mod) and a nice lighting feel that really left me empressed.However the biggest downfall of this mod is the ending is very displeasing. I can't crituiqe more with out spoiling it, and I presume that the suprise of it was the design desision behind it, but even still it was a fairly lack luster ending even for a mod. That being said however I am a man who believes the journey is what is important not the destinaton. In which case this mod is a must play for anyone who owns Half Life 2. You will not regret it, feeling emotions from fear, despair, suspision and relief. All pulled off amazingly.In conclusion, play this mod. 9/10 would play again.			"

												When I first heard of this game coming out, I was extremely excited. I knew there would be mystery, puzzles and was very eager to download this free game. I got even more excited (Spoiler Alert)  when I learned it was about an island overrun by zombies. Yes, i do love my zombies. Here are my thoughts on this game:The story, I dare say is a teensie bit cliche. It is formatted like some other ones that i have heard and played. The beggining had me very intrigued, and I was excited to continue playing to better understand this mysterious story.Yet, as I went on, it was the same old thing. It was more puzzle and walking down hallways (Spoiler Alert) than shooting zombies in the damn face. There were only about two real gun scenes. Yes, I like exploration but if your not going to put much in it than at LEAST substitute it with shooting things. It wasent even real puzzles, it was lift this crate put it here take this thing throw it over there. I even found the (Spoiler Alert) easter egg of that tv watching zombie without even trying.So, why you may ask, am I reccomending it? Because it is free, and not only that but i think the developers can turn it around. This is act one of maybe many acts and im hoping very, very much that the developers can improve on this idea. Cliche, yes, but fun and it did have some jump scares. With that said I wish the developers best of luck and i will continue to download (maybe buy if you put a price on it) each act of this game.

												♥♥♥♥in awesome best game mod extension ever. Me and my friend have just been playing episode 1 and we met someone ...... special. A cinderblock named Bernard, he was jovial at first, but unfortunately his condition, both mental and physical deteriorated when he sustained heavy injury. He developed suicidal tendancies and then began becoming malicious and violent. Eventually, he was just a liability. We beat him to keep his condition critical so that he could cause us no harm. Once we found a suitable location in the sewers, ...... we killed him. It only took seconds for his face to disappear into the deep, water. We never saw him again. We developed immense guilt and tried to make another relationship with a bucket named Gurtrude. It ended in seconds when a door was locked and i struck Gurtrude so hard against the wall that she never woke up. Toiling with different emotions me and my friend decided to adopt another cinderblock named Bernard Mark 23. It turns out he was Bernards 23rd son and he kept asking about his dad. We can't bring ourselfs or let ourselves tell him that his father was dead, and we killed him. The adventure continues...			"

												Enstranged is a fantastic mod, and I highly recommend it to anyone into adventure games.The atmosphere is constantly changing, but never fails to interest you, creep you out, or get you pumped for the next encounter.The voice acting is great, and could hardly be improved whatsoever.The difficulty is challenging, but the enemies do not overcrowd you. This makes for a less action-filled game, but reduces the need to be shooting 24/7 and in my opinion, suits the style of the game very well.The graphics are just like HL2, only with some fancier effects. These are really appealing.The physics are great, as in any source-based game.Overall, I'd say the game is worthy of a 9/10, with it's main flaw being that it is a short game!At the extremely low price of $0.00 and a small download size, I'd argue that there's no excuse not to give this mod a try.

												If you are looking for a horror game that doesn't always use the typical methods, (predictable jump scares, loud music, hordes of creatures) is a decnt length for an episodic game, has a very interesting and enthralling story and has made great use of the tools it was given in the Half Life 2 engine then Estranged Act I is something you should definately try out. As a free to play, you have nothing to lose.GAMEPLAYAs I said the game uses the Half Life 2 engine so nothing has really changed from movement, interaction or combat. There are a couple nice additions though such as interactable computers and the fact you are only allowed to carry one weapon at a time which gives it a nice realistic and survivalist feel. While not having a lot of combat, the horror is mostly made up of what you expect to happen but doesn't. I was yellnig at the game in my mind, ""God damnit, just do what you're gonna do and get it over with already!"" It's a very effective way to enduce fear as I found myself searching round corners a lot more than I usually would, your torch runs on dying batteries so I only used it for a couple seconds if I had to and I was reluctant to go into dark area's without preparing myself first. (I resisted the urge to turn on my television for noise in the background while I played. :) )SOUNDA completely original soundtrack was used on this game and it stands out as a very eerie and unsettling score to represent how the character is feeling. There isn't really an ongoing ambient track and specific music only plays at certain parts.But when the music isn't playing youre usually in silence which is extremely daunting as every noise can set you off. With only the gentle breeze passing by me and the chirping of the early morning birds, I found myself jumping everytime I accidentaly knocked over something on more than one occasion. Either just because it was loud enough to make me jump or I was worried that it would attract the ""Yellow eyes."" The team behind it has also employed their own voice actors to add a lot of original dialogue to the game to make it feel like a true standalone game. There are no re-used material of any of the Half Life or Source games, it's all them and they do an amazing job of it.LOOKStunning graphics on an aging engine, they have made the game look miles better with their take on lighting. It's hard to explain exactly but the lighting makes the game feel so realistic. You walk under a streetlight and its bright all around you, but when you walk away it isn't just sudden;y darker, it gets darker gradually. That is the same with entering and exiting buildings, turning on lights or lights from computers and lamps etc.STORY (MINOR SPOLIERS!)The story is a very interesting one. You are a lone fisherman who's boat has just crashed onto a mysterious island which seems deserted... at first. Upon meeting a guy who lost his wife and daughter somewhere three months ago, you see him shoot a yellow eyed man in cold blood. When you set off on your own to find a way to exit the island you come across more of these monsters, strange communication arrays and an equally mysterious company known as Arque.(MINOR SPOILERS END)This is definately a game you do not want to miss. Hopefully soon they will bring out an Estranged Act II as there are many questions I need answers to. :)			"

												Going into Estranged: Act 1, I was expecting some kind of Dear Esther-ish experience - that feeling of exploration, perhaps with a few token puzzles.  I got the token puzzles, but definitely not any sense of exploration.The puzzles were as token as can be, if you've played Half-Life 2 onwards (which I assume you have if you're playing this mod) then you've solved all these puzzles before.  In Estranged we experienced, to name but a few ""stop the giant fan from spinning!"", ""unplug/plug the electrical thingy!"", ""get to the other side of this electrified body of water by creating a bridge somehow!"", ""turn off the valve!"", ""stack the boxes!"" and ""brick through window"".  I don't remember any real twists to the puzzles just carbon copies of what we've solved before in HL2 and many other mods.I don't really think ""explore"" is a word I would associate with this game, maybe ""travel"", you travel down the narrow corridors of levels, sometimes passing something and thinking ""oh that looks cool"" (like first seeing the hula doll's shadow, 5th screenshot on store page) but never never really exploring, looking for things, small details and even if you did you wouldn't find many.  Countless times I was enticed by a warm, glowing room expecting to find something of use, or at least something interesting unfortunately what I found 90% of the time was a room full of boxes or pallettes or barrels, don't bother looking behind them.  There's probably nothing there.After the first character you meet the voice acting is very good (sorry first guy!), in fact sound is something that the game gets right, the soundtrack is very fitting to the game's atmosphere and never feels out of place (available  here [anicator.bandcamp.com]).I'm sure you've seen the word ""atmospheric"" mentioned in all of these reviews, and they're right, it is atmospheric.  The lighting was the main thing that I felt made it so.  From the shadow of a zombie on the wall keeping you on your toes to the cold, blue flourescent tubes of the treatment plant gently but clinically reminding you of where you are.  Not as atmospheric as playing Dear Esther in a cave on the Outer Hebrides whilst a posh man reads random pages of letters and diary entries into your ear, but, you know, good enough.Anyway, I'm done rambling, basically don't go into this expecting anything different or original, it's all been done before.  What Estranged is, is a solidly made FREE mod that takes up an hour of your time, why not just give it a try?  If you don't enjoy it you haven't exactly invested much and if you do, I assume that there's more on the way! "

												An odd one to say the least. A mod with an attention to detail that matches any ""real"" game. It's a fairly bland story, but the level design is simply superb. Even rivaling the game this is a mod of. It looks beautiful, which is odd as it is a mod of Half-Life 2 which even with the updated texture packs still shows its age. This mod on the other hand gives a fairly large overhaul (enough to distract me from the thought that it is a mod) and a nice lighting feel that really left me empressed.However the biggest downfall of this mod is the ending is very displeasing. I can't crituiqe more with out spoiling it, and I presume that the suprise of it was the design desision behind it, but even still it was a fairly lack luster ending even for a mod. That being said however I am a man who believes the journey is what is important not the destinaton. In which case this mod is a must play for anyone who owns Half Life 2. You will not regret it, feeling emotions from fear, despair, suspision and relief. All pulled off amazingly.In conclusion, play this mod. 9/10 would play again.			"

												Estranged : Act I is a really great cinematographic-like experience with wonderfull visuals and a nice sound atmosphere. By delivering a solid survival/action moment and a lot of mystery, this Half-Life² mod can bring some new adventures with the great source engine. I wrote ""can"" because as it still in development you'll able to play only to the act one. So we've to be patient and greelight this stuff as we liked it.Of course, it's not perfect  :It's about 1hour of gameplay, it's kind of short. I can also regret the choice made for the equipment, i'd love to have more than one weapon on myself on this island. For the enemies we only had four/five models of ""infected"" and the AI have to be more worked.But i can easily forget what i wrote before because this graphic render is really really HUGE. Textures are beautifull and the ambiant occlusion work very well. I think that some details miss, but as it's the source engine i'm impressed. The artistic direction is very cool too, especially the music direction, perfect fit with the screen and well produced.So, if you are an HL player or a mystery movie fan, you should try this, you'll not be disappointed !

												Wow! I really gotta say, when I started this game I thought to myself ""Self, this will probably not be too substantial, but you should take a look at it, since it seems to have some work put into it; and since when do you pass on free games?"" Well I didn't know anything about this game when I started and boy, was I surprised.I did NOT expect a single thing that was to come. The level design is innovative, though a bit linear at times. But the little tidbits that are worked into the game are awesome, the puzzles, if you want to call them that, are awesome and this game, is simply awesome.It is SO nice to see a game use the Source game engine to it's fullest and there is literally nothing more you should know, but it is so awesome I don't want to stop writing until you are completely convinced to download and play it (hey, it's free)! :D "

												It's a good game to go on a Quest and all that, but the game has good decent Values. The ending was o'k but not as I was expecting. I hope this is not the end of the game I do know that there could be a 2nd one but that depends. The game was like a Half-Life 2 Double a little bit the game was short enough that I played this game a hole day. It was fun and awesome, I just there would be a 2nd one with a good ending. But I no want a cheesy or corny ending it just ruins it a little bit on the game. Well it is a good Quest game it was like Half-Life 2 and I enjoyed it, I didn't mine Estranged that much. I hope the Journey still goes on I hope. I know that Valve still has it's classics, but I know that Graphics don't matter in games but depends. But I just think that Valve's Engine hasn't change for years but whatever it's still a enjoyable game.			"

												In my opinion Estranged is really good and worth trying, why?Let's take a look at the gameplay at first, there are similaritys to the Half Life series (which I think is the best singleplayer fps) like the puzzle parts, the level design and the enemies (how often they appear and so on). Now let's take a look at the atmosphere which is created like in Half Life by barely telling a story and giving informations in very little pieces you have to find. The graphics are quite good, not like Battlefield 4 or Crysis 3 but considdering the hardware requirements it's the best you can get I think. Last but not least this game shows the Source Engine is still able to provide really good gameplay an graphics.To put it in a nutshell this Game/Mod really shows potetial and I can't wait for the next part.Ps: I didn't mention the story because I think it's to early to talk about, but let me say I have quite a good feeling about it.

												The zombies were I think were a good idea, but a bit cliche, and they took more away from the game than they added. During intense parts of the game I was thinking that something was going to jump out at me, which never happend. I hope Act 2 changes that, but I still like the game no matter if they change it or not.On a positive note, the story is very mysterious, and I like games like that. It also had a great atmosphere through out the game, and the levels felt realistic. I cannot wait for Act 2 to come out! This is a must play game!			"

												Decent, as far as mods go, but nothing that's going to rock your world. Reasonable atmosphere, competent if unremarkable storyline, and the developers are more than capable of levering Half-Life 2's gameplay mechanics to provide an enjoyable experience.Will last you about 3 hours tops, and it's free. Worth a shot.			"

												Really good level design. Really really reminiscent of Half Life 2 in term of level design (environment / puzzles) and global pacing / storytelling. The only things that prevent me from actually saying it's a good mod is the fact that it lacks something. Polishing in terms of animations, perhaps a bit more story polishing would have been better (such as reactions of the NPCs to the player, story wise (I'm thinking about the first meeting)), and a bit less of action was needed. The thing is you really feel all powerful, so the foes don't scare you as much as they should, in my opinion! Waiting for the Act2, and hoping the devs see my review and think about that. Estranged, is actually a HL² worship mod that could turn into much, much more.			"

												Enstranged is a fantastic mod, and I highly recommend it to anyone into adventure games.The atmosphere is constantly changing, but never fails to interest you, creep you out, or get you pumped for the next encounter.The voice acting is great, and could hardly be improved whatsoever.The difficulty is challenging, but the enemies do not overcrowd you. This makes for a less action-filled game, but reduces the need to be shooting 24/7 and in my opinion, suits the style of the game very well.The graphics are just like HL2, only with some fancier effects. These are really appealing.The physics are great, as in any source-based game.Overall, I'd say the game is worthy of a 9/10, with it's main flaw being that it is a short game!At the extremely low price of $0.00 and a small download size, I'd argue that there's no excuse not to give this mod a try.

												When I first heard of this game coming out, I was extremely excited. I knew there would be mystery, puzzles and was very eager to download this free game. I got even more excited (Spoiler Alert)  when I learned it was about an island overrun by zombies. Yes, i do love my zombies. Here are my thoughts on this game:The story, I dare say is a teensie bit cliche. It is formatted like some other ones that i have heard and played. The beggining had me very intrigued, and I was excited to continue playing to better understand this mysterious story.Yet, as I went on, it was the same old thing. It was more puzzle and walking down hallways (Spoiler Alert) than shooting zombies in the damn face. There were only about two real gun scenes. Yes, I like exploration but if your not going to put much in it than at LEAST substitute it with shooting things. It wasent even real puzzles, it was lift this crate put it here take this thing throw it over there. I even found the (Spoiler Alert) easter egg of that tv watching zombie without even trying.So, why you may ask, am I reccomending it? Because it is free, and not only that but i think the developers can turn it around. This is act one of maybe many acts and im hoping very, very much that the developers can improve on this idea. Cliche, yes, but fun and it did have some jump scares. With that said I wish the developers best of luck and i will continue to download (maybe buy if you put a price on it) each act of this game.

												Tried it cause I was bored, and was supremely surprised by how good it was. Fluid gameplay, and found no bugs/glitches in it at all. You can tell the creator(s) took the time to truly make this game; the areas in the game are very realistic and beleiveable. The story is intresting enough and it keeps you wondering what had and is happening to this desolate island and it's poor inhabitants. Try it out, I totally recommend it!			"

												When I first went into this mod, I wasn't sure what to expect. I should have expected a great adventure...Estranged Act 1 is one of the finest HF2 mods I've played in a whileThe setting felt real; obviously one of the mods high points is it's atmosphereEverything on the map had a purpose, whether it be lighting, scenery, or something trying to kill you...The music and general audio authoring is top-notch, adding emphasis or background depending on what was happening...In some of the previous mods I've played, the voice acting lacked out of sheer inexperienceEstranged had voice acting that seemed to be coming right out of the NPC...Finally, the storyline had it's unexpected turn of events - a couple of them were predictable, but still had me at the edge of my seat...Now even though this game is a phenomenal achievement of their development team, it is not without its bugs.There were some parts where the video was a bit choppy. The other thing I noticed is that when you had the ""Highlight important items"" option on, you could sometimes see the items through cabinet or locker doors.Putting those two things aside, this HF2 mod kept me wanting more, and will definitely be anticipating Act 2My Rating: 8.5/10			"

[STORY]   First off the story is really good little bit clicheish but still good. its about a fisherman who gets stuck on a island and is trying to survive you fight zombies and later on armys.                                                                                                                               [ATMOSPHERE] Feels alot like Bioshock  Mirrors edge and Half life [witch are my favorite shooters of all time] and lots of easter eggs.                                                                                                                                                                                               [GAMEPLAY] Pretty much half life 2 it has puzzles that are  hard but not too hard   and the shooting is half life 2 becuse its a mod for half life 2                                                                                                                                                                                [OVERALL] Great story  fun gameplay  and free i give this game a  8/10    cant wait for act 2 "

												Apparently you can hold only 1 weapon at a time....apart from that a quality mod that has solid atmosphere and all around polish. Some maps might seem a bit simplistic while others are really pretty to look at.It plays like a good old shooter. By that I mean that it is just a linear shooter with a story. No gimmicks and no pretense. I dig that.Recommended.			"

												Wow! I really gotta say, when I started this game I thought to myself ""Self, this will probably not be too substantial, but you should take a look at it, since it seems to have some work put into it; and since when do you pass on free games?"" Well I didn't know anything about this game when I started and boy, was I surprised.I did NOT expect a single thing that was to come. The level design is innovative, though a bit linear at times. But the little tidbits that are worked into the game are awesome, the puzzles, if you want to call them that, are awesome and this game, is simply awesome.It is SO nice to see a game use the Source game engine to it's fullest and there is literally nothing more you should know, but it is so awesome I don't want to stop writing until you are completely convinced to download and play it (hey, it's free)! :D "

												The simple fact is, I have only ever played one mod that could possibly be better than this, and it lasts much longer and is the famed Black Mesa Mod. To have the privlige of playing this, it's just simply superb. I am definitely a fan now, and the ending of Act 1 is perfect, just like HL2 and just like what a proper survival fps is supposed to be like. I want everyone to know that I will be more than happy to see further development, Steam picked a big winner here!			"

												It's a good game to go on a Quest and all that, but the game has good decent Values. The ending was o'k but not as I was expecting. I hope this is not the end of the game I do know that there could be a 2nd one but that depends. The game was like a Half-Life 2 Double a little bit the game was short enough that I played this game a hole day. It was fun and awesome, I just there would be a 2nd one with a good ending. But I no want a cheesy or corny ending it just ruins it a little bit on the game. Well it is a good Quest game it was like Half-Life 2 and I enjoyed it, I didn't mine Estranged that much. I hope the Journey still goes on I hope. I know that Valve still has it's classics, but I know that Graphics don't matter in games but depends. But I just think that Valve's Engine hasn't change for years but whatever it's still a enjoyable game.			"

												You can play this game for free, and it will only take two or three hours of your time.In many ways, it feels like a love letter to Valve games, but does enough original things to have its own identity. The design of the environments and atmosphere will leave you constantly looking out for something and checking behind you. The artificial scarcity of health and ammo plays into this as well. There is no difficulty selection as far as I could see, but the more resources you end up needing, the more you will find along the way. It keeps the flow of the gameplay going smoothly without making the player feel like there's too much going in their favor for there to be any real danger, which is something I think this mod does better than Half-Life 2, which threw health and ammo at you like confetti. Only give this game a pass for now if you're allergic to cliffhangers, because this mod does end rather abruptly, with absolutely no clues as to where it could go from here. Act II is only in development right now, but what's in Act I is solid and worth checking out.			"

Clearly, it is crawling with zombies and he does not need it anymore, could have been done better, but overall a great game. Looking towards for act 2It is worth the download "

												Really good level design. Really really reminiscent of Half Life 2 in term of level design (environment / puzzles) and global pacing / storytelling. The only things that prevent me from actually saying it's a good mod is the fact that it lacks something. Polishing in terms of animations, perhaps a bit more story polishing would have been better (such as reactions of the NPCs to the player, story wise (I'm thinking about the first meeting)), and a bit less of action was needed. The thing is you really feel all powerful, so the foes don't scare you as much as they should, in my opinion! Waiting for the Act2, and hoping the devs see my review and think about that. Estranged, is actually a HL² worship mod that could turn into much, much more.			"

												When I first heard of this game coming out, I was extremely excited. I knew there would be mystery, puzzles and was very eager to download this free game. I got even more excited (Spoiler Alert)  when I learned it was about an island overrun by zombies. Yes, i do love my zombies. Here are my thoughts on this game:The story, I dare say is a teensie bit cliche. It is formatted like some other ones that i have heard and played. The beggining had me very intrigued, and I was excited to continue playing to better understand this mysterious story.Yet, as I went on, it was the same old thing. It was more puzzle and walking down hallways (Spoiler Alert) than shooting zombies in the damn face. There were only about two real gun scenes. Yes, I like exploration but if your not going to put much in it than at LEAST substitute it with shooting things. It wasent even real puzzles, it was lift this crate put it here take this thing throw it over there. I even found the (Spoiler Alert) easter egg of that tv watching zombie without even trying.So, why you may ask, am I reccomending it? Because it is free, and not only that but i think the developers can turn it around. This is act one of maybe many acts and im hoping very, very much that the developers can improve on this idea. Cliche, yes, but fun and it did have some jump scares. With that said I wish the developers best of luck and i will continue to download (maybe buy if you put a price on it) each act of this game.

												Estranged is a great Source mod and shows that even in 2014, Source is alive and kicking. While the graphics may not be next-gen, the atmosphere is perfect. Estranged follows the journey of a fisherman who is marooned on an island infested with zombies (?), presumably left over after a science experiment gone wrong. While the story may be a little cliche, the gameplay is smooth and entertaining. Lighting and sound are used to great effect in this mod. The story is short (around 2 hours), but it's engaging and doesn't feel like a chore to finish. Eager to see what happens in Act 2.			"

												After following the mod for a long time, I expected a TON from this, sadly it didn't deliver, don't get me wrong, it's really well made, has great voice acting and is heavily inspired by Half Life 2, but unfortunately that's where it begins to suffer. The story has premise and potential, but the general lack of inspiration, ambient music and just atmosphere makes the game feel like a lackluster HL2 mod, this isn't helped by the stock HL2 animations, textures, sounds and even entire weapon models. For the most part this follows the basic HL2 structure, fight>puzzle>fight>story etc.  Throw in mediocre combat, easy puzzles and a slow moving plot, you find yourself bored for most of the experience. But this is a step in the right direction for the developer, the mod is VERY well made, the map design is excellent and shines quality, I feel it's simply the lack of polish that hurts the experience more than anything, throw in some nice models, nice animations and some more ambience, you will have an excellent game on your hands, for a ""MOD"" this is a fairly good experience, but for a ""GAME"" I feel it falls short on too many levels, As a full paid game, I wouldn't recommend this, but as a FREE mod? Yeah, try it, your experience may differ to mine.			"

A shooter with only the SMG from HL2, not even retextured and the most rushed together looking last map. The good stuff...Graphicly looks great for a HL2 mod (till the last part). A lot of lamps, a lot of extra effects and a lot of good textures, some of the highest res textures I've seen on the engine. 7/10			"

												Estranged doesn't really feel like a Half-Life 2 mod. It feels like its own standalone game. If you own Half-Life 2, definitely download this. It is free. It is worth your time.If you don't have Half-Life 2, what the hell are you doing with your life? GO GET IT.Anyway, this is a great game. No, I am calling it a game. Technically, yes it is a mod, but it's also not. It almost completely converts the original Half-Life 2. The only noticable traces are one weapon model and a few recycled character models. The atmosphere is very, very nice and the improvement on the Source engine's graphics help add to the feel the developers were attempting to create.There aren't many complaints I have for this game. Sometimes it's a bit difficult to tell what you're supposed to do. Like at the end, I couldn't find the exit (although that may just be my blondeness) for about ten minutes. And there was this other part near the beginning of the game where there was a dark room with a train, I had to google what to do on that part.Other than that, I did really enjoy it. Fun to play, great experience, must download.I would give the developer(s) money for this. Well, I wouldn't because I'm on a budget. But if I had the money and I knew what this was, then I would pay for it if I had to, yes.			"

												Great! It may seem like a horror game but its not in the way you would think. Its not jumpscares that make things scary but,    the eerie feeling it gives you is what makes it scary. The environment is what makes it scary. That feeling to me is what a true horror game is for me. I just can't wait for ""Estranged Act II!""			"

												This short mod using the source engine is a lot of fun. It take about an hour to and hour and a half to complete, but I enjoyed it the entire time. The story is engaging and I am intereseted to see where it goes in the folling acts. It is a free game so I do not see a reason not to try it out. The gun play is solid and the puzzles are challenging but not overly difficuly. I highly recommend this game.			"

												This game, in my opinion, is a definite 5/5 stars.The atmosphere of the game in general was very eerie, which I absolutely love in horror games. Even as it progressed, it seemed to become more of an adventure game than a horror game. But as I played, I never forgot that I was on a near-deserted island filled with zombies and other hostilities that seem to scare me.The game takes you through a few terrains and such things as that, that never leave the game map in a boring way to think about it. I absolutely loved traveling the island and seeing the sights.I loved the way they scripted the weapons and physics. So you had to use logic when breaking glass, or the damage being realistic. It brought a challenge to me as I played. It kept me wanting to beat it, and I never lost focus.I think the only problem I noticed in the game was minor. When the zombies died, their arms kinda morphed into the rest of the body. But that's about all.I absolutely love this game, and I look forward to playing it again.I don't care how much the sequel costs...I don't care how much the download size is...I don't care how long it takes for it to be realeased...I WILL PLAY IT.

												Firstly,I can't belive how good this game is and secondly,that It's free! I got 40 minutes in and then had to go to work. Trust me,If I didn't have to stop playing it,I wouldn't have. I haven't played a game in ages that has captivated me quite like Estranged did,and have just been waiting for one to come along. It's left me feeling like I just have to leave a review for it.Upon having a look at it and at the beginning of first playing it,I thought I had a pretty good idea of what It was going to be like and what to expect,but I was completely wrong! You never really know where you're about to go/what's about to happen next,and with so many different types of locations and environments (on the coast,in a railway yard/line,warehouses,sewers,office buildings etc.) It keeps the game fresh and interesting. At one point I thought I was in Mirrors Edge haha,those who have played it will get what I mean. It feeds strongly on the emotion of curiosity leaving you wanting more!  The graphics start off very typical of a HL mod,but slowly get more and more beautiful throughout the game with the final result being absolutely brilliant. I felt as though this slow build up was done deliberately and is extremely noticeable as at first you may be a bit dissapointed,but hang in there! The majority of colours,textures and lighting are stunning and get better and better as the game progresses.Gameplay is HL typical,but awesome and familiar. It ranges from solving mini-puzzles of the surrounding objects to use of weapons like a hammer,pistol and machine gun to break things and take out enemies. You have control over some PC's (with a good bit of humour thrown in) and also a massive crane. Also,HL based games always make throwing stuff around so much fun!I could very easily rant on about this for ages,but It's really something you have try for yourself to completely understand how unique and good it is. The fact that It's free and a small download size leaves you with no excuses. I would easily have paid money for this,play it now!!!			"

Introduction : Estranged is built on the same engine Half-Life 2 runs, with some additional features.(+)Graphics : Graphics are absolutely beautiful . This game has the best graphics i've ever seen in a Source game .(+)Soundtrack :  Soundtracks are perfectly made . Especially the main theme , If only there was a 10 hours loop version of it ...(+)Story :  Story is fascinating and completely unique . If only it was longer , than it'd be perfect .(+)Content :  The content is not much since it can be finished in a few hours . But still , It's worth it !(+)Gameplay :  Gameplay is very realistic. No unbelievable amounts of ammos , No endless amount of flashlights and hours of fun !This game is definetely worth your time , if only it was longer . Oh well , I guess we'll just wait for Act 28/10 -   Triskelion Turbella Reviews   "

Pros:- Great picture of surrounding area- Great voice acting- Great level design- Great music- Great atmosphere- Just... Great.Cons:- Too damn short (Only 3 chapters)- Narrative is pretty average (You'll understand what I mean when you'll play)------Conclusion: 11/10 "

												Kui teile meeldivad apokalüpsise taolised mängud, siis soovitan seda. Oled sattunud saarele, kus tehti mingeid bioloogilisi teste ja kõik läks nägu alati - nihu. Tekkis mingi viirus ja nakatunud käituvad nagu zombid. Act I pikkuseks oli kuskil 2 tundi, ootan põnevusega jätku, lõpp oli vägagi ettearvamatu ja paneb uut osa ootama. Veel meeldis survival osa, et pead kuule kokku hoidma, patareisi taskulambile otsima jne - lisas pinget.

												Free achievements have brought me to another interesting title.  A Half Life mod that brings suspicion and paranoia to your doorstep.For the squeemish, the ""Horror"" will lie in paranoia and zombies (bleach-skinned men with yellow eyes).  The environment is dark and creepy, but if you manage your pistol and hammer well, your fears will be short-lived.  Once you get the minigun and fight living humans, then the horror will be over.I would say this game had 3 arcs.  The forest arc, the sewers arc, and the lab-escape arc.  Just a few hours in and it's all over.PROS:+ Nice presentation+ Great use of suspense+ Ambient noises keep you on edge+ Easy achievements+ FreeCONS:- There are areas where you expect something to happen, only to find that it's a safe area and that your guard was up for no reason- Story feels negligible at best- Some physics may be faulty (Entering a vent with some garbage in the way can screw up the physics)- Lack of a sequel after at least 2 yearsOverall, despite the cold feeling of paranoia washing over me (along with being in a freezing room), I felt it was a pretty solid experience.  A short and easy 100% for achievement hunters.  My only complaint is that sometimes it feels empty when you don't really have anything to kill.  It's a shame to see a sequel hasn't been released yet, but with the story not feeling negligible, then I'm probably not missing much.8/10  A nice addition to Steam.			"

												Estranged is a well made Half-Life 2 Mod not that it is part of Half-Life 2 it just uses Source.  It is voice acted and scored which creates a tense atmosphere.  The zombies all look like Star Trek people which made me laugh.  If you can download this I think its worth a play.			"

												Estranged: Act 1 is a quite unique mod! Once you are pitted into the game with nothing but a destroyed boat, you are quick to know that you must survive. But against what, you ask. Against what is left of the entire island! Zombies, Rebels, and the means of finding ammunition and health! You must act smart, or die stupid. Featuring HBAO and DoF, this game puts the Source Engine at it's most powerful and provides you with an extremely HD quality experience with an awesome storyline and immersive gameplay. From start to end, you will be attached to the game, using your wits to survive the island, and learn its mystery! All for FREE! The game, ""Estranged: Act I"" is better than a lot of AAA titles out there! It is a professionally made mod! No laziness here! Explore the island, find supplies, evade zombie attacks, survive the survivors, solve the mystery. Become Estranged.			"

												Kudos to Alan Edwardes for producing a great little mod that’s both polished and enjoyable. The source engine has been used well to create a good-looking game that ran without a glitch except for one problem with an achievement which I managed to fix but was a little annoying. The voice acting is pretty good. The mix of simple problem solving and combat is just right, giving the game a nice balanced feel. Overall this is a fun way to spend a few hours and it’s free, so what more could you want? 4.5/5			"

To me it was the best one made , & he wen to work at Steam . He did not have the tools we have tools now like we have now , he had to write in code . . I have been watching how games have delvoped and how the software has come out to make games  easer to make , As I look back at games ,& how Pong got got here , I have been a round computers  sence 1969 , The tools are on Steam , & are great tools to get ,plus  get a buget software from Gabe and you might make  a game like Estranged: Act 1 and you might get  noticed like the person did  in this game , You will notice that the person falled the right producal with the right permision , all the places to put the who & what & where the game peaces came to gather , A good examplu on how to put pices togather . look at the white boards & you can see .

												As all Half-Life 2 modifications stand out, this one seems to do so as well, but better. Although the plot is another generic zombie type story, it somehow manages to have a certain charm that leaves you wanting more. The gameplay itself is very simple, yet fun, with few puzzles to figure out. Non too difficult achievements, good gameplay, an ok story, and the fact that it's free, makes this a good game to give a try.			"

												Something short and sweet.I saw a lot of my friends play this, and I was like ""What is Estranged?"" They said ""it's a game. A mod for HL2 or something.""So I checked it out. I felt like the game was nice. The level design was pretty interesting at first, yet having it's boring bland to it, especially if you have a flashlight. I did have some trouble here and there with the game, but at certain parts I felt like there needed to be a little more design here and there. Hell, even if it's just the first act, I'll be waiting to play the next one. I also felt like the ammo was scarce in the beginning. Not that it matters, but still.Estranged: Act I really brought my attention to an adventure, soaring through a set of new levels. While the entire game is still in development, I would still love to see more of this.			"

												Estranged is a shooter made in the source engine and was a Half Life mod but now that its fully realeased is it worth it to play through. In the game you play as a lone fisherman and one stormy night your boat crashes on a deserted island which you find out is filled by zombies. So its up to you to find a way off the island. Estranged is a shooter and if you played Half Life its pretty simmilar. The shooting mechanics work great its pretty fun and plus its Absolutly FREE. With this kinda deal you really cant go wrong. Its a fun game, great story and creepy atmosphere. Now there are some minor issues with this title. The biggest one is the stupid puzzles. The game has you finding items to complete puzzles. Some items are scattered through the enviroments and theyre so small its really easy to miss them.Overall a really fun shooting game with a great atmosphere and a great story and plus its free you cant go wrong. I give Estranged Act 1 a 7/10			"

												Generally fun. 8/10Pros:-Good graphics with some advance graphical settings-Great scenery-Easter egg: that video of cat-It has a good opening-F2P-Which is the most important partCons:-Deja vu of these NPCs and human enemies-The pace of game is not well adjusted, first you are dealing with a slow and dumb zombie(?), seconds later, you must deal with a group of armed enemies shooting at you(and it hurts). And there is not enough health packs.-Lack of variation of weapons, only three appear in Act I- Pistol, hammer and SMG (which looks exactly the same model in HL2)-Lack of BGM, not enough enemies\puzzles-The scene is either too dark or too bright. The atmospehere is not scary or tense, it's just so so- bascially not interesting-How on earth can a fisherman be so calm after seeing a guy shooting another one without knowing what the hell is going on...That reminds me of Freeman.

												Estranged Act 1 is surprisingly good considering it is a comunity built game with no commercial backing, done for fun.If you are expecting a Tripple-A grade game, you probably should look elsewhere, but keep in mind this is completely free.The atmosphere is quite good, as are many of the elements of the level layout.  The world does feel tangable and coherant, and has a lot of small details that make it more immerisve.   Little drawings and readable notes and whiteboards all make things more interesting, and make it feel like you are going through a real workplace where something went horibly wrong.   It definately leaves me wanting to know more.As of the problems:The biggest issue has to be the NPC animations.  Many of them are simply non-existant.   The zombies more stumble around, rather than stagger, and there is very little in the way of animation.In some spots the difficulty feels artificially added through making the machine gun weaker, and artificially improving the abilities of the AI to land good hits.  This is particularly so when you are assaulted in the warehouse.  Generally the AI on these tactical units is quite good.The layout of many of the levels isn't the best.  There is an excessively liniar feel to them.  The zombie placement is a little predictable and their spawning sometimes comes from nowhere.  However, that is a very common problem in many games.As of the graphics, they aren't too bad, but they aren't particularly good either.   There are definately plenty of places they could be improved, such as the detail plants, and a few textures.  However, in other spots they look better than some comercial games on the same engine.   I have to say the rocky cliff side in one spot is downright exceptional.  The real disappointment is the lack of consistancy			"

Recently found this back on steam and fell right in love. It was gorgeous, i actually found myself complimenting the hallways and computer screens around me. Not to mention functioning computers, something ive only seen in another half life 2 mod : UNDERHELL. (Also a steller mod highly reccomended) The zombies are great, the weapon is great (The pistol was cool, BUT the smg is stock from Hl2....sorry got to deduct some points) As far as amazing mods go, i would definatly put it on par with Nightmare House 2 and Underhell. All 3 are amazing works of art.			"

												I'm on the fence with this one.I'm putting ""Do Not Recommend"" only to highlight the fact that I didn't enjoy it, not that I recommend you stay away from it.  It's free, after all - it's not like you're paying money to try it, in which case, ""Do Not Recommend"" would probably keep you away.Take the gushy reviews with a grain of salt on this one.  I'm seriously hoping that the developers have something better up their sleeve for the next couple of parts.  A few things: for the most part, it is not scary.  Not once did the ""zombies"" frighten me at all - the only really chilling part of this game was the soundtrack (which was very well done).  The atmosphere is well done, and they did an incredibly good job with the lighting.  I liked the general gist of the story, except for the fact that it's yet another source-engine zombie mod.  Guys, you don't need zombies to make a game scary.  The original F.E.A.R creeped me out more than this game (or any other zombie game, for that matter), and for the most part, you were just fighting AI soldiers.  All you need is atmosphere, atmosphere, atmosphere: and with the amazing soundtrack in this game and the graphical capabilities, that can definitely be achieved. Speaking of graphics, here's where I found another issuse: a lot of inconsistency.  The lighting is fantastic, as are what appear to be custom textures, but they clash heavily with the HL-2 assets.  There's a custom pistol model, yet the SMG from HL-2.  The interior of the Arque facilities reminded me of Mirror's Edge (in a very good way), and in minutes, you were stepping back into 2004.  If you want to stick with HL-2 assets only, that's fine.  If you want to use custom assets, also fine.  But swapping back and forth between the two of them made me wince - as did the Kleiner and guard models.It's also linear as hell, but the levels are large, and designed well.  The voice acting is so well done, it makes me wonder why they have a silent protagonist.   In summary, go for it - it's free to play - but be wary.  Hell, if they started charging money for it on the condition that there would be all-custom models and textures, I would probably buy in.  But at this rate, Estranged isn't the best thing out there.+ Top-notch voice acting.+ Excellent soundtrack.+ Free to play.+ Large levels.+ A couple of neat interactive sequences.+ The story is going somewhere, but...+/- Squeezes even more life out of the old Source engine, for better or worse.+/- Linear, but it balances out with the size of the levels.+/- Combat is far too repetitive and easy.  These zombies truly are brain dead.  - Zombies.- Recycled HL-2 NPC models.- Inconsistency in the graphics.- It's a sin to use the word ""puzzle"" when referring to the ""puzzles"" in this game.  They're about as complex as a lunchbox.- ...it probably could've been executed better.  The first act doesn't set up the plot very strongly, so it's a crapshoot for the next act.   "

Estranged acts as a game experience rather than just a game. Which is something you don't find that often nowadays. It is limited by Half Life 2 engine but it still delivers a lot of beautiful scenarios. There's certainly points where I think there's room for improvement. The sound could be better: there's a lot of silence, it misses some constant environment sound; the voice acting could be better.But considering the small team that brought Estranged to life and considering it's free to play there's nothing more you could ask, it's a great piece of work you should pick and play yourself!I'll leave my Let's play here if you're interested, enjoy!

												Estranged is a singleplayer mod for HL2 which is in short; quite amazing I say.The story is slightly confusing but I suppose you're not going to know everything about what's going on in the very first Act.I had a blast playing this. It has very, very fine atmosphere. The map design is incredible. I was on the edge of my seat a couple of times. But I would never call this close to a horror mod.The cons? Some will hate the 1-weapon-only option and lack of ammo/arsenal. But my biggest issue was the gunfight. I only found amusement in the very end. The rest of the game is way too easy to beat. I also think they should give a little more exploration possibilities for the next act as this one was a bit cramped at times.But in overall; Estranged is a mod that singleplayer lovers and HL2-enjoyers SHOULD try out. Disregard the negative feedbacks, they don't know what they're talking about.7.5/10			"

												Nice little game, not the best out there but still an okay 80-100 minutes game if you've nothing better to play. Also free.Combat is meh, you get the option to disable HUD (highly recommended for extra immersion) and the crosshair (pointless because you cant aim with the gun sights). Fighting zombies becomes repetitive once you killed 2 or 3, but there are better enemies further on.Level design is above par, 12/10, beautiful indoors environments, with great lightning and ambient sounds, beautiful water, if you like urban exploration this game has a big segment in which you can roam around a facility with varying levels of abandonment and no enemies, so it's just you wandering around some very well designed levels.Maps are not linear, there are siderooms and alternate paths in a lot of places that you might miss, so I guess that adds just a little replayabilityPuzzles are your typical HL2 puzzles, find a lever, put it in place and pull it and the such. It's not R&D.Story is meh, you're a boat guy and you crash on an island with a facility that let out some sort of zombie virus. The levels tell part of the story, which is nice, instead of it being 100% NPC exposition dialog.Overall a 6/10, which is good considering it's a free game you can download in a matter of minutes. Don't let the lame♥♥♥♥♥zombies in the begining put you off, it ends up being enjoyable past the first 15-20 minutes.			"

												Well, this was a small surprise. This is an original game built on the Source engine and Half-Life 2 assets. It's free to play too.You're a sailor who is having an accident with his boat, crashing on the shores of an island. The place seems abandoned, and indeed, you quickly learn that not everything is as it should be. Something has gone wrong and you'll get to trek around the place to figure out what's going on, and trying to help the people you meet.What I first noticed was how good it looks, considering it's built on what seems to be an earlier version of Source. The second thing was the atmosphere, which I think they did a very good job with. The place really feels abandoned, and it's accompanied with well-timed, atmospheric music. It seems obvious that they found a lot of inspiration from games like Half-Life 2. While using several assets from that game, they have really managed to make it their own creation.The characters you meet have been given convincing voices. The game is also sprinkled with clues and memos, including newspapers, scribbles and interactive workstations. They managed to get a little humor in there too. The game is absolutely linear, but here and there are rooms and places you can explore, even though they rarely hold anything useful, just like in real life. At times the game seems a bit stretched out though. Some parts could've been skipped without hurting the story and experience.It took me about 2 hours to finish. After finishing the game I noticed I had some achievements left, so there's a little bit of replay value there. This is just act 1, so there's more content to come, but I know nothing about it. Apparently, Occulus Rift is supported for those that have that option.I don't see any reason not to try it out, considering it's free. I think it was surprisingly good.			"

												I liked this game... but I had expected more than just pretty graphics. This game has not even scared me or made me paranoid of anything.... it's the zombie outbreak with the soldiers trying to kill you.... typical kind of thing that people would do. Also ""Jack"" in the beginning seemed like a character that I would like to hang with in the adventure,but instead they just say ""Here take my only weapon I have I dont need to live anymore"". Mostly this game feels like HL2 with the traveling places which bores me, and I don't get the thrill that other people get I guess.... Now as I continue on the combat mechanic is awful I dont feel any accuracy in my weapon also a nice aim down the sights would have been more nice than a zoom in feature... Also it's just like HL2 when it come to ""GO IN THE DOOR BEFORE ME"" mechanic which should be fixed. Now this game as I said it has lots of potential,and should reconsider their story line a bit of edit to make it seem more realistic than you wondering alone.... Cause I just want to know if they could possibly consider characters that have different models than the default HL2 dummies :p. Now I know this is a FREE 2 PLAY! game these are consideration's if they wanted to SELL the whole game. Also in this game I feel like im on an adventure than a escape mission from an island which I have to say I never feel like that in other games besides ""The Legend of Zelda"" series.			"

It's free to play too.You're a sailor who is having an accident with his boat, crashing on the shores of an island. The place seems abandoned, and indeed, you quickly learn that not everything is as it should be. Something has gone wrong and you'll get to trek around the place to figure out what's going on, and trying to help the people you meet.What I first noticed was how good it looks, considering it's built on what seems to be an earlier version of Source. The second thing was the atmosphere, which I think they did a very good job with. The place really feels abandoned, and it's accompanied with well-timed, atmospheric music. It seems obvious that they found a lot of inspiration from games like Half-Life 2. While using several assets from that game, they have really managed to make it their own creation.The characters you meet have been given convincing voices. The game is also sprinkled with clues and memos, including newspapers, scribbles and interactive workstations. They managed to get a little humor in there too. The game is absolutely linear, but here and there are rooms and places you can explore, even though they rarely hold anything useful, just like in real life. At times the game seems a bit stretched out though. Some parts could've been skipped without hurting the story and experience.It took me about 2 hours to finish. After finishing the game I noticed I had some achievements left, so there's a little bit of replay value there. This is just act 1, so there's more content to come, but I know nothing about it. Apparently, Occulus Rift is supported for those that have that option.I don't see any reason not to try it out, considering it's free. I think it was surprisingly good.			"

												This game is amazing. It blew my mind that this game was so good and FREE. So I guess america is a free country sometimes. This game is rich with story, graphics, gameplay, AI, and so much more. This game is a masterpiece 10/10.			"

												Amazing game!! Amazing use of the Source SDK, the maps look very good, with loving detail. The stroy also is very catching, I loved it from the beginning to the end. It seems the designers managed to create a good realism, but one thing related to that cought me: when you leave the train track area and go to the right, there's a train in the middle of the street blocking it. Well, it looks like this train got there from nowhere, the fences around it are intact, but this doesn't make the game any less good.I'd really have paid money if the game wasn't for free!Congratulations!! I'm looking foward for Act II.			"

												Its a free to play game.So far that only have act 1. So i assume there will be more to come if its not forgotten about and left to rot.It plays well, not really scary or suspencful, after you get the train. (It was pretty good up till you have to get off, and find out theres nothing to be scared of anymore with a gun, pocket full of ammo, and the 'zombies' can get caught up just trying to walk over a curb, starirs, or through a doorway.)It was good up till that point, but afterwards turns into another FPS shooter. No horror. No suspence. Just run and gun. I liked getting on the train, and i had hopped to be able to use it again or even often. Moving from place to place to fight off and survive the zombies while you get it moving again, then hop back on and escape the hoards.But it doesnt play out like that.The level design is pretty good. Though most people will be able to see where parts of it was cut from games like Mirrors edge, half life 2, and the other source engine games.Even then it manages to keep the level a little different, and change the puzzles and challenges up to be different from the game they copied it from.Do i recommend this game? Yes.Its not the best, and could do with some more work, but its free and makes for a good couple of hours to waste in something a little different.			"

												Great scares for the price. I'm awaiting act 2 for sure! Loved how the entire game is done first person perspective and you even need to find your path using nearby objects to break glass or unlock paths at certain sections of the game. Any time you expect to find a glitch, hidden location or added ammo - you are confronted by more runners. Not a single undead in this game walks. Be careful to stick to that main path.			"

												The gameplay is what you would expect, it's a Half-Life 2 mod so it plays like Half-Life 2. The story line is decent, but it's more of an adventure and less about character developement. Estranged is split up into different acts (example game The Walking Dead) and each act has chapters that which you can choose from. The game truly never gets boring and has about 3 to 4 hours of gameplay depending on the weapons you choose and whether you take your time or speed through it. It's a fairly easy game and you can't beat the price of free. It's worth the try, and if you don't like it, oh well. You didn't spend any money on it. If you liked it then good, you'll be excited for Act 2.			"

												A first person mix of horror elements, light half-life based environmental puzzles and functional (albeit cliche'd) story. You play as a stranded fisherman on an island where some ""secret experiments"" by a corporation has gone wrong and now there are zombies walking all over the island. Later on, you'll meet the company's cleaning crew who want to get rid of you, permanantly.Since the game is made with the Source engine it looks great and plays great too. It's a little short (maybe 1 hour experience) but it's free and this is only Act I of the whole story. Try this out it's a pretty entertaining ride while it lasts.			"

												First piece of a cake, I suppose?Quite a good beginning, the start felt like a good start for a real adventure! I liked the fact players had to think of ways how to progress to the next part instead of just opening the doors and such, unfortunately from there it felt a bit cliche at times - I couldn't help it but sometimes I felt like I am playing several different games I have played before mixed into one game - familiar environments, familiar characters, weapons and last but not least, lately a bit overused zombie genre - don't get me wrong, I am a fan of zombie stuff, I just wish to see something with deeper story than just another zombie shooting gallery, but overall I didn't feel bored playing through this Act I, I just honestly hope the overall experience will improve later - this game feels like a mixture of an adventure and a classic first person shooter, which isn't a bad idea at all when it's done well.So at this point, if I may suggest something for developers, I think it would be a good idea to focus more on an adventure part of the game and put the players deeper into the story. Make the danger higher to actually make the players realize that there actually is some danger they should be afraid of. Maybe even give the players some hazardous tasks, like to protect survivors so that they will feel more tense since it's not just their lives they need to take care of but also give the players some creative ways how to avoid or take out the enemies instead of just shooting them or smashing their heads with hammer, because too much of shooting or smashing heads with hammer can make the game feel repetitive at times and more ways how to get rid of enemies will give the players better adventure experience, also more puzzles and harder puzzles wouldn't hurt.Overall, I think this game has a good potential and so far it's done well, especially for a mod, so like I said, it's a nice start but the whole experience will depend on what is coming next and I am looking forward to play more of this game, long hours of gameplay with a deep story would be nice!

												Wonderfully crafted source engine game.The only two gripes I have are only being able to carry one weapon - I suggest they up it to two. And in a couple of areas the level design was a little amateurish - there's only so much the source engine can do, and outside areas in particular are hard to close in well without breaking off immersion, but there's a good bit of room for improvement.Now despite what I just said, the level design throughout the rest of the game was fantastic. The office areas in particular were wonderfully atmospheric. The pacing is also well done, a few action moments here and there with plenty of long breaks to build the tension up again.Combat is standard fair for a source engine game, but it doesn't take away anything from the game. In the beginning especially I was particularly ammo starved - sometimes running from enemies is the best way to go about. As far as the story - it's cliche, at least based on what we're given so far, but it's well done cliche.At the low, low price of nothing, this game is definitely worth checking out.			"

												This a beautifully created Mod, or story. Granted, its not very long, but it is very well made. The only bad thing about it would be, that a sequal hasn't been made yet :P None the less, this is a 10/10 game. My justification for this is, that it has its own personal voice actors. In many mods, the voice actors are absolutely garbage. This is not the case in this game. None the less, I recommend anyone with an hour or so to spend, to get this.			"

												Really awesome mod.I find the voice acting really great and the gameplay smooth.I play most of single player games on hard because I like challenging games but the restrictions of 1 weapon is a bit harsh in my humble opinion.I do understand that you don't want the player to wear all weapons like Freeman does with his suit, but if you ask me to wear a hand gun and an smg, I could put my hand gun in my pocket and the smg in my hands and vice versa.Maybe try to design some more customized weapons with different magazine capacity, scopes, etc...Maybe some new npc design because I find out that using Kleiner as the NPC has quite suprised me to be honest.I was looking foward to seeing new faces, new weapon types, etc... but guess it's not going to be, yet.I've been following the development of this game/mod since the beginning & I love the level design, well done on it (yeah, I'm a level designer for Source, if you're interested).The new entities incorporated (especially the lighting entities) made the game seem more realistic, and loved the lighting too.While the game looks really great, some improvements can be implemented.I'm looking forward to playing Act II & Act III.

												One of the best HL2 single player mods. Though, it is not perfect. I really liked the atmosphere and the mystery at the beginning of the game, and some of the puzzles, even if they don't really need so much brain to solve - until you get the machine gun. The pistol had a unique design, and you barely found ammo, so it was still scary and difficult at moments, to deal with enemies, but the submachine gun is the same as in HL2, so it was kinda out of place in this game, and it killed the difficulty too. Plus, there are very few enemies to have a submachine gun, and also, the dark is not so scary anymore, if you got an automated killermachine in your hands... The ending was really unexpected, and cliffhanger, so looking forward to the next act.			"

												At first, I figured this would be your run of the mill horrorcore disasterpiece - I actually was mistaken. The story-line (and mind you, I'm not really all that far into the game) seems very interesting. Feeling a little like No More Room In Hell, I was ready to be bored within minutes, but the over-all feel of the game is so much better.  I never did like how fast batteries run out in games and this one is exactly the same with that - find a battery and you have a very limited amount of time to get around and see in the dark.The sound effects are probably my favorite part - besides the background - each thing you hit with a hammer or throw something at, it really sounds realistic.  Very well done.I'm excited to continue and would love to see this game come in a bundle - free or not, I'd definitely recommend it to anyone interested in some solo-horror style games.			"

												What starts off as a really awesome spooky-atmospheric exploratory survival game quickly turns into HL-esque corridor shooter and puzzle solver with typical ""jumping on random sewer pipes, pressing random buttons, because PROGRESS."" I kind wish it stayed the former.That being said, it's really well crafted and polished for a mod with some really interesting set-pieces (like train crossing or the chair bit), so recommended for fans of Half Life or the like.

												It's free, but it's really short, the pacing is weird, and it feels like the game didn't know what it wanted to be.  There's no bravado when it comes to presentation in this game.  I'm not saying the game should be a Michael Bay movie, but there's no buildup to ANYTHING.  The first zombie you see is just inside of a bush, and he comes out screaming at you.  No tension building, just ""BLEH, a zombie!""  The mod has a very strange idea of what pace it wants to take, though.  There are sometimes long stretches of time where nothing interesting happens at all.  No interesting set pieces, no fights, nothing.  Then at the end, everything that could be considered interesting is thrown at you, all at once!There's also a very strange lack of exploration in this mod.  For something labelled as ""adventure,"" it sure didn't want me to explore.  Virtually every door I tried, except for the one to lead me further into the level, was locked.  The mod is too linear for its own good.I suppose you should still try it, because it IS free, and it does have some interesting and really pretty environments.  As long as they listen to feedback and improve episode 2, it could be a really good mod.			"

												I was literally charmed by the landscapes - never thought source engine could do that. Unfortunately that's all I feel being charmed about. The story is a mediocre attempt to build some tension around nothing. It just goes like corridors, corridors, jump here, press there...OH A ZOMBIE...corridors etc. The puzzles are so simple you may not even notice them. Yes guys, to break a window with a brick IS considered to be a puzzle in this game. The enemies are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and I also wonder why no one has even tried to script any scary zombie encounter into the game. Like come on, if they're that stupid at least try to make them appear in a scary manner. But no - they mostly just sit peacefully until you come too close.5/10 for the beautiful nature. Hopefully it will get better in ACT 2.			"

												Estranged may have been an exciting and interesting foray into a video game world a few years ago, but its archaeic puzzle designs and simplistic gameplay beg the question ""What is this doing in this generation?"" A Half-Life 2 Mod, Estranged tells the story of Fenwick the Fisherman on his journey through a spooky island community populated by ghouls and other nasties. Along the way you must solve physics puzzles including fan favorites such as the ""Put A Crate on Another Crate"" and ""Throw A Rock At The Breakable Thing"". The story and environment, while interesting, are nothing to holler about and the game itself is simple in both combat and puzzles. Many of the game's conundrums are over before they begin and the entire mod feels like someone spent an afternoon with the HL2 creation kit. That being said, the mod itself has great musical quality and the level design looks quite nice even in the post-Source age. Do these qualities save the mod, however? Unfortunately not. Even being free, the designers will have to think of some new tricks for Episodes 2 and 3, because if you've played Half-Life 2, you've already seen this mod.			"

A lone fisherman on an island where something that only comes out of fiction or a horror movie occurs. And when you first get the gun, you feel powerful, until you realize you have very limited ammo. This game can get terrifying when you are attacked from behind with out warning, that's what makes it so tense. Get this game, it's free. I HIGHLY recommend it.			"

												Estranged: Act 1 took me only about an hour and a half to complete (and I could have halved that time if I was complete s***), yet after the gameplay and (minor) exploration, and the cliffhanger-iest cliffhanger to ever hang, I find myself very excited to play the secondinstallment. Being a Half-Life mod, it plays very similarly, as you'd expect, and simply swaps the aliens with zombies and the soldiers with slightly different soldiers, the story is intriging. It seems obvious that the shady corporation with its logo plastered on every billboard, bus stop, and behind, is behind everything but I would hope the story doesn't go down that road as it seems a little cheap, and I feel a spawn of Half-Life shoudl be above that. I would also like to give the game points on using the zombies before the soldiers, since they don't shoot back, which creates a simple difficulty curve for the player. Now I'm off to Estrage: Act II, which had better not make me regret giving this one leway in the story department.			"

												The beginning is the best part of the game. It has a scary atmosphere with dark lighting that looks very nice, and fast paced combat against zombies.

												I love this game! it has a Original Gameplay and Story - The game features around an hour of story driven gameplay. It includes a completely original cast, with a carefully crafted script to bring the Estranged world to life. Amazing Graphics - Estranged is built on the same engine Half-Life 2 runs, with some additional features. We have extended the dynamic lighting system to allow us to illuminate our levels in a realistic manner, and have included effects such as film grain and lens flare to help create the atmosphere for the game. Original Soundtrack - The soundtrack was written especially for Estranged, and was designed alongside the game's levels. The music matches gameplay, and helps to bring together the atmosphere in Estranged to bring the story to life. O:			"

												It is clear that the two developers are skilled at game art and level design - Estranged is very pretty for a HL2 mod, but this game is lacking in novelty. There is nothing exciting about the story or gameplay - nothing to keep me interested. It's just another ""follow the linear path while shooting zombies"" game.I hope this mod will help them attract a larger team or get jobs in the games industry, where they can continue making beautiful environments and characters, while other people work on making the experience enjoyable.

												Estranged: Act I is a horror FPS that starts out strong and then peters out into mediocrity, a testament to its shortness.For starters, the game looks decent. There's a mix of Half-Life 2 assets and custom assets, but it's consistent enough to work well. The custom graphical effects and use of dynamic lighting are also very well-done, even if the depth of field is a little strong. The levels are well-constructed from a visual standpoint, the music is fitting, and the game doesn't rely on jumpscares to pull the fear out of you.That said, the game's mechanics are so recognizable that the horror element won't last longer than, say, 45 minutes. The zombies you fight never really felt challenging. The scare was more ""me not knowing what they're capable of,"" and it gets easy to see what they're capable of. Also, the game sometimes puts them in cheap places. I feel like enemies this simple could be much scarier if used in different ways.In addition, you also fight a few non-zombie combatants. Their AI is good, but the main danger comes from the fact that they can kill you in a few shots. Unlike Half-Life 2, you have to be careful and take cover constantly. It's a decent amount of fun, but there are really only two spots where the game plays with this concept. There's also a mandatory ""crane"" section, because that was *totally* fun in Half-Life 2.The crane bit brings me to one of my biggest complaints about Estranged: Act I: the level design I said before that the levels were well-constructed from a visual standpoint, but from a game standpoint, they're bad. The game uses the Valve trick of light and darkness to tell you where to go or what to do, but none of it makes sense in the game's world. Just random spotlights that have no reason to be there. The levels are straightforward and most of the time are just corridors with nothing happening. No chance for implied stories or combat or navigation. The levels aren't compact, practical, or even useful, in some cases. It feels so disjointed. I felt like there was never a reason for most of this environment to exist, and it killed the immersion for me. I haven't seen level design this impractical since the original Half-Life.Then there's the issue of length. The game is VERY short. It's free, yes, but that's no excuse for breaking it up into tiny segments like this. There's no story development, none of the characters are even remotely interesting, the player character is even more of a blank slate than types like Gordon Freeman and Link, and the pacing is nonexistent. I don't care if this is an episodic game, you still have to take me somewhere that isn't another shooting gallery. Telltale and Valve have both proven that it's possible to make episodic games with pacing just as good as their full-length big brothers. When the game ends, it just kind of...ends. There's no climax or falling action. It's just ""Welp, you're done! See you later!""I wouldn't be so upset with this if it weren't for the fact that this game shows potential. It looks and controls great, and I was genuinely scared in the beginning as I crept forward, anxiouslyt waiting for something to pop out that never came. It's just that the game lets its guard down so quickly and devolves into the same routine. It's too recognizable, the level design is unrealistic, and it's over before you know it. Hopefully Act II can fix these mistakes. I would be surprised if it did.			"

												I thought this game held many promises. An interesting plot of how you wake up on a mysterious island after your fishing boat crashed. It told of how you would unwravel the mystery about the mysterious island you are traversing (Which is quite linear, but I don't mind.), and how it said that you would interact with many colorful character. Everything I expected and what I read was a lie. Estranged: Act One is a failed attempt at a stealth/suspense zombie survival game. You rarely come across characters, and when you get the pistol in the beginning, there is not enough ammo whatsoever to keep yourself alive, as you wold need to run. I did think that the game was going to pick up at the point when you get captured and you have to escape, but I thought wrong. It was extremely weak as it was the same thing as before except in a building. At this point, I seriously considered about quitting the game, but I had the slightest sliver of hope that the game was going to be interesting, but once again... I was wrong. After being weaponless for an amount of time, you find a hammer. It's similar to the Crowbar in Half Life, mechanics-wise. After coming into a storage room, I see one of the clone-zombies as I like to call them because they all look the same. I snuck up behind it thinking that I could perform some heavy/stealth attack that would one-hit kill the zombie, but no! It recognized I was there, and I had to whack it repeatidly up close to kill it. This continued on for some time until I found this dude who looked like Dr. Kliner from Half Life 2. I had to free him from being locked up, and then I found the SMG from Half Life 2. I thought I could weild multiple weapons in an inventory, but sadly I wasn't able to. It turns out that you can carry only one weapon at a time. (Which sucks) The gun had loads of ammo crates by it, which seemed to be an insane amount of ammunition that I thought wasn't necessary. After that, you get separated, and you find yourself eventually in a warehouse. You turn a corner and then you find about three enemy NPC's shooting at you. If you kill them, you turn another corner, low on health (Trust me), and then you go into this cramped little hall. In there were about FOUR ENEMIES WITH MACHINE GUNS SHOOTING AT ME WITH NO CHANCE TO REACT! I tried again and again, and I was able to pick off one or two of them without dying, but It was virtualy impossible without something like a grenade to clear out the hall. After that, I immediately shut down the game, finally fed up with the horrible gameplay, impossible fights at this part, and overall, I felt like I wasted forty five minutes of my life. I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS BLAND, MOD THAT IS NOT FUN OR ENJOYABLE WHATSOEVER!			"

												A bland walk through some very non-unique scenery. This is like a very small piece of Half Life 2 without the sci-fi elements. And story, what story, there is about none. A fisherman shipwrecks on some island that has some corporation and zombies. Could it be any more cliched and boring? Music is okay and graphics about on par with HL2, no surprise there as it uses mostly HL2 assets. Thankfully this is free, I would have been angry if I had paid for this. There is nothing wrong per se (well, the melee combat is somehow clumsy), it is just an uninspired piece of lack of imagination.			"

												I read about Estranged: Act 1 on PC Gamer and their writing peaked my interest so I came and downloaded it right away. After a short wait time, it was finished and I fired it up. The first 10 minutes of the game oozed with atmosphere and style. It was very dark and eerie. I was excited to play more!And then...you start the most generic, uninspired ""crawl through sewers"" segment I've experienced in video gaming. I cant stress how uninspired this was. Quickly after that I realized how uninspired the whole game was. From Half Life 2 models to the generic ""zombies"" and mandatory bad-humans-in-disaster-situation, the game quickly turned into a chore. Pros: The beginning was nice, very atmospheric. The voice acting is superb and in some places the level design is very nice.Cons: Very generic story with a very generic and boring gameplay. Overall a very unispired standalone mod.Do I reccomend it? No, there are better Source mods out there.			"

												I have to say I was a little disappointed with Estranged; Act I. From the screenshots, I was expecting a more story driven atmospheric experience. What I got, was a bunch of typical Source engine gameplay elements. Put a crate there so you can jump over stuff. Find a brick to throw through a window. Insert plug here, add switch there, talk to HL2 character models and use HL2 weapons to shoot other HL2 models. The story and atmosphere start out great, but are then just left out for most of the game as you work your way through boring levels battling enemies with really outdated combat mechanics (it feels worse than HL2 itself). Obviously it's free, so you can't complain about that, but at this point I wouldn't even invest the time to be honest.			"

												+ Some of the most beautifully lighted sewers I have ever seen.- The story and gameplay are♥♥♥♥♥♥ It starts off as some kind of zombie apocalypse island survivor thing with a desolate abandoned atmosphere. You meet a guy who's been hiding in a cabin for weeks apparently, and he gives you his only gun for some reason. Then you do some lever pulling puzzles in a train yard for some reason. The mod takes it's time letting you walk around in a bunch of abandoned areas before throwing it's lame zombies at you, so there's a sense of build-up. Overall, the part where nothing is happening yet is the best part of the mod.You then somehow end up in an evil corporation office building staffed by the Half Life 2 rebel models who are trying to shoot you. You escape from the place with Dr. Kleiner who is under the alias ""George Richmond"".  (They could have at least given him a mustache and a toupee) Then there's a bunch of clumsy shootout sequences with the rebel modes, and you mess around with the Half Life 2 crane thing, and then you'll quit out of boredom.The player character is a fisherman who crashes his boat in the intro sequence. This doesn't seem to have any relevance to anything else that's going on, you don't even get to hit zombies with a fishing rod or anything. Nothing really relates to anything; it's just stuff happening.If you like pretty lighting then this is the mod for you.			"

												Not very scary, by the numbers zombie game that quickly devolves into a corridor shooting gallery. The human enemies and the zombies are all dumb as bricks and easier to kill than a fly with its wings pulled off. Starts out seeming like it will be decent but the first couple of zombies you face off against are dispatched so easily that you'll never spend another second feeling frightened.			"

												Night, crash washed ashore, empty island, zombies, outbreak from research center... Aren't you bored already? Seriously, could they get any more generic?First mod hopelessly tries to be a horror, then corridor running sim and becomes crаp shooter towards end, they borrowed idea of finite flashlight from Afraid of Monsters but showered player with batteries and forgot to make it useful., sometimes mod gives you ""puzzles"", I called them puzzles in case HL2 puzzled you.Levels look like what you'd expect from HL2, not that it's a bad thing for a mod, but nevertheless it is so.I do not understand what's it doing on steam, of course it's not the worst mod I've played, seen worse, seen better, but why'd you play something average? At least when you play something bad you can have a laugh, but this... If you want proper HL2 horror mod, go get awesome Nightmare House 2 or Grey.I've recently played Train made by one man and I had much better experience with it.			"

												I was hoping this agme was going to be good. The game was advertized well and looked like it had some interesting fetures. The game had some nice atmosphers but the game did a horible job making you feel apart of it. The game poorly introduced gameplay fetures it sorta expects you to know what to do. There was no horror aspect tot he game even tho it had tryed to add some, the zombies were much too easy to kill and the only ""difficulty"" of the game would be clicking your mouse untill the bad guys stoped moving. When you take a brake on killing things you figure out where to go in borring all the same puzzles, the only hard thing about them would be that it's very unclear where the crap the go. You spend too much time walking in circles. The game over all was much too slow to keep me interested.			"

												There isn't anything really worth saying about this game. It's short (beat in less than 2 hours with every inch of the levels explored. You could run straight through in probably less than an hour), doesn't have any well-explained story, and doesn't bring anything new or interesting to the table. It's just your typical run-of-the-mill HL2 mod where you run through levels just for the sake of getting to the end of them. Hopefully Act II will be better.			"

												This game is too short. It doesn't deserve to be called a Half Life 2 mod in my opinion. You can't even carry 2 guns, the zombies are a joke and the people you can actually shoot are just a few before the game ends. Very disappointed. If you played Half-Life 2, you'll find Estranged: Act I to be boring.			"

												At the beginning i was convinced that the game would be awesome. But after a while it just got annoying and i just ran and and shot everyone. I think for gamer who have never played an horror game, it is a good game to begin with, with some cool eastereggs. But for veteran player, who search for a unique horror experience, it is not the game they should go for.The game is like any other mod. But i have to say that they clearly put work in this mod. And i appreciate that they did that. But this was not what i was looking for. I expected more horror, more scares, maybe a good chase scene, or something like that. But what i got was some Zombies behind the corner, some of them got reanimated and attacked me etc. But none of that was that scary...The story wasn't anything new as far as I'm concerned. Don't want to spoil anything, so i cant really tell about the story.TL;DR : New at horror games ? - Go for it.            Are you not ? - Do not.            Do you search for an unique story line which is gripping ? - Not what you are searching for.			"

												Sorry, but I'm not loving this. The atmosphere is good, and the game mechanics are fine, but the story is almost nonexistent (and what's there is pedestrian and dull). The areas are delineated well, and the combat is tense. But I want something more. (Silly, I know, given the fact that it's all free.) I can't really recommend it. Good on the devs for trying for a creepy mood, but I kinda feel like I got what I paid for. Feels like just another zombie world.			"

												One of the better HL2 mods I've played in some time. Not everything is an original asset (hence my usage of mod instead of game by itself since there's a clear distinction between a mod and something that happens to use Source) but there is still a fair amount of new content. Including original voice work and an awesome 1911 pistol model. Also Kleiner and someone who sounds an awful lot like the guy who voiced him in HL2 makes an appearance. If that doesn't want you to play it automatically I don't know what will. I did a full playthrough of it here.			"

												A remarkably mediocre mod. The gameplay is a long and bland tunnel (Valve games tend to do this, but they try to provide some illusion that it's not just a path of corridors you follow.) The puzzles are easy, simple, uninspired, and take pages directly from Half Life 2, the plot is stereotypical, the zombies are buggy and silly, and overall the game underdelivers. The plot goes nowhere noteworthy, but that's ok because I expect nothing of it other than ""we're scientists, we messed up and created zombies, now there's a containment conspiracy,"" and the game's finished in about an hour and a half. I suggest you don't waste your time playing this.			"

												Estranged: Act 1 is the first installment of what is to be a continued series built on Valve's Source engine, and for a free mod built on an outdated engine it was quite impressive.Don't read too much into ""impressive"". What I mean is that the world and atmosphere of Estranged are wonderful and you feel like something terrifying can happen at any moment, which sadly doesn't happen. I found the build-up for confrontations to be a bit of a let-down, you're exploring an abandoned island that shows signs of recent struggle after being shipwrecked when you encounter the cause...Zombies.Yes, it is another Source zombie mod, which I found to be quite the letdown when I first encountered the enemy of the first half of the mod. Since this is the first installment of Estranged I overlooked the fact that there was no exposition to the background of the ""outbreak"" (which I'm reluctant to refer to as, since the zombies were few in number and were generally underwhelming in combat) and soldiered on through its three chapters. About halfway through you encounter the second enemy, which are gun-toting Half-Life 2 citizens that, also like the zombies, left a bit to be admired.With such a well-built atmosphere it was all the more disappointing to observe the lack of effort in the character models, even going as far to recycle Dr. Kliener's model. If you're a veteren of the Source engine then this method of re-using content will deal a large chunk of damage to any immersion, which for a mod that aims for atmosphere is not a good thing at all.The level design was very restrictive with almost no potential for exploration or discovery. The pacing was just messy inconsistently jumping from long winded and empty hallways to short and cramped office spaces. The puzzles are just horribly easy and the only way to fail them is if you suffered head trauma as a child. Overall the gameplay in both combat and level design was rubbish in laymans terms. The story is lacking and failed to grab my interest, but since this was only Act 1 I'm willing to overlook that and give the developers the benefit of the doubt and assume that more exposition will be given in the future installments.Now I may be giving Estranged a bit of a harsh lashing, and my expectations may have been a bit high for a free mod, but I just felt underwhelmed by the whole experience and I left Estranged very disappointed because of the apparant lack of effort in the character models and the combat. If Estranged cost any money then I would be much more harsh, but since it is a free mod with low memory and hardware requirements there really isn't any legitimate reason to not play through it for yourself and develop your own opinion about it. Who knows? You may just like what you see.The music was pretty good though.			"

												In one word: Dull. The game has a nice atmosphere and graphics features, and the sound is really good but thats about it.The levels are beautiful and somewhat consistent but if you have played half-life 2 it will feel like dumbed down version of some of its core elements, especially the puzzles. Gameplay feels unrewarding, the zombies are plain and simple to fight with no challenge at all, the gunplay is ok but same old. The flashlight is not much needed and thus making the batteries, which should act as a reward for the players exploration, feel useless.The story is not interesting at all, plain and simple: cliché.

												Whilst it's worth trying out, I found this game dull and uninspired. The combat is weak and boring, as are the zombies. You'll never encounter more than one or two at a time and they take no effort to kill. Out of all the times I died, I don't think any have been from zombies.The presentation is definitely good, as is the music and even the voice acting isn't that bad. All of that accounts to nothing when you spend all your time walking down hallways and linear levels facing the odd zombie that takes no effort to kill.I'm not sure if this game was trying to achieve. I just didn't enjoy playing it.			"

												This game just isn't fun. It seems like it's 90% running through deserted areas, and 10% solving minor environmental puzzles that serve as little more than a minor impedance to moving forward.The shooting mechanics aren't good, but that's ok because the enemie AI is very stupid, even for zombies. But they are few and far between. They pose no challenge what so ever and again like they puzzles the seem like just a minor roadblock on your constant push forward through the uninteresting maps.Aside from the modern resolutions and somewhat decent textures this entire game looks and feels like something from the early 2000's era.Would not recommend.

												Nice try, next time better. I had absolutely no fun while playing this game. At first the game was pretty interesting, but the further I got into the story it dulled me. - Too rigid- No music- Some bugs: when going onto a computer, reading some mails and trying to get out of that computer (it says to press enter, but that's not how you quit the desktop)- Achievement to score 15 points at the shooting range is complete bugger. I had to try several times to get this thing working. It unlocked at +16..........- Bucket-achievement (ragequit several times). Look how they did it in L4D2 with the gnome: when you took the gnome, it was almost glued to your hands and useable as melee weapon (unless you died or threw it away); in this game the bucket can get stuck behind things and you can lose it at any moment. - game needs better crosshair asap (or other color)- no more bullets: run like you've never runneth beforeEven if this is a free game, I do not recommend it to other players. Way to many things bothered me.			"

												A relentlessly bland game that doesn't have a single original idea in it, offering instead a endless barrage of zombie cliches while providing little to nothing in the way of scares, challenge, story, or fun. If a game is about what you do most often while playing it, Estranged: Act I is about walking down corridors while feeling bored. The entire game is a linear path from one vague objective to another. Once in a while you encounter either a single zombie, a first-person jumping puzzle (ugh), or some simple setpiece puzzle resolved in thirty seconds, at most. Enemies are so non-threatening and so few in number that any attempt to build tension falls flat, and the plot might as well not exist, utterly failing to tell an interesting story or give us characters that we connect with. The second half of the game starts ripping off Half-Life blatantly. There's a escort mission where you help a scientist who can open security doors get around an office complex, then you switch from bashing and shooting zombies to gunning down dudes with assault rifles who are trying to cover up the evil corporation's responsibility. Near the end the game shamelessly recycles the crane from Half-Life 2. Don't bother with Estranged, there are much better games out there.  Even if you're restricted to free games, the mod-turned-standalone Cry of Fear is light-years ahead of this poorly-executed boilerplate dross.			"

												Estranged Act I is an example of a good singleplayer mod by the name of Alan Edwardes (correct me if i  misspelled his name) and it's almost a NMRiH+L4D crossover. Here is my opinions so far:Good Storyline: Your a fisherman who is stranded on a island infested by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of ZAWMBES that will run at your face and beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you. But it's not the zombies is your enemies, also the guys that want you to die will shoot you until you die, despite that your not infected. But the story would be a lot better if it makes sense (or it was just me who doesn't make any sense)A.I Director: The author of this mod probably added the A.I Director so he wouldn't place every ammo in a single map like he did in the Alpha versions. Probably an excellent way for a zombie apocalyptic themed mod.Zombies: They're just like your playing Left 4 Dead but no SI. They will jump high if you stay at the stairs for too long (confirmed in the barricade sequence) and shoot them in the head for a insta-kill. Shooting them in the chest or the legs will end up wasting your own ammo.Weapons: They sound very realistic for my taste, and that gold Colt 1911 is way too good for a mod like this. I won't explain a lot in this thing. Too much shooting to do.Also Alan, you didn'nt know you can carry more pistol ammo in the game than the traditional 80 (confirmed by playing Noamztunnels), but instead here's a note, try limiting the ammo about like 40 but that's just my only flaw in the game. But I still like it thoughRatings:PROSGood StorylineAI DirectorNice SoundtrackThe Pistol looks too goodThe ZombiesCONSSecond Half can get tedious and boring.Human AI is basically a copypaste from the dumb HL2 Rebel AI.OVERALL SCORE: 82/100			"

												TOO LITTLE TOO LATE. The age of sourcemods is coming to an end, and this one doesn't do anything Half-Life 2 didn't do way better. Zombies are not scary and die extremely easily, graphics are source engine, ""puzzles"" are way too simple, and the story is uh... I don't know even know what the story is supposed to be. Something about some evil corporation taking over some island and being jerks and probably making zombies, and there's some d00d with a wife and kid I'm supposed to care about or something I don't even know if that comes up again, I only played half an hour (got to the part ARQUE captures you and you escape).Maybe if I played this 5 years ago I would find the atmosphere engaging, but here in 2014 I'm too busy bhopping to care about the ""jumpscares"". Seriously, zombies pretending to be ""sleeping"" in obvious locations got predictable in Half-Life 2, did the makers of this think it would become scary here?			"

												Well the mod presented itself in a way that I expected a high quality mod. What I got is a mod which wanted to be so much, but was nothing of that. The beginning was nice, but the same formula as 1000 other games and mods which is okay, but something more original would be nice. The graphics are really good for a Half-Life 2 Mod, but they get worse later in the game. Feels like they only put much effort into the beginning so it looks good in the trailers...This mod involves a lot of walking, A LOT, which is supposed to be atmosspheric or something, but i was boring. There is no exploration at all, because there is nothing to find, and the enviroments are all generic and get more and more generic with time. Also the borders of the levels were most of the time really obvious and they used the same method multiple times. Also in many places the game doesnt let you go back, a door shuts down or a something falls apart or I dont know, like a casual military shooter kinda.The gunplay was by far the most terrible gunplay ever Ive seen in a HL2 mod (probably because most mods use the gunplay of HL2 anyway which is fantastic). The enemys are so extremely dull, stupid, predictable and easy to kill. Just one shot to the head, wow. Where is the challenge? I mean they arent even really fast and they run straight to you. No skill involved in this game. Oh and btw the zombies look stupid and have stupid animations (which is okay considering its a mod).You can only hold one gun at a time which is probably supposed to feel realisitc, but I want fun games, not realistic games. Dont get me wrong, having only 1 gun could be fun, they just pulled it off terrible. It feeled like I had infinite ammo, cause everyone died with 1 shot anyway.Well, I hoped at least the puzzles could be fun, but no. They have extremely obvious solutions, mostly because they just use puzzles which were already in Half-Life 2 and even Half-Life 1. I was just doing what I had to do to progress, it feeled kinda lika QTEs where you just do what the game tells you to do.The voice acting was really good for a mod, but the humour was stupid. The game wanted to be funny, but the jokes were obvious or just bad.The part with the hammer was the most stupid, cause most zombies you encounter were lying on the ground, so you could easily kill them before they stand up. One area of the game was like 1by1 copied from Mirrors Edge, which is okay, just wanted to point it out.Overall the game was boring, and it felt like it wanted to do so much, but did everything bad. Instead they should focus on less things and makes those very good. It is just broken in so many ways, just designed bad. I stopped playing at the part with the cat. I know I am really harsh, but as I said the mod presented itself in a way that I had high expectations and not even the visuals could keep up with that.			"

												Let down, the Official video game.Yesterday night, I watched the trailer, and it looked rather good for a mod. Today, I download it, and give it a try. And well, I wanted to give it a try, but it was too short, I finished the game in 2 hours. And I was trying to explore, and not rush it. So, let's explain why this mod fails.First of all, the game feels just like Final Fantasy XIII : It's a giant corridor. You can't do anything but to go forward, and well, in games like these it's okay, but also placing items that make wasting time exploring and piling up boxes be worth it. Does this mod do that? No. I've spend like 20 minutes of those 2 hours trying to find cool and hidden stuff, and got nothing. That's lazy. I have even got all the achievements (only 8 of them) on my first play, without really trying. The only one that could been difficult to find would be the one about a zombie watching a TV, but since I was actually looking for hidden crap, it was not hard at all. THe game is pretty much filled with locked doors you can't open, and it forces you to keep going forward, ignoring the work that was put into the mod.And talk about lazy, the story. It kind of fails to deliver. You expect something BIG to happen, and you get nothing. You lose, good day sir. The story is not interesting, but to be fair, there's almost no story at all. And you know what's even worse than that? Zombies. Yeah, motherf#cking zombies. I'm tired of seeing zombies in games, but this is just dumb. For some reason, there are zombies in this island. The game gives NO explanation of WHY THE HELL THERE ARE ZOMBIES RUNNING ARROUND EVERYWHERE. But of course, then you find humans who try to kill you for reasons also unknown. And what's this? The game seems to be split into multiple episodes. Why not just work into a full mod and release it at once, instead of giving the people an unfinished game?Most of the models NPC's have are either the same from Half Life 2 with minor changes, or custom, made by the creators, but with...strange animations. The guy who gives you a pistol at the start of the game isn't even holding it right, zombies have hillarious attack animations...Stuff like that.There has been a lot of work with the mod, that's for sure. But if I had to rate the entire game by this first part, it would get the same rating I would give to most generic shooters we all get every now and then (You know, Call of Duty, Battlefield...). Like a 3 or 4 /10. The voice acting is good, the music is really amazing, but the rest is...Well, less than average.And seriously, cats? Why the hell is the Internet so filled with cats? Why not parrots? Or zebras? Or dinosaurs with afro hair?Oh, and the game seems to crash when you try to check the game options while in the game, in the pause menu. It crashed twice, and made me waste even more time. I can tell you, you can finish this game in one hour, or less.Edit: Oh wow, you know what's more dissapointing? The creators of the game making reviews of their own creation, giving it 10/10 and saying it's perfect in every way possible. It's not even finished, how can it be perfect!?			"

												Estranged tells the story of a lone fisherman, whose ship is stranded on a mysterious island during a violent storm. Explore the rich environments and meet the curious inhabitants of the island as you find a way back to the mainland. Face both danger and intrigue in this perilous adventure, where you will soon find that not everything is as normal as it seems.			"

												Quality bad game IMHOLet me explain it to you. Somehow it combines finest moments with terrible ones. + Absolutely gorgeous ambient music+ Lovely lighting+ Good UI design- Absolutely awful choice for footsteps sound. My had actually started to hurt I'm not exaggerating!- Lack of ambient soundscape in general- Terrible firefights. That is corridor shooter for you!- Puzzles with in-your-face solutions- Boring level design. Too much of straight lines I guess.Overall outcome is mediocre at best. If you have some experience playing HL mods - this one is pretty dull. 20 minutes of Whoopservatory was more interesting for me.			"

												I kind of feel like this game had an identity crisis within the first hour or so, what started as an adventure/horror with light action turned into an action/adventure with light horror. It gets the thumbs up for being free, having good design and layout (despite reusing most of Half-Life 2's assets), and having great voice acting for a mod. If you have two hours and want to enjoy a unique, short action/adventure, I'd recommend it.			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game, some good and bad. Although the game does shine every now and then, it's mostly shallow in terms of entertaining content. There's little to none emotions and feelings implemented in what is supposed to be an island plagued by a zombie outbreak. What really breaks the immersion is the original Half-Life 2 character models that are used in this game, a few of them slightly altered, but that's it. Something that really bothered me was that the Half-Life 2 rebels were trying to kill me without giving any specific reason to why they were doing so. I mean come on, there's a zombie outbreak and they don't even bother negotiating with me?Not a game I would put my money on, but it's worth a try since it's free.			"

												Very smooth, not a lot to do and very linear. If you have played Half-Life 2 the puzzles leave nothing to the imagination. I played through it in 91 minutes and most of the time I was sprinting just to get down hallways put in for no reason. It would've been nice to have the answer to the password on a different computer terminal than the one that asks you the question. But it did have it's comedic points, well two of them,  when you almost Panic shoot them in the face. Maybe when all 3 acts are released may it be worth playing so it can build up to something. Hope for the best.			"

												I've downloaded this game because it had a lot, generally positive review.I think it's a very ""thin"" game, and I don't recommend it.The problem is that it feels more like a technical exercise than a game.It fails as an action game, as the fighting itself is very limited; there is no strategy or variety.It also fails as an expressive medium, as there is no real story; only a very generic and derivative plot (corporation X caused a zombie outbreak and it's covering it up). The characters are paper-thin and purely functional; the locations are quite interesting, but again, there is no depth; the puzzles are [very often] of the type ""stack the boxes"" or ""push the lever and disable the electricity"".The game has a very distinct Half life 2 feeling. It's not about the engine though; it's about the game as a whole: it feels very much 2004; even the name is a reference to it. People who enjoy retrogaming may like it, but by today's standards, it would have been much more effective to make a shorter but deeper game, than a longer and shallower one.Based on the website informations, the creators seem more technically than artistically minded - I think they're not going into an interesting direction with the Act 2, which I'll likely not play.

The ammo is just too hard to find and it takes around 3 shots to kill a zombie. The spawning system of the zombies suck, I was hoping for a already loaded system(the are already there when you get to that destination). This game looks great and there's alot of room for improvement. You guys can do better, I know it!!!			"

												I'm sorry but I almost fell alseep 40 mins into the game...it's just horrible and lazy done. They are just using the original HL2 characters for the maincharacters in the game, like, the protagonist ""the good helper"" is just professor Kleiner...with another voice...the ""Army badguys"" are just HL2 Rebells, ported over...blablabla. and the same goes for the weapons, except they had the decency to give the 45. pistol another skin (1911 skin) I lolled so hard when it said ""Amazing Graphics"" when its just the source engine they are using, even tho I like the Source Engine, it's getting pretty outdated imo (2004). The zombies/infected/AIDS/IdontKnow people look like♥♥♥♥♥♥with yellow square eyes, they barely make a noice, but when they do, it sounds like they are taking a sh*t, not even close to scary. Don't even get me started on the story...it has more holes than a swiss cheese ffs, nuff' said. If you are looking for a horrorgame and some fun, stay away! Get ""Outlast"" or the ""Amnesia"" series. On the other hand, If you are high as f*ck on crack or shrooms, and have nothing else to do, then sure, enjoy!			"

												I hope this game is in Beta Testing because it does not seem finish.1. I swam around the island without being eaten by the fish and they don't seem like a threat.2. The window in the office room on the docks dos no look like it has glass so add some glare and smudges to the glass and I did't know it can be broken.3. Explain all the controls at the start at the game because I didn't know what all of my options were and couldn't progress.4. I swam around the office room on the docks and did not need to do throw it, the fish may be more of a problem if the fish where everywhere.5. The danger of the fish needs to be better explained.The crates are too big to fit throw the door of the the office room on the docks so they shouldn't be there.6. One of the doors on the office room on the docks lock from the outside so it can't be opined form the inside. If I where in the room I should be able to open all the doors if they are not blocked by something.7. The fish need to be visible and animated before the hero is attract by them.8. The physics for object manipulation unrealistic because objects move to quickly and easily and size and weight are not accounted for.			"

While I find that it is not replay worthy (mostly due to it being incomplete), the game is very well made and enjoyable as well.  The stroy is actually ver good and I was into it the entire time. I also like the many interactive items throughout the entire game as well! The music and the atmosphere in Estranged was top notch and succeeded in further pulling me into the game.

												I will freely express that this is a wonderful, well-made mod. I did not run into any bugs, so playthrough was clean and not at all frustrating. The puzzles are intuitive and creative (although rather few in number), the music is fresh and fitting, and the voice acting is very well done. I felt immersed in the game, and the environments were detailed and fun to explore. Where I needed to go was well marked, so I never truly felt lost. I got a bit worried about my ammunition though, and at one point I ran out, but I was able to outrun the enemies, and generally the item spacing made sense.The story could use some development, perhaps more than just the one newspaper for background, but I will wait to pass judgment until the other Acts are released. Generally, I'm interested to see how the story unfolds. I was also pleased with the length of the mod, all things considered--I put in about 1.5 hours, but was expecting much shorter. Overall, I feel this mod has a little bit of everything that makes for a satisfying playthrough, and would highly recommend it. What have you got to lose?			"

												Excellent game. Throughout the game I felt as if I was playing the Half life game Valve never made. The first half of the game was very creepy, with zombies limited ammo and dark locations. The second half was more like a standard shooter, with plenty of ammo, enemies, and well lit locations. I have only one problem with the game and that is the fact that it is very short. However, it is only Act I, and I am very excited to see what the developers will bring with Act II.			"

												Great MOD, one of the better ones I've played in a long time. My only complaint is that since you have to have batteries for the flashlight that they should make areas a bit darker to force the player to actually use it. Great ambience and good texture work, music is very good and the voice acting is defently top notch. I look forward to more!			"

												I will freely express that this is a wonderful, well-made mod. I did not run into any bugs, so playthrough was clean and not at all frustrating. The puzzles are intuitive and creative (although rather few in number), the music is fresh and fitting, and the voice acting is very well done. I felt immersed in the game, and the environments were detailed and fun to explore. Where I needed to go was well marked, so I never truly felt lost. I got a bit worried about my ammunition though, and at one point I ran out, but I was able to outrun the enemies, and generally the item spacing made sense.The story could use some development, perhaps more than just the one newspaper for background, but I will wait to pass judgment until the other Acts are released. Generally, I'm interested to see how the story unfolds. I was also pleased with the length of the mod, all things considered--I put in about 1.5 hours, but was expecting much shorter. Overall, I feel this mod has a little bit of everything that makes for a satisfying playthrough, and would highly recommend it. What have you got to lose?			"

												The experience is great; it includes immersive gameplay and scenery, along with a whip of action, mystery, and horror. It fulfills it's title of a horror adventure, with a deepening plot as you go along with the game. Estranged: Act 1 is a great start and is full of potential to keep it's momentum going. It includes things that are unique among other source stories; and includes a level of interactivity not seen in most stories of this genre.If you like a story that stands out from the rest, I suggest you give this a try.

												Well, this was a bit of a mixed bag.The atmosphere is nice, level design and voice acting are quite impressive for a free mod, and it does pull you in at the start. But it's problem is it's trying to do too much. The start of the game seems to be going for an Amnesia-like feel, but then it switches to jump scares and full shootouts as you progress.Pros:Game world feels real and believableVoice actingExcellent musicMulti platform, Linux version runs without any problemsCons:Rather cliche story, though atmosphere makes up for some of itTries to do too much, resulting in rather large shifts in gameplay styleNot passing any judgments on graphics since I played it on my laptop using integrated Intel card. It ran well without much fiddling with settings, so that's a plus.Overall, I'd say give it a go. It's rather short and easy on normal difficulty so there's not much you can lose.And seriously, release the soundtrack, it's easily my favorite part of the game.			"

												In Estranged Act 1, the starting sequence can be a little confusing, however, that problem is quickly solved as you are thrown from your boat and into the water, though there was no indication that you are a fisherman until later when other characters refer to you as a fisherman. Story As said before Estranged Act 1 has you experiencing a ship crash which results in your being stranded on an island. At first, you might not even see this game as scary, much less a zombie game, in fact I had no idea that this was a zombie game at all when i first started playing the game. After meeting a man named John who gives you a gun and sets you on your way, your real goal is unclear. The game progesses in a fasion of your moving forward and finding your way around obstacles until you are knocked out by a long fall and captured. When you awake you are tied to a chair and interrogated, which leads to the game resuming the ""move forward"" gameplay. This continues until you arrive at Arque Corporation, a company mentioned in the beggining portion of the game. There, you meet a doctor (who you immediately trust?) who wants to find a way to send a message for help off the island. After failing at this task due to a signal disruption coming from the other side of the island you part ways. Afterwards, Arque Corporation is alerted to your presence and you must fight your way out. After escaping, you come to a cabin which leaves you on a very big cliffhanger for Act 2. Playability If you are using a control, you might be something of a trailblazer here, as the game gives you no help as far as controls go on a controller. All control hints are made with a computer in mind, which would make sense seeing as this game is on a computer based game store. As you progress through the game you get the hang of the controls which are similar to Half Life 2 (it is a mod of Half Life 2 after all) or, if you are not familiar with it, like other mods of Half Life 2 i.e. No More Room in Hell. The only complaint I have is the fact that you can't aim down the sights, making aiming difficult, and causing an unneccesary loss of bullets as you take multiple shots to down one zombie. But, as with the rest of the controls, aiming gets easier and I saw myself downing zombie with one simple headshot again.GraphicsAs with the controls, graphics are similar to higher quality mods of Half Life 2. I saw improvements in water effects, as well as shadows being darker and displaying a true sense of the absence of light when zombies would run out of it straight towards you. This carries over to lighting effects, with light being essential to the game unless you turn the brightness up, which makes getting the Estranged in the Dark acheivement a challenge. Depth of view effects were a nice touch, though there are small problems with it. One small problem I saw, was how your vision would still be blurred after opening a door, until being quickly adjusted. Again, a small problem, but it can't be overlooked. CharactersWhat few notable character there are in this game are boring without having a real backstory to them. Voice acting can sometimes seem unrealistic, as some voices are not getting their desired effect. John for example may have been trying to sound like he was truly affected emotionally by the strange disapearence of his wife and daughter, but instead sounded like he was trying to hold back a laugh. Characters also don't seem to react too much to transpiring events. John again, for example, shoots (a zombie as you later find out) someone in plain view of you. After you go up to him he acts like nothing happened at all, he doesn't try to explain the situation either. I for one would probably not trust someone who just fired a round into someone's head. Sound EffectsMusic play a key role in the beginning of the game, though its fades as you get deeper into it, as music changed when you enter a new room for example. The music definetely does scare you with it's creepy effects, as it made me think that something was just around the corner. Battle music always feels right as well as a kind of chase scene. Gun sounds are farily realistic, as well as splash and breaking glass sound effects. ReplayabilityWith the challenge of acheivements always present, I could definetely see myself playing the game one or two more times, though anymore would be pushing it. The reason for this is that you come to expect and memorize where zombies are as oppose to when you first play the game through. Wrap Up Estranged Act 1 is a perfect example of the thought that games don't have to be made by enormous corporations, or be extremely taxing to your PC to be good. A zombie shooter with touches of horror as well, I would definetely recommend playing through at least once, to get the feel of what it means to be estranged. Story: 9.7/10 Well thought out with very little questionable partsPlayability: 7/10 Easy to learn controls, however no aiming down sights?Graphics:  9/10 Impressive graphics for games like this; Depth of view issuesCharacters: 4/10 Uninteresting characters with little emotion and unrealistic voice tonesSound Effects: 9.5/10 Musical horror effects start out strong but fade out later in the game, other music always fits the moodReplayability: 9/10 Acheivements offer multiple playthroughs as well as new challengesOverall Score: 48.2/60			"

												Estranged is one part Bioshock, one part Most Dangerous Game, two parts Half-Life 2 mod, a combination which doesnt end up mixing well. As I began, I was presented with a truly engrossing and haunting atmosphere. You're a fisherman, crashed on an unknown island. You're given a pistol with 8 bullets, and come across a flashlight with barely sixty seconds of battery life to its name and are sent forth to help a stranger find his wife and daughter (que big daddy groans). The catch? The island is over run by cannibles. And by cannibles, I mean, really dumb and not scary zombies.			"

												Estranged Act I is the first part in an action fps horror survival game. You play as a fisherman with no memory of anything shipwrecked on a mysterious civilian island. This game at first scared the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me as doors would close randomly and creatures and people would come out of nowhere and attack me. This game is mostly a mystery game with puzzles closely related to the hal life games. Obviously like the HL games this game is mostly based off scripted events that happen. The game though is not a horror game it does not hav that many jumpscares and does not have a lot of enemies thrown at you. During the first levels you are trying to figure out whats happening and get your hands on a gun pretty early but with not much ammo. Once you get the pistol zombies start to spawn in certain locations and you eventually find a place that might explain what happened. Not to spoil anything but near the end of the game you get your hands on more ammo and guns and for the first time confronted by human enemies. Overall as a free game this is worth buying even if its only about 1-2 hours long it still is a brief yet fun experience.			"

												It doesn't really explain a whole lot (but this is Act 1 and I'm assuming there will be more) but this game is essentially a mod for the Source engine (which is what Half Life 2 is built on) that is basically what amounts to a short survival/horror game. I was most impressed by the sound design. It really showcases the power of excellent sound and music in a game, and I couldn't have been immersed without it.For being free, you can't go wrong spending an hour or two playing through this game.

												Wow! It's hard to sum up the creepy feelings that Estranged showered me in. I thought this was going to be yet another crappy HL2 mod but i was so wrong! The atmosphere, sound and light effects makes this a really creepy (and really good) mod and i applaud the makers. I have paid for worse games than this. The story was compelling and well thought through with several ""WTF!?"" and ""Holy crap!!"" moments. In the end i checked every door, box and corner of everything, everywhere to make sure i was safe. While it's no next gen graphics titan (it's source!) it still left me biting my fingernails because of the feeling in the game. I would rate the levels of scare (where 1 is PacMan and 10 is Amnesia) a 6/10.Overall i think the game was a 6/10.			"

												This game entertained me while I was downloading a mod for The Witcher 2. I am impressed. The story is interesting but its not very robust. If they would have made custom skins for the characters instead of recycling old half-life npc's it would have gotten a better rating. I would like to see more cut-scenes and more fleshed out enviorments. I enjoyed reading the newspaper and seeing the pictures and video on that guys computer. The game has plenty of room for immersion. Just needs more depth and detail. More newspapers more♥♥♥♥♥♥on computers. 10/10.			"

												""Estranged Act I"" What an awesome free game. My first thought was that a free game must be mediocre at best, but no, this game is freaking amazing. Originally a Half Life 2 mod, this game is a first person adventure with shooting, interacting with your environment, and puzzle solving. I don't want to ruin your (very short) experience by saying... well anything... about it. The story develops in the best possible way, it reveals what's going on around you with little hints and scraps of newspapers laying on the ground, and subtle offhanded comments that the few characters in the game sneak in.The game won't give you a suggestion of what to do to move on, if you get stuck you're generally in a limited space with few objects, the tone of the game is ""figure it out or give up"". I like this, since there aren't any overly challenging points unless you've never played any first person game ever, in which case, you'll still certainly figure it out. The storyline and the consistent pace make for a super enjoyable evening. When you finish, you'll be satisfied, you'll have laughed,♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants, and probably smacked yourself in the forehead for taking too long to figure out an easy puzzle. My only message to you if you are going to play this game, without spoilers of course, is to please, please, read everything, click on everything, get the achievement for the cats! (You'll know it when you get it.)Overall: 10/10 (Best FPS experience in a long, long time.)			"

												It is hard to call this a mod for hl2 because it looks nothing like anything in the half-life series. Most of these mods have only zombies, only soldiers, or they take place in the half-life universe. Considering they reused Dr. Kliener's model, I don't think it takes place in the half-life universe. The gameplay isn't anything like hl2, either. Now you need batteries for your flashlight, you can hold multiple batteries, there is no armour, you can only carry one weapon at a time, you can read emails and newspapers, usefull things glow when you are near them(can be turned off in options), you can disable your HUD and crosshair, and your weapons make you so OP that the devil has nightmares about you. Through the game, your one-shot-kill pistol becomes a three-shot-kill hammer, which later becomes a five-shot-kill SMG. Also, it's never explained why you start fighting people. I don't understand how you go from fighting only zombies at night to fighting only people in the daytime. Still, it's better than Half-Life 2: Episode 2, so I reccomend it.			"

												The experience is great; it includes immersive gameplay and scenery, along with a whip of action, mystery, and horror. It fulfills it's title of a horror adventure, with a deepening plot as you go along with the game. Estranged: Act 1 is a great start and is full of potential to keep it's momentum going. It includes things that are unique among other source stories; and includes a level of interactivity not seen in most stories of this genre.If you like a story that stands out from the rest, I suggest you give this a try.

												My first reaction was like ""Zombie... grh. Really, again?"". But a few more minutes and you can actually get into this game. Given the fact that Source engine isn't very eye-catching anymore, I must say the developers did a pretty good job here. There are some glitches here and there of course, like poor AI or getting stuck easily. However the game has a great potential and could become one of the finest mods ever made as long as the devs release some more improvements.Pros:- atmosphere- well-designed locations- little bit of survival- interaction with the environment- soundtrackCons:- lack of zombie AI, Instinct at least :)- getting stuck too easily - weapon skin- ideas for computers and paintings designs in my opinion don't fit the rest of the game- should be a little bit longer.

I went into this without high expectations and as I awoke shipwrecked on an island, desolate of life, yet full of detail, I started wanting to explore it and the reason behind my being here. Soon after followed the first gunshots and a chance meeting with a stranger, which would eventually lead to an even bigger mistery and to my morale downfall.After having played through this I am able to tell you, the people who created this have made an astonishing game alongside a good story, making you question your actions. Though there are some minor issues regarding the overall top-notch level design, which can be seen in the train session, but otherwise the few puzzles in the game are mostly straight forward, however still have you involved in the actual gameplay.Something funny before I conclude my review:At one point you enter a room, well a space which reminded me of one of my favourite games 'Mirror's Edge', well this will probably mislead many people, however it added to my overall enjoyment.Thank you for creating this free to play game and I hope that I can see a continuation of this in the future.

												This HL2 mod looks and feels great to begin with: great lighting and water effects, even slightly more polished than HL2!However, I will not be attempting to play this game anymore as it has caused my PC to completely lock up during the loading sections.  When it happens, I can't tab out, nor open Task Manager  - completely locks up and have to restart/power off.  Only played about an hour and its done it 3 times, so no more.  It's a shame as this game/mod showed promise in the early stages.  My issue could be isolated, but I doubt it.  Also - for the record, no other game, offical title or mod, causes my PC to lock up like that :(Because of the system lock/crashes, I am not recommending this game.			"

												I quite enjoyed this game but the music...well, it changes the mood from just running around to slowly proceeding along and checking every corner and taking it easy, makes it sometimes very, very tense. You might want to play with the lights off and with a good set of headphones on...whew on the edge of my seat. Good set design and good voice acting. When it ended I was like dang, I guess I will have to wait on the next act....:( I give it a strong 8/10. Great job guys, waiting on more...			"

												Estranged: Act I is a Half Life 2 mod that uses the Source engine and plays like Half Life 2 but doesn't relate to HL2's story in any way. I think I noticed one character that seemed familiar from the Half Life universe but I am not 100% sure it was him. This game is free so I thought to install and give it a try. For a free to play game it is pretty decent and can be completed in one sitting.The story of the game is simple. You are a shipwrecked fisherman who is stranded on a strange and mysterious island and is trying to find his path back onto the mainland and recontact civilization. However, during the course of your adventures you encounter hostile and dangerous being, a corrupt organization with a bad agenda and very little of normal civilization.As soon as the game starts the atmosphere really does pull you into the story and you are immersed into a universe that both intrigues and occasionally and creeps you out. The game isn't a challenging one with the enemies being very easy to defeat. The game is meant to be played for the immersion and exploration which are two elements the game achieves well from the outset but it seems to weaken a bit as you progress. The start of the game is a little slow going but it's one of those games that gets better as you play through it. There are a small number of weapons and tools at your disposal such as  a pistol, SMG, torch, and medkit. The first Act is short-lived and forgettable but is a good experience which is further improved by the fact that it is free. I was mildly dissapointed by the ending which seemed rushed but nonetheless I am looking forward to Act II whenever it is coming out. Let's hope Act II is also free.			"

												CONCLUSION AT THE END!Let's first start off with: it's free, so why not give it a shot?This game does not feel like it's free, it feels like a whole game, even though it's not that long. It has many elements that HL2 has too, sometimes positive, sometimes negative. It is a very enjoyable shooter and the atmosphere is very good and fits the whole situation: you're stranded on an unknown island and you have to survive the zombies. I find it a little disappointing they chose for zombies, because there are a lot of zombie games out there and it would be nice to have some other enemy for once. The story is pretty good overall and the voice acting is also good.Things I'd like to see in Act II:-Other enemies, not just zombies and bandits;-More things customized, this means more models, weapons and maybe props;-Better melee combat;-Higher difficulty at some points.Pros:-Appealing story;-Good shooter elements;-Good voice acting;-Amazing atmosphere;-Achievements (for the achievement hunters);-Overall fun gameplay.-IT'S FREE!Cons:-Your typical enemies, zombies and bandits;-Not many weapons;-AI too good at some points;Conclusion:Get this game right now, it's free, small in file size and you'll have a great experience playing it!

												This game was suprisingly in depth for a free to play game. Unlike other zombie games, Estranged:Act I does a great job implementing both survival and FPS. In general I would rate 7/10 and here is why.The Characters:There was some interesting character devolpment from the begining. You meet random strangers who live on this island each either hindering or benefitting you. In an actual apocolypse it really will be  a matter of deciding whether or not someone is a freind or a foe. The Hero:To be blunt, the hero is pretty uninteresting untill he picks up a gun. Becuase, you know that the run of the mill fisherman actually can use guns. Even though the hero's backstory is kind of vague, it does feel more emmersive than if there was more. You were on a ship. You crashed. Now survive. The zombies:Unfortunatly, the zombies are why I didn't rate 9/10. They weren't that intimidating. If an object is in front of a zombie the first thing they do is throw it at you, even if its just a book. If a window is broken you would think they would try to jump at you or climb through. Nope. They just stand there as you engage in extreme staring contests. Half of the zombies you can just walk up to them crack their skulls. After a while, the game stops being about surviving and just becomes a pure FPS.The Gameplay: Between the puzzles and the stealth, not only do you have to think quick but you have to be resourceful. A lot of the game I was avoiding using my gun to perserve bullets. If you don't manage to find more ammo your helpless. In Exchange for a small amount of bullets, there are several diffrent traps you can set up to sweep out pesky zombies. if you like problem solving and surviving thenn you will like this game.Environment:There are a few bugs with the texturing leaving either white hairlines on things or red lines in water. The amount of areas to explore are very linear. Granted, I didn't expect a free roam Skyrim style world in the first place, but it would have been nice to have more than ammo or health packs for a reward for taking alternate paths. In Conclusion:It was a nice game, and I don't regret playing it. Overall it has potential for making me want to purchase the next game. The graphics were a little lower but the gameplay makes up for it. There were a lot of perks and I feel acomplished after making it to the next checkpoint. If you enjoy heart pounding, problem solving, well thought zombie games You will enjoy this title.			"

												Downloaded this not expecting much, but it's probably one of my favorite games right now. It's only a couple hours long, but those hours have been great.[minor spoilers below:]Basically, Estranged is a well-written love-letter to Half-Life 2: there's a shady corporation, hints that something went wrong, zombie-like creations, and a military-is-hunting-you deal. But where it really, really feels like Half-Life in a way I haven't seen done outside of Valve is the atmosphere. The music is amazing, especially for a free  game like this (minimalist orchestral parts, eerie electronic swells, pulsing bass), and the quiet exploration through Pacific-Northwest-style scenery was excellent. There is noise when there should be noise, but unlike most games, it isn't overly-cinematic. Walking around, solving basic puzzles felt incredibly quiet and natural. The actual game-mechanics still feel a bit blocky, and some sound-effects could use some work (your gun makes that early-90's video-game ""pop"" sound), but overall, I'm already looking forward to seeing Act II.

												A nice atmospheric game, despite some minor flaws. Pace was good, but as you are pretty much conditioned from the start to move forward, ultimately it pretty much feels like a rail shooter. There may be hidden stuff here and there (caught the lamp on the first playthrough), but not enough to warrant checking out every corner. Nevertheless, the atmosphere carries the game and despite the lackluster enemies (zombies, yawn) I felt pretty much compelled to finish the first act in one setting. Nice work, especially for a mod.			"

												你将扮演一名渔夫，你被困在一座与外界失去联系的岛屿上。而这座岛上发生了一场可怕的疫情，岛上一部分的人变成了僵尸。你的任务就是想办法与外界取得联系。游戏的画面感一般，背景音乐有点恐怖。游戏的真实性很强，游戏过程中不会给你任何路线提示。你可能会走投无路，但是你可以凭借你的智慧创造出一条路。你不会遇到僵尸群，只会有零散的僵尸出现。游戏很考验你的智慧与判断力，有点解密性质的游戏。本人已经把此章节完成，游戏还没有更新完，很是期待第二章节。You will play a fisherman, you are trapped on an island lost contact with the outside world. And on the island there was a terrible epidemic, the island became a part of people zombies. Your task is to find ways to get in touch with the outside world. The general sense of the game screen, the background music a little scary. Authenticity of the game is very strong, the game will not give you any route tips. You may be desperate, but you can rely on your wisdom to create a path. You will not encounter zombies, zombies will appear there scattered. The game is a test of your intelligence and common sense, a little decrypt the nature of the game. I've completed this chapter, the game has not finished updating, it is looking forward to the second chapter.			"

												The first thing that surprised me when I started playing Estranged was that it was free. I assumed it would be just another poor free Half Life Modification like Half Life Before. How wrong I was. Estranged turned out to be an atmospheric experience as terrifying as Amnesia in places. The growing feeling like something very wrong is going on here is always with you, and you never feel safe or alone. What I did enjoy was how well melded together amostphere and combat were, when I encoutered a group of infected, it was flight or fight. At this point, I chose flight. Running from the infected sounds stupid when you have bullets in your gun, because they die with one shot to the head. The infected are fast and agile however and you risk an awful lot when taking them head-on. The best thing about Estranged was the sound. The sound in this game was overwhelmingly good. Everything is crisp and clean. From the Echoing sound of my feet on a concrete floor in an incredibly uncomfortably close quators sewer system, to the flickering of a broken light, to the snarling of the infected. This game is an all around winner.For a free game, I highly reccomend Estranged. Just remember to play it with the lights off and a pair of head phones, and you'll be looking for an exscuse to stop playing, because its so damn scary.			"

												Although a little short and re-using models from Half Life 2, this game has fantastic gameplay and pushes the source engine further than I thought it could ever go. This is one of the greatest single player mods for the source engine ever produced that is truly original, rather than simply being part of existing game universes. I cannot wait for the next act to come out.			"

												In Estranged Act 1, the starting sequence can be a little confusing, however, that problem is quickly solved as you are thrown from your boat and into the water, though there was no indication that you are a fisherman until later when other characters refer to you as a fisherman. Story As said before Estranged Act 1 has you experiencing a ship crash which results in your being stranded on an island. At first, you might not even see this game as scary, much less a zombie game, in fact I had no idea that this was a zombie game at all when i first started playing the game. After meeting a man named John who gives you a gun and sets you on your way, your real goal is unclear. The game progesses in a fasion of your moving forward and finding your way around obstacles until you are knocked out by a long fall and captured. When you awake you are tied to a chair and interrogated, which leads to the game resuming the ""move forward"" gameplay. This continues until you arrive at Arque Corporation, a company mentioned in the beggining portion of the game. There, you meet a doctor (who you immediately trust?) who wants to find a way to send a message for help off the island. After failing at this task due to a signal disruption coming from the other side of the island you part ways. Afterwards, Arque Corporation is alerted to your presence and you must fight your way out. After escaping, you come to a cabin which leaves you on a very big cliffhanger for Act 2. Playability If you are using a control, you might be something of a trailblazer here, as the game gives you no help as far as controls go on a controller. All control hints are made with a computer in mind, which would make sense seeing as this game is on a computer based game store. As you progress through the game you get the hang of the controls which are similar to Half Life 2 (it is a mod of Half Life 2 after all) or, if you are not familiar with it, like other mods of Half Life 2 i.e. No More Room in Hell. The only complaint I have is the fact that you can't aim down the sights, making aiming difficult, and causing an unneccesary loss of bullets as you take multiple shots to down one zombie. But, as with the rest of the controls, aiming gets easier and I saw myself downing zombie with one simple headshot again.GraphicsAs with the controls, graphics are similar to higher quality mods of Half Life 2. I saw improvements in water effects, as well as shadows being darker and displaying a true sense of the absence of light when zombies would run out of it straight towards you. This carries over to lighting effects, with light being essential to the game unless you turn the brightness up, which makes getting the Estranged in the Dark acheivement a challenge. Depth of view effects were a nice touch, though there are small problems with it. One small problem I saw, was how your vision would still be blurred after opening a door, until being quickly adjusted. Again, a small problem, but it can't be overlooked. CharactersWhat few notable character there are in this game are boring without having a real backstory to them. Voice acting can sometimes seem unrealistic, as some voices are not getting their desired effect. John for example may have been trying to sound like he was truly affected emotionally by the strange disapearence of his wife and daughter, but instead sounded like he was trying to hold back a laugh. Characters also don't seem to react too much to transpiring events. John again, for example, shoots (a zombie as you later find out) someone in plain view of you. After you go up to him he acts like nothing happened at all, he doesn't try to explain the situation either. I for one would probably not trust someone who just fired a round into someone's head. Sound EffectsMusic play a key role in the beginning of the game, though its fades as you get deeper into it, as music changed when you enter a new room for example. The music definetely does scare you with it's creepy effects, as it made me think that something was just around the corner. Battle music always feels right as well as a kind of chase scene. Gun sounds are farily realistic, as well as splash and breaking glass sound effects. ReplayabilityWith the challenge of acheivements always present, I could definetely see myself playing the game one or two more times, though anymore would be pushing it. The reason for this is that you come to expect and memorize where zombies are as oppose to when you first play the game through. Wrap Up Estranged Act 1 is a perfect example of the thought that games don't have to be made by enormous corporations, or be extremely taxing to your PC to be good. A zombie shooter with touches of horror as well, I would definetely recommend playing through at least once, to get the feel of what it means to be estranged. Story: 9.7/10 Well thought out with very little questionable partsPlayability: 7/10 Easy to learn controls, however no aiming down sights?Graphics:  9/10 Impressive graphics for games like this; Depth of view issuesCharacters: 4/10 Uninteresting characters with little emotion and unrealistic voice tonesSound Effects: 9.5/10 Musical horror effects start out strong but fade out later in the game, other music always fits the moodReplayability: 9/10 Acheivements offer multiple playthroughs as well as new challengesOverall Score: 48.2/60			"

												Estranged: Act I is a great stand-alone mod. It has a good atmosphere, with very eerie vibes and some weird enemies... for the beginning at least. After a while it just turns into another shooter, but it's great while it lasts. The voice-acting was awesome and the style was sweet. The only thing I didn't like was that all the models came from Half-Life 2, there weren't any characters that looked original. Hopefully, this will be remedied in Act II.			"

I must commend the developer of this. It's really quite good. Here's a recommendation, though. I absolutely hated the pathing for the zombies. They were the same as L4D2. If anything, the slower hl2 zombie would have been more correct, at least from my point of view.Either way, it's a fun mod that I urge you to play.

												Let me start off by saying that I am NOT and never have been a zombie game lover.  Also, when it comes to horror games, I almost never enjoy games in which you can defend yourself with some sort of firearm.  So, when I saw this game, I was in for a surprise.  Now, you probably think that I was dissapointed or disgusted with the game because it does in fact have both zombies and defensive gameplay, but somehow this game gave me entertainment and made me more and more interested in finishing it.  The atmosphere is pretty well made, and the story isn't the worst out there.  If you let youself get into this game, you'll hopefully become like me and keep pushing yourself to figure out what will happen next.Difficulty wasn't the worst.  I don't remember if there was a setting for difficulty because it's been a while since I played it, but I remember that I was only stuck on one scene, but only because I lacked common sense (We've all been there).Estranged Act 1 also isn't as scary as some of you may hope.  I probably had a heart pumping moment once or twice throughout the entire playthrough, but it certainly was very fun to play.If you enjoy the game as much as I did then I would predict that the ending will dissapoint you.  Not a disappointment that ruins the game for you, but a disppointment that the game is actually over and you have to wait for Act 2.  I know for a fact that when Estranged Act 2 comes out that I'll be playing it and will be writing a review for the Act as well.  If the producers keep most of the first game's aspects in the second release, I'm sure it'll do excellent and excel just like the first one did.So play it and see for yourself what a game with good graphics, story, and gameplay in general is like.  I doubt anyone will regret it.Fun Fact: This game was released on my birthday :)			"

												Terrifying and atmospheric, I'm no fan of zombie games, but I liked this. My only bugbear being the quite high difficulty of the game, with no option to adjust the difficulty. I fustratingly found myself in a position of having 10% hitpoints and being required to run through some steam that killed me every single time, leaving me unable to complete. Being poor at headshots is likely to leave you bereft of ammo after 2 engagements, and melee with zombies pretty much gurantees you'll lose 50% of your hitpoints with insufficient healthpacks available to restore more than a hair's breadth above death.

												For me it's out of question, this is one of the best Half-Life 2/ Source Mods. The developers changed quiet a bit to the Alpha that i've played but all changes are improvements except one*, i'll get to this later.The graphics are far better than Half-Life 2 and the lights are amazing, in combination with a very nice AA the game looks very nice.There are no big changes in the gameplay but one thing has changed:*You can only carry one Weapon, it was hell for me. All the time i was afraid of running low on ammo and once i did run out, because there aren't many ammo boxes, i were chased by some zombies at that moment and it scared the s*** out of me.Together with the good and thrilling storry it was a short but a good game.DOWNLOAD IT NOW IT'S FREE!!!

												Not bad, it functions well for the introduction of the player into what is happening, and what their role is. The amount of enemies did not seem quite right for the areas, making them feel almost too empty to me, unless that the intention or limitions that the person/persons working on it at the moment. Hopefully, the city/town will present a more diverse combat to deal with. As for the story, it is left with holes for the player to ponder about and wonder what exactly occured on the island in the first place.Considering that it is a free game, I say check it out for yourself and see if it is something up your ally. I found it fun for the amount of gameplay it is, and I am looking forward to the next act and how the story will unfold further.			"

												The scenery is amazing, the gameplay is much like HL2 (similar weapons), and the story is interesting. However, the gameplay can use some tweaking, and the models should vary from HL2 (including weapon models and the Kleiner npc), but overall it is a well made mod that is worth your time. Cannot wait for Act II!			"

												     I have played through this game only twice. I think this along with No More Room In Hell are the best F2P games on Steam. When I saw my first zombie creture that got me from behind I jumped just a little bit, mostly because I had no idea what the zombies looked like. This was a gaming experience to take and I glad this game isnt wasted memory on my computer. Looking forward to Act II. As long as the developers arn't anything like Valve I say go for it!			"

												A very short mod that is similar to the gameplay of Half-Life. It is mainly a puzzle game broken up by combat scenarios. The story is engaging, the voice acting is very good, and the atmosphere is immersive.Unfortunately, it is easy to break the game. I would often jump to places where I shouldn't have been in the first place and at times I would feel a disconnect from the environment due to the number of invisible walls that it employs.Overall its a very good little mod that can be finished in one sitting.7/10			"

												Damn son. Trying to get all the achievements in the first run kept me really engaged in the game, I searched every nook and cranny for secrets. Sometimes the background music comes to an end and then you're doing some action stuff in awkward silence, but it's understandable since this is a mod. It doesn't hold your hand through puzzles, which may be bad for people who don't have the patience. Overall, I would say theres no reason not to play this because it's free.			"

												Great game and great ideas by the creators, a few glitches now and then. Since they are using Half life 2 as a base, it already has a solid gameplay base and the source engine works perfectly for this type of game. Since they're bringing it out in episodes, along with the strong storyline so far, i am very much looking forward to future installation of the Hlaf Life 2 mod. It's good fun,a short download, and a interesting way to spend a couple of hours and its free, what have you got to lose.			"

												So, the game starts off kinda slow and has a minimalistic tutorial where you learn as you progress. There is a slight number of physics puzzles, so it is recommended that you have the basic understanding of Source physics engine. However, once it picks off, you get a well-made mod campaign with a number of things you can do. I have yet to finish it, but I can assure you that it has a rich content in 3 (wow) chapters.			"

												6/10 - A Good GameA Stand Alone Mod for half life 2. Its very well done, even though the actual game itself is is good, not great, which is why i gave it a 6.The Pros: Atmosphere: Surprisingly well done in the atmosphere department. I liked itGameplay: Plays like half life 2 so yeah you know its gonna be goodVoice Acting: it was good, alot better than I had anticipated, well done!Pacing: I thought the game went along pretty well on the path that it wanted you to go on.The cons:Enemies: Really boring zombie-like enemies that are super easy to killWeapons: its been a bit since i've played this game, but if i remember correctly you could only carry one weapon at a time. I did not like that , i felt 2 would have been more adequate.Story: while i enjoyed the story to an extent, i felt it left to many unanswered questions. But seeing as how this is only the first part in a series, it can be overlooked, just dont expect any real explanation or closure for the story.In conclusion, do i recommend this game? Hell yes I do. For one thing it's free, and it's well done. So knock yourself out with Estranged Act 1. "

												Overall the game is solid but the act I needed a boss of some kind. Anti-climatic is the word to describe enemies. The puzzles are pretty open world while Act I is linear in the game play. Use your items wisely as there are no maps and inventory to hold items. Hopefully there will be alot of advancement in anticipation of Estranged Act II that uses all the gripes. To design a better game, the Devs need to consider the ability to cycle weapons etc. More weapons for the enemy encounters will help change gameplay.			"

												Estranged: Act I-----------------When I first downloaded this game, I was skeptical. Firstly, it was free: sure, they probably couldn't make it paid because it's a blatant HL2 Mod, but all legal aspects aside great quality shouldn't be expected in a free game. Secondly, I'd seen some of the reviews on the Estranged community page: ""This mod sucks!"" ""No quality!"" ""I like cheese!"". But what the hell, when did I listen to random people over the Internet? So I tried the game.Turns out, whoa, it isn't half bad. Spanning about an hour and a half, one can take comfort in the fact that future installments will give you an overall decent playtime. The environments are quite beautiful in places: an observant player might notice some props and textures from HL2, but there's plenty of custom materials in this game to give it a fairly unique feel. There's also a good soundtrack, which at one point made me super pumped and ready to kick some♥♥♥♥♥There's two kinds of enemy in this first act: firstly, dumb running zombies. They look more like hobos on some kind of drug, which is cool, because killing frenzied druggies is way better than killing headcrab zombies. They can even play dead sometimes, which gave me a jumpscare on two separate occasions. The second type of enemy is, more disappointingly, a HL2 rebel. Of course, this time they're hostile and flashlight-wielding, and actually quite a challenge to take down if you aren't well-equipped. Thankfully, these elite hostiles don't come into play until quite near the end.There's a fair few action sequences where you're gunning down whatever stands in your path, but also a lot of platforming and puzzle parts. The kind of structure that made HL2 a great game, I suppose. Running around in super tense situations before cooling down with a bit of crate-stacking and vent-crawling. There was never a moment when I wanted to quit because I got bored, and the shots just kept on coming.Overall, good game. Buy it. It's free, which is the best price ever. So no excuses. "

												Estranged act I was a short, but amazing game, (well, part of a game) that left me very disappointed when i was finnaly met with the dredded ""end credits"". The dev. team did a magnificent job at taking the old source 2 engine and making something better out of it. I ofen found myself thinking, ""This is a half life 2 mod, wow."" while the graphics arent top of the line, i really did'nt care beacause its still a beautiful game and makes you realize th quality that you can get out of a small team and something to work with. Also the soundtack, AMAZING, the music would have you tense when turning a corner, and make you feel awesome when in a gunfight. Another thing to add to the list of things done right in this game is the voice acting, it was wonderful and the script was well written. My only complaint is the models you recycled from HL2, like dr kleiner or using the rebel models for the arque thugs, it just pulled me out of the experience. overall though it was a great experience, id even go as far as to say on of the best experiences you can get, FOR FREE, yes its free, just another reason to get the game. the best part is that the memory space and hardware requirements are very low. All in all, Estranged act I left me wanting more and i cant wait for act II			"

												This half life 2 mod is really quite challenging. I found myself running low on health a lot. The zombies in the game aren't too much trouble, but the other people, I guess you can call them soldiers, have ridiculously good accuracy. This makes the last stretch of the first act pretty tough. If you have half life 2 and a couple of hours on your hands, this is a good game to kill that time. It took me about an hour and a half to complete and I died A LOT. I was a bit dissapointed with the end of it, though.			"

												I like it. It is not as well refined as some other games, the aiming and movement are vague but consistant. The scenes and detail are great along with the story. It all goes together well. Interaction with boxes, barrels and a lot of other things  really add to the story. Nice job.			"

												When I started this game I was but a lone fisherman.  Then I found him.  The most Majestic 90's style computer you will ever see.  I found Steve.  He traveled with me on a train and into the sewers.  Our adventures got better as our friendship grew, but then I lost him as the rushing water took me away from Steve.  I had a plan to get him to a bathroom, but was unable too. I failed my mission.  I failed Steve.  The rest of the game is alright too i guess. 8/10.			"

												It looks like the original Half life(or half life 2) but sadly some of the things have been removed however keep in mind this game is absolutely free so don't expect everything to be the way you might figure it. I think the creators did a good job still since its completely free.-Flashlight health does not recharge(need to find batteries)-character health bar from L4D-Graphics are similar to cry of fear(blurry)-Not very scarry as expected-Soome of the sounds are crummy+Puzzles aren't too frustrating ^^ wow, only thing i have postive about this game seems to be the puzzles. I would not recommend this too shooters/action type.If you look at the genre it says adventure. I can see now why it is adventure and not shooter/action.UPDATE:Forgetting about others reviews and starting fresh, shows an entirely different outcome of my opinion.. i see it as a small survior game where your in the middle of no where with nothing and your just trying to find your way out. I can now see the true reason as to why they say its an adventure game is because your trying to find a way out with just your weapon and a whole new world with new places to discover.Jump scares don't occur around every corner, more like, every 20 minutes throughout the game. not every game has to have jump scares every 10 seconds, so its quite rare.

												Subtle action to cliff hangers this game has that casual feel, while still having the looks and mechanics of a valve game. I love how the story is simple but there was more left to be dicussed about the antagonizing corporation that is behind it all. Has a sort of ""zombie outbreak"" plot base but also little twist adding the plot lines from a very popular gaming franshise ""resident evil"". I enojoyed the game and its ending leaving you wanting more. 9/10 for the small glitches like indestructable boxes, and the fact you could only carry one weapon at a time. But over all very well done team!			"

												Amazing game for a short one. The game is a Half-Life 2 mod, tho you don't need Half-Life 2 in order to play this game. The game itself has both a very mysterious storyline and atmosphere, you absolutely don't know what the point behind the game is and what's actually happening. The game is relatively short, can be finished in roughly 15 minutes. It's free, I'd suggest that you should have a look ;)			"

The story is confusing and rather mainstream, but the graphics are pretty neat.			"

												Estranged: Act I, Where do I begin? This game is unlike many others, the atmosphere is thrilling, (this game is best played in a dark room), the gameplay is excellent, and the mystery behind it all. You are put alone, through a proverbial torment, a childs nighmare after watching a scary movie. Despite it's short length, Estranged: Act I has become one of my favourites to just sit down and play over and over. There is so much to explore and find this game is great. And the best part, its FREE.10/10I hope Estranged: Act II comes out soon.			"

												Estranged: Act 1, is an amazing mod for the HL2 engine that in roughly an hour managed to draw me into the environment and gameplay as effectively as Half-Life did the first time I played it. The atmosphere is great, and while the FPS elements are naturally laid on thick as per it being a HL2 mod, I actually found myself quite pleased with the amount of time the game took to build tension. It took it's time, didn't pull half the horror cheap-shots it set up for itself, and while the story isn't the most well-developed thing I've ever seen, I felt well emerged in the game. Overall, I would say it's worth the download if you have a craving for a short horror-action game that isn't resorting to the old indie hat of pixelated haunted houses. I can't wait to see what future installments could offer, and I would gladly pay for the next one, as the creators intend.			"

												Don't waste your time.I completed game, and found that I'm not satisfied with game play.Pros:Plot and idea are good. Really beautiful atmosphere & sounds. Good graphics & textures. That made me love this game.Cons:Levels are awkwardly straightforward. Not much of easter eggs. Level design is really simple. Puzzles made for 7yo boys. I discovered the fact that I'm not satisfied with such simplicity, and after HL2, Silent Hill, nothing new here. Move few barrels, make few shoots, go on, repeat, go on, repeat, it gets even boring.If you like source engine for beautiful nature and open environments, fact that whole 2nd part of 1st Act would be on corridors\buildings will upset you.

												An excellent Halflife2 mod. Plenty of story and things to do. My only complaint would be that it was a bit short and felt like it just came to a rather sudden stop. Of course, I look forward to the follow-up and wish the maker well in creating the rest of this mod. Decent pacing with enough hints to get you moving forward without holding your hand, the game actually feels like it's letting you play and figure things out on your own. I will be honest, I went into the game expecting a creepy horror game and was only slightly disappointed. However, despite my expectations, the mod is well-made and I did enjoy it.			"

												It wasn't very long, but the atmosphere was well done and the sound track wasn't bad either. The only thing that really bothered me was the absolute lack of any ambient sound effects at a few spots in the game, but it didn't heavily detract from the experience. Also, INTERACTIVE TERMINALS OH MY GOSH YES.			"

												Estranged:act 1. the story take place with the charater we play as a fishermen and his boat crash in a abanded island that is over run by zombie...it an interresting concept that make the the story well interesting: Spoiler alert : you find a man name david and he give you his gun and tell you about his Daughter and his wife and tell you if you fine them protect them.ok that probably wasent such a spoiler but this is. you met a scientest and as you go with him he said to take down the radio because OF THE DAMM CURFEW MESSEGE! sorry i just... got carried away. and also the milatary want to stop you for some reason? the graghic in this is the same as the half life 2,not one, but in some strange reason they make it 'better'. i dont know if it the lighting they use or the way they make the AI move with there mouth idk but they make a good game. but some complaint. whey where there zombie? WHY did the milatary tried to stop us? WHERE IS HALF LIFE THREE?!?...i did it again sorry. now the real complaint: why did they gave me a flashlight that i can bearly use the only time i use is when a part is dark. they could tell me to press e on the vent the whole time. but  seriously where is half life 3.MY RATE is                         8 out of ten...or nine?

												It looks like the original Half life(or half life 2) but sadly some of the things have been removed however keep in mind this game is absolutely free so don't expect everything to be the way you might figure it. I think the creators did a good job still since its completely free.-Flashlight health does not recharge(need to find batteries)-character health bar from L4D-Graphics are similar to cry of fear(blurry)-Not very scarry as expected-Soome of the sounds are crummy+Puzzles aren't too frustrating ^^ wow, only thing i have postive about this game seems to be the puzzles. I would not recommend this too shooters/action type.If you look at the genre it says adventure. I can see now why it is adventure and not shooter/action.UPDATE:Forgetting about others reviews and starting fresh, shows an entirely different outcome of my opinion.. i see it as a small survior game where your in the middle of no where with nothing and your just trying to find your way out. I can now see the true reason as to why they say its an adventure game is because your trying to find a way out with just your weapon and a whole new world with new places to discover.Jump scares don't occur around every corner, more like, every 20 minutes throughout the game. not every game has to have jump scares every 10 seconds, so its quite rare.

												Subtle action to cliff hangers this game has that casual feel, while still having the looks and mechanics of a valve game. I love how the story is simple but there was more left to be dicussed about the antagonizing corporation that is behind it all. Has a sort of ""zombie outbreak"" plot base but also little twist adding the plot lines from a very popular gaming franshise ""resident evil"". I enojoyed the game and its ending leaving you wanting more. 9/10 for the small glitches like indestructable boxes, and the fact you could only carry one weapon at a time. But over all very well done team!			"

												Amazing game for a short one. The game is a Half-Life 2 mod, tho you don't need Half-Life 2 in order to play this game. The game itself has both a very mysterious storyline and atmosphere, you absolutely don't know what the point behind the game is and what's actually happening. The game is relatively short, can be finished in roughly 15 minutes. It's free, I'd suggest that you should have a look ;)			"

												Reminds me of Half-Life 2 not just because its built off the same engine, but it has some puzzles and components of the game that require a little bit of thought. The starting of the story is pretty good and leaves me wondering what caused all of the choas. Overall I will probably continue to play this game series, but if you haven't played it already, google Blackmesa, which is a remake of the original HL which they did a fantastic job, this game reminds me of the quality received from that free game. Also I loved ambient songs/soundtracks and from what I heard I really like this soundtrack, again it reminds me of Half-Life, but that is a good thing. I'd love to get a copy of the soundtrack to listen to when I am doing work.			"

Please never quit, guy.2. Facial animations are extremely well-done.3. The soundtrack (and sound engineering overall) are simply fantastic. I was literally on the edge of my seat in suspense in the warehouse area with the crane.4. Even for Source, this game looks beautiful.5. Although the gameplay mechanics feel very similar to Half-Life 2, the overall themes and moods did a great deal to convince me that this was a very different game.This all goes without saying that this mod is completely free.GET.

												Personal Rating: 8 out of 10.Despite that the graphics seem a bit dated, especially when it comes to the rendering the various enemies and npc's of the game, the storyline is what gets you. From the first moment you start the game, the storyline captivates you to the point where you need to know what happens next. I started from Chapter 1 (of 3) and completed in approximately 2 hours. Not sure if I went through Chapters 2 and 3 during the course of the game, it did not say. If I didn't, I got quite a ways to go, but am still going to play it when acts 2 and 3 make their debut, just to see what the hell happens. The only real gripe is that when I played through this game, and needed to access a computer in-game or the options menu there was no mouse icon. BEWARE!!!, because you can still use your mouse to select items, the mouse arrow is invisible and you'll kinda have to move your mouse around until the option you want is highlighted.			"

I also think it is incredibly playable since you don't need Half Life 1 or Half Life 2. The game overall was immersive and respectable for what it is. The negative comments are from people who are impatient and don't really understand that this is just Act I. It's even in the title. C'mon, guys, really? You're going to get upset because it's shorter than you would like? Just stop your complaining, enjoy a video game for once, and realize that games aren't easy to make.			"

												This game is excelent.  It has a briliant transition of styles; from horror to action.  The transiton between these styles is as briliant as Half-Life 2's.  It has amaizing graphics, voice acting, story and gameplay along interesting achievements that can obtained for exploring and seeking out every nook and cranny.  I can only think of two reasons as to why this game is free: this game uses too many reasources from HL2 or the creators are trying draw us in and make us pay for it's sequel.  If it is the latter, then it has worked.  I cannot wait for the sequel to this game to come out and need be, I will pay money for it.  It is an amazing game that is worth anyones time and I can't wait to see what happens next.			"

When you find health or ammo you know zombies or security is coming soon.Very simple puzzles and the solve is always very close.

												It wasa pretty cool game, especially for being free. It was somewhat like Half-Life as far as storytelling and gameplay went. I was expecting a bit more action, and it seemed like once the story was finally picking up, it ended. It left me wanting more. I hope the creators make a sequel (I would expect them to since this game is called ""Act I""). Anyways, It was a great play and I recommend checking it out.			"

												Pros:Solid voice actingCreepy atmosphereVery effective level design and flowVisuals are on par with that of Left 4 DeadThe ending, albeit abrupt, left me wanting more. Certainly looking forward to Act IICons:Clunky zombie animationsPoor balance in difficultly between the zombies and the human enemiesThe story so far is a bit generic for the horror/zombie genre, although I can't knock it too much before playing the rest of game.Verdict:It's free. Download it if you like horror/games.8/10Absolutely looking forward to future acts in this well constructed, zombie filled adventure. "

												Loved it! Such a great game! I was amazed how good can Source Engine still look! Ambient Occlusion and Depth of Field really add to the immersion. I liked the gameplay and the story too, it was fun, there were few puzzles now and then combined with some action, it just made my day :) Also the level design looks fabulous, I liked every bit :) Maybe one thing that I missed was that I couldn't see my body, that would add a lot to the experience! Also custom anims for the Colt and the MP7...but those are just details. The soundtrack and the sound effects are just perfect.For me: 9/10Cons:Too bad it's soo short! (1-2 Hours of gameplay) "

												A short, yet engaging mod making a wonderful use of the source engine. With an interesting early developed story, it proves that there is definitely more to come and possibly more to offer in the next acts. Although the puzzles seem quite simple, it engages you to find out more about the mystery of the island. Hopefully the story will set a darker and more mysterious tone in the next act. All in all; one of the better and easier to follow HL2 mods out today.			"

												In Estranged Act 1, the starting sequence can be a little confusing, however, that problem is quickly solved as you are thrown from your boat and into the water, though there was no indication that you are a fisherman until later when other characters refer to you as a fisherman. Story As said before Estranged Act 1 has you experiencing a ship crash which results in your being stranded on an island. At first, you might not even see this game as scary, much less a zombie game, in fact I had no idea that this was a zombie game at all when i first started playing the game. After meeting a man named John who gives you a gun and sets you on your way, your real goal is unclear. The game progesses in a fasion of your moving forward and finding your way around obstacles until you are knocked out by a long fall and captured. When you awake you are tied to a chair and interrogated, which leads to the game resuming the ""move forward"" gameplay. This continues until you arrive at Arque Corporation, a company mentioned in the beggining portion of the game. There, you meet a doctor (who you immediately trust?) who wants to find a way to send a message for help off the island. After failing at this task due to a signal disruption coming from the other side of the island you part ways. Afterwards, Arque Corporation is alerted to your presence and you must fight your way out. After escaping, you come to a cabin which leaves you on a very big cliffhanger for Act 2. Playability If you are using a control, you might be something of a trailblazer here, as the game gives you no help as far as controls go on a controller. All control hints are made with a computer in mind, which would make sense seeing as this game is on a computer based game store. As you progress through the game you get the hang of the controls which are similar to Half Life 2 (it is a mod of Half Life 2 after all) or, if you are not familiar with it, like other mods of Half Life 2 i.e. No More Room in Hell. The only complaint I have is the fact that you can't aim down the sights, making aiming difficult, and causing an unneccesary loss of bullets as you take multiple shots to down one zombie. But, as with the rest of the controls, aiming gets easier and I saw myself downing zombie with one simple headshot again.GraphicsAs with the controls, graphics are similar to higher quality mods of Half Life 2. I saw improvements in water effects, as well as shadows being darker and displaying a true sense of the absence of light when zombies would run out of it straight towards you. This carries over to lighting effects, with light being essential to the game unless you turn the brightness up, which makes getting the Estranged in the Dark acheivement a challenge. Depth of view effects were a nice touch, though there are small problems with it. One small problem I saw, was how your vision would still be blurred after opening a door, until being quickly adjusted. Again, a small problem, but it can't be overlooked. CharactersWhat few notable character there are in this game are boring without having a real backstory to them. Voice acting can sometimes seem unrealistic, as some voices are not getting their desired effect. John for example may have been trying to sound like he was truly affected emotionally by the strange disapearence of his wife and daughter, but instead sounded like he was trying to hold back a laugh. Characters also don't seem to react too much to transpiring events. John again, for example, shoots (a zombie as you later find out) someone in plain view of you. After you go up to him he acts like nothing happened at all, he doesn't try to explain the situation either. I for one would probably not trust someone who just fired a round into someone's head. Sound EffectsMusic play a key role in the beginning of the game, though its fades as you get deeper into it, as music changed when you enter a new room for example. The music definetely does scare you with it's creepy effects, as it made me think that something was just around the corner. Battle music always feels right as well as a kind of chase scene. Gun sounds are farily realistic, as well as splash and breaking glass sound effects. ReplayabilityWith the challenge of acheivements always present, I could definetely see myself playing the game one or two more times, though anymore would be pushing it. The reason for this is that you come to expect and memorize where zombies are as oppose to when you first play the game through. Wrap Up Estranged Act 1 is a perfect example of the thought that games don't have to be made by enormous corporations, or be extremely taxing to your PC to be good. A zombie shooter with touches of horror as well, I would definetely recommend playing through at least once, to get the feel of what it means to be estranged. Story: 9.7/10 Well thought out with very little questionable partsPlayability: 7/10 Easy to learn controls, however no aiming down sights?Graphics:  9/10 Impressive graphics for games like this; Depth of view issuesCharacters: 4/10 Uninteresting characters with little emotion and unrealistic voice tonesSound Effects: 9.5/10 Musical horror effects start out strong but fade out later in the game, other music always fits the moodReplayability: 9/10 Acheivements offer multiple playthroughs as well as new challengesOverall Score: 48.2/60			"

												This is not a good game by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a good bad game. The enemies, human or otherwise, are of no threat whatsoever unless you count the fact that they can open doors. Past combat the level of challenge is zero. Puzzles are dead simple. The game doesn't setup an appropriate motivation for your fisherman turned mass murderer to start capping people, and it's fairly common to get stuck on enviromental objects and have to reload. It's essentially an amped up Half Life 2 TS, but it comes at the right price.			"

Very nice sounds and equally nice music, never did i really feel like the music was ""forced"" so to say, it all felt more or less natural. Gameplay ramps up nicely as you get farther into Act I, and it as well feels natural. Solid mod, can't wait to see if the Act II / III is good, if they come out.			"

												Estranged: Act I is the first part of a continuing series of games yet to come. You are a lone fisherman, whose ship is stranded on a mysterious island during a violent storm. But then you (the player) begin to ask yourself: What is this Island? How will I escape it and am I the only one here? Most of these questions are answered in Act I, but the game ends with a cliffhanger that leaves you not only curious but left in the dark with even more unanswered questions. The game is full of puzzles that require you to think, difficulty may vary depending on the player and the type of puzzle. The Zombies are agressive and they aren't the only things that want you dead. If you like games that have a story and are engaging, I recommend Estranged. If you do not, I recommend you give it a try.  I cannot wait for Estranged: Act II, whether it is free or not.			"

Of course, I look forward to the follow-up and wish the maker well in creating the rest of this mod. Decent pacing with enough hints to get you moving forward without holding your hand, the game actually feels like it's letting you play and figure things out on your own. I will be honest, I went into the game expecting a creepy horror game and was only slightly disappointed. However, despite my expectations, the mod is well-made and I did enjoy it.			"

												Not a bad game but it turned out to be one of these ""walking simulators"" where you just walk a (very) linear path, greet some silly zombies and solve very minor puzzles. Therefore it's not a really exciting game. Only at the very end you get thrown into some real gunfights.In short: Not a bad game but nothing special either.			"

												Holy sh*t. Not many games gave me the chills like this game. The zombie factor is perfect. Not too much that makes you hate killing zombies like Left 4 Dead, but just enough to provide apprehension of running into one. Love the scarce ammo. Can't wait for Act 2!!!			"

												Great world improvements, great atmosphere, great storyline, graphics are also splendid (especially the lighting and HBAO, unlike most Source-based games/mods), and chilling-yet-awesome soundtrack. But not much achievements, though. And where's the 'fill the bucket' mission? I like that task.I've played all the beta versions before, but the alpha version is way more good. I'm curious why did they changed the corporation name from 'Omnicorp' to 'Arque'?Still, I'll rate the game 8.5/10. Can't wait for 'Estranged: Act II'.			"

												I was somewhat disappointed after playing through this. From what i read from the other reviews, i expected it to be excellent and top of my ""pay attention to"" list. Sadly, after playing it, it just felt like any other mod. Then again, I might of been spoiled from Underhell.First off, the first thing i noticed was that the voice acting was pretty good, and excellent if you consider this is a free mod. It can't compare to Underhell's voice acting, but then again, Underhell has voice acting better than most comerical games.Secondly, I have to admit the map design is pretty damned great, resembling some of the orginal half life 2 levels. I consantly explored everywhere I could, hoping not to miss any of the beautiful landscapes. Some of the tiny touches too, like a newspaper you can read and a guard's humorous note, really add to the feeling this is a real place. Combined with the Voice acting, this is some of the best immersion i have ever experienced in a mod, on par with half life 2.The story is a bit... meh. Ignoring the plotholes of your guy being a fisherman that somehow seems to have military level training with firearms, it feels like the standard Zombie Movie/Zombie Game plot. Evil Organization unleashes zombies on island and stops anyone from rescuing for help, and you, crash landing on the island, need to go and stop them. Its horribly cliched.Where the mod TRUELY falls flat, however, is in the gameplay. You can only hold one weapon at a time(yes, you can't even carry the one melee weapon in the game with you along with a gun), and they don't really... feel very interesting. The Smg is the same as the half life 2 one, and the hammer reskin of the crowbar has some wonky animations(doesn't feel like I should be doing any sort of damage with the swings). The pistol on the other hand, looks and feels great. Onto actual gameplay, the zombies(and thats what im assuming they are) aren't much of a threat. They are slow, do low damage even when they hit you, can you can 1 shot them with the pistol. The whole first part of the game is super easy. Even when you lose you lose your gun and you are stuck with the hammer, they don't feel like much of a threat, as you can hit them 3 times before they can even finish a swinging animation. By the time the company soliders show up, its very close to the end of the game, and they where also pretty meh. Except for one case with one moving in a patrol pattern, they simply stood still and shot full auto at you, with almost aimbot level aim. Fighting them turned into a case of who hit who first.Now, you might be wondering how I can recomend this game even with my 'hate'. I recomend it, because it is free, and the mapping is amazing. Plus, i know this is not finished. Im hoping ill find this again one day and it will be a lot better than it is right now. This has a good future ahead of it, as long as the creators work on the story and gameplay. Ill give this a 7/10.On a side note, it is rather short, but that is to be expected from it being Act 1 out of a planned three Acts. So don't expect this to fill up more than a single day. "

												I recomend this game because it's free and it does run on Linux. But it does have some flaws, the whole puzzle solving feature is only enlightened on the first parts, picking weapons from the ground doesn't grant you ammo, and you can carry only one gun at the time. The story is confusing and rather mainstream, but the graphics are pretty neat.			"

												Estranged: Act I, Where do I begin? This game is unlike many others, the atmosphere is thrilling, (this game is best played in a dark room), the gameplay is excellent, and the mystery behind it all. You are put alone, through a proverbial torment, a childs nighmare after watching a scary movie. Despite it's short length, Estranged: Act I has become one of my favourites to just sit down and play over and over. There is so much to explore and find this game is great. And the best part, its FREE.10/10I hope Estranged: Act II comes out soon.			"

												Okay,Pros: GWHAFICS GHWAFICS GWHAFICS!!, Extremely good voice acting, interesting story, very Half-life-ish mechanics, almost Dishonored style world interaction, and last but not least chair tipping.Cons: The use of the DEFAULT Kleiner model just ruined any and all immersion, insane loading times, if you try and quick save while the game is loading the tiniest amount of data IT WILL CRASH, cumbersome FOV, bullets do WAY TOO MUCH damage to you in comparison to your enemies, low ammo at all times, cheating enemy AI, and just bad combat in general.Overall: There are quite a bit of flaws, there could be more. Towards the end the game just...sucked. If you have HL2, and want something different, download it and play it.			"

												The strong suit of Estranged are its well crafted environments. I enjoyed the two hours it took to play through the initial episode. Neither combat nor puzzle solving are especially challenging or varied, but the atmosphere is nicely presented and curiosity keeps you moving forward more than game play. Its strongest moments come up front when the story is very much a mystery but it peeters out a bit as you come to realize it is a pretty straight forward afair of zombies and corporate/state cover up of said zombies. But again, the atmosphere keeps you moving along and opening doors to see what's next.			"

												If you're in for a short and captivating story, which will inevitably put your brain to serious labour and send chills down your spine at times, Estranged is the way ahead. Take note, this is just the first Act, more are likely to come and add to the delusionary and mind-boggling series.			"
