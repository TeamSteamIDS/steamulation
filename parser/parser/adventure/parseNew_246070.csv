												Do not buy this game. This is not the programming game you want to buy. It is not worth the money, and it is not currently, by my standards, a finished puzzle game, much less one that teaches any reasonable amount of programming.It is a beautiful idea for a game, and a very clever title for the idea. But this game does not live up to the beauty of its idea. If you must buy it, wait for the game that purports to teach programming to at least be itself adequately programmed. That is not the game that is available right now.Hack 'n' Slash is a game in which you swing your USB sword to, instead of slaying things, set their hit points to 0. I can offer no higher praise for the integration of the ""hacking"" in the game for the first few minutes of gameplay. Instead of attacking the turtle, you hack its allegiance so it becomes your ally. Instead of finding the right order of blocks to push for a block pushing puzzle, you simply hack the number of remaining pushes allowed for one block. Reprogramming the movement of the guards was hilarious.Then, just as quickly as the fun begins, the clever puzzle design disintegrates.The coding is still painfully inaccessible and unserviceable—if you're a programmer, it's boring and tedious for no apparent reason, and if you're not a programmer, there's no chance you'll really even understand the puzzle as it's presented. As an experienced programmer, putting together the clues using detailed understanding of how programming generally works got me through the ""programming puzzles"", but left me painfully frustrated by how obtuse they were guaranteed to be for someone who didn't automatically know that ""HackBlock 1"" is probably the same in-game object as ""blocks[1]"". I see no reason to relate a red letter 'a' directly to a red diamond symbol other than educated guesswork. A game which requires trial and error is fine, but a game that requires too much backtracking between trials and crashes when you don't know what you're doing is not a game that encourages learning.The most frustrating thing for me was when I immediately saw the solution the programmers intended, but also that there were far more obvious and trivial solutions. Let's take a hypothetical locked gate as an example: if instead of entering the prescribed password, you simply toggled some output value from ""false"" to ""true,"" you might bypass the intended lesson entirely. Not only are the puzzles poorly thought out, they don't even enforce the intended lesson. I can't imagine anything other than inexperienced players blundering their way through the ""puzzles.""The game crashes when the built-in LUA interpreter falls apart, because instead of being a sandboxed interpreter, the game runs code you throw at it natively, and I wouldn't be surprised if the game was a legitimate security vulnerability for getting admin access to the local machine. What's worse, the programming conventions used are distracting, if not outright confusing. The variables that are useful to hack aren't even always next to the lines of code they relate to, requiring mundane back calculation or walking around to find the right variable.Imagine if a game that wasn't about programming presented these qualities: for instance, you found yourself in a hallway with five switches, and the purpose of the switches only marginally explained to you. There is absolutely no feedback to tell you what each switch does, unless you've solved the puzzle, or unknowingly triggered a fail state. What's worse, these fail states cause you to lose any forward progress made not only on the current 5-switch puzzle, but also the 3-switch puzzles that you've managed to solve in the same hallway. This is not what I consider a good puzzle game, but it is exactly the sort of scenario Hack 'n' Slash unforgivingly drops players into. Where traditional games undergo thorough testing to prevent the player from causing crashes, Hack 'n' Slash markets the total (and completely unnecessary) instability of the game as a feature. Can you imagine an point and click adventure game that crashed when you used the wrong item on the wrong target? How is this fun for the player? Why aren't they simply preventing unnecessary modifications, and adding iteration limits and variable scopes to prevent accidents? The puzzles are poorly designed, and just aren't fun.And now for the rest of the game. As adventure games go, this game feels incomplete: shoddy collision detection make movement a confusing dance, total lack of information on what can and can't be done makes even thinking about solutions total guesswork.Traditional adventure games leave a trail of breadcrumbs to lead you along, and a useful assistant who makes sure the player is at least going in the right direction. Not so in this half-done game. Between acts the player is expected to know where they should romp for five minutes to get to the next destination, and while this could be ""part of the puzzle"" in some twisted logic the latter half of the game is a series of tedious activities: wander until you reach the next scripted destination, randomly permute code until success. Nothing is named in a useful fashion, nothing is provided, and the game gives you more ways to cause a crash than it does any meaningful direction towards a smart solution. There's invariably way too much information available as ""clues,"" and the player has no idea what's useful and what's just there because the programmers thought it would be cool. I spend so much time wading through unnecessary details for reasons I don't understand to solve puzzles that aren't even intellectually challenging so much as they are a series of inside jokes. The final puzzles aren't so much arcane wizardry as they are exercises in variable tweaking, and there's not even any guide to explain which variables should really be tweaked to start with. Behaviors not explained before or after a particular puzzle are used and so players shouldn't even know to try the things the developers expect us to know.As someone who actually studied computer science, incidentally, I'm disappointed by what the game refers to as algorithms. None of the implementations are meaningfully quantifiable algorithms. This is what most saddens me, to be honest: there are so many beautiful, challenging, and meaningful problems in computer science that programming games could explore and teach. Even the final chapter of the game, purported to be a legitimate programming challenge with actual security applications, boils down to a series of password reading tricks used earlier, or the mundane ""wander, hack, permute"" process. I was hoping to maybe see some binary search, or some loop iteration, or even just simple mathematics to inject actual challenge into the game, but instead found myself going through the exact motions I go through when debugging ugly, poorly written code. ""If x ==y continue"" tells me nothing about how many lines are actually part of the if statement, by the way. LUA probably wouldn't have been my first choice as a language for making the code readable to nonprogrammers. Might have been smarter to create a simpler, if still Turing complete domain specific version of LUA that doesn't throw unfamiliar terms like jump statements and closure operations. I'm saddened by the possibility that LUA was chosen not because it's a beautiful, educational language but because it made executing user code easy (and highly destructive and universe-collapsing). I spent more time shaking my head at the programming choices than solving the puzzles, and even more time wondering why Double Fine failed to even make the non-programming parts of the game enjoyable. It plays like a very promising alpha, which would be encouraging, if the game wasn't being marketed as a full release. This is not a programming game. This is not a well-programmed game. And what's worse, this is not even a good game. I'd save your money if I were you.			"

												A very interesting concept, but I see several issues with this game.Cons:* It's absolutely NOT recommended for people with no programming/algorithmics knowledge. The first half of the game should be doable by almost anyone, but as soon as actual code is shown and modifiable (end of Act 4 and all of Act 5), it can be overwhelming.* The code you can hack is displayed in a very hard to understand way. I heard it's based on the game's Lua bytecode. Why not let people see/modify the source code instead? Bytecode is not meant to be read by humans.You can see the code as text, or there is a sort of visual representation with machines and crystals, but it's just too confusing. As a professional programmer, I grasped most of it, but I think most people won't.* The graphics look mostly bad. The characters are OK but the backgrounds... The level design is meh, with many useless paths and dead ends.* The music is forgettable* A bit on the short side, with low replay value unless you just want to test how far you can go with the hacking. But then why not program your own game instead?* The ending is surprising but weird, nonsensical and abrupt to me.Pros:* Awesome base concept* Some of the puzzles are quite cleverly made* The ""Double Fine touch"" is here, with quirky characters and dialogs, but it's a bit weak. Psychonauts is way better in that regard.* It's challenging for your brain for those who like that.Not really a pro nor a con:* Near the end I think I skipped an important scene completely with hacking. That's pretty cool but I'm missing part of the story!* It's only in English. I didn't really mind even though I'm French, but some people will. I think it would be really hard to translate such a game anyway (all the game's variables and functions would have to be translated)Conclusion:If you are a programming junkie, a bit curious, or just want to challenge your brain, buy this game when it gets cheaper. Otherwise I think it will just be a frustrating experience and you will not enjoy it.			"

												Recommended for programmers/tinkerers. Others will probably be confused and disappointed. This review itself will likely not make that much sense to the latter group.It's in the current Humble Bundle Weekly at the $1 tier (ends 2015-11-5). Worth it at that price for sure.This is not a ""programming"" game (like TIS-100, SpaceChem, Human Resource Machine, etc). It is a ""hacking"" game.It is definitely not a ""Hack and Slash"" game as it may seem to be at first glance. There is very little of anything resembling a normal game here, although it has a vaguely Zelda-esque facade.As a minor connoisseur of sorts when it comes to programming/hacking games, I'm not aware of any other game that has done what HnS has (Edit: The more recently released Else Heart.Break() seems to do something similar, but I haven't played it yet).The title is more of a proof of concept than a fully featured game. Not really a surprise at this point coming from Double Fine. But the proof of concept alone should be worth the price of admission and the time for those interested in this sort of thing.Most of the game is written in Lua (a very common game scripting language). The game (gradually) exposes the ability to modify itself, but only to a limited extent. You start off being able to only modify some instance variables of certain entities (and later a handful of game instance globals, if you can find them). Eventually you gain the ability to examine the code of just about everything, but you can only modify constants (including the names of called functions in some cases). You can also swap a few operators.Although that sounds like a lot of power, there is actually fairly little you can do that is interesting or useful. The majority of the ""puzzles"" reduce to finding the right variable or operator to alter in typically fairly mundane ways (e.g. flip a bool, comparison operator, make a number very large or very small). That's not all that surprising considering how difficult it is to accomplish something more meaningful from a gameplay perspective in this kind of system. But what is there is reasonably fun/amusing. And thankfully it doesn't grow old because the game is quite short.Typically hackable entities can be ""hacked"" (have their state/instance vars altered) by attacking them with a weapon. Later in the game, you gain the ability to hack into a larger variety of entities by actually modifying the code (again, only specific parts of the code). This is done in an unusual, noteworthy fashion:Instead of simply editing the code text/values directly, a visual/spatial representation of the code is created in which you can walk around and modify particular constants and operators.Strangely, when the game shows you the Lua code, it doesn't actually show you the raw code. Instead, it displays it in a rather strange, awkward syntax that actually makes it more obfuscated than it is in the original Lua (for a typical programmer, at least). I guess it could be said that this better immerses already experienced programmers, forcing them to ""learn"" the system even if they already know Lua.Near the end of the game, you also gain the ability to browse the entire(?) lua game source. This is represented as a library in game, where each level of the library is a directory, and staircases are the means for directory traversal. Individual files are books on a bookshelf that can be stored in your inventory for direct hacking later. Again, despite how much power this seemingly conveys, the actual usefulness of this is quite limited. But it's a cool experiment.			"

Disclaimer: My programming knowledge is almost zero, except for easy stuff like a bit of html, some BASIC from 20 years ago and some understanding of general programming logic. I've played the game until act 4, after a set of 3 easier puzzles that were quickly followed by puzzles incomprehensible to me, no matter how hard I tried.Overview: Hack 'n' Slash is a puzzle game with a small share of action. The puzzles are all related to programming, starting with simple stuff anyone should be able to sort out, but rapidly escalating to puzzles that require solid programming knowledge. You control a girl with her sprite friend and they collect tools that help you with the hacking, while trying to ultimately defeat an evil wizard.Pros: Awesome concept Cute graphics Interesting puzzles (as far as I was able to solve them, anyway) The puzzles starting in the act 4 seem great, too--even better, actually-- if you're able to understand them, that is Funny characters and dialogues (but nothing special or memorable) Probably a good programming training session (but I'm just guessing)Cons: Almost no tutorial when the hacking gets really hard--if they had taken their time to make a great tutorial, it would probably be playable by everyone, but it isn't Requires solid programming knowledge and it really should be written in huge letters somewhere in the store page--since it's not, it feels like they're trying to fool people into buying a game they won't be able to play Action part of the game is clumsy, boring, and totally unnecessary Although there's controller support, it sucks--stick to your keyboard Music is a bit annoying, even when you haven't reprogrammed the game speedBought on: I got it as a Christmas gift from Sweetheart Gamer! Thank you, despite everything. Sorry to rate a gift with thumbs down (again, but fair is fair). Well, if you care to know, it's been as cheap as US$ 4.54 (R$ 8,83) on Steam.Verdict: If you can't program (lua, I guess), STAY AWAY! You won't learn it in this game. You might get through acts 2 and 3, but you'll be stuck on act 4, and I'm 100% sure of that. And starting a game you won't be able to complete without a guide is more frustrating than not even trying. Well, if you are familiar with programming, lua, and all that stuff, then you'll probably enjoy it, despite its other minor flaws. So it's a thumbs down for most people, thumbs up for a few others.Similar games: If you ended up on this game while looking for something similar to the classic 2D Zelda, you should try Ittle Dew, for both Ittle Dew and Hack 'n' Slash have the same sense of humor, graphics have their similarities--only Ittle Dew doesn't require you to know how to program.

												Does this game have a brilliant concept?Yes.Is this game enjoyable for the general public?Eh.It's quite special for a developer to get an idea that rubs down to: Hey, isn't it fun to let players alter the game the way they like and hack almost anything? But, somewhere down the line of production, I guess they forgot to realize how user-unfriendly this game can get beyond Act 4. It's not puzzle, oh no, not your every day 'explore-and-find-clues' puzzle, it's a confusing, excrusiatingly painful coding experience. Worst of all, this game -crashes-, and by that I mean ALL the time. Any event where you mess up on either hacking things, digging into Algorithm, you have the potential to slam into different kind of bugs that the developer didn't iron out. If you hit too many bugs, it wouldn't even allow you to go back to your previous setting (An item in game that basically rewind what you do), forcing you to shut down the game and restart. Option menu is totally devoided of any options other than choosing fullscreen/window mode, as well as sound. Where is the graphic options?All around, it's a game with potential, but is underdeveloped. It's baffling that this game can even win an indie game award with the state it currently is in.			"

												Great concept, horrible exceution. Buy only on sale. If you've never written a single line of code in your life this game could frustrate the crap out of you.Up until the 4th act ""hacking"" is very repetitive, but should be easy enough for everyone. I was hoping for the part of the game when editing of the code itself starts but it doesn't. Ever. What starts in act 4 is just bad. I've never programmed in LUA before, but why the game developers chose to mix scripting with some colorful gems and going ""into"" scripts is beyond me. It's confusing. Why they chose to hammer people down after relatively easy first part of the game by denying us real power? A real editor/command line to modify/hack the code?I was hoping for something in a line of the CodeCombat browser game (Google that if you want). This way Hack 'n' Slash could actually teach some programing to people and giving a player more freedom.5/10 (for graphics and general DubleFine dialogues).			"

Early Access Review
								Hack n' Slash is in early access, but it is magnificent already.Bugs are present, so if that bothers you, you may want to steer clear until v1.0. I havent come across anything game breaking, but I have encountered a few instances of the game freezing or inventory scrambling. Regardless of this, I have really enjoyed my playthrough so far.  If you're the least bit interested in this games mechanics and can handle a few minor hiccups, I'd say go for it.			"

												POST-RELEASE EDIT:I'm a bit disappointed, I'll be honest. Just finished the game a few minutes ago. I'm happy to say that the bombs are great, they work very well. And the completed Act 5 is nice. But that's about it. After beating the game, I really don't have any incentive to go back and play it again. I know I still have secrets to discover, artifacts to find, and thousands of lines of Lua to exploit, but there's no reason why I should. I think the only hope this game has of being played again is if I forget how I solved all of the puzzles, and forget that I spent $20 on this thing. Unless there are even more updates coming in the future, this game is not worth $20. Maybe half that, at the most.You had so much potential, Hack 'n' Slash. I'm so sorry.Until that potential is met, rating revised to a solid 7/10 for gameplay. However, too overpriced at $20. Would not recommend.OLD REVIEW:A great game, even at this current state. Yes, it's unfinished, but what is present already, when combined with the game's visible potential, makes it worth the money.A few things I would really like to see in future updates:* a completed Act V* a larger world to explore* something to explain why the game starts at Act II instead of the logical Act I (or even Act 0, considering this is about hacking)* more uses for the bombs (You get to use them once! That's not enough!)But as it is, it's not bad, if a little pricey.7/10, potentially up to 8/10 or even 9/10, depending on update content.			"

												This game does not do a good job of explaining its mechanics, let alone its higher-level concepts. What begins as a generally fun and interesting educational puzzle game quickly devolves into a frustrating mess. The conveyance and presentation of important concepts, most notably the algorithm puzzles, is opaque. The paper-thin storyline, flat dialogue, and cardboard-cutout characters do nothing to make the puzzle headache worthwhile.There are definitely a couple of good ideas that went into this game, but they're not developed adequately in the short playtime. The scarcity of interactive elements in the world makes the whole experience feel perfunctory and lifeless. With the sole exception of the clever and engaging boss fight with the corrupted turtle king early in the game, none of this really felt very fun. I managed to inadvertently skip about half of the prison level by rushing past the boss with the movement speed hack, which screwed me a bit later in the game as I was unable to decipher the runes made visible with the Third Eye Hat. The feeling the experience most left me with overall is confusion and frustration.It took me about 3 hours in total to complete Hack N Slash, but I gave up and consulted a walkthrough upon being trapped in the algorithm puzzle caves of act IV. Had I not, I would likely never have been able to finish the game. Perhaps everything would have made more sense to a programmer, but it didn't to me and Double Fine made little effort to ameliorate that. Overall, this game is not worth $20. Pick it up for $5 if you can, but you're not missing much if you give it a miss entirely.			"

												As a progammer and a lover of puzzle games, I figured that I'd brave the mixed reviews since I fall within the target demographic. Despite that, this game was a disappointment. The puzzles are either uninspired or obscure, the game is liable to crash often, and the dialogue is grating.Some of the early problems were promising, but simple. ""Hacking"" objects to modify high-level object properties made for some novel challenges, but there are few enough hackable objects and few enough properties within each that most of these puzzles reduced to ""hack problem object, adjust obvious property."" At some point in the game we are given the ability to actually examine and edit objects' code. Unfortunately this also leads to either frustrating or overly simple puzzles. Many times in the game we simply enter an object's code and change it's ""isHackable"" property to true, then hack the object and change some obvious property. A fine puzzle to solve once, but to use it at several critical points seems repetitive.I'm not familiar with Lua (the langauge the player manipulates in-game) and figured this game would at least give me a sense of the language. This was not the case. The structure of the in-game code was such that its purpose was often impossible to decipher - loops and conditions were presumably present but all code was displayed in a perfectly linear manner and I emerged even more confused about Lua than when I began.Most of the late-game programming puzzles offer up the bit of code to be modified pretty easily. Upon entering an object's code you can visit various subclasses and functions, most of which are long and clearly critical to the game's normal function. The game does allow you to visit these blocks of code (though this sometimes crashes the game with longer sections) and does allow you to modify them, but their size and codepenence generally means that no meaningful changes can be made without ""crashing the game"" (errors created by the player result in the ""end of the universe"" and you must reload), and puzzles are rarely solved by doing so.In contrast, other blocks of code have a very different style - short and with clearly labeled variables that pertain to the puzzle at hand. Identifying which blocks the game invites you to modify is pretty easy based only on this clear difference in style, and once you've found the critical function you can often change a simple boolean or integer without really understanding what you're doing, and solving the puzzle.This is not to say the game is a breeze - many puzzles are not obvious. The challenge comes not from the innovation of the puzzles but by their obscurity. No direction is given to the player in several key sections, and it's often unclear whether you simply don't have the object required to get past a challenge, or if you haven't dig deep enough in the code.The final puzzle was especially unrewarding. A deep delve into the final boss's code was fun, and I finally mananged to convice the boss to destroy itself. Success! ...or, nope, I'm just stuck in the boss screen with no boss. I reloaded and tried a different tactic, but this one defeated the boss as well as destroyed the universe. Suspecting a bug, I turned to a guide which presented a third, equally viable code tweak which was arbitrarily selected as the ""correct"" one by the designers and moved the plot forward.I also was able to accidentally skip a final puzzle by reloading at a particular spot (which I only realized by reading a guide after completing the game), which makes me unsure if this happened at other points in the game.A final note is the humor: The writers try painfully hard to make witty dialogue but it comes across as juvenile and bizzare. I'm a fan of good humor, high- or low-brow, but this game delivers neither. I DID finish the game in the hopes that such a novel concept would yield at least a few inspired puzzles or challenges, and admittely a few did come close. Riding the line between puzzle game and programming chalenge, ultimately the game fails as either. To programmers and puzzlers, I advise you to seek fun elsewhere.			"

												This game get a NO from me for several reasons.As a TL;DR here is a list- No objective indicator/map/sense of direction whatsoever- Extremely difficult to grasp system of functions etc- Frustrating atmosphere in general coupled with clunky controlsAs a more in depth version:The fact that there is no objective indicator or map or something may seem like a modern gamers lazy complaint, but it really isn't. For a game as complex as this there really should be an objective indicator for those who want to progress the story. Those who want to fiddle about with any piece of code they can touch can do that if they want, but for those who want to go towards progression at all times, this game is very frustrating. I found myself wandering aimlessly several times with not a clue where to go until I looked up a guide, or simply stopped playing in anger. To be clear: I was not stuck on puzzles, I just had no idea where to go to get to the next puzzle etc.The way the code is presented to you is very hard to understand. I am currently a computer science student at my university, so I know how to write code and make programs, mainly in Java, C, C++ etc, at the moment, and not Lua itself, but I know that no language looks like this game tries to make it look. Apparently it is based on the games Lua bytecode which FYI is not meant to be read by humans, it is meant for the computer to compile. If it were based on actual Source Code for the game, maybe it would be easier to grasp. But the implication of those weird crystals to represent hundreds of different things inside functions? Forget it. I can normally grasp programming ideas pretty quickly and easily, but in this game, I couldn't understand a thing during Act 5. This also links back to the previous point, if I was told perhaps what place to search in or maybe what function to investigate, not specifically what to do etc but at least a clue? Maybe then it would be easier to see what needed to be modified. Others may disagree with this one, but I personally found it very hard to grasp.The entire atmosphere of this game is basically designed to be annoying. The sounds get extremely repetitve and annoying e.g going in and out of several functions in short amount of time. This also ties in with the first point, when wandering aimlessly not knowing where to go, I get frustrated a lot easier, so this may contribute to the fact that I'm complaining about this as well.ALL IN ALL I think this game could have been great with different execution, and easier to understand interfaces/functions and such. As it is, I will not be completing it without a walkthrough of the (final?) Act 5, as I cannot progress on my own from here it seems.4/10EDITED 10/11/14I've been learning all about C this year in school, and I know now what the GOTO statements are really meant to do. You see these EVERYWHERE in the coding of the functions in the game, and they are one of the most out of date things ever. We learned in class that if you use Goto your code will be very difficult for people who are not yourself to read and manipulate so the fact that they spammed goto in the coding for this game is just ridiculous. It is much more clear to use definitive logic like if-else than goto. Although it is still valid syntax, stylistically it is horrible, especially considering this game was MADE to be read and manipulated...2/10:)			"

												This isn't a Zelda game, this isn't entirely a programmer's game (though you do learn some things about programming/code from it). It's a cheater's (and a critical thinker's) game. The only way to beat it is to cheat. No, really. The game kept it's difficulty consistent, as long as I cheated where, when, and how it's appropriate to. Simply put, it's like Game Genie/Gameshark/Action Replay/Cheat Engine not being used to cheat, exactly, but more as a series of tools to make progress, one way or another. For example, instead of avoiding enemies, be an enemy, and you'll hide in plain sight. Simple as that.All the *cough*narrow-minded*cough* nay-sayers can say all they want, I enjoyed this. Took some serious lateral and Gestalt thinking in some areas to make the most of my situations. Ironically, I'm not the brightest person to play this game, but more often than not, I was able to keep a grasp of the big picture. I barely know crap about programming (learned a little more, with active examples as game elements), and yet, I beat it the same day I started it (with a few accidental crashings by my own clumsy code); simply put. Once more, to win, you must cheat. You don't need to be a 1337 hax0r; just be wise when, where, and how to modify things.This game pretty much summarizes one of my life mottos the best:""There's always a simple solution to an otherwise complex problem.""Sometimes, people just think too hard, or not enough. Wisdom is required in this game more than intelligence. Oh, and before you accuse me of using FAQs and the like, the most I ever needed one was for a story item that seemed out of reach, with nowhere else to go (I did things correctly before looking, apparently I just encountered a bug when trying to collect it that prevented me from being able to pick it up). That aside, I figured out the rest. Oh yeah, and I managed to skip one or two parts by merely brute-forcing my own solution the developers didn't think of (one word, bridges. I didn't need to code a part of it to pass ^_^. Did my own brand of cheating in a game about cheating.).			"

												Half-way through the game the tutorials and ease of play are thrown out of the window for heavy convoluted scripting puzzles, which you won't know how to complete without a decent understanding of programming/game design/and debuging.The game developers didn't want to decide if they wanted to make a game for kiddies who have never coded (which started the game with gear that is akin to learning visual basic front-ends) or veterans who have an idea of what they doing (going super script heavy the last half of the game)This indecision of how they wanted to make a game really hampered it. The first half was boring for me, but the second half really caught my interest as I hacked my way into areas I wasn't supposed to be going. But then again, after you get the super hacking powers the game gets vague on what you were doing.This game is unfinished. It presents a security risk already demonstrated with the community workshop mods available for it. (opening up other programs on your comptuer) And feels like it was rushed to be finished in less than 2 months dseign and development time combined.I would reccomend it to anybody who's up for a debugging challenge. I wouldn't reccomend it for people who haven't read a line of code before though. And I wouldn't reccomend downloading any of the workshop mods available for it.I really wish this was something morethan what it is. But as of right now, it's just a proof of concept, and a reminder of what could have been.			"

												TL;DR ----This game has a great concept and art style but ultimately fails to provide a good gameplay experience.Great concept that works for the start of the game. Later on it devolves into messy visual rooms of code that are more difficult to understand than actual code. Useless for someone without an understanding of coding concepts and for anyone else too simple to break through.The story is rather dull and lacks direction. A huge amount of my time spent in this game is simply wandering around the world trying to figure out where to go rather than actually solving any puzzles.The art style is very attractive but gets ruined by an item picked up later in the game which puts a messy overlay over this.This game could really have benefitted with additional content, more purpose made interesting puzzles, a well thought out driving story rather than a balled up handful of clichés. The concept provides a basis for a useful way to introduce people to the concepts of programming which they managed well to a certain point after which it feels they lost focus, gave up and stamped it as finished.The concept is great hopefully future games will learn from this game and improve upon it and create something fun and educational.

												TL;DR: Short, buggy, hard for programming illiterates. Only buy if it's 50%-75%; even at $13.37 (*sigh* that's what I paid) it feels like a rip off.The game is entirely too short (5ish hours, took me 7 or so because I was stuck quite often) and quite difficult for someone without any programming knowledge. One puzzle literally took me an hour because I could not figure it out. Near the end of the game, you can skip a portion of events by changing one event for another.The interface is a real doozy at times, too. It took me a few minutes to get in the exact right spot to hack your sprite, and it also took me a couple minutes to find the exact right spot to grab the loupe. The game froze at one point; forgot how I made that happen.Some of the items seem redundant. You get a hat that lets you see overlays, then not even ten minutes later, you get an item that lets you toggle the overlay so you can use other items.That said, this game is fairly unique and relatively enjoyable... despite getting stuck in three or four different places. Personally I'd only pick it up if it's 50%-75% off.			"

TL;DR: A unique game for programmers, not an RPG at all but more of a programming puzzle game. I guess the programming part is why a lot of people don't enjoy it, though. If you know how to program and enjoy programming puzzles, definitely buy it when on sale.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-At first the game seems like some normal adventure game, with the quirk that you can plug your sword into some monsters and change some of the way they behave. Nice but limited, it's a game after all and most people enjoy this part.Once you progress, you get more powerful abilities. If you though editing a bunch of variables was cool, think again. Once you progress you can change the actual game source code...THAT BLEW MY MINDThe code editing does have some limitations: you cannot delete lines of code, but you can change the logic used. And if you mess around too much you'll crash the game. When it crashes you can go back in time to earlier states: it has version control. If you know what you're doing it's not a hard game at all and most puzzles are pretty straight forward.The problem with it is that the story and pacing could have been better, and it seems that the narrative is only a means to string together the different puzzles.

												It's a neat concept, but once the novelty wears off it really just feels tedious rather than fun. Come to think of it, it reminds me of a better attempt at those awful educational games from the 90s but about programming concepts instead of the Oregon Trail. It gets an A for effort, but I really wish I'd waited for the inevitable sale. I doubt they'll be able to sell this at full price for long because there's just not enough value in it. At this point, all we can do is hope the mods add significant value.			"

												This game feels a bit cheap at first and really lacks some polish, but its later stages most definitely make up for all its flaws! As you progress through the game, you'll get more and more control over the world as you literraly hack deeper and deeper into the code of the game. Once you manage to get deep into the latest act, this gets pretty insane and, dare I say, absolutely brilliant. It's really nice to see that the author of this game managed to push its crazy but greatly refreshing concept so far! Double Fine still delivers.Much recommended! but definitely not for everyone			"

Early Access Review
								Type of Game:Action/Adventure Hack and Slash Puzzle Coding Simulation (phew!)Version Played:Early Access PC version through SteamSimilar Games:The Legend of Zelda, 3D Dot Heroes, and, to a lesser degree, Psychonauts (mostly due to design and humor)The Good:- The game maintains DoubleFine’s wonderful quirky sense of humor, game design aesthetic, and overall charm.- The “hacking” gameplay mechanic is a really unique and fun design choice. It basically allows you to edit the actual code of the game objects, which can lead to some enjoyable puzzles.- While the game begins similar to an action/adventure game, in that it focuses on combat more than elaborate “hacking,” it quickly transitions into a full-fledged puzzle game that focuses on coding solutions to problems.- The plot and storyline of the game is interesting and fresh in that “breaking the 4th wall” way.- The early-game code tweaking is empowering and gives a wonderful feeling of accomplishment when you solve a puzzle in an unique way.- Playing around with the variables of objects, such as their damage settings and idle settings, can create some unintentionally funny moments.The Bad:- As advertised before each play session there are a plethora of bugs, glitches, and missing features in this Alpha build. Some of the more bothersome ones were as follows:    -There is no way to exit the game. It will continue to run until you force the application to close using your operating system. Anyone that doesn’t have a decent understanding of computing will be completely lost and frustrated. This has thankfully been patched on May 30th with a complete menu interface when using ESC in game.    -Walking into a new area put me in the scenery that was off the main path, which caused me to keep from progressing. Using the “time reverse” ability simply replicated it each time. I was forced to start over.- The game took me about two hours to complete the currently contained four Acts (a final fifth one is planned), but unless the final act takes a considerable amount of time to complete, I feel as though the game is too short.- The puzzles on the fourth Act were considerably more tedious than fun. The early debugging moments of accomplishment were quickly replaced with a monotonous requirement to run from one place to another memorizing bits of code.Can you play it while the children are awake?Yes! In fact I had a fun learning moment with my eight year old regarding the settings on each of the objects I was debugging. It may have piqued an interest in coding for him.Did I make time to complete it?I finished what was currently available, which were four Acts in total. It took me about two hours to complete.Redlight or Greenlight?This game is currently at a redlight.I do not feel the content that is currently offered is enjoyable enough for a $19.99 purchase. The game has too many game-breaking bugs and missing features. That said, I am sure that it will be well worth that price when they’ve made some substantial updates. If you are a fan of unique gaming ideas then I would encourage you to purchase it as a support mechanism as the end product will be well worth it. The game has a ton of potential, but is being held back in its current form.A Quick Look at Those Games You Might Buyhttp://www.gamersglance.com "

												The game lets you manipulate code somewhat, but not nearly as much as it makes you believe.On each object that you can hack, you can see all the 'relevant' functions and their code, which you kind of have power over.  Except that all you can actually change in the code is the value of a few of the assigned variables.As a result, most battles can be won by turning a true to false or vice versa, or incrementing /decrementing a number.This isn't TOO bad by itself.  But the game also gives you access to some strings and function calls that you can change which makes you think you could do a lot more more.  Except that the moment you change a single character in the string, the entire game crashes.  Sometimes the crash is contained by the game, and you just have to reload a save.  Other times (and quite often) the crash isn't contained and the entire game will actually freeze, forcing you to give exit the game and close the game with task manager.Overall, the game actually is somewhat enjoyable, but it's hard to say that it would really appeal to anyone.  Having more versatility for injecting your own code into creatures would have made the challenges more thought provoking, I think.Oh, before I forget.  There's also entire segments of the game, such as challenges that reset after a certain point in the game, and revisiting any of them and attempting to redefeat the challenge/boss will also cause the game to either crash or glitch out.

												I actually really enjoyed ~1 hour of this game, near the middle. Unfortunately, the first 2 hours of the game were a chore, and the last 2 hours were crazy buggy.Ultimately, the buggy nature of the last hour of the game is why I do not recommend it. Perfectly fine and valid solutions to puzzles sometimes won't work until you restart the game. Heck, even redoing the exact same change sometimes won't have the same result. In a game about coding, that's a huge no-no.I had a glitch at the end where I couldn't get into the epilogue, even though I hadn't edited anything that would affect it. I tried different things for literally half an hour. In the end, I restarted the game and somehow it worked. To add insult to injury, the ending was utterly unsatisfying, and left me feeling like I wasted my time.			"

												I really enjoyed this game up until act 4 where the hacking puzzles devolved into ""code algorithm"" which is by far the most confusing and frustrating part of the game to someone who has no understanding of programing. There was only one video on you tube that explained what to change to beat the puzzles, but since this video came out the developers have decided to change the second cavestash bridge puzzle setup so people like myself with no programming background can't just follow the walkthrough.I spent 2 hours trying to figure out the puzzle I was stuck on to no avail, and another 2 hours trying to find a walkthrough for the updated puzzle. There was probably less than an hour left in the game once I got past this BS. So if your thinking about buying this game and you arn't a programmer, be prepared to be frustrated with these last few programming math puzzles where they whole hacking aspect of the game takes a total nose dive as a personal F-you to the player.

Product received for free
												I liked this game! But I don't think I can generally recommend it.Note first: Hack 'n' Slash is not an action game; it's a programming puzzle game wearing RPG's clothing. If you're not already a programmer, this game isn't for you. The game gives some playful programming lessons for starters, but as a programmer and a teacher, I declare that the instructions they give you in this game are ABSOLUTELY ABYSMAL. I have NEVER, IN MY LIFE, seen such a poor explanation of a for-loop, one of the easiest things to explain. If you ARE already a programmer, though, this game may also not be for you. Their attempts to simplify the programming with colour schemes and visual metaphors, in my opinion, made things only more complicated. And most of all, you'll be grinding your teeth on how easy the solutions would be if you could just type your own lines (to manually call functions, for example), and how you're condemned to stitching together something from the arbitrary list of things you ARE allowed to edit.Why did I like it then? The conversation isn't very good, the character designs are of varying appeal (quite liked Isis, liked most of Alice, hated almost every single aspect of Bob), the music is pretty sweet though and the world is nice and vibrant. But at the end of the day, I liked it for being a puzzle game with a neat new idea to explore and that wasn't too easy or too hard. A nice little brain teaser with some creative ideas and a lot of heart.13 euro is way too much for this though.			"

												Right from the distorted growls of the intro screen, Hack 'n' Slash lets you know you're in for something a little different. Awakening in a dungeon, your character (who very much resembles Link) must find his way out. Meer moments after starting the game, the main weapon of the game appears..a usb sword.Interacting with objects in this game is unlike any other game before it. Upon coming into contact with items, your weapon displays an interactive box. This box shows a dumbed down version of some machine language akin to Java, setting up all your battles for the game. This is a feature that I loved, but to be honest, is going to put a lot of people off if they don't understand code. It also, while original, makes for a very boring game. Graphics This game is without a doubt beautiful. While not quite cell-shaded, it personally reminds me of The Legend Of Zelda: Windwaker. Throughout the game you will encounter things that break the mold of it's pretty design, such as the toxic whirls of poliution near the factory. Amazingly animated, Hack 'n' Slash is one of the best looking games I've seen in quite some time Gameplay Besides the interesting addition of using code to fight creatures and move blocks, there isn't much in the game that hasn't already been done before. It's a top down game much like the original Zelda games. If you've played an RPG, you're overly familiar with the design. Interacting with enemies and objects via the usb sword quickly becomes tedious, as the code box that appears takes you out of the heat of the moment, leading to a very jarring experience that leaves the game feeling more broken than finished. Story You are a red headed Link. Awakening in a cell, you quickly get your sword and break out of the dungeon you've been being kept in with your sprite named Bob. After this, I couldn't honestly tell you the story because I can't figure out if there even is one. Overall, I wanted to love this game. It's an original game (when it doesn't scream Zelda), but sometimes orginality just isn't enough. I quickly found myself losing interest in the title not because of the graphics or because I didn't want to find out the story, but because of the unique combat system. Every single item you interact with is code, and let's face it, code does not equal fun. "

												This is an adventure/puzzle/programming game, NOT an action game of any sort. The puzzles revolve around you manipulating the programming of various objects and npcs. That sounds good, but what you can edit is very limited, at least in the beginning. Other reviews say it opens up a lot later, but is still more limited than you probably desire. Anyway, the game has a lot of quirks and frustrating design choices that typical adventure games have, and those turned me off completely. Examples include:* Some objects or paths from one map to another are easy to miss. Not getting them means you eventually can't proceed but you won't know why because...* No objective display to let you know or even hint at what you should be doing* No map* Solutions to puzzles are sometimes very obtuseSo as you might guess from the above, I got lost for over an hour, with no idea what to do next. I ended up turning to a guide, and quit soon after.This is the kind of game where you need to be prepared to walk around every inch of the world looking for what changed since your last world-changing action. And you need to be ready to bash your head against the wall, trying everything you can think of, until you finally solve a puzzle. Lots of people find that fun. I don't. At all.			"

												This is an interesting puzzle game, but fails big for me in one aspect. Early in the game, I encountered a puzzle I could not solve, it was an easy solution, but my solution was not working. Finally, after using a walkthrough, I realized my solution was correct the first time. A bug in the game was not allowing my solution to work. I restarted and it worked. The above problem occured several times during my playthrough. It is difficult to recommend a puzzle game when you cannot 'trust' the game. I ended up having to keep a walkthrough up through the entire playthrough, for fear that I would waste hours looking for a solution that I had already come up with, but would not work due to a bug. Should these problems be solved, this would be a good game. For now, I don't recommend.			"

												Very short (5 hours start to finish, could be shorter if you don't try to overthink the last 'dungeon')You might find it interesting if you're interested in hacking, but there's a major issue that keep this game from feeling compltete. About halfway through the game, you get 'bombs' and a 'loupe' which let you alter certain constants in the game's code. Unfortunately, you can't change the flow of a program beyond altering TRUE / FALSE statements or switching ""="" to ""not ="" and visa-versa. Oh wait, you can actually also change strings, including which procedures are called... It's a shame that wasn't the solution to any puzzle, and you only have to modify strings in one room(spoiler: it's in the tutorial on how to use the glass /spoiler).

												The game was more annoying than fun. Maybe it gets better after more than one hour of gameplay, but I couldn't stand it. I've had enough of running around swinging my sword at rocks and editing the same attributes over and over again to make them pushable.I've had enough of falling off turtles moving into the water even though I'm standing right in the middle of their shells.And I'm fed up with bugs that made me unable to proceed, forcing me to use the map, which reset my progress on the current level.Cheesy unskippable (?) fairtytale-ish dialogues between the hero and its sprite sure don't help the game either.I'm extremely disappointed in this game especially since I am a fan of most works coming from Double Fine Productions.

												This game is a masterpiece, but you MUST be a programmer to be able to appreciate it. If you're not, you'll join the angry and frustrated group of people who is writing negative reviews. I read many people complaining about Act 4, but in my opinion, the game really started at Act 4, because that was the moment you could start messing with the source code, if you knew what you were doing. The only flaw, in my opinion, was choosing Lua as the programming language for players to mess with the source code. Lua is a terrible and unintuitive programming language that no one should learn. If developers used another sugar syntax language instead, like python, this game would have been perfect. But it's a masterpiece nevertheless. I do recommend it, if you're a programmer.			"

												I'd have to say that the concept behind this game is unique and really awesome. However, like many other negative reviews, the execution is lacking. I'd still recommend it, because I know that pulling this game off is extremely hard, and the devs did not fail terribly at doing so. They didn't pull it off great, just fine, but it's not game-wrecking either.Hack 'n' Slash has a certain sense of novelty before you buy it. I mean, you gotta change that boolean value to open the door! How cool is that?! But after a while, the more complex puzzles kinda ticks you off with it's complexity. People who have no prior background knowledge or experience with programming will find this game impossible to complete, and will leave it hanging in their game library.The game is largely unguided, so you can actually run off and get yourself into the wrong room/place before completing a certain task, or getting a certain artifact. The game takes the difficulty up a few scary notches late into the story, notably within the castle. I'm no elite programmer by any standards, and I find that giving the entire library of source code in the castle is a little overwhelming. I also did get lost a few times within the game, not knowing if I should proceed this way or that.All in all, I'd say it's a good challenge for those even with a strong programming background. I'd recommend this game, but only if you know some basic computer programming beforehand.			"

												 In 2012, Double Fine held their first public Amnesia Fortnight event, a previously internal two week event in which developers at Double Fine would break into small teams and create prototypes from game concepts which, if they showed promise would eventually be developed into full games.Today Hack 'n' Slash has been released marking it the first Amnesia Fortnight 2012 concept to be released as a full game (excluding the Leap version of Autonomous, which is not considered internally to be a compelete game, and the space station building sim SpaceBase DF-9 which is still currently a Steam Early Access title).Presented on the surface as a cute dungeon crawler, Hack 'n' Slash offers players the unique opportunity to modify the game's running code to create their own solutions to the puzzles presented.Project lead Brandon Dillon has often been quick to point out that whilst the in-game ""hacking"" interfaces may look pretty, the variables, visualisations and behaviours they expose are not chosen or crafted as game mechanics - they are the in-game debugging interfaces that the developers use when creating and testing the game.Hack 'n' Slash features the adorably charming art styles of Double Fine concept artist Raz Mavlian (after whom the protagonist from Psychonauts is named), depicting Alice and her sprite Bob (if you choose to keep their default names) in a striking and vibrant fairytale world.The game's tone and pacing are engaging, and whilst it's possible to break the game, it's surprisingly robust considering the type of things players are expected to do.It's been a pleasure to participate in the Steam Early Access community and watch the game get further refined. I'm excited to see the conclusion (I haven't yet finished), and what the community will be doing with the Workshop tools and source made available for modding.			"

												Note: That ""Reccomended"" does *not* apply to people who aren't programmers. This game isn't for you. If you aren't willing to do a little searching into how Lua do, then it's especially not reccomended for you. Lua's weird.It starts out a tad dull. Just a few silly ""hacking"" mechanics where you can do goofy things like make a turtle have 5e7 hp, do 2.4e6 damage, and friendly. That's alright and all. When I got the chance, I made sure to speed up time to the max and change my running speed to as high as possible.Then you get to the library.The library is where the game really starts. You can go into files as they're running and just screw with them. I once made the game freeze so hard Alt-F4 didn't work by changing a numeric for loop to going from 0 to 0.The code is difficult to edit in that most of the variables are locked from you and what operations are happening are immutable... you just get to screw with the rest. Testing for equality, I see? Let's make that testing for inequality. Working within the constraints given is extrmely entertaining, especially when you're doing stuff you were never intended to. I highly reccomend finding the book in the library for you.The actual game's puzzles tend to be solved by calling functions that are supposed to be called by the ""success"" script, which gets bypassed entirely, by way of the ""fight starts"" script. That or flipping a loadbool or five.The actual fun, though, that's when you start goofing around afterwards. Tired of the stupid green fire everywhere in the library? Well, what if the init file's ""scale"" were locked to 0? (It makes it invisible).TL;DR: Reccomended for people who like to break things and are already programmers, preferably fluent in Lua, since Lua's weird.			"

												Nowhere near as entertaining as I would have expected, especially considering it came from Double Fine - I love the concept and art style, but it feels like an early access game: Hastily built with very little polish, and with gameplay decisions that really put the player on the back foot. I really did want to to like it, but I just can't recommend it in it's current state :( Might play again if they do some bug fixes, updates or dlc.NOTE: Played it for close to 5 hours, but in offline mode on my laptop, so time wasn't tracked for some reason.

												I really liked this game.It won't teach you any real programming but requires you to think creative from time-to-time and it will ♥♥♥♥ with you on many levels.I did not encounter bugs, but sometimes it took me a little longer as hoped to find a solution.Is it worth the full price? Not sure, but right now it's on sale for -90% and it's worth that and more for sure!			"

												This game is a mess! I have encountedered so many glitches, like walking around out of the map, making a ""quantum leap"" forward, object that can't be picked up, crashing when exiting the game, etc. It can also become quite laggy despite the very simple graphics.The puzzles are not really clear on what you should try to do, and you can just skip some anyway in the most stupid way possible (like just running behind the warden instead of changing your name). There are so many variables you can change and serve no purpose whatsoever, so why were they added in the game?It is not clear who this games is for. Is it for kids, with this cookie artstyle and cheesy dialogue? Is it for people who want to learn programming? Is it for experienced programmers? In my opinion, it is not for any of those.This game is a mess, and I can't understand how this got released. Where is the quality control?			"

												This game has a great hacking concept and implementation of that concept; it’s a shame they had poor implementation on the basics.This game could be vastly improved with a map and current objective system. A map+compass system for dungeons borrowed from the Legend of Zelda series is needed. I spent a long time running around and backtracking not knowing where to go until I looked up a walkthrough or turned the game off in frustration.Being lost with no direction != a interesting challenge			"

												A strong (if confusing) start quickly leads to a downward slide into what can only be described as visual spaghetti code, with puzzles based mostly around reading the designer's mind and associating two visually unrelated in-world objects. Mechanics learned at the start of the game rapidly become effectively irrelevant, and collision detection is questionable.Forgivable for a game under $5 from a no-name publisher, but neither of those things are the case here.

												Short version: I'm not a fan.The bland, amateurish art style, the directionless narrative, the janky animations, and the loose, unfinished gameplay makes this a game I won't be returning to. The design on this one is just questionable all around, and doesn't do anything to draw out the fun possibilities of its central premise -- a premise that sounds delightful on paper. "

												I will say, the concept of this game is interesting in its own right. However, the execution is not very good.While the start of the game feels neat, it very, VERY quickly devolves into nonsense. Your helping hand is lost along the way and you're left not really understanding how things are supposed to work. New mechanics confuse the player and take a long time to understand. Puzzles are intricate, lacking any guidance as to what they are. Guessing is sometimes the best option and the only option to progress.While I admire the extreme level of depth to the full coding ability of the player, having them be able to physically modify the game's logical engine, it also means the player can very easily destroy everything.Look, the game is interesting, but it's not really fun. Too complicated and without clear direction, it feels like a mess. Trust me, I can code, and this confused me too.			"

												I just finished playing ""Hack 'n' Slash"". And by ""finished"", I don't mean ""completed the game""…I got all the way to Act 4, or the ""Tutorial"", at which point the game expected me to modify increasingly complex graphical abstractions of Lua script. I am not a programer (not because I haven't ever tried), so this is the point where the game stopped being at all fun. I'm not saying that I couldn't possibly have figured it out and continued progressing, but…I enjoyed what I played of this game, and don't regret purchasing it. However, I'm a bit disappointed that the game puts up such a brick wall, after what had been a fairly easy learning curve. I very quickly went from an ""I am smart"" feeling to a ""this is the point where I fail to 'measure up'"" feeling.			"

												Oh man... This game was terribly disappointing. Do NOT spend your time or money on it. I really can't tell who would be the proper fanbase for this game, or if there even is one.The whole concept is fun and would be awesome if it was applied well, but right now this game is just pretty poorly done. Sure, the graphics took some time, but they're nothing that drastically special. Other than that, most of the game actually seems pretty slapped together by the time you get through it.Firstly, I am a really experienced programmer, at least for 7-8 years now. Obviously, I'm no amazing specialist, but I know waaaaaaay more than anything this game goes into. Even so, I thought it would be interesting. Turns out not.The game has no difficulty as you're basically invincible from the beginning (which is possible through more than just 1 way). Even if you don't make yourself invincible, the fighting really isn't the focus and is pointless anyway.What's more important is the coding and hacking, which is a flop. The majority of the puzzles require barely any thought, except for one or two which require no real thought in programming but more thought in understanding what in the world you're supposed to be going for. For the former, most puzzles simply require setting a value to X or changing a ""greater than"" to a ""less than"" and you're done. For the latter, I mean things like what are required from the Library at the endgame--some are easy, some are just unintuitive to even know what you're meant to edit.Anyway, I beat the game in under 4 hours, probably closer to 3 hours as some of my gametime is spent with the game sitting up. For me, it was boring. For non-programmers, I feel like it would be a pain. The first couple of chapters would be fine, with some general understanding, but once you have non-programmers needing to delve 3+ levels into an object to find some function or variable, they're not really going to understand what this means anymore... they'll just sit with their game broken into 4 screens, confused.Lastly, the whole story was boring and the dialogue was TERRIBLE. Oh man, I wanted to punch the screen so much, I kept skipping through more dialogue the further I was through the game. It was cheesily stupid to the point where it was annoying. I can deal with cheesiness and love overly-stupid humor, but this game's dialogue was just the worst.Usually I don't come out this gritty about a game, but it's just not done well. I wanted this game to be great, especially from Double Fine, but nope. I've played many other Double Fine games on console before (and bought them again for the PC to play again), but I still stick by (as many others do) Psychonauts being their best.Anyway: Just don't buy this game.

												Hack 'n Slash is good game with lots of character. It has introduced new and new and almost well executed mechanics all with a great design. The levels in this game however can be extremely hard, to the point where you literally need to know how to hack to be able to play. Not a game for everyone, so I can only really recommend this to a set audience, people with good programming skills. It's a nice game, especially on sale or bundled. A cleverly designed game with some difficult puzzles and newly introduced, clever, mechanics. I'm going to have to give it a 8/10			"

												I am going to cautiously recommend this game for programmers only.While Hack 'n' Slash may appear to play like the old overhead Zelda games, it is a pure puzzle game.  Direct attacks are impossible, there is no penalty for dieing, and you don't need fast reflexes.I would give it a, perhaps generous, 7/10.  I base this on averaging the 5/10 I would give it for non-programmers since they can only play the first half of the game, and 10/10 for programmers who may find it enjoyable.Quite a bit of programming knowledge is assumed.  Almost nothing is explained.  At first, all you can do is alter the value of variables.  Soon “if” statements and logical operators are introduced.  The game spends quite a while at this level of sophistication, and an intelligent person that can read English can get by for the first half of the game.Intelligence is not sufficient.  Do you know the programming terms “function”, “iteration”, “modulo”, and “closure”?  Do you know programmer catchphrases like “hack the planet” well enough to recognize them even when letters are missing and the words are rearranged?  If not, you can't complete the last half of this game without a walkthrough.  Playing with a walkthrough will be no fun, since there is nothing to the game other than solving the puzzles.When the game does attempt to explain something, the explanations are often unhelpful, vague, and/or inaccurate.  For example, the game hints that a closure is “when a function has a pet function”.  That is unhelpful because it doesn't tell you what you can do with it, or what it's for.  Those features would help you use it to solve puzzles.  It is vague because it neglects to mention that a closure is an anonymous function (a function without a name), and that it can contain references to the values of variables in the enclosing scopes of where it was created.  Those features are why programmers care about closures.  It's inaccurate because a closure can be returned by a function.  It does not have to remain with the function that created it (that would be a nested function definition).  If none of that made sense to you, that's fine.  Just know that this game will not teach you to be a programmer.It is perhaps for the best that the game does not teach programming, because the code you interact with appears to be produced by a Lua disassembler.  There is no indention, and very little code structure.  “goto” is heavily used.  This does make the game challenging for programmers near the end, but it would teach bad practices.For programmers the first half of the game will be far too easy.  If you're creative you may be able to amuse yourself by solving the puzzles in roundabout or spectacular ways, but it is not required or rewarded.Most programmers should find the last half of the game difficult, but mostly fair.  Most of the difficulty comes from needing to debug (or carefully ‘bug’) code that is unfamiliar and poorly structured.  This is a valuable skill.The story is serviceable.  Neither the plot nor the characters are very deep, but the ending is clever.  I won't spoil it.Some parts of the interface are very bad.A minor, but constant, problem is overlapping text.  This isn't just an eyesore.  It's hard to find a particular book in a burning library when all the titles have other words printed over them.  This could have been solved several ways.  Text could be nudged the minimal distance from its centered position to avoid overlapping (the best solution I've come up with).  Text could only appear when you mouseover something (likely a worse solution).  Different colors could be used (probably the worst solution).Source code (what a programmer writes to make a computer do things) is displayed two ways.One view of the code is as mostly-text that should be familiar to most programmers.  I say “mostly” text because there are colored diamonds scattered throughout.  This form is used when you look at a 'signpost' for an algorithm before editing it.  I had no problem with it.The other view of the code is as a collection of machines connected with wires, with beams firing at them from colored diamonds.  This form is used to make your changes to the code.  It is, to put it bluntly, terrible.  Each machine has some text on it.  This text is so small as to be illegible.  The machines are always arranged as a vertical line, causing the white lines indicating the control flow of the program to overlap, making it very difficult to understand.  Even small amounts of code presented this way results in large rooms that make it almost impossible to get a sense of the overall structure of the code, and require a lot of time spent walking.It's unfortunate that the text view wasn't used for everything.The interface seems to have been designed with gamepads in mind.  This makes editing the code slow and clumsy, and you occasionally have to type variable names and strings anyway.  It would have been better if normal text editing had been used for everything.The engine itself is fascinating.  It appears to work by disassembling its own code, and letting you edit it while it runs.  It's very resilient.  If you make a mistake that would normally crash or hang a program the game doesn't crash or hang.  You get a message about the world collapsing, and restart from the point where you entered the room as if you had died.  This is even used in some traps late in the game.  The code is version-controlled, and you can return to a previous version of it, at the cost of any progress (location change and items gained) you made since then, when you die or by using an item you get early on.  That's nice if you mess things up too badly.  It would have been nice to have buttons to view the original code for things, and the changes that were made (probably in unified diff format).While this isn't the first programming game (Darwin was released in 1961), it might be the first that shows how to get a non-programmer interested in programming.  Editing the value of variables in the source code of BASIC games, and then proceeding to make more and more complex changes, are how I learned to program in the 80s, and the way this game starts out.  It's a pity that Hack 'n' Slash does such a poor job explaining things, and that the learning curve hits a brick wall so suddenly halfway through the game.  Hopefully future games will use this as a model to improve upon, rather than as a sign that such games cannot work.			"

												I'd much rather wait a bit before making my review, but seeing the absolute review-bombing that's occurred in the last few weeks I thought I would drop my two cents on the game.I may be only an hour in, but so far DF's Hack n Slash has been nothing short of superb.  To be fair, I didn't follow this game's development, and received the game as compensation after Spacebase DF-9 fell apart (which still leaves me a bit upset considering what it could have been, though RimWorld has since healed these wounds).  I'm not quite sure why I never gave it a chance as long as I had it, but after Steam Big Picture reminded me of its existence and shamed me for having never touched it nor even looked at the store page, I decided to give it a chance.  With both the acclaimed Double Fine Productions, and of course the legendary Castle Crashers and BattleBlock Theater developers at The Behemoth, this game certainly has a lot going for it!  Then again, Spacebase DF-9 did as well, so perhaps it's worth clarifying why.The concept alone is worth a look; a mix of educational and entertaining puzzles entirely based around coding, and modifying the world around you to cheat your way through the game.  In practice, however, it seems that DF has nailed it.  Whether it's hacking an enemy raven to do negative damage (therefore healing you on hit) or hacking the Day/Night cycle to speed up time and make a 50-days-later chest spawn quickly, it has a reasonable difficulty curve that eventually throws you into the mess of code we all know and love, aside from the actual top-down RPG presentation.Of course, this game is purely meant for those with coding knowledge.  It starts with a Magic Circle-esque basic exploration into code with modifying public vars, but by the final act you'll be diving into the game's Source Code in order to solve puzzles.  It takes a slow but sure leap from hacking-themed to actual hacking, and when it fully jumps to that latter category, it comes as a bit of a shock.If you pick it up on sale, I do recommend it broadly if only for the first two hours of gameplay, where it mixes RPG elements in with ""hacking"" shenanigans; if you're looking for a challenging but rewarding experience with LUA and aren't one of the blinded DF haters, though, I can't recommend it enough.  Most importantly, it is NOT FOR EVERYONE, and a bit of prior knowledge is pretty much essential before you get into the main part of the game.			"

												It's got charm, some fun to it and it certainly stands out among other indie games... but i'll be honest, once you get to the algorithm puzzles, I gave up and consulted a walkthrough. Coding puzzles just get way too convoluted to be figured out normally. The solutions are undoubtedly clever, it's just a shame there's probably no way to figure them out on your own.Story is... meh. The entire game's story line holds almost no weight, even in its own universe. Characters don't really emote anything, the situation is just kind of flat and there's barely ever any tension in gameplay. Writing can be funny at times but even then, it gets into cliche territory around the ending. Game looks nice at least. Style is unique but the graphics can get kind of confusing at times, covering up passages and the like. But it's nice... eh.Overall, it's an interesting experience and it's hard to think of another game like it, but for a puzzle game, it's not one I'd recommend.But hey, I can safely say it's the most fun ""hack the world"" game since Watchdogs.

Some of the earlier puzzles are witty, and the idea that you can modify global variables at will (such as game speed) is a brilliantly fun thing to toy with. Unfortunately, some of the later puzzles are too esoteric for even a seasoned programmer like myself, and I don't see a real reason to dig much further, since there's not much else worth tinkering with.

Yes, there is a tutorial of sorts, but it's not very detailled and there's little progression of code-based puzzles before the final assault on the villain's castle, resulting in a massive jump in difficulty.An in-universe book on the language for us to keep in our inventory would have been a huge help.Another complaint is that of clunky interfaces. Modifying numerical values requires scrolling through them until you hit the one you want. Why not just let us type the desired value in?The code-modification system is also very clunky. It's implemented as a sort of dungeon. It would be a lot easier and faster to use if we could just enter a text editor when viewing code and type new code.Overall, it feels incomplete and needs work, but it's interesting nevertheless.Only reccommended if you can get it really cheap or as part of a pack containing multiple other games you don't yet own.

Incredible freedom, limitless experimantationThis game is incredibly original and brilliant beyond measure. The game, to me, is reminiscent of Scribblenauts, as the player is rather overpowered. Such power, though, leads and infinity of almost boundless possibilities. I wouldn't recommend this game to speedrunners, as I believe trying to find the most fun solution to a problem is the best aspect of this game. The time travel mechanic really encourages experimentation, even when reckless.Well worth your money and your time.import steamLibrary

Early Access Review
								A nice ride into the world of hacking things. Thanks to the fact that i learn that hacking stuff since long times i can tell that in this game you are really confronted with some of the fundamental concepts of hacking.Catching passwords trough some unwanted outputs or changing of global variables are just a few of them.Also you get familliar with the think outside of the Box expirience a hacker needs each day. I only whish that there are more upcoming eastereggs and some funhacks you can do if wanted. I alsohope that there will be more than just the final dungeon.More maps and a little bit more stuff in general.Beside this fact and trough its early access the game offers a nice playtime and is also underlined with funny dialoges and a catching story :DThe start was a bit greedy on functions, but soon after the first boss the real hacking skills were needed :DIll give this game 8/10 in its current state (there were some crashes but because off the way the game is made it never REALLY crashed just the room restarted and often it was my fault for hacking sth. into an infinite loop ) also a little lack off content but this is early access and the devs have some time left to make new content and More stuff. For everyone intrested in programming and/or (logical or) zelda this game is fine and worth the 20 Bucks (i expect that moar content WILL come)			"

												I baught this game a little under 5 hours ago and just finished it, and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ It is bizzare and weird and wonderful. You probbably need a decent grasp of how coding works to get the most out of the later parts of the game, but you don't need to have actually made a game before, I got by just fine with the gist of algorithms and a coupple of hours flailing about. It was a really cool and fun game, I really liked how open ended the later half of the game was, even if it ment having the entire universe collapse a few times. The early parts of the game are the simple ""Hack"" stuff, edditing a few select values, but later on the game litterally lets you edit the .lua files and really mess with it.Not everyone will like this game, The later half can be frustrating if you don't have a clue what you are doing, but ♥♥♥♥ing up and breaking with everything was part of the fun for me.I can definately see why people would dislike this game, the ""Hack"" stuff at the start of the game puts it into the wrong light.Also supprising, the character design is really really good. There are like 5 or 6 characters in the whole game but I really enjoied the art and characterization of them. Well worth the about 14 dollars I spent on it, but if you are on the fence and not confident in your ability to read code, maybe wait for a sale.P.S. This may be the only game in my library that I can ♥♥♥♥ up so badly that I need to re-install every time I want to make a new game.			"

It allows players to access part of the source code to hack or change the game.Anyone who is interested in programming would like this idea and should try this.However, poor performanceGame is very unfriendly, no ""teaching purpose"" really.Game is more about hacking and debuging than ""programming.""Anyone without programming experience is discouraged.After ending, nothing much to do.Still, worth a try if on sale "

												Don't think I've ever seen programming conecpts so deeply required for completion of a game.  I'm not sure I can recommend to gamers in general, but for a niche that I'm in, it was a very fun game, so I will mark the review as ""recommended"".I had to resort to a walkthrough a couple times for some of the programming tasks, and the funny thing was I could solve those puzzels in completely different ways.  Amazing that you had something like edit rights to the same game you were playing. :)If you are a software developer, you owe it to yourself to at least check out the game.			"

												TL;DR at bottom, if you want.I'll be honest, I tried to love this game. I thought this game was right up my alley, being as I love programming, I love puzzles, and I love the Legend of Zelda-like look to it, but overall, this game was just completely underwhelming. In general, the core mechanics of this game aren't all to great. Sure it seems cool looking at all the things that you can do, and all the possible puzzles, but nothing really feels very interesting. So many of the encounters you have are just the samet thing of dodging the enemy, reprogramming the enemy to something else, and repeat. It may seem pretty cool, and pretty limitless, but theres almost nothing interesting you can do. This game also looks like it has a lot of exploration to it, but it's really just extremely railroaded with the illusion of being truly open world. Its like ""Sure you could go this way, but it doesn't lead anywhere for you right now and you don't get any hint what you need or how to get it.""On top of this, the challenge in this game comes from the wrong place. It should be in the interesting combat which changes constantly, but it's extremely repetetive, and you can become practically invincible extremely early on. The real challenge is the puzzles and the feeling of ""Am I doing this right? I have no idea"" and then going to the ""There has to be another way, or some hint"" but being as it's very railroaded, there's no hints, and nothing else to do other than look up what to do online, and being completely underwhelmed by the solution.Just overall, this game was a tremendous disappointment for someone who wanted to love this game, and if you're on the fence about buying this, don't.TL;DR: I would have loved this game, but I've only had experiences that are underwhelming, boring, repetetive, and just infuriating. Do not buy this game unless you want to just refund it.			"

YouTube™ Video: Hack 'n' Slash Review 

			Views: 833		

			...and we're back! USB sword: great weapon or greatest weapon? Is it even better than the SCSI mace? How many times did it take me to actually start playing properly?		

The modern game release cycle is a strange one. Sometimes I’m aware of games months or even years before their retail release. Other times a game will come out of nowhere and grab me instantly. Hack ‘n’ Slash from Double Fine is one of those games.The first I heard of it was on Steam’s front page. I watched the trailer and was instantly hooked. On the surface Hack ‘n’ Slash appears to be a straight-forward Zelda clone, isometric adventure in a fantasy setting. I quickly realised it was a puzzle game in disguise, thanks to an ingenious central game mechanic: hacking.Your character has the ability to hack into enemies and world objects, enabling you to modify gameplay behaviour and unit characteristics. You can alter how much damage enemies cause, change their idle routine, and even turn them from enemies into allies. This hacking changes the actual object variables in realtime and I was blown away by the concept.I picked up the game on sale and sat down to play. My first playthrough I bounced off pretty hard. First of all the controls aren’t great. The joystick tends to travel a lot and I’ve died countless times because my character stayed in motion even after I took my thumb off the stick. As well, the starting area isn’t very intuitive and I found myself backtracking quite a bit. The hacking ability seemed largely restricted and I wasn’t having any fun.This pattern repeated a few times as I tried to come back to the game. I knew there was something special with Hack ‘n’ Slash but I just wasn’t seeing it. Finally I gave it one last try and suddenly everything clicked. I saw the whole game open up in front of me and I realised how clever and innovative it really is.Even beyond the USB sword your character uses to hack, the game has a number of cool mechanics that allow you to play with the rules of the world. You can slow down or speed up time, change the day/night cycling, and view the hidden paths around the world. The main thrust of gameplay involves using a variety of items to manipulate and maneuver the world.I’m only a few hours into Hack ‘n’ Slash but the majority of that time’s been spent in exploration. Exploring the world, the game’s systems, and the methods you’re given to modify them.I’ve still got some minor gripes, like the controller issues I mentioned before, and other occasional platforming problems, but there’s a lot to like in Hack ‘n’ Slash. Double Fine have developed a clever, playful, and self-referential title that pays homage to classic RPGs while bringing something new to the genre. Give Hack ‘n’ Slash a try and, if required, a second, third, and fourth try.			"

												The idea of ""changing the codes of the game"" is pretty cool. It can be perfect for a programming course or lua 101. But making a game with this idea would be really tough. As a programmer, I feel like working while playing Hack 'n' Slash. Actually, you're debugging a game! It is fun for a short time, well, at least you learn what we're dealing with while making games.Also puzzles are not fair, e.g. write two strings to open to door and there is no clue about it.			"

												Plays more like a series of logic puzzles than a RPG. The puzzles are solid but may require a few runs to a walkthrough. Manipulating the game ""variables"" such as enemy behaviour and game speed is the core mechanic rather than Zelda-esque action battles (on a side note: variables values CAN be negative, this is important in many places). The humour is good but often you may feel a bit ""lost"" as to where to go. It's worth while exploring all the corners, there are optional artifacts that makes the game much more pleasurable to play (e.g. time speed up/slow down). Where it does suffer is that the graphics aren't consistently good (feels like a flash game in places with pixel art thrown in) and the movement model can feel glitchy at times especially around edges of cliffs and lakes where you sometimes (but not always) ""slide"" in.Similar meta-gaming asthetic to games like Unepic and Evoland and although it is less tedious than the former and lacks the graphical and tight gameplay of the latter. It's worth it on a good special, but wouldn't play it for more than a weekend or two.			"

												There will be spoilers: For the gimic of being able to edit the lua and properties of objects to obtain desired results, this is by far one of the most entertaining games I've come across in a long while.It however, felt short and a little rushed, and although there were nerdy references that was like slapping your own face with a heavy course book a few times over; it will likely have a very limited appeal for those that aren't being catered to in this game.I had a friend who kinda sorta understands coding and he could barely get to act 3, in the amount of time it took me to beat the game.I'd love to recommend this to everyone given how well I generally liked it, but between the common bugs, the barely comprehesible final boss sequence, and the very strict coding procedures to solve puzzles? I just cant.I love you Hack N'Slash, not enough people will, and I won't recommend such a buggy game on 'average' peopleTL;DR8/10 for me and a very select few2/10 for the masses			"

												Very, very boring, there is not really an incentive for keep playing it. Your hero have a USB-sword that lets him change the properties of some objects of the world, but the game doesn't makes you feel that is necessary do it.Adulteration of this properties are not permanent and is very annoying. For example, there is a sprite that have an annoying jingle that scares the turtles that you need to pass the area,  you can use your USB-Sword to turn the volume to 0, but, if you leave the area and then come back it will have it's properties reset. Rocks blocking your way? Change it properties to move it! A bird is attacking you? Change it properties to turn off his aggressiveness, yeih!You can get some artifacts that lets you change Global Properties of tha game to make it easier and get the feeling that you are exploiting it.Not even recommended with disccount, save your money for other game.P.D: If you want to try some ""programing"" game, i suggest you Spacechem.

												Since I definitely recommend this game I'll start by listing the ""cons"" just to get straight to the point:- The level design is weak. There's a lot of pointless walking in this game, with empty rooms and maze-like paths that ultimately serve no purpose. I haven't finished the game so maybe there's something later on that's supposed to make up for this, but they could have just as easily trimmed down the convoluted paths, or make them accessible only later on with new powers.- The graphics are adequate, but messy. The walkable paths tend to blend into the background and get covered by stuff from the foreground. Seeing how this game take inspiration by Zelda they should have applied one of its most important lessons: don't clutter the screen. I know there's an item early on that clearly shows you the walkable areas, but it's no excuse.- Everything resets as soon as you leave the current ""room"". This avoids getting stuck, but it also means that you'll have to do specific actions over and over again, and seeing how most of this involves hacking it can get a bit tedious.From a purely mechanical standpoint I also have to say that:- only having 5 quick buttons (the space bar and buttons 1 through 4) is just inexcusable, especially seeing the vast abount of items you get to use. Of all games I expected this one to be more flexible in its options section, and to be at least more accomodating towards people who play with a keyboard.- The inventory only displays two rows of items at a time, despite clearly having room for a third one. This is a bit nitpicky, but it also caused me some confusion when I got an item that went in the third row of items, which I couldn't see at all until I scrolled down.The pros are fewer in number, but ultimately redeem the game in my opinion:- The mechanics are really a lot of fun to use, and very insightful when it comes to game development. You can speed up and slow down time, change the beaviour of enemies and traps - and even of your own character! - and see behind the curtain of the graphics.- The puzzles can be really creative and complex, requiring you to think outside the box and make full use of your powers.Overall my impression is that a simpler, cleaner graphic style and more concise level design would have served this game much better. Aside from that it's definitely worth a try.			"

												Going to make this quick, don't get this game, even on sale. I spent $1.33 on it and I regret it. I feel bad for people who got this at full price. I get that it's a puzzle game, but first hour was so boring, I don't want to open it again. Gameplay is simple and repatative with no real challenge. Music is the same 5 to 15 second music loop per area and will slowly drive you insane.Art is pretty meh and drab to look at after a while.Dialouge tries to be humerous, but fails to keep me interested of invested. It really feels like this game was put together on a drunken weekend, they couldn't even fix a quick travel bug where if you quick travel, it may replay cutscenes and not read that you already gotten way past that part. For example, finishing a boss and then being captured by the enemy in a prison. Use the quick travel button to go back to the main stage, boss is still there and THE SAME CUTSCENE OF YOU BEING CAPTURE PLAYS ALL OVER AGAIN. And the worst part is that they tell you about this bug and try to play it off as some weird side effect to the quick travel tool. They knew this was a problem and didn't even bother to fix it or plan around it.Overall 0/10, because I wouldn't even torrent this game it was so dull.			"

												Nice concept, too buggy.Hack 'n' Slash starts out nice, but I found that the game just loves to crash and the gamepad/keyboard switching seems to give it issues where both stop responding.  It doesn't seem to be a major issue until the cave trials where the universe kept collapsing with greater and greater frequency, even if I just looked at code and then popped out afterwards and sometimes would have issues just reloading areas using the device to reload areas (where it just stopped responding to input although didn't hard-lock).Would have liked to recommend the game but I can't recommend it if I can't play it without it continuing to die on me.

												I found this game absurdly buggy.  The interface was controller-friendly, though.  I also like the concept behind the game.  The overall experience was just too buggy and frustrating to recommend buying the game at any price.What the game has going for it is a vector art style similar to a typical Flash-powered game.  Whether or not this game leveraged Flash is beyond my knowledge, but it looks like all the art was drawn in Flash or a similar vector drawing tool.  it also has one of the coolest concepts ever seen in action RPGs: hack things using their USB ports.  It's not simply a gag, though!  It's utilized at the game's core design level, allowing for very interesting puzzles.  The time travel aspect is cool, too, but I found myself avoiding that aspect of the game as much as possible.Where this game goes wrong is it does not hold your hand enough in the beginning and has a very unintuitive hacking interface.  There's a slab near the beginning that shows you code that you can't edit at all... though it spawns a chest right away... not sure if that was hinting that future puzzles would use these slabs to give you clues, but that's my assumption.  Anyway, a lot of the puzzles can be messed up and require you to really think about what you're doing.  You have to contend with the game's poor implementation of riding on moving platforms, like swimming turtles, only to finally get across a small body of water after countless times getting pushed into the water by invisible forces.  Mildly frustrating... becomes tedious... becomes too tedious to keep going.  During playing this game, I felt like it would be easier to code my own game from scratch than it would be to play this game about hacking a game's logic.  It's silly, because I could just as easily really hack the game and just beat it right away, ruining what little gameplay the game provides.			"

												This game is interesting, breakable, funny, and well put together....however i don't have any desire to finish it. You are given no direction, and even walkthroughs are confusing. Because you can break the game basically from the outset, it's hard to figure what the solution to the puzzle is. Some can be deduced, but others require information that you really couldn't figure out without random guesswork. For example, one item can bounce off walls, and at angles, but how and when it can do this is arbitrary.Most things speak english, but item based anything are usually in a code of some sort. One is in what looks like feedback from an old TV and another speaks in arabic (i think). When i looked up what these items/characters actually did, i couldn't help but wonder how i was supposed to figure that out myself. There may be a way, but i never found it, which brings me to my next pointYou can do things out of order, in unintended ways, and in completely broken ways. For example, One puzzle required both character/items i had obtained  to change my name  but i did it in a much more simplistic and sane way  i hacked myself, ramped my speed to max and ran past the warden ...I technically didn't need any story important items to progress, and you can get near infinite health and health pickups within 20 minutes. The gameplay was fun, but the lack of any sense of direction was crippling. the lack of boundaries, and the ""do whatever you can think of"" makes for a very loose experience. Basically this game is a very oldschool game mashed with newer mechanics and systems. If you loved the first Legend of Zelda for the NES and wished it was made to be more modern, this game is for you. If you prefered later games like Link to the Past or Ocarina of TIme, this game will be an exercise in disappointment.			"

												Hack 'n' Slash was a promissing-looking game : a manipulation of the enemies with ""coding"", which allowed to use them at your advantage or even twist your environnement. It looked great!But it's not. The game's sole interest was this gameplay system. To be honest, it even seems that this was the only element that had thoughts put into it (and I said thoughts, not work). The game design is rather cartoony and, let's be honest, very pleasant to the eye, the developpers did a great job on the environnement. But it does NOT fit the gameplay at ALL. It's like having the gameplay of Darksouls on a Mario game : it just doesn't work. Gameplay is supposed to work together with the rest of the game, and here, it's in pure contradiction. It's too cutsy and cartoony, where realism or old-school pixelated graphics would've been way more fit.There is also a total lack of story, as the dialogues are borderline stupid and make no sense. Now some game work very well without stories...but not this one. You're just thrown into it without knowing who you are, what you're supposed to do in a game where the level design is pretty confusing : roads everywhere, random chests everywhere, no logic, no explanation. You do get some little ""quests"" further but...by the time you reach (or rather, find) where the first lines of (still non-sensical) story happen, you have enough time to feel dissapointed and not invested in the game at all.This is sad, because such gameplay elements could've been grounds for an amazing story. Or the artistic look of the game, that would've been great in any more classic RPG/Adventure game...but it just doesn't work. It feels off. And it sincerely disconnects you from the game. You don't feel involved in it.			"

												It’s too bad this game has seen so much hate by the community. I think most people who play this already have a good understanding of at least one computer programming language and jump to the conclusions. I rather enjoyed the obscurity of the games code and found myself relying on the basics of what I know more than anything else. Honestly I wish there were more games out there like this.			"

												I found this game absurdly buggy.  The interface was controller-friendly, though.  I also like the concept behind the game.  The overall experience was just too buggy and frustrating to recommend buying the game at any price.What the game has going for it is a vector art style similar to a typical Flash-powered game.  Whether or not this game leveraged Flash is beyond my knowledge, but it looks like all the art was drawn in Flash or a similar vector drawing tool.  it also has one of the coolest concepts ever seen in action RPGs: hack things using their USB ports.  It's not simply a gag, though!  It's utilized at the game's core design level, allowing for very interesting puzzles.  The time travel aspect is cool, too, but I found myself avoiding that aspect of the game as much as possible.Where this game goes wrong is it does not hold your hand enough in the beginning and has a very unintuitive hacking interface.  There's a slab near the beginning that shows you code that you can't edit at all... though it spawns a chest right away... not sure if that was hinting that future puzzles would use these slabs to give you clues, but that's my assumption.  Anyway, a lot of the puzzles can be messed up and require you to really think about what you're doing.  You have to contend with the game's poor implementation of riding on moving platforms, like swimming turtles, only to finally get across a small body of water after countless times getting pushed into the water by invisible forces.  Mildly frustrating... becomes tedious... becomes too tedious to keep going.  During playing this game, I felt like it would be easier to code my own game from scratch than it would be to play this game about hacking a game's logic.  It's silly, because I could just as easily really hack the game and just beat it right away, ruining what little gameplay the game provides.			"

												It's cute, it's intuitive, and it's fun to play.Hack n' Slash is a Legend of Zelda-like game where gender roles are reversed ala Peter Pan style. You are Alice (by default or whatever name you want to give her). You begin the game in Act 2 finding yourself in a cage in a cave. (You'll know more about Act 1 later in the game.) You attempt to use your sword to break open the door of the cage, but your sword breaks. Now you can access the game's code on objects you attack with the broken sword. It's like tweaking game .ini or .xml configuration files in real-time. Want to unlock that door? Set it's DoorLocked flag to 0.But it's not as simple as just 'cheating' your way through the game like with the opening act in the cage. There are some pretty tricky puzzles to solve where hacking certain objects or even global values is needed to solve some of them.You'll encounter unique gear such as the Wizard Hat that allows you to see the game's raw pathing map layout, or artifacts that allow you to change the day/night cycle time and time ellapse speed. There are also some familiar items such as the classic blue boomerang. This boomerang though, allows you to attack, thus hack, yourself.The music is charming and the visuals are genuinely unique. Everything is hand drawn 2D, and the music has a classic midi feel to it.The game is kind of short though, so I won't tell you too much more. I hope this review helps you in making your descision on purchasing or not this game.			"

												One of the most unique games you'll ever play.  The game slowly let's you modify more and more of itself, eventually graduating from editing simple variables to modifying function calls.  It's completely free-form, in that the solution can be whatever you code it to be.  You can delve in the code to find the solution to the puzzle, or edit the code so the puzzle doesn't trigger to begin with.If you mess up while modifying the games code, it even has fake blue screens.  And, if you're like me and REALLY mess up, you can even crash the game entirely, which adds a degree of legitimicacy to all the crazy stuff you can do.			"

												Like all games that Double Fine put out after the year 2006, Hack 'n' Slash is an unfinished, unpolished, buggy mess that the developers promptly abandoned the second that the money stopped coming in. Tragic, too, because this is a game with *enormous* potential. Another review pointed out that the game, as it stands now, would have been a great tech demo - but instead, they're charging full price for 3 hours of crashes, laughably unintuitive script editing, and puzzles that are not only unfinished, but go out of their way to point out that they're unfinished.I had fun with this game, but I don't think many people would. Nonprogrammers aren't going to understand the programming, and programmers are going to be put off by the bizarre, stylized way the scripts are presented to you. Do not purchase, and stop giving money to Tim Schaefer, who is an unrepentant con artist.			"

												I'm enjoying Hack 'n' Slash, but my view might be biased as I've studied computer science and I like Double Fine's style ;)It's a pretty unique game idea - an rpg like game where you run around with an USB sword, hacking mobs and game properties around! Everything has the colorful and recognizable Double Fine look and feel, and of course ... the humor ;) I personally find the music of the game fitting and unintrusive.I haven't played that much from the game, I haven't completed act 4 yet, but I definitely like what I see. The question is : how are people, unfamiliar with programming, gonna progress in the game - as the only obvious way to increase the difficulty is to make the code you need to change more complicated - and that might be, where the fun ends. On the other hand - is a game, how complicated can it get? It's not like it's computer science ... o wait :p Then again I also think, that in this day and age, everyone should be able to look at a code and get the general idea of what's going on :pThere is also mod support for the game and I can't wait to see what funny things the community will come up with!TL:DR you can check my overview video, as I play through act 2 :

Would have been fun to have a more normal rpg style game with the additional hack element, but this is good too.Only complaint is that it was pretty short.All in all, one of the better games I've played.

												This is clearly not your typical RPG, and thats ok.If you don't have any programming experience, you probably won't be able to get very far into act 4 without looking up solutions online, and it will take a lot of the fun out of it.  This game is not meant to teach you programming, it just has fun with programming concepts.In this game, you are encouraged to do crazy things and exploit 'glitches'.  You can give your self obscene amounts of health, change lines of dialogue, teleport into inaccessible areas, and all kinds of things.  Theres even a modification you can make to your character so any and all damage taken is ignored completely!			"

												I'm finally starting to get stuck into act 5 of this game now 1.0 is out. It's probably one of my favourite Double Fine games ever so far. It really delivers on that concept of delving into the game code in a really clever way. I feel smart solving stuff, and don't feel like I'm being guided toward the solution in a really heavy-handed way.It's a difficult game to get into if you're not willing to get your hands a little dirty. It rewards experimentation and isn't going to necessarily teach you all the steps so much as give you a bunch of tools and let you play. That's not to say there's no gradual introducing of concepts. There is, but it's not afraid to introduce quite a few new concepts at a time and expect you to wrap your head around that. It's a bit like SpaceChem in that you feel a little less like you're finding 'the' solution and more like you're given the tools, and with them you craft a solution. I find that very refreshing, but your mileage may vary!One issue I've had is that the build doesn't seem entirely stable on my machine, I get a few crashes to desktop here and there. But they're pretty rare. Actually, when you mess with in-game code in such a way that would usually cause a crash, the game catches the error and lets you reload from a previous save state.			"

												I really had high hopes for this game, the concept is really interesting. Unfortunately this is another case of a neat concept with poor excecution. You solve problems by ""modifying the game"", but what ""modifying the game"" means is just changing object variables (i.e. modify a creature's health/alignment/damage, change the number of times you can move a block, volume of a sound, etc.). You don't actually write functions to run and make things happen in the game, or anything exciting like that. I could have been willing to look past this, however; after all, Brutal Legend, another Double Fine game, also suffers from somewhat lackluster (although i personally found it enjoyable) gameplay, but more than makes up for it with a fantastic environment, enjoyable characters, and excellent aesthetic. Hack 'n' Slash, sadly, fails on this front as well. The best way I could come up with to describe the writing is DESPERATELY trying to be clever but failing miserably. Every character is this way to the point of being irritating. The world itself isn't anything out of the ordinary either; generic ""retro-styled"" backgrounds and levels coupled with a boring soundtrack are largely ignorable.In summary: excellent concept, mediocre excecution, TERRIBLE writing, bland aesthetic.EDIT: I've been told that later in the game you DO actually modify the game code and write lines yourself, but these sections are very poorly executed and are more confusing and frustrating than original and enjoyable. So no, it doesn't get better.			"

This challenging game gives you several in game hacking tools that let you change the universe around you.

												Hack 'n' Slash is a love letter to both gamers and computer programmers. The game's many references to old-school games like the original Legend Of Zelda make it an enjoyable homage, and the game's rather innovative hacking mechanic challenged me in a way that I've never really experienced before. By hitting certain objects with your sword/USB drive, you can hack them, changing attributes to open locked doors, instantly defeat enemies, and give yourself extra health. With the ability to hack yourself to ludicrous levels of health, and the ability to hack enemies out of existence, you'd think that the game would get boring quickly, but that's not the case. The game barely pretends to be combat-oriented, and rather focuses on puzzles. Early in the game, the puzzles tend to be rather easy, such as hacking a movable block to increase the number of spaces it moves, but by the game's second chapter, the puzzles begin to become more complex. Around the game's third chapter, however, there is an abrupt gameplay shift.At some point, you gain an item known as the ""loupe"", which allows you to, quite literally, look at and change the coding for in-game objects. At this point, the game shifts from relatively simple block-pushing puzzles to fiendishly difficult challenges that basically boil down to the problems you might find in a programming textbook. As a matter of fact, the second half of the game feels almost like an interactive tutorial to coding, and honestly, that's not neccesarily a bad thing. The puzzles may be difficult, but the game always provides you with more than enough information to solve them.  No programming knowledge is required to start this game, but once you get to the midpoint, you'll find that you may very well leave with some.Overall, I think this is a creative game that uses its innovative mechanic to the fullest extent. If you're looking for a relaxing game to zone out playing, I'd advise you to look elsewhere, but if you're looking for a fun and interesting challenge, then I would heartily reccomend Hack 'n' Slash.

												A lot of like the Zeldas of yore, Hack 'n' Slash can be fun, but falls flat on the premise of story.I'm not talking about the stuff that were the brick-builders for Zelda, I'm talking about the first one: where Link was simply an explorer in a dangerous world, not even armed with a sword until you acquired one. This game harnesses that exploration mechanic, and does it well.My problem is exactly that, however. It makes no attempt to really explain itself to the player, and plays against logic to enable puzzles that I shouldn't have to deal with. I spent the first 30 minutes exploring aimlessly, until I found the sprites and was given a goal - fix the pollution. Okay. So I explore the complete area of pollution, and find only one potential progression point - a place where you walk on sleeping... turtles, I guess. Anyway, the puzzle comes in when your sidekick appears and just decides WOW I'M GONNA SING ON THIS. I died at least 5 times when what I SHOULD have been able to do was, I don't know, tell the little bugger to shut up, or hack him mute.Unfortunately, the player character never seems to think of these solutions, when the player themselves has only been taught to hack and move. Swing sword-thing. Hack object.I honestly stopped there because I was completely stuck. Maybe I would have gotten different results if I made it night, or if I went back to the sprites and got a comically large cork to shove in my sprite's big mouth.But I didn't. Because I already wasn't enamored with the game: the writing felt flat and the mechanics were stale. Yes, I can make a block move 20 times in a milisecond with a single nudge of my Link-shaped hat. But I have to do that to every single block I come across with a cute puzzle to it. Or I waste about the same amount of time just... pushing it. The only creative application was when I had to put a delay and reverse the push of the block, and even then that was clearly ""advanced puzzling 101"", because it only ever hid excess content I thought didn't matter. The game doesn't expect much out of you, in other words.If you want to get this game, and like what I'm saying, go for it. If you don't, great. Glad I could help.By the way, I got this for free when SBDF-9 flopped. I cannot remotely understand why that would somehow make me feel better about Double Fine. You fail one game, you give me another one with poor storytelling for free? Thanks, Double Fine. Thanks.			"

												Initial Impression  1/10Although first impressions make it appear that it would be a fun game but I have to say that this game is a piece of garbage.  It is so full of bugs that you will be lucky to even get it going long enough to play for a few minutes.  Anyway lets move on to the other parts of the game (if you can get it running). Support  0/10This game is abandoned.  I can not give a game in this condition or state any kind of rating at all. Graphics 1/10Did someone say windows 3.1 or below ??  I would gladly post some screenshots but when you hit the F-12 button the software is so buggy that it crashes to the desktop.   No I am not impressed at all with this kind of graphics.  Sounds and Music 0/10This is an area that is bare.Gameplay 0/10I tried but this game is such a piece of junk that it will barely run.  Fun 0/10How fun do you think it is when the game is so buggy that it won't even start correctly?  Sorry a big 0 on this one. Price: No. Bugs and Execution: Call the pest control at once.  This game has so many bugs in it that you will need an entire team.  Overall :  This game is buggy, unfinished and appears abandonned.  How in the world this game got good reviews is really beyond me as it is one step away from being solid vaporware.			"

												So first off, I was almost hesitant to buy this because of the negative reviews. Let me just say- I'm glad I bought it anyway!I really did thoroughly enjoy this game- perhaps it was because I had read a lot of disclaimers, and was waiting for ""a letdown"" but for me, such a letdown never occured. I am a programmer (though I've never really delved into Lua specifically) so the obvious appeal of a ""hacking game"" was at the core of my reason for purchasing. I am typically a ""whiner"" when it comes to games (I set everything to easy, and try to ""hack"" around the difficulty if I decide that a game is too difficult) so this game was awesome, because it certainly encouarged the hacking!For the first part of the game, I found the ""hacking"" of the entities kind of repetitive, and somewhat boring, but I pressed on. When I finally got to act 4 (where some many people start to see negatives)- I was extatic when I started to see real live code! Some have said it's not actual Lua source (I'm not sure- but it looks similar to source at any rate to me). I was really worried that it was going to be really difficult, but I found the puzzles intriguing. Some of the puzzles can be a bender (you start messing with something, and then you figure out the most obvious solution and it's like- ""Gee, why didn't I see that in the first place?"" lol). tl;drOverall, I found the game highly enjoyable (low replay value, but that's not usually important to me in games- I conquer and move on).

			Its dangerous to go alone! Start hacking! Atleast that is what Double Fine Productions version of the tale would have you do. In this familiar but twisted version of an action/adventure classic.		

I hope you enjoy!Martyr			"

												Though the abhorrent trailer that involves a rap song about hacking might (quite reasonably so) scare you far away from this game, it's actually surprisingly fun to play. It's basically Zelda, but with a game-breaking ability that allows you to change the programming of enemies, friends, rocks, and pretty much everything else. Don't expect a coherent title from start to finish, but you're well within the realms of reason to have a blast playing it.			"

												So first off, I was almost hesitant to buy this because of the negative reviews. Let me just say- I'm glad I bought it anyway!I really did thoroughly enjoy this game- perhaps it was because I had read a lot of disclaimers, and was waiting for ""a letdown"" but for me, such a letdown never occured. I am a programmer (though I've never really delved into Lua specifically) so the obvious appeal of a ""hacking game"" was at the core of my reason for purchasing. I am typically a ""whiner"" when it comes to games (I set everything to easy, and try to ""hack"" around the difficulty if I decide that a game is too difficult) so this game was awesome, because it certainly encouarged the hacking!For the first part of the game, I found the ""hacking"" of the entities kind of repetitive, and somewhat boring, but I pressed on. When I finally got to act 4 (where some many people start to see negatives)- I was extatic when I started to see real live code! Some have said it's not actual Lua source (I'm not sure- but it looks similar to source at any rate to me). I was really worried that it was going to be really difficult, but I found the puzzles intriguing. Some of the puzzles can be a bender (you start messing with something, and then you figure out the most obvious solution and it's like- ""Gee, why didn't I see that in the first place?"" lol). tl;drOverall, I found the game highly enjoyable (low replay value, but that's not usually important to me in games- I conquer and move on). If you do any kind of intermediate coding (I HIGHLY stress that- you will need to have some kind of logic, math, or data structure training once you get to act 4) then you owe it to yourself to get this game and try it out!

												Finished it in about 7 hours, I enjoyed it my self, but I can see why others would not. If your looking for a game like Zelda, this is not what your looking for. It might look a bit similar but the game goals and mechanics are not even close..... unless you hacked in Zelda.If your interested in hacking, cheating, programming or game mechanics in general this could be your thing. However as with hacking and programming you will need to have patience. You will crash the game when you make a mistake, sometimes not immediately but you can expect a crash later on. Most of the times its not a big deal the game auto saves when you enter a room and it takes less then a minute to restart the game.The first half of the game you can play through without any knowledge of programming. Things are presented in such a way that it is simple to understand what to do. The second half of the game there are multiple solutions to a puzzle. If your a hardcore developer you will likely over complicate the solution and ignore the hints left by the game developer. In most cases even the most complicated puzzles are solved by changing one variable to true/false or looking up the super secret password in the code. If you have no programming skills at all you could figure stuff out by deduction. But the last few puzzles have a very steep learning grade, so I would combine this game with a 101 in programming and you will have a good ""hello world"" replacement program to play with. As for anyone else who is not a wanna be programmer I would say stick with your current favorite casual puzzle game.			"

												One question I see about this game is ""Do I need to know how to program to play this game?""Yes. Yes, you do. Or you need to be willing to sit down with a reference book for a few hours before having any chance of finishing the game, although the first half is totally doable with minimal programming knowledge. The game does try to have a reasonable learning curve, but it is not meant to teach you programming. You will have to do that yourself.I would say that 1-2 years of computer science background is ideal for this game. Less than that and it's going to be a huge chore. Much more than that and it's going to be pretty easy (although still very fun).The short version:Do you like programming? Do you like games? How does a game that involves tinkering with programs sound? Interesting? Buy it!			"

												I could not get this game to work properly on my system. By properly, I mean display words, menus, anything.... I had to figure out on my own how to get past the first 3 bubbles and  then how to pick up a sword. A menu never popped up, but boxes for my character where text should have been did which I thought was supposed to be some extremely challenging puzzle that I would have to hack through, until I saw the game videos others have. I found it to literally be unplayable. I have had the steam check the files for missing pieces to redownload, no problems. I have approximately 250 games, which all work.

												I want to like this game. I do. But I feel like it's execution (no pun intended) was poor.This game, as you will probably can tell, needs some experience with code in general, but LUA would be highly recommended that's what the game runs on. Now, I dont have tons of experience with coding, mainly only C, but, that's not the problem I have with this game. The game kinda spins this idea that you can change all the code how you need it to, but that's not really true. Each puzzle looks for a specific solution, or the world will crash (no, it will not crash your game, they were smart about that). And what I mean by that is that the code is filled with error checking, which makes sense in normal games, but with something like this where errors are kinda the objective, it feels limiting.But lets do a list, because people like those:ProsSeeing how you can mess with the code is fun (if your a computer geekThe puzzles are very clever (except at certain parts where it's obvious, or you really have to know your stuff)The art is cute and nice on the eyesIt's something differentConsCharacters are ehStory is meh (it feels like it's not supposed to know they're code, but then they do)Humor is bleh (which is disappointing, knowing Double Fine)It treats itself as if it's going to teach you, but it wontThere's ways to solve puzzles that are probably more along the lines of ""cheating the system"" (On the last room of trials, instead of moving all the platforms, I was able to ride the last platform to where I needed to be by changing the increments to -1)The puzzles get extremely difficult and give no direction if you don't know what you're doingTrying to read the LUA code represented with arrows and color coded crystals just makes it even harder to grasp. (I understand assigning values, but I hate trying to connect the dots with color crystals intstead of var names)I give it 6/10. It's fun, but more of an experiement then a game. I can recommend if for people that know LUA code, but... why don't you just make a game at that point? I feel like that would be more rewarding. And for the ending... I followed the game guide, didn't work, went back, fought the 2nd stage boss again and picked up the PrincessChamberCopy.lua before I left the library by accident, and somehow that bypassed the whole decryption part and I just had to put the book on the pedestal. I honestly have no idea why that happened or what caused it.Did I have fun? Yes. Did it get frustrating? Hell yes, but blame my inexperience. If you got it for $1 on humble bundle, definitly play it and give it a try, but other than that, I can't recommend this game. It didn't feel fun. It felt like trying to understand a robot already built with no explanation how unless you take it appart with a screwdriver and your own knowledge, no explanation on where and what to change, and not even that cool of a robot except for the fact that you can take it apart. I used the game guide too many times to be happy (and for a meh ending).When you get the boomerang and an artifact that lets you hack yourself, bump up that speed to avoid painful walking. ... and the main character was a girl apparently. Kinda found that out a bit too late when I gave her a guy name. oh well. "

A LOT.This game is the best hacking game i have ever played.Even if the syntax was seriously weird,it has its own style.Also,it doesnt make you directly edit Lua code.That's huge plus for these types of games.If you want a good hack n slash game,-no pun intended- this is the game for you.10/10 Would ""Princess is in another castle"" again.Also i think i have got the feeling that ppl say they get from Zelda games.(Even if i didnt play any.)

												Hack n slash is an interesting concept of a game: You need to hack it in order to win it. It excels in this in that, unlike some other ""hacking"" games, you're not simulating trying to get into some generic linux server, you're given a world and as you play you learn how it works. As you progress you are slowly given more and more control over it, until by the end where you are given access to the entire ""library"" of scripts, which in this case is an actual library.As a meta-game it does very well. It acts as a fairly good RPG in its own right [i.e. it has good art, a fairly good story, good music], as well as being a hacking game. But it is worth mentioning that if you don't get programming, then you shouldn't even go near this. The hacking is simple to begin with [almost boring], but it starts become more involved as you get a few levels in. But when you get to seeing and editing actual code, unless you have a grasp of the underlying concepts, you won't be able to do much.Definitely worth playing if you like to tinker with code.			"

												Not recommended. I was enthused by the idea but the execution is very hard to like.The possibilities are pretty good being able to essentially approach puzzles in different ways to solve them.. but they totally forget about the fun. The first screen is boring as hell - but you need to complete it twice to get the first artifact in the game - no shortcuts here, ladies and gentlemen. Then there's a second screen completely void of anything to interact with .. um.. exciting?Third screen and you're in a mazelike area that involves way too much repetitive crap (hack rock to move it 1 space. hack next rock. hack next rock. etc) and then contains a treasure chest with a 'puzzle' that essentially encourages you to speed up the passage of time (ie make your screen go from dark to light every few seconds [yep just as irritating as it sounds] for a total of 10000000 cycles just to earn another item. That's not fun, or rewarding. It's useless timewasting busywork.It's a personal thing but I also hated the characters / art .. that sort of half tongue-in-cheek villain gives me the ♥♥♥♥♥. It's like a horrid bland half arsed effort from someone who once watched an Adventure Time episode, but understands none of what makes it work.Finally the 'feel' of moving around etc also - plays like a buggy platformer rather than something from a big studio with plenty of glitching off edges and never quite knowing if you're going to be hit. Even the time speed up / slow down device is more trouble than it's worth.So yeah didn't like this? Hopefully someone decent can steal the idea and actually put it to good use.			"

												Not recommended. I was enthused by the idea but the execution is very hard to like.The possibilities are pretty good being able to essentially approach puzzles in different ways to solve them.. but they totally forget about the fun. The first screen is boring as hell - but you need to complete it twice to get the first artifact in the game - no shortcuts here, ladies and gentlemen. Then there's a second screen completely void of anything to interact with .. um.. exciting?Third screen and you're in a mazelike area that involves way too much repetitive crap (hack rock to move it 1 space. hack next rock. hack next rock. etc) and then contains a treasure chest with a 'puzzle' that essentially encourages you to speed up the passage of time (ie make your screen go from dark to light every few seconds [yep just as irritating as it sounds] for a total of 10000000 cycles just to earn another item. That's not fun, or rewarding. It's useless timewasting busywork.It's a personal thing but I also hated the characters / art .. that sort of half tongue-in-cheek villain gives me the ♥♥♥♥♥. It's like a horrid bland half arsed effort from someone who once watched an Adventure Time episode, but understands none of what makes it work.Finally the 'feel' of moving around etc also - plays like a buggy platformer rather than something from a big studio with plenty of glitching off edges and never quite knowing if you're going to be hit. Even the time speed up / slow down device is more trouble than it's worth.So yeah didn't like this? Hopefully someone decent can steal the idea and actually put it to good use.			"

												well, i will write a review now too.i guess i have the right to do so cause i finished the game x3 (not like others who just playing it for like 5 minutes and then saying ""mehhh ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game"" or giving the game just a bad review because they dont like the game at all)first of all, this game requires a bit of scripting knowledge. if you dont have some knowledge in scripting will you have it kinda hard to finish the game because the puzzles are later here and there a bit complicated without that knowledge. this is one flaw of the game and its kinda ... a critical flaw because its not easy for peoples which never seen scripts in their life before.on the good site: this game actually teaches you a bit ""how to script"" ofcourse it wont teach you everything but you get over the time a vague idea how scripts work. the sprite on your side helps you in the script rooms, he explains you how stuff might and/or could work when you change something. you cant do mistakes tho, if you make something wrong colapses the universe and resets the script, with other words: you cant really break the game. the devs found a really nice way to show how a script really works, you will see it when you go for the first time into an enemy or hacking post. (not the normal sword hacking, it goes much further with hacking when you progress xP)the story is really well made, its funny aswell. it starts right from the beginning on x3. you get nice hacking tools and with scripting knowledge would it be possible to have really fun with all the enemys, you can completely rewrite them if you have the needed knowledge, i was amazed from what the devs made out of a game which is basicly a script puzzle.Overall is this game really good, its a bit short tho x3 i wish it had some more enemys but i guess the mainfocus is here the story and to have fun to hack stuff, rewriting them and watching what happens ^^.due to the big flaw that you might need some scripting knowledge will i give the game a 7/10the big flaw is a really heavyone, i say it again, without some knowledge will you be helpless and knowing not what to do at all, what i mean is, you dont know what to change in the script to progress further. its a bit frustrating but it makes you more happy when ya found it out but then stand ya infront of an even bigger complicating puzzlethis game is really challenging for ppls who never seen a script or how they work. but yea =P some ppls like challenges right?

												The game is interesting at first, but quickly falls apart as you are left with no clear clue as to where to go, but worse, no clue as to what to hack. The hack rooms very VERY quickly become a forest of code that is hard to even figure out what it DOES, never mind what you want it to do. This isn't helped by the color coding of certain variables and constants making them difficult to read, using shades of colors that are indestinguishable from each other. Add to that that some variables/constants/functions are represented by crystals that have only color, but no names (those same colors that your eyes cannot tell the difference between) and you have a recipe for dispair. The end of the game comes so quickly, and expects so much from you that it is nigh impossible to finish the game without a LOT of experience in making games or a guide open in another window. I even question whether someone with coding experience could handle this game without knowledge of the specifics of video games, and therefore a knowledge of where to look. Honestly, don't bother with this game: it's too short, the story is too vague, the enemies and gameplay are too sparse, and the finale is infuriating as you question whether what you are doing will do ANYTHING to the villian as he literally burns the game's folder. I don't know how to feel about Double Fine anymore, beyond dull despair, as I remember the multiple playthroughs of Psychonauts I have completed and loved, rocking back and forth dreaming of a day when Brutal Legend, this game, and DF-9 hadn't shown us that Double couldn't actually FINISH a game if their lives depended on it. I don't think I'll be buying anything from them again, unless it's called ""Psychonauts 2"" because I am a sad-sack who can't let go.			"

												I would definitely recommend this one to anyone who wants to get some progamming tests in a form of a game.On the bright side:+ pretty fun, although sometimes humour is not so exquisite ;-)+ it's programming, you can improve your skillzDrawbacks:- pretty hard and restrictive in programming part, will not do for a beginner, I believe- has some bugs that will probably never be fixed- short, although this allows for an intense one-night playthrough session- pretty much no replayabilityTo sum up, this one is good, if you get it with a discount, otherwise it can wait... possibly forever.

tl;drAn interesting, if flawed, adventure game.  6/10Ps & Cs+ It lets you screw with the code of the world+ The game encourages exploiting+ Good sense of humor- The actual code portion is spaghetti and nearly indecipherable- No direction of any sort- Can be a bit tedious- Collision is spottyNitty GrittyThis game was an interesting mess.  The game starts and you're given almost no direction.  You wander aimlessly for an hour or two until you get your first exploit, but once you have that, the game really starts to open up and get fun.  As time goes on you're given more and more freedom to change the code of the game and herein lies some of the problem.  The code is broken out into this visual machine code that you can only interact with some of the time and there's no indication of what can be changed and what can't.Overall, I did enjoy my time with this game and that is why, despite it's many flaws, I give Hack 'n' Slash a thumbs up.  6/10			"

												This cute puzzle/hacking game isn't for those who are into serious hacking or serious gaming, but other than that I would recomend it. It's a puzzle game, but instead of pushing blocks or connecting nodes, you're ""hacking"" with programming logic. I showed it to the girl I used to babysit and she really enjoyed it. It's not just a really great way to get kids into a programming mind-frame, it's also a fun brain teaser. I don't constantly play this game, it's not that type of game. I play it when I'm in need of a bridge from creative thinking to logical thinking.			"

On the bright side, that means I was able to finish the darn thing. However, it does feel like the game wraps up just about the time you start leaning all the cool stuff. Although I will admit that some of the Cool Stuff started flying over my head. The game won't teach you code, but it will sort of teach you about code. Sometimes cleverly and intuitively, sometimes a bit more hamhandedly. The game doesn't always quite work, but when it does, it's kinda magical. Definitely recommend this one.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a cute idea, the animation is nice.. the mechanics work well enough for an alpha game (although, at full-release they'd be underwhelming).. This is an early access game review, so keep that in mind.The game is basically unplayable on Ubuntu 14.04. It crashes as soon as it starts running. It runs better in Windows, but not so much better that it stops crashing altogether. Overall, I find the actual engagement level with the game low. I expect that it'll improve when it's officially released. I'm going to put it down and wait until then.When it's released, I'll see if it will run on my Linux laptop and then update my review.			"

												I have played a lot of this game, but in offline mode.Hack 'n' slash is a great game. It is a little like zelda, but with hacking. When you start the game, you are given a sword. The second you hit something with the sword, it breaks in half. One half gets lost, the other is a USB that allows you to intereact creatively with dcertain objects. Need to move a bush? You change the code.			"

												This game is...unique, to be certain. It scratched an itch I didn't know I had. While my playtime does show 7 hours, I effectively beat the game in about four, only getting stuck on the final inch of the last puzzle due to a technicality (and a large amount of second-guessing myself). The game is quite short, almost disappointingly so, and the features available to you advance at a breakneck pace, which is extremely disorienting at first. You gain new abilities faster than I would like, and oftentimes they are not explained or even required for advancement, leaving you with items in your inventory that you have no idea how to use.  I used Ida and Halcyon a grand total of zero times throughout the game, and am still unsure as to what they were supposed to be used forAnother issue I have with this game, while not necessarily a ""bad thing"", is that oftentimes you will solve a puzzle without even knowing how you've done it or indeed, what exactly you were solving in the first place. The game's interface, while allowing you to view the code in macroscale, only allows you to edit it inside ""algorithm rooms"", which, besides being clunky on larger scripts, obfuscate the code by only allowing you to see a small amount of the script at a time while editing it, necessitating backing out of the room to view your changes on the code, and even then the behavioral changes to the game will only be apparent once you leave the room entirely. If your solution doesn't work, it's back to square one.Overall, an enjoyable game, but far from a polished experience.			"

												I really, really tried to like this game because I like Double Fine with their quirky ideas. Unfortunately, this game which has the very original idea of breaking the barrier between the developer and the player by letting the latter change actual variables in order to progress, has a few flaws that turn it into a boring, repetitive chore. Just imagine having to cross different screens or rooms in a Zelda-like world, trying to find some clue to let you progress and having to fight the same ennemies and move the same blocks every time you pass by. Now imagine having to do this by a rather cumbersome system of reprogramming those ennemies and blocks every single time. Imagine there is no reward for this: no gold, souls or XP. You just run around aimlessly, hoping to find some clue somewhere that will finally allow you to progress. Imagine finding artifacts with functions so puzzling that you can't shake off the feeling that they might allow you to progress somehow, somewhere, but you don't have any clue about how and where because the game loves to troll you with garbled messages or nonsensical gibberish. That's my experience in Hack 'n' Slash. The game could have been something if the developers had shown a little more concern about the players: give him a clue now and then, leave cleared stages cleared. I hate it when I have to use Google to progress in a game. No game in the world should ever need you to use a walkthrough or a forum in order to progress. This game makes it essential.Pros:- Nice, retroish Zelda-like game world and graphics- Open world- Very original conceptCons:- Repetitive, repetitive, repetitive, repetitive, repetitive, ...- Puzzles are often too abstract to figure out; no clues- I heard you could make the game crash by fiddling with some variablesTl;dr: This game has a very original concept. Get it if you're curious or if you're comfortable with the idea of playing a game that will make you feel completely lost in a world that makes you overcome the same obstacles over and over.			"

												I probably shouldn't be reviewing this game with less than an hour of gameplay, but I gave it an honest effort.  If anything, my lack of playtime should be a testament to how boring this game becomes.  I received this game for free from Double Fine, as an apology for the fun-yet-under-delivered game known as Spacebase DF-9.  At first, I was excited.  I had read about this game in Game Informer, and the idea of ""hacking"" objects to complete puzzles and fight was new.  Then once I witnessed the execution, I couldn't play for very long.A majority of the options for hacking any given object are redundant and/or pointless, but some can be fun to mess with.  For example, I hacked a bird that was trying to kill me, and made him keep attacking me for -20 damage, which meant he was constantly healing me for 20 hearts and rendered me invincible.  However, if I see another rock that I have to edit the movement value for just to push out of my way, I'll lose my♥♥♥♥♥♥  Shortly into the game, you are introduced to a method of time-travel, where you can go back into time to revisit any area you have visited.  This is a fun idea in theory, and adds to the depth of some puzzles, but can get very confusing.  The fact that you can rewind to the beginning of every single area you've ever visited in chronological order quickly adds confusion as to when you should use it, and when it has no purpose.  Not to mention if you've visited a place 10 times, that means there are 10 different points in time where you could rewind to that single area alone.   It does have benefits though, adding to puzzle depth as mentioned earlier, and acting as an auto-save feature for every area.  That way if you make a mistake, you won't have to load your last saved game and potentially lose progress.It's like an old point-and-click adventure game, where you have so many items in your inventory that you are absolutely lost, and no matter where you go you can't figure any new ideas out.  If you have to look for a walkthrough just to figure out what to do next, then you're no longer playing the game.  You're just parroting the instructions of someone who has already figured it out for themselves.Overall, the game is fun for a little bit.  I've seen most reviewers have managed to beat this game in about 4-6 hours.  So I'd say if this type of game still sounds interesting to you, wait for a generous sale.  As humorous as pricing the game at $13.37 is, I got it for free and still can't force myself to play beyond 35 minutes.			"

												(Preface: game was played in offline mode before going online to post this review, actual playtime: 1 hour 15 min)Too much power is given to the player right away, like God Mode which you can give yourself within less 30 minutes of playing the game. Anyone with or without basic programming knowledge can near instantly get infinite health. This poses an immediate problem as enemies are no longer any threat. Compounding this, all enemies parameters can be changed to make them friendly and EVEN HEAL YOU. Do you like puzzle blocks that can't be pushed? Enjoy changing variables for every one of them then!This game is not fun, it's tedious... much like real programming. Don't get me started on the damn turtle puzzle either. Obtuse puzzles and tedious gameplay. Would not recommend.			"

												An interesting concept of the game.Note that you have to understand programming in order to play this though, or you'll be confused when playing this game.This game doesn't rely on levels, items, or equipments. It relies on your brain.You'll be forced to think outside the box most of the time. Make sure you always notice that USB plug, though.However, i think that the game is too hard, especially in the last stage (the tower) since basically, you have to figure out in which file does the game needs to be hacked (and one wrong move can make the ""universe crashed"" and force you to retry and redo it from the last save)tl;dr: This game looks like Legend of Zelda mixed with programming.

												Must play it if you know and enjoy programming logics. Not otherwise though.As a teenager studying computer science, this game is everything I've dreamt for and beyond, and I'm saying this having progressed no longer than act 4. I have already seen and beaten every aspect of programming that I deal with on a daily basis, and yet I am not in any way bored. I am utterly entertained and challenged for every minute. I have even learned and gotten new ideas from this game alone. Thanks for that, Double Fine.But let's face it, you're probably not a computer science student. And since you're not, don't expect to find the same entertainment as I did. This is not a ah-let's-chill-out-this-afternoon-with-a-nice-little-indie-game-kind of game. This is a game that will test your math- and logic skills to the max. And if you're never written any code, you're pretty much screwed.Don't play it if you don't know a ♥♥♥♥ about programming; find some other game that fits your taste. Steam is vast.Don't play it either if you aim to learn programming; go find and spend money on some proper education.But if you know your way around coding and enjoy a challenge, you have no time or money to lose. Definetly worth 20 euros.Why I have voted it down if I enjoyed it? Because the question is not 'Do you like this game?' but 'Do you recommend this game?'. And since most gamers around here are in fact not future software developers, I cannot recommend it. This game is for a niche audience, and you are almost certainly not within that niche. 10/10 for computer geeks.3/10 for everyone else.			"

Early Access Review
								I had a really good time with this!  I come from a programming background so I was interested in the concept when it was described to me and it was really well executed.  I think it's telling that having finished Act 2, I ended up playing most of Act 3 last night before getting stuck looking for a missing door and then actually got up this morning, bought my laptop to bed and polished off Acts 3 and 4 - it's the sort of puzzle that I can't leave alone!As you would expect, there is the odd glitch - I had a few crashes, but the reload is pretty fast and I didn't seem to lose data so that wasn't too bothersome.  In Act 3, I felt that the player direction needed some work - I skipped a puzzle because I couldn't figure it out and ended up completeing a couple of puzzles and not being able to understand what the people were saying to me when I completed it - perhaps a little more steering would have been a good idea here?  That being said, I didn't need to back track once I had solved the piano puzzle (that was the only one where I felt that I'd solved it by poking, not by figuring it out though).  There were also a couple of points where a map would have been helpful, although I ended up using the save points as a crude map which sorted out my problem in the end.  Also, I would like to register a complaint that you can't swap Bob the sprite for Script the cat - I would love to have Script follow me around and miow!Overall, I loved this and I can't wait for Act 5 to come out - the moment at the end of Act 4 where you really feel like you're inside the guts of the code actually feels pretty amazing and if you like puzzle type games I thoroughly recommend it.

There are many glitches, which don't affect my rating of the game, but I think I should highlight the ones that I have encountered so far:While escaping from prison cell, you can get out of the boundaries by going down the staircase and continuing to walk right, this is fixed through going around to the anti-barrier circle again. With the boomerang hack artifact, if you die while the boomerang is in the air and it hits you, you will survive with 0 hp but you will be just a shadow. (Check my uploads for the picture).I have had to reload some areas due to getting stuck between objects too.I realize this is the first version of the game, so these don't bother me, I think it's pretty cool when Im still alive with 0 hp, but i think these should be addressed.

												I'm just getting started programming and thought this game looked like a bit of fun and challenge.  What I've found instead is a massive amounts of bugs.  Most of what I've experienced has been crash upon crash (usually freezing my entire screen with game image or font maps plastered across my screen).  The game also 'saves' not actually saving.  I've found when changing some of the codes in the game only to have them crash the game.  I'm quite tired of completing a puzzle, only to have the game freeze or return me to the same screen, only to try and progress - putting in the same answer, and freezing the game in an infinite loop. Ironic really.  For me, it's not playable at this point.Using a controller is possible, but slow to change characters and strings, but I've alternatively found that the keyboard is much more likely to the crash the game.Unrelated to the constant crashes and terrible UI, I think the game is cute with a great idea behind it. But it lacks any depth, is incredibly short, unpolished, and nowhere near worth the money.  For example - I thought there was a massive bug as the game starts you off in act 2, only to do some research online and find that it doesn't have an act 1. Did anyone test this game beforehand?I will attempt to complete it, if I can get it started again. But cannot recommend this to anyone else unless the bugs are fixed and it's massively on sale.			"

If you're an adventure puzzle game fan and dig retro 8-bit throwbacks-- give this game a try, you don't be disappointed.I'd love to see a 4-5x longer version with even more complexity- it truly is a unique game play experience where the possibilities of how certain puzzle get solved could be endless.Kudos to the Double Fine team- another excellent game.

								Basically ""Legend of Zelda"" the items you recieve change in coding of the in game characters. It can be a very difficult game. If you are like me and skip through the cut-scenes, without looking for any hints of what to do. The plot and writing of the game seems like it is attempting to be too funny, which kinda looses my interest. The art style looks like it was made using adobe flash, which is pleasing to my eyes. The price seems fair for the length if the game, the many unique puzzles, and the tons of gadgets that you get your hands on.  7/10 overall			"

								Do you like cheating video games, do you fondly remember the top down zelda games of your youth? Hack n Slash might be the game for you. It takes programming and cryptography concepts and turns them into intersting game mechanics and some pretty cool puzzles. It also has some great writing and the two main charactrers dialouge consistently made me laugh. If I have any complaints it is that the game seems short. Keep in mind I have only played the early access version wihich leaves out the 4th and final act of the game. I'm hopeful that this final act will satisfy by combinig the different game mechanics in unexpected ways to make some seriously mind bending puzzles.			"

								This game does a good job at teaching the hacker mindset. Instead of breaking the rules of the game by force, you subvert them by manipulating variables on NPCs using your magic USB sword. Each level is progressively nuanced in it's difficulty, encouraging the player to expirement and think outside of the box. Near the end of the game you actually get to hack simplistic programs that control locked gates. The game is honest in it's visualization of these programs, with both pseudo assembly code and as a series of machines that represent each step of the program.			"

								Currently the game is extremly short. It is a fun interesting game with interesting mechanics but the content so far lasts but a few hours supposidly only missing the final dungeon of what the release build will be. It is probably not a game you want to pick up at full price on day one when there is no user created content for it yet, but given a bit of time with Steam Works it can easily gain a lot more content to be worth the asking price.Unless it has a sale before getting Steamworks content I would say hold off on buying the game but definitly keep it in your watch list seeing when there is more content added to be worth the price, the soundtrack is quit good and once the game has enough content to be worth picking up I would definitly suggest getting the version with the soundtrack.

												From the little I played, it wasn't what I expected. Much less hack and slash and much more boring puzzle solving. The idea is really cool, editing an enemies stats to be advtnageous. The game surrounding that system is so boring. I was imagining more like an actual hack and slash, fighting to get my sword into the guy to drastically lower his HP stat or slow him down, or change him to friendly instead of...waiting for a turtle to flip over to change its walk cycle.I expected puzzler + hack and slash, not a poorly done, relies-on-one-gimic Zelda clone.

It's a fun game where you have to put yourself in the mind of a developer and nothing like this has every been attempted before.... as far as I am aware. It's incredibly clever and will have you reloading levels and trying out new hacks and codes.This is going to be a game on everyone's lips and is already heading for legendary status. - It's that good just get it!

												Ontop of that fact you have to endure painful, childish writing, the art style is the most boring, uninspired eye sore. There is little to no actual gameplay, within thirty seconds you're walking around, utterly directionless on an awkwardly drawn beach area with no map. From there you can walk in a circle, being attacked by birds that you cannot defend yourself from, just continously heal from the burning bushes everywhere? after you've walked in this nice circle though, you drop back into the hole you came from and discover an amazing revolutionary tool which allows you to change the passage of time itself!! would you believe I can now make the days go by up too 80% faster?! How that is at all helpful for my questing through this game I am very excited to find out. I reccomend this game to any of the most die-hard, zelda loving, neck bearding, redditors that mostlikely helped write this piece of uninspiring, culturally dead, generic garbage.			"

Early Access Review
								Even as an early access game, it doesn't seem to be doing much with it's core mechanic of hacking in-game items to alter the world. In fact, the alterations by and large felt unfulfilling, and in a lot of ways, simply an unneeded gimmick. I was willing to accept that until I hit a puzzle where I have to float around on invisible panels to slowly tweek the movement of a series of rotating rings.  It took way longer to complete than was entertaining. The hacking of each individual guard to get through certain areas gets tedious fast.I'll give the devs props on some things.The fact that the game runs in it's own virtual environment allowing it to restart seamlessly when crashes occure (and I assume they will even in the fully released game) is great design, and the idea itself is a very unique break of the 4th wall. Other issues, such as it's almost complete plotlessness might be ironed out as development continues, but there are many others that seem likely to not be.The hacking, as I said, get tedious fast. The art style often leaves it difficult to tell the difference between walls, cliffs, and walkable areas without the use of the hat or info opacity tool (which really seem to do the exact same thing).  Which okay, the invisible platporms you use that ability for are okay at best, but it shouldn't be needed just to walk around some areas.All this culminates in an unltimately frustrating gameplay experience that I'm not sure the original idea driving it can make up for. I'll probably come back to it later, but AS IT IS NOW, I can't recommend this game, hence the rating of NOT RECOMMENDED.			"

Initially, this entails little more than being able to tweak speed, damage, health and similar variables in order to bypass obstacles, but it eventually escalates to making poorly-tutorialized and potentially game-crashing alterations to core game scripts – by which time the game has become a tedious exercise in pouring through lines of code.

												Hack 'n' Slash is a gem of a game. Never have I had so much fun, well, learning as part of the games mechanics. I'd reccomend it to anyone with even the slightest interest in coding. The art is fantastic and the characters are vibrant. The game has charm, and I'd love to see more of it. And that's the problem. The game is rather short. It seems that the team working on it was told to pack it up and sell it as is. At the very least, I had hoped for the game to reach a higher level of public appeal and become a primer of sorts to introduce some programming concepts. Anyway, the game is one of the most unique experiences on steam and is well worth your time.			"

At 5 takes the programming aspects of this game to another level I really disliked the library aka a visual file system with books that I needed to find and edit. It was hard to navigate and too far removed from the puzzles I wanted to solve. Additionally when hacking I'd read through the code and figure out what I needed to change solve the problem only to find that my solution wasn't editiable.But in spite of all my problems if you can get this game for 90% off it's worth the $1.33 for 4h of fun plus 1h of walkthrough to beat the game.

												I recommend this game on an extreme sale(I paid a few bucks.), as the game itself is fun and all, the humors great, but the game is relatively short, and even shorter if you understand the programming behind it. It could be finished in probably 3 to 4 hours. It took me a bit longer.. as some parts really stumped me.Think.. uh. Link.. but with programming skills? It's a weird but unique game, worth a shot for those.. really into programming.Lots of replayability the more you know.. about well. The ""Hack"" aspect of the game as you can towards the end of the game.. pretty much edit every aspect of it. That in itself for those into that kind of thing could get pretty excited.Hope this helps.			"

												I like the main character and the sprite.  Their interactions are some of the best parts of the game.However, I'm sticking with a recommendation against buying it because it crashes *constantly*.  Every time I really started to get into it, it would bite it and I would have to start groping for some way to get around whatever blood clot had mysteriously gotten into the bloodstream of my game.The last time it happened I couldn't find a way around it so I gave up and deleted it.  :( "

												To put it simply, Hack 'n' Slash is terrible at explaining programming.  Near the end of the game, puzzles are simply impossible t complete unless you have prior knowledge of how code works.  The UI they choose to represent code is confusing and obtuse.  How am I supposed to know that a red word has the same value as a red crystal etc.Don't buy this game.  You'd have more fun hacking a Zelda ROM			"

												This is primarily a puzzle game with some aspects of an adventure game that are slightly similar to the Legend of Zelda games. However, unlike the Legend of Zelda games, the adventure side of this game is not fun. There is no direction, and there is nothing to help guide you down the correct path. You will have to do a lot of guess work, and that guess work will cost you a lot of time. You will need to spend a lot of time backtracking to figure out why you can't proceed down a specific path.The guess work doesn't end with the adventure aspect of the game either. Many of the puzzles are not intuitive. You will have to guess, and guessing incorrectly will crash the universe, causing you to have to reload from the last area you entered. This means you will have to start over any puzzles that are in the room where you failed. Crashing the universe is rather easy too. You can cause a crash by simply changing a boolean value from true to false.This game is not worth the money.			"

												Just beat the game and enjoyed it a lot. Beware that it requires some experience in programming and code reading. Don't buy this game if you don't know anything about algorithmics (variable assignments, conditionals, loops, boolean algebra). The game won't teach you programming at all. It will just throw programming puzzles at your face and hope you understand what it all means. It's also worth noting that the code samples might frustrate experienced programmers because of the way the game wants you to edit scripts. The game doesn't let you modify everything you want in plain text. It just shows you the algorithms as machines and only lets you modify the code in a few spots. You can't remove or add code instructions for instance. And you can only modify some of the instructions, not all of them. But this doesn't mean that the game is simple. It is not. The amount of available scripts is quite big and each of them might contain dozens of code lines. Figuring what to modify remains fun and challenging. And some hacks will make you feel clever. There are also a few interesting secrets to uncover. In short, it's a great game but it's not for everyone.			"

												I really wanted to like this game.  I really did.Disclaimer: I bought this as a full game, not as part of its early access program.The art style is nicely done, intentionally evoking similarities between itself and Legend of Zelda.The music is pleasant.The writing in parts is great and amusing, as is the story and setting.The core concept of hacking / changing variables and code to progress or solve puzzles is unique as far as my experience goes, and you could see the idea helping teach some coding alongside game progression.Disclaimer 2 - I don't have programming experience, although I do have a master's degree in chemical engineering.  Neither of these two things should be prerequisites to enjoying a game.The execution however leaves something to be desired.  A number of the concepts in the game are really poorly explained and so you will quite often find yourself fumbling around having accidentally changed something you didn't need to or breaking a puzzle in such a way that it is very difficult to get back on track (assuming you're learning the coding logic as the game presents it to you, as I was).  You will occasionally find yourself understanding the problem and having the solution, and yet being beaten back from it by often loose controls constantly sending you off the edge of tiny moving platforms.  You'll see speech and conversation that reads as though it hasn't been proof-read and is missing punctuation and grammar (not important until you're relying on it to help you solve puzzles).And then Act 4 happens, whereby you're set loose into a complex set of puzzles that are all but impossible to work around using the game's explanations.   Note that they aren't impossible, and often the solution is relatively simple, but the point of this is that the solution is obfuscated by so much poorly presented information that unless you already understand the puzzle (i.e. can read the code logic) and have written it out (to figure out what variables and subloops are  doing) you quickly find yourself giving up.I gave in part way through this.  Some games I enjoyed the experience so much that I persisted, or looked for solutions online to help me pass a sticky bit and enjoy the rest of it.  This was very much like trudging through treacle.Ultimately a missed opportunity, and a lesson in game development of why play testing and QA are important.Give it a miss.			"

												Wonderful game! If you like games like Zelda, or Ittle Dew, this is the game for you. Hack 'n' Slash bring some comedy to the gameplay with quirky character design, and somewhat whitty dialogue. The gameplay is as the title suggests, a hack and slash. BUT, the twist is your sword won't do any damage, instead you'll have to manipulate the game as you play, rewriting pieces of code to suit your needs at that time. This is definitely for someone who might have an aptitude for understanding code (or looking up walkthroughs).Towards the end, there is a LOT of room for mistake, and I even caused the game to crash a number of times beacuse hacked together buggy code. It would seem Lua doesn't like my ""creative"" solutions to the problems at hand. But the autosave feature is well implemented, and when you resume a game, you pick at what point in space time you wish to continue, so I was never left stranded, nor did I have to start over.All in all if you take your time to enjoy the game, it will last for 6 - 8 hours, which left me a little wanting when the credits started to roll. I hope Double FIne will double down and incorporate this unique gameplay aspect in another game.			"

												Every time I have started playing this game, it takes a minute before a really start to enjoy it.  But then I really enjoy it.  I've decided not to put it down for this reason, so I can complete it.The music is great.  It grew on me.The dialogue is also good.  It grew on me as well.I enjoy the puzzle solving immensely.  It feels very fresh and unique compared to other puzzles in games.  Some may be a little recycled but they still feel very novel to me.  Also, very rewarding to complete.  I would hate to ruin it with walkthroughs or spoilers.I really like the way you can seamlessly switch between mouse and keyboard.I do have a few complaints though.  The game is not entirely bug free.  For example, I had to hack ""something""(real object omitted to avoid spoilers) to continue in the game, and while I thought of this solution first, I wasn't actually able to hack it.  So, I reluctantly resorted to a walkthrough just to find out that I had been right all along.  Then I continued to try and eventually it worked.  It may be less a bug and more of me not standing in the right place or something?  Weird hit detection?  I have no idea.Another complaint is that, I have not been able to get the game to work with my rumblepad 2.  I assume the game uses Xinput, and my rumblepad only uses directinput.  Normally I just load X360ce into the folder and the controller works, but in this case I haven't been able to get it to work.  It may have something to do with some PS3 controller drivers interferring with x360ce, but I'm not sure.  However, the game is working my PS3 controller, using the aforementioned drivers, so this is the controller I've been using.  Also, in some ways the keyboard is superior, especially if you have a wireless keyboard.  And you can seamlessly switch between the controller and keyboard, which is nice.			"

												I enjoyed a lot the game, its atmosphere, story (mainly the final talk), and winks to old games.Definitely is for people who has some programming background, but you do not have to be a hacker (just the basic stuff: conditionals, loops, subrutines...). But if you are, you will not edit tons of code in vi as you may imagine. In fact, the scripts fit in your screen and the ""edition interface"" (consisting in rooms and hackeable objects) is quite time wasting, but I understand that is for non-programmers.About the programming language, you do not have to know lua at all, the scripts are quite intuitive.In summary, I have had fun hacking puzzles in a new way, so I recommend it !

												Very disappointed with this game.  Had a LOT of potential, but ended up being a waste of my time.The game has an interesting premise, but the execution is sorely lacking.  Hacking items gets old, especially since the world resets everytime you exit a room.  So that puzzle that you've completed already?  If you leave the area, you'll have to do it again.  And there's a lot of backtracking.  The idea of hacking items is interesting, and kinda cool the first few times, but eventually I just ended up running around enemies instead of hacking them, or just letting them hit me because I knew I'd heal up within a few seconds.The enemies you DO need to hack (guards, mostly) can be finnicky.  You want them to go to a specific location, but often times I'd have to hack them one direction at a time to get them to the correct location.  And since, as mentioned above, you have to do this everytime you re-enter an area, it gets REAL old real fast.Also, there's NO direction in this game.  I ended up using a walkthrough pretty religiously, because for the most part, I had NO idea where I needed to go next, or what I needed to be doing.  When I entered a puzzle room, I didn't know if I needed to come back later, or if it's something I could potentially solve with the tools on hand.  (Note: usually it's the tools on hand.)  But they certainly weren't clear about what needed to be done - although once you did it, it did appear fairly obvious most of the time.And even using a walkthough, I never finished the game.  The coding goes from changing values, to starting to do a bit of algorithmic stuff, to indepth coding REALLY fast, and as someone who codes for a living, the coding was either too simple, or stuff I didn't want to wade through to make sense of it.  And I know they had to ""simplify"" the interface for interacting with code, but my god if it didn't make my head hurt trying to figure out what I needed to deal with.  But eventually I just gave up, and quit the game.The final insult? In quitting the game, it crashed my computer - this is one I'm deleting from my library and will likely never fire up again.  I can't say I'm at all impressed with any of the games Doublefine has come out with lately, from the unfinished DF-9 (or whatever the hell it is), the ""we need more money"" Broken Age (which I sadly backed - it's the only kickstarter I backed I regretted, and there were kickstarters I backed that I never saw anything from) and this, which feels like a really cool concept coded up by high school comp-sci students.tl;dr - Don't waste your money.  It might be worth picking up if you can get it for free, but I still think there are better things to do with your time, like anything else.  Watch a Let's Play, and you'll get to see the best and the worst of it.			"

												This is a good game in concept. You run around with a little sword that allows you access into what appears to be that entity's global variables, adjusting things such as HP, direction, alligience, etc. It has a decent storyline, and the game was actually quite entertaining.However, it gives you the sense that you are simply running around. There is no real sense of direction, similar to Pokemon that you just walked around until you found what you wanted, but to a bigger extreme.The coding puzzles where you actually saw machines were not designed to encourage learning. My mentality going through those puzzles was ""Ok hit this, look at random crap that makes no sense, change something, hit this, hit this, change, hit, change, OH I SOLVED IT!!"" I am not a foreigner to coding, but the coding setups they have you work with are not intuitive in the slightest.The game was incredibly short. I finished the game in about 4 hours, including loitering, screwing around with random objects, and having no idea where I was going. And the developers haven't made any contact or updates with the public really. It needs more content.Overall, the game felt like a side project, something that a few people casually worked on in their spare time, with user input being virtually useless, and no level of satisfaction from actually completing the puzzles. If you have money that you must spend, don't spend it here. But if you get the game for free, it will give you a couple hours of enjoyment			"

My main points for giving a 7 and not higher, is its really more of an adventure game, than it is a programming game, or hacking game, and its a little to expensive for the level of the game, but on sale, its worth it, and still fun.

												If you're a programmer, you'll love this game about hacking the world. If you're not, the game concepts and joke references will likely fly right over your head.[Potential Spoilers Ahead]The mechanics of the game are to hack the game to your benefit. Throughout the game, you slowly gain access to the very lua script files that make up the game itself, and you can edit all of it (within a limit), even to the point that the game crashes (with a cute dialog telling you that ""the universe has imploded""). By the end of the game, you are literally editing the files of the game (in a virtual file system in memory) via a ""Breakpoint Bomb"". It's a hilariously ingenious concept taken to its logical conclusion with the final set of levels, and I loved it. It has a witty sense of humor about it (the main character's default names are ""Alice"" and ""Bob"", a cute reference for any security nerds out there) that leans very heavily on the fourth wall without ever actually completely breaking it (that is to say, the characters never actually say ""oh this is a game"", but they treat the fact that they are made of source code like its an everyday fact of life).A fun dalliance in the concept that'll last you about 4-8 hours, depending on how much bumbling and code examination about you do. I heartily recommend it for the concept alone.			"

												Controls are mostly terrible, particularly for modifying code. It's possible, even likely, that you'll neglect to complete a puzzle or two along the way, but manage to progress anyway. This is a problem because without solving certain puzzles, other puzzles in the future will be virtually impossible to solve. Specifically, there were a couple puzzles in the jail that I missed but I escaped anyway (without trying very hard) and had to lookup how to solve other puzzles I ran into in order to discover that I never should have made it out of the jail the way I did.Also, the game bugged out when I tried to exit. I understand glitches are sorta supposed to be a part of the gameplay, but when you're trying to quit the game and it freezes up, that's a bug that shouldn't exist.			"

												Nope.Pros:- The first bit of the game is quite fun.  You can sneak up on critters and objects, hacking them to change their behaviors and the rules that they play by.  It's a fantastic concept, and it would be wonderful if someone made an enjoyable game with it, someday.Cons:- The latter half of the game is a programming simulator.  Instead of straight-up hacking a target to solve a puzzle, you'll find yourself picking apart the code that holds it together.  It's tedious, boring, and largely unplayable, due mainly to the fantastic amount of actual game-breaking crashes that you'll experience along the way.The writing is nothing to phone home about either, which in itself is a terrible thing to say about a Double Fine game.  Verdict?  Just walk away. "

												Although I ultimately somewhat liked Hack 'n' Slash, I feel that I can not recommend it to most people. Indeed the only people I would even consider recommending this to are programmers. (Disclosure: I am a programmer) Ultimately I'd consider my rating as between the thumbs up and thumbs down.First off, as much as we'd all love if it was the case, it is not a video game that teaches programming. This is very much a video game made by programmers for programmers. If you are not a programmer, you'll need gameFAQs (or steam guide) up on your other screen. And even if you are, you still might need that aid from time to time.Hack 'n' Slash can be clever at times, and can make you feel clever at times as well. But once the full extent of your powers are available, it is far too easy to be too clever to sequence break or crash the game. The game can also feel like an old school adventure game and not in the good way as you'll have puzzles that are not required to beat the game, ways of beating puzzles that bypass other critical puzzles, and puzzles that can't be solved until later. It can be difficult to figure out which of these situations is the case, although this was only an issue as part of the Escape from the Castle.Despite this, I enjoyed the presentation and the charm of the world and characters. By the end you are able to weld nearly godlike powers in this world in a way that seems clever... I just wish I got more chances to weld or misuse that power. Still... just like in real programming... debugging is such a pain. But it is even worse here thanks to a lack of a debugger.			"

Seriously, its beyond easy to create a mock python implementation. The developers were just lazy, and thought that they'd entirely miss a market if they made this an actual game about programming. Avoid this god awful mess at all costs			"

												The setup of the game starts out nice, but the deeper you are able to dive into the code, to more you start to get annoyed by the awefull gameplay.In the end it felt more like a prototype game with a 'story' slapped on.			"

												This is primarily a puzzle game with some aspects of an adventure game that are slightly similar to the Legend of Zelda games. However, unlike the Legend of Zelda games, the adventure side of this game is not fun. There is no direction, and there is nothing to help guide you down the correct path. You will have to do a lot of guess work, and that guess work will cost you a lot of time. You will need to spend a lot of time backtracking to figure out why you can't proceed down a specific path.The guess work doesn't end with the adventure aspect of the game either. Many of the puzzles are not intuitive. You will have to guess, and guessing incorrectly will crash the universe, causing you to have to reload from the last area you entered. This means you will have to start over any puzzles that are in the room where you failed. Crashing the universe is rather easy too. You can cause a crash by simply changing a boolean value from true to false.This game is not worth the money.			"

												My No recommendation comes with the caveat that if it's on sale for $5 or so, you should buy this in a heartbeat. Why?Great ideas, sloppy execution.The core mechanics of this game are brilliant. Unfortunately, the actual implementation seems to have been rushed out the door a bit. Certain puzzles are frustrating not due to difficult thinking, but because of the difficulty in interfacing with their components.The puzzle shortly after you get the boomerang is a good example of this- one learns that the pyramids  ""offset"" value  can control concentric rings with gaps in them, letting you cause their rotations to sync up. Unfortunately, getting them to actually do this takes a lot of trial-and-error, and not the fun kind.This sort of problem, where you have mentally ""solved"" a puzzle but must still put in several minutes of effort to cause that solution to take effect, repeats itself regularly throughout the game. The hacking interface, while pleasing and atmospheric initially, quickly becomes an irritant and discourages the use of complex hacking in favor of ""Turn Thing Off"" due to the clumsiness in setting advanced things like enemy pathing.There may exist community mods that adress some of these issues, but for now, I don't recommend you pay full price for this.

												As many before me have said, and unfourtunately what I did not read until after I bought this game, is that in short, great idea, TERRIBLE execution. This is a brilliant concept for a game and has great potential, but it's spoiled by the people put in charge of it. It works I suppose, mostly does what it says on the box, but you kind of forget about that part while wondering how they let it out the door like this. The whole thing feels rather cheap and unfinished, all the graphics look pretty childish, the story has no structure, there are little to no instructions/tutorials for the user, and the maps are nothing but  big images with some hitboxes. It's confusing to try to play through because there's no direction usually. As said previously, it plays like a promising alpha of a game, but for some reason the developers thought that this was good enough for final release. I can't really nail down why this game feels quite so cheap, but I imagine that's because everything is the problem. Everything needs some work.			"

												I really wanted to like this game.  I really did.Disclaimer: I bought this as a full game, not as part of its early access program.The art style is nicely done, intentionally evoking similarities between itself and Legend of Zelda.The music is pleasant.The writing in parts is great and amusing, as is the story and setting.The core concept of hacking / changing variables and code to progress or solve puzzles is unique as far as my experience goes, and you could see the idea helping teach some coding alongside game progression.Disclaimer 2 - I don't have programming experience, although I do have a master's degree in chemical engineering.  Neither of these two things should be prerequisites to enjoying a game.The execution however leaves something to be desired.  A number of the concepts in the game are really poorly explained and so you will quite often find yourself fumbling around having accidentally changed something you didn't need to or breaking a puzzle in such a way that it is very difficult to get back on track (assuming you're learning the coding logic as the game presents it to you, as I was).  You will occasionally find yourself understanding the problem and having the solution, and yet being beaten back from it by often loose controls constantly sending you off the edge of tiny moving platforms.  You'll see speech and conversation that reads as though it hasn't been proof-read and is missing punctuation and grammar (not important until you're relying on it to help you solve puzzles).And then Act 4 happens, whereby you're set loose into a complex set of puzzles that are all but impossible to work around using the game's explanations.   Note that they aren't impossible, and often the solution is relatively simple, but the point of this is that the solution is obfuscated by so much poorly presented information that unless you already understand the puzzle (i.e. can read the code logic) and have written it out (to figure out what variables and subloops are  doing) you quickly find yourself giving up.I gave in part way through this.  Some games I enjoyed the experience so much that I persisted, or looked for solutions online to help me pass a sticky bit and enjoy the rest of it.  This was very much like trudging through treacle.Ultimately a missed opportunity, and a lesson in game development of why play testing and QA are important.Give it a miss.			"

It needs a ton of work and even for the 2 dollars I bought it, I would say this is an experiment at best.			"

												I want to like this game, so much.It plays like this, though:1)2) Neat idea! A Zelda-like game where you actively manipulate the game's internal structure to progress! Cool! Fun art style, buildup to a story, alright!3) Expands on 2. The puzzles ramp up, but in a mostly expected way. Wait, why did THAT crash everything? No worry. It still looks pretty fun.4) Um, ok, this is a huge step up from the past. Like, a completely different type of hacking. I did enjoy this part, as a legit challenge, since I do like learning about coding/scripting and and it seems like this is building up to a few hours of neat, coding inspired gameplay. ... Story here is basically nonexistent, though.5) ...What. Just, what. If you're going to throw THAT at me, why did you chose the very last couple of puzzles to do so?Basically, this is a game with a massive difficulty cliff at the very end of it for those not initially familiar with scripting. It is a game that can probably be beaten in 3 hours or less if you are, and if you are, you're wondering why you have to go through the game's UI of chapter 5 to do what you already know you need to do. Really, who on earth is the intended audience for the last chapter?! I'm pretty sure almost everyone is either nowhere near experienced enough in scripting to even know what to do, at all, or is experienced enough, and the ending is more an exercise in coping with a weird UI instead of just doing what you have to do yourself.And this is why I cannot recommend it. The first parts of the game as a great draw to people who like to think about changing variables, with an engaging gameplay style. The middle will do what's essentially a bait-and-switch from fun puzzle-action-adventure game to really tricky introduction to coding stuff. I had a hard time getting through Chapter 5 even WITH a walkthrough. I beat Chapter 4 without a guide or prior scripting experience in LUA.That game really, REALLY feels like it ran out of budget in the end, and had to be really awkwardly compressed. The story's compression seems to second this.I beat that which I could be reasonably expected to complete, given my past coding/scripting knowledge, in about 2 and a half hours, and the last chapter felt completely inaccessible to me. For a game that costs over $10, it gives either 3-6 hours of gameplay before you hit a wall (be it the later parts of Chapter 3, Chapter 4 or Chapter 5)l or 3 or so hours of gameplay which is really not challenging because you KNOW what you're doing. Which isn't worth it.Maybe if you can get it on a pretty big discount, or in a bundle, it's worth experiencing. You're probably going to have fun for a little while, then wonder what the hell happened. I'd have loved a few hours of the first three or so chapters, instead of what I got.			"

												Every time I have started playing this game, it takes a minute before a really start to enjoy it.  But then I really enjoy it.  I've decided not to put it down for this reason, so I can complete it.The music is great.  It grew on me.The dialogue is also good.  It grew on me as well.I enjoy the puzzle solving immensely.  It feels very fresh and unique compared to other puzzles in games.  Some may be a little recycled but they still feel very novel to me.  Also, very rewarding to complete.  I would hate to ruin it with walkthroughs or spoilers.I really like the way you can seamlessly switch between mouse and keyboard.I do have a few complaints though.  The game is not entirely bug free.  For example, I had to hack ""something""(real object omitted to avoid spoilers) to continue in the game, and while I thought of this solution first, I wasn't actually able to hack it.  So, I reluctantly resorted to a walkthrough just to find out that I had been right all along.  Then I continued to try and eventually it worked.  It may be less a bug and more of me not standing in the right place or something?  Weird hit detection?  I have no idea.Another complaint is that, I have not been able to get the game to work with my rumblepad 2.  I assume the game uses Xinput, and my rumblepad only uses directinput.  Normally I just load X360ce into the folder and the controller works, but in this case I haven't been able to get it to work.  It may have something to do with some PS3 controller drivers interferring with x360ce, but I'm not sure.  However, the game is working my PS3 controller, using the aforementioned drivers, so this is the controller I've been using.  Also, in some ways the keyboard is superior, especially if you have a wireless keyboard.  And you can seamlessly switch between the controller and keyboard, which is nice.			"

												Initially it seems like a good game. The idea that you could ""hack"" anything in the game sounds completely interesting. However, the execution of the game is really bad. I lost interest with the hacking mechanics after a short while of gameplay. The graphics itself is not impressive. I initially thought i could simply turn a blind eye on this. but no, I was wrong.

												You should take the title quite literally, as the game may be Zelda-looking, but it got a twist. Main character's sword is also a hacking tool which would help you to bend the rules of the game a bit. It's interesting and a bit unsual, it challanges the player not only to kill all that moves, as usual, but also, to use your head.			"

												It's a fun little game that's different from what you're used to but even being a programmer I found it difficult sometimes to process the LUA code as it was hard to get an overview. I can imagine that this game isn't for everyone and I'm not recommending it because of this, the target audience is simply too small. Took me just over 6 hours to complete in casual mode (ea laying in the couch watching TV whilst playing). So get it only if you're curious and it's on sale.			"

												The idea of a game you can 'hack' seemed appealing - it seemed to offer a way of opening-up a genre which is often linear, repetitive and derivative.The problem here is that what you're given to work with feels MORE restrictive than a regular game with regular puzzles and regular combat!The things you're allowed to do are so basic - and repeated so often - that you quickly forget any notion of 'hacking' and simply repeat a slightly different form of grind.Worse, it's a fiddly and annoying one because the UI you work with is AWFUL.  Setting numeric values is done with arrows - no keyboard input is available - what!?  Do you know how AWFUL an idea that is?Cannot recommend this unless you think a light RPG/adventure with nasty controls is your thing...			"

												I'm on the fence about this game.The idea and basic premise is that instead of playing a regular Zelda-like game (which it looks like) you accidentally break your sword, expose a USB port in it and learn to hack the game itself.Which would be cool... if it wasn't so annoyingly done in terms of plot, pacing, and what you can do. Initially you uncover the usual stuff - like get one heart more health etc. This seems important until basically two or three scenes later you discover how to raise your hearts to basically any amount you want. Yes, this teaches the basics of the game but is pretty disappointing, having such nonsensical interim achievements.So, most of the first half of the game you interact with the game world by changing values in enemies and objects. This is generally fun and makes for some awesome puzzles, some of them so obscure they are true headscratchers. You also get to look at the first game scripts, but you cannot manipulate them directly, only the world.In this way you keep collecting items that help you alter the game world and overcome scene by scene. Initially it seems like it is an open game world where you run around and do stuff in your own order. The walking around takes too long and adds no fun to the game itself or makes it more immersive. In reality it obscures that you can access maybe half a dozen initial areas, only half of which you can solve. The game is pretty linear in what order you must tackle things, it only makes solving the puzzles harder by not letting you know what fits where and what needs to be done next. Often frustratingly so! I missed up on the first boss because I didn't know where it would show up.In general, the puzzles are between clever and entertaining to downright obscure in the first half of the game. Progress is good and you feel like accomplishing something. Just don't expect much of a plot or ability to divert from the order in which puzzles must be solved. The puzzles often involve manipulating the environment in new ways, sometimes you even miss out on the fact that you can affect the environment - like your little friend. Kudos to everyone who can beat this part without any sneak peeking, some stuff was really obscure.Just to make sure you know how the puzzles in this game are (mild spoiler follows): You need to guess correctly that the words you are trying to form by hacking several scripts are ""Hack the planet."" Good luck for those who didn't see ""Hackers"" or guess this right.In the second half of the game you get to manipulate ""game code"" directly. So, you get access to the little scripts that steer things - doors, triggers, ports, etc. These scripts are written in some colorful Lua it seems. Expect no tutorial. People not knowing how to program need not apply. Don't know what a ""continue"" statement does? Now you will be in trouble. There is no help, no real tutorial, nothing. You just get presented with code and that's it. You then cannot freely modify it but only parts of it through a fairly obscure ""walk around in the code"" mini game. Most of the time the structure of the code is or seems fixed and you can only change values or operators to affect things.To make matters worse and challening, the code is hacked and cobbled together. The more you progress, the more obscure the code becomes, and I still haven't found out how certain things work - especially since there seems to be some colored diamonds acting as variables and you never get to see all the code, nor modify all of it. As I understand it so far, you don't get to manipulate input parameters to the scripts - or to see them - and this makes the hacking all the more - well, hacky.I write code for a living and I find as I progress the game becomes more and more obscure. Lua is easy to pick up, but only the more logic-minded individuals with some previous programming knowledge will have a chance at succeeding. Plus, the code is deliberately obscure, so you will spend most of your time towards the end trying to outwit whoever wrote those scripts to solve puzzles. The game then becomes rather slow and tedious. I would say this game has a good and novel premise. It does not execute it well, nor does it a good job with teaching how to play itself, how to code, or how to understand code. There are sudden jumps in how challenging stuff is. Even trying to get a minor chest that was empty early on to spawn an item requires going through dozens of lines of obscure code, apparently even mixed up even with how the animations work. I gave up on that one.Most people who aren't into coding probably won't enjoy the game at all. Not everyone who does know how to write code might enjoy it either. The fun and charm of the characters from the beginning is practically absent in the second half where puzzles completely replace plot and all other elements of the game. Prepare to code yourself to victory. I didn't finish yet. Sooo tedious...			"

But the concept is interesting and I do recommend it for people, who want a game, that accurately represents what modifying code (or ""hacking"" if you wish) is like. You won't have to write anything new, just change around variables, operators and functions. Despite that, this isn't a good game for someone completely unfamiliar with programming, it will probably feel just frustrating.			"

												The first half is pretty standout on it's own. Cute, fun, and just the right difficulty. There are a lot of ""hacks"" that seem like huge game-breaking advantages that are either necessary or don't impact the game at all. And then scripting is introduced.I ended up looking up a guide for most of the second half. At first I thought that was a negative, until I realized that's something you do when coding for real.Props as well for letting players mess with variables that will actually crash the game.			"

												I wish I could recommend this game. The concept is wonderful, and it was fun for a bit. But unless you're an actual real life programmer, you have little hope of ever seeing the end on your own. Assuming you can get to Act 4 without looking up a walkthrough, at that point you would almost certainly have to look it up to get anywhere. Its far easier to bug, crash, or completely screw up the game to the point it won't play than it is to figure out what exactly you need to change to move on. I sincerely hope someone learns from this and either makes this game playable to non-programers or creates a new one that capitalizes on this unique concept in a more enjoyable way. Until then, I wouldn't waste your money unless you either really like crashing a game over and over until you get lucky or like using walkthroughs rather than actually beating the game.			"

												Hack 'n' Slash is a game that has an ambitious premise, but unfortunately doesn't seem to be able to fulfill that ambition. The idea here is that while some games would use magic as your way to control your surroundings, in this game everything has underlying code so that you instead are manipulating the 'rules' of your environment that way.As a concept, it's a pretty interesting one, and it's the sort of thing that I do really like as one that could start introducing people to coding in the first place. The big problem I have with it, though, is that it seems to increase in difficulty dramatically, almost impossibly so. What caught me most off guard with that is that I'm used to coding on a daily basis, so while I found some of the early levels extremely straight forward, I didn't fault it because it's clearly trying to get the player in the right mindset for coding, and so it does a good job with that in its own right.About 2/3rds of the way though, though, the game kicks it up a notch and the problem I have there is that while I feel like the first half has some level of intuitive nature, the last section of the game seems to drop that, and the whole thing becomes increasingly obscure. There are a few points where the solutions seems so specific and so obscure that I feel like it'd be too likely to discourage anyone that's not particularly stubborn to figure out the specific particulars of the game itself, rather than the underlying logic.I like a lot about the first half of the game, and I really do enjoy the concept, but it's difficult for me to recommend it at regular price (currently 13.37). If you get the chance to pick it up for less, though, as I did for around $5, then I think it can be worth the money at that point, especially for getting a gist of coding in a pretty novel way. Just don't expect to finish the game.			"

												Another disappointement from Double Fine, that I used to love. The premise is very promising (litterally hack the game files to progress) but the execution is poor.The first two acts are pretty nice and engaging. Stuff are correctly explained and riddles are not too hard to solve. Some clever tricks allow you to get a lot of HP or increase drastically your HP regen, which is useless but rewarding to do. Then from the third act it just starts getting downhill very fast. The game suddenly requires you to read Lua bytecode/assembly and modify it. The problem is, bytecode/assembly is NOT supposed to be read by a human, it's optimized code much closer to the machine than to what a human would write. As a result, most code snippets don't make any sense, and I just went through the end of Act 3 by tinkering with random variables until something worked, because it was THAT painful to decypher that spaghetti bytecode and all its GOTO and LT. I finally gave up in Act 4, when suddenly I had to comb through libraries made of thousands of lines of bytecode in order to find the one useful variable to change. My job is developper, and I found myself thinking that working was funnier than playing this game.I guess they fell short of money midway through the development time, didn't have time to develop a way to give us the source code instead of the bytecode and rushed the game, which would explain the pretty good first two acts and the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor acts 3 and 4. So yeah, unless you work on Lua bytecode or love assembly code, I wouldn't recommend this game. If you never touched programming of your life, the first two acts are okay, but don't bother trying to go through Act 3.			"

												'Hack 'n' Slash' resembles 'The Legend of Zelda', but with hacking puzzles. It sounds like a good combination in theory, but not so so in execution. What I love about 'The Legend of Zelda' games is the sense of adventure they convey and the freedom they give you to explore. 'Hack 'n' Slash' lacks both early in the game, and by the time the so-called ""adventure"" has begun, I had grown disinterested.The early hacking puzzles were amusing at first. The game doesn't seem to give the player much of a tutorial on what to do with each weapon or artifact and how to ""hack"". Worse, many, if not all, puzzles reset after you returned from the next area. This made the puzzles repetitive and annoying quickly. Furthermore, it feels that your actions in the game have little consequence on your suroundings. It also doesn't help that objectives of some puzzles are not clearly explained.Prior to playing 'Hack 'n' Slash', I had less-than-exciting first impressions of 'The Witcher' and 'LEGO: Batman'. I was really hoping third time's the charm, but that is not so. I can't recommend 'Hack 'n' Slash'; it is a great collection of ideas, but quite unpolished. If only someone could hack it and make it better.			"

												The game is unique in the way that it set out to be. You pretty much need to be at least at an intermediate level with coding knowledge to have any chance of getting through this game without guides. It was fun to do quirky things like toggle friend/foe of enemies and hacking your character. However, the game does not provide a sufficient ramp up for those who simply don't understand the subtleties of programming. The common person probably wouldn't know what a ""tick"" or ""init"" function's purpose is. It was also frustrating that they pretty much expose the entire game's code. This can make for some very bad situations where you might actually break the game. You can always roll back but there's no indication of wheter you're making good progress or not. In the end even I had to refer to guides for a few puzzles, if for nothing else, to make sure that I was on the right track.Check this out if you have programming experience. If not, go ahead and playthrough but make sure you've got a guide handy. Give yourself maybe 30 minutes/puzzle and if you're not making any progress, just look up the answer. Otherwise you'll probably find yourself hating this game.			"

												Hack 'n' Slash was a game that initially interested me because of its unique approach to puzzle solving (change the game's code? how cool!), but I'd heard mixed things, so I wrote it off. Later, I saw it appeared on quite a few end-of-year top 10 lists from people whose opinion on games generally seemed similar to mine, so I got to thinking if maybe the coding elements just weren't for everyone. Since they totally are for me, I saw that it was on sale and took a chance.Whoops.Right from the get go, Hack 'n' Slash feels like a slapped together indie product. It is the sort of thing that would wow you if it were on Kongregate or some free flash site, but will immediately make you wonder about your fiscal prudence. Rather than put you through an interesting sequence of puzzles, Hack 'n' Slash dumps you unceremoniously into a Zelda like open world, but unlike a Zelda-like open world, there is absolutely no direction, nor rhyme, nor reason to what you're supposed to do. Worse still, the low production values extend to the gameplay as well; why do I have to scroll slowly through numerical values instead of just typing them in?The aesthetic is beautiful, the animation is eye gougingly bad (presumably to allow for the fact that the player can speedit up), and the main character looks so stupid that it affected my enjoyment of the game. I futzed around hoping to encounter something interesting but that never happened. Even the title screen is amazingly unresponsive (it prompts you with just the word ""Enter"", but you'll have to practically mash the return key before you actually get the result you want).Don't buy Hack 'n' Slash.

The arbitrary rating: 8/10I don't want to get too detailed about this game because it was just some adventure. You think creatively to continue on throughout the game. You gotta always be mindful of what items you've collected. There are many games that give you item after item after item, and it always seems like as you progress, your older items become obsolete, their effects being replace by newer, better ones. In Hack 'n' Slash all your items synergize and remain useful throughout the game. Blah blah blah. The game is 100% about the adventure, aaaaaaaand hackin'♥♥♥♥♥♥in your environment. But mostly about the adventure. It's definitely atmospheric and kept my attention well enough to keep me playing until I completed it in my first and only session. Hack 'n' Slash can be really buggy, especially toward the end of the game, which would explain the, err, 8-10$ reduction from its original, Early Access pricepoint. I've gone out of bounds like four times in the prison. I've had the game relinquish my control over my character in one screen (while hacking) and give me control of my character in the original screen, effectively breaking the game by denying dialogue, access to inventory, or the ability to leave an area. And boy does all that break your immersion.But hey it's actually a pretty amazing game. I was completely enthralled by the writing and the way cutscenes, acts, and the end flow so seamlessly. It just kept me playing the whole time.Bah, buggy or not this game is ♥♥♥♥ing great. Just get it :P			"

												Although I ultimately somewhat liked Hack 'n' Slash, I feel that I can not recommend it to most people. Indeed the only people I would even consider recommending this to are programmers. (Disclosure: I am a programmer) Ultimately I'd consider my rating as between the thumbs up and thumbs down.First off, as much as we'd all love if it was the case, it is not a video game that teaches programming. This is very much a video game made by programmers for programmers. If you are not a programmer, you'll need gameFAQs (or steam guide) up on your other screen. And even if you are, you still might need that aid from time to time.Hack 'n' Slash can be clever at times, and can make you feel clever at times as well. But once the full extent of your powers are available, it is far too easy to be too clever to sequence break or crash the game. The game can also feel like an old school adventure game and not in the good way as you'll have puzzles that are not required to beat the game, ways of beating puzzles that bypass other critical puzzles, and puzzles that can't be solved until later. It can be difficult to figure out which of these situations is the case, although this was only an issue as part of the Escape from the Castle.Despite this, I enjoyed the presentation and the charm of the world and characters. By the end you are able to weld nearly godlike powers in this world in a way that seems clever... I just wish I got more chances to weld or misuse that power. Still... just like in real programming... debugging is such a pain. But it is even worse here thanks to a lack of a debugger.			"

												My No recommendation comes with the caveat that if it's on sale for $5 or so, you should buy this in a heartbeat. Why?Great ideas, sloppy execution.The core mechanics of this game are brilliant. Unfortunately, the actual implementation seems to have been rushed out the door a bit. Certain puzzles are frustrating not due to difficult thinking, but because of the difficulty in interfacing with their components.The puzzle shortly after you get the boomerang is a good example of this- one learns that the pyramids  ""offset"" value  can control concentric rings with gaps in them, letting you cause their rotations to sync up. Unfortunately, getting them to actually do this takes a lot of trial-and-error, and not the fun kind.This sort of problem, where you have mentally ""solved"" a puzzle but must still put in several minutes of effort to cause that solution to take effect, repeats itself regularly throughout the game. The hacking interface, while pleasing and atmospheric initially, quickly becomes an irritant and discourages the use of complex hacking in favor of ""Turn Thing Off"" due to the clumsiness in setting advanced things like enemy pathing.There may exist community mods that adress some of these issues, but for now, I don't recommend you pay full price for this.

												Controls are mostly terrible, particularly for modifying code. It's possible, even likely, that you'll neglect to complete a puzzle or two along the way, but manage to progress anyway. This is a problem because without solving certain puzzles, other puzzles in the future will be virtually impossible to solve. Specifically, there were a couple puzzles in the jail that I missed but I escaped anyway (without trying very hard) and had to lookup how to solve other puzzles I ran into in order to discover that I never should have made it out of the jail the way I did.Also, the game bugged out when I tried to exit. I understand glitches are sorta supposed to be a part of the gameplay, but when you're trying to quit the game and it freezes up, that's a bug that shouldn't exist.			"

												If you're a programmer, you'll love this game about hacking the world. If you're not, the game concepts and joke references will likely fly right over your head.[Potential Spoilers Ahead]The mechanics of the game are to hack the game to your benefit. Throughout the game, you slowly gain access to the very lua script files that make up the game itself, and you can edit all of it (within a limit), even to the point that the game crashes (with a cute dialog telling you that ""the universe has imploded""). By the end of the game, you are literally editing the files of the game (in a virtual file system in memory) via a ""Breakpoint Bomb"". It's a hilariously ingenious concept taken to its logical conclusion with the final set of levels, and I loved it. It has a witty sense of humor about it (the main character's default names are ""Alice"" and ""Bob"", a cute reference for any security nerds out there) that leans very heavily on the fourth wall without ever actually completely breaking it (that is to say, the characters never actually say ""oh this is a game"", but they treat the fact that they are made of source code like its an everyday fact of life).A fun dalliance in the concept that'll last you about 4-8 hours, depending on how much bumbling and code examination about you do. I heartily recommend it for the concept alone.			"

												This is a good game in concept. You run around with a little sword that allows you access into what appears to be that entity's global variables, adjusting things such as HP, direction, alligience, etc. It has a decent storyline, and the game was actually quite entertaining.However, it gives you the sense that you are simply running around. There is no real sense of direction, similar to Pokemon that you just walked around until you found what you wanted, but to a bigger extreme.The coding puzzles where you actually saw machines were not designed to encourage learning. My mentality going through those puzzles was ""Ok hit this, look at random crap that makes no sense, change something, hit this, hit this, change, hit, change, OH I SOLVED IT!!"" I am not a foreigner to coding, but the coding setups they have you work with are not intuitive in the slightest.The game was incredibly short. I finished the game in about 4 hours, including loitering, screwing around with random objects, and having no idea where I was going. And the developers haven't made any contact or updates with the public really. It needs more content.Overall, the game felt like a side project, something that a few people casually worked on in their spare time, with user input being virtually useless, and no level of satisfaction from actually completing the puzzles. If you have money that you must spend, don't spend it here. But if you get the game for free, it will give you a couple hours of enjoyment			"

It would be much easier if you simply weren't capable of walking off the cliffs you weren't meant to leave. Likewise, if you go more than a step or two into water, you immediately fall beneath the waterline, giving the same animation and effect as if you had just walked off a cliff. The story was hard to see much of, as I only completed Act 2 (and why did it start at Act 2, instead of Act 1?), but I find the game too frustrating to continue with.			"

												The creator’s reputation is the only real reason I bought the game. And that, was my mistake. The game is glitch and the puzzles seem impossible to figure out. There aren't any villages or creatures hinting on where to go or how to solve a puzzle. Had it not been for the walkthrough I might never had continued.			"

												Another game from Double Fine for those who have the basic understanding of reading algorithms with a funny storyline.I have learned some programming at high school and took some mandatory courses at the university, so I know the basics, but for those who don’t have the background I won't recommend this at all.This game lacks any real tutorial for teaching the basics and even I had difficulties at the final puzzles and had to look for the solution.This game is NOT for those who don’t understand basic programming and sadly it will not teach you some and because It very short then I highly recommend to buy it at a high discount.

												I was somewhat lukewarm on the first half of the game -- the puzzles are okay, and the variable tweaking is a neat mechanic, but it wasn't until the second sequence when the code becomes properly accessible that I was dazzled. The game got really hard; I was stuck on several puzzles, and im sure the methods I used were brute-force at best in some instances, but the sensation of being able to dive layer after layer into the code of the very game I'm playing is something I've never experienced before -- something primal and strange and wonderful comes with the realization that reality is your plaything. Remove falling off platforms, change your own movespeed, break everything again and again until you find a way to break it that doesn't make the universe keel over. It's short, but I don't know if length would've improved it. The true coding of the game is bewildering at first, and remains half-indecipherable, but whole experience was enjoyable, with decent writing and art to round out the game's mechanics. Hack n Slash could've used a bit more polish to smooth out the learning curve and pay more attention to certain tools or toys that are used once, then loiter forever in your inventory, but overall it was at the very least, a very interesting experience. Grab it on sale if you're not sure.			"

												This game feels like a demo. There just isn't much too it. I can say one of the things in it is walking ... lots of walking. It is one of those games that pads game content with meaningless travel through bland and stale open areas.  The character intro to the game was simply dumb .... sorry, I have no other words for it. Spoiler, the hero falls into a prison cell then breaks his sword trying to open the lock ... yay ... story is for noobs right? I had no idea who the bad guy was or why I was fighting turtles and birds. The ""hacking"" in the game seems like a cool concept, but its not. In normal adventure games you will push a rock and it will move BUT NOT HERE! You have to hit the rock, toggle a command in a popup menu over to increase the number of pushes you can do and the distance, THEN you push it. If this sounds fun to you then this game was made for you because you will be doing it hundreds of times!Tedious, boring ... with a misleading ""quirk"".			"

												I love this game.  As a programmer who grew up on the Zelda franchise, it hits all the high points for me!  Aside from [Lua] syntax that I'm not familiar with, the concepts of object orientation and programming were immediately familiar--but in a visually compelling way.If you don't have some programming experience, this game may be frustratingly difficult.  It's not one where you can simply play by the conventional rules of the game; in fact, you'll be frustrated if you do.  It's a game for cheaters.  Some of the areas felt like they had bugs (such as walk regions that weren't passable) that could have just been more clever puzzles and easter eggs that only the best hackers would enjoy. Meanwhile, the storyline is smart and interesting.  Visualizing complicated relationships like this reminds me of the D!sney movie ""Inside Out.""  The cast of characters has amusing, quirky personalities in proper Double Fine fashion, and the breadth of exploration within the story makes for an intriguing gameplay.			"

												I usually don't give negative review, especially to indie games, and even more so when they are original.Unfortunately this game didn't really click for me. I'm not sure if it's because i was playing with the wrong mindset but I couldn't solve some of the puzzles (until half of the third chapter i had already had to read a walktrough 4/5 times) so I decided it wasnt worth it continuing to play like that. It's not even that I don't like playing puzzles (portal and talos are between my favorite games) or logic games (shenzhen or spacechem), its just that something just didnt feel right. I really would like to recommend this game, but i'm just not sure that I didn't like it because of my mindset or because the game is actually bad			"

												'Hack 'n' Slash' resembles 'The Legend of Zelda', but with hacking puzzles. It sounds like a good combination in theory, but not so so in execution. What I love about 'The Legend of Zelda' games is the sense of adventure they convey and the freedom they give you to explore. 'Hack 'n' Slash' lacks both early in the game, and by the time the so-called ""adventure"" has begun, I had grown disinterested.The early hacking puzzles were amusing at first. The game doesn't seem to give the player much of a tutorial on what to do with each weapon or artifact and how to ""hack"". Worse, many, if not all, puzzles reset after you returned from the next area. This made the puzzles repetitive and annoying quickly. Furthermore, it feels that your actions in the game have little consequence on your suroundings. It also doesn't help that objectives of some puzzles are not clearly explained.Prior to playing 'Hack 'n' Slash', I had less-than-exciting first impressions of 'The Witcher' and 'LEGO: Batman'. I was really hoping third time's the charm, but that is not so. I can't recommend 'Hack 'n' Slash'; it is a great collection of ideas, but quite unpolished. If only someone could hack it and make it better.			"

												I wish I could recommend this game. The concept is wonderful, and it was fun for a bit. But unless you're an actual real life programmer, you have little hope of ever seeing the end on your own. Assuming you can get to Act 4 without looking up a walkthrough, at that point you would almost certainly have to look it up to get anywhere. Its far easier to bug, crash, or completely screw up the game to the point it won't play than it is to figure out what exactly you need to change to move on. I sincerely hope someone learns from this and either makes this game playable to non-programers or creates a new one that capitalizes on this unique concept in a more enjoyable way. Until then, I wouldn't waste your money unless you either really like crashing a game over and over until you get lucky or like using walkthroughs rather than actually beating the game.			"

The arbitrary rating: 8/10I don't want to get too detailed about this game because it was just some adventure. You think creatively to continue on throughout the game. You gotta always be mindful of what items you've collected. There are many games that give you item after item after item, and it always seems like as you progress, your older items become obsolete, their effects being replace by newer, better ones. In Hack 'n' Slash all your items synergize and remain useful throughout the game. Blah blah blah. The game is 100% about the adventure, aaaaaaaand hackin'♥♥♥♥♥♥in your environment. But mostly about the adventure. It's definitely atmospheric and kept my attention well enough to keep me playing until I completed it in my first and only session. Hack 'n' Slash can be really buggy, especially toward the end of the game, which would explain the, err, 8-10$ reduction from its original, Early Access pricepoint. I've gone out of bounds like four times in the prison. I've had the game relinquish my control over my character in one screen (while hacking) and give me control of my character in the original screen, effectively breaking the game by denying dialogue, access to inventory, or the ability to leave an area. And boy does all that break your immersion.But hey it's actually a pretty amazing game. I was completely enthralled by the writing and the way cutscenes, acts, and the end flow so seamlessly. It just kept me playing the whole time.Bah, buggy or not this game is ♥♥♥♥ing great. Just get it :P			"

												First of all ... I beat it and it was fun to me but I do have a weird taste sometimes. The story is indeed very funny. I like the ""Double Fine"" humour.A big negative point is the quest line. You have no idea what to do after you accidentally triggered a story event while exploring the world. You need a walkthrough to know where to go after you finished a puzzle. What I really do like about this is the in game possibility to change its own program code (let's be honest, you scratch on the surface, but it's still fun). I've you are prepared for crashes, when you try to swap one enemy type with another, while teleporting through time and position, then I can recommend Hack 'n' Slash to you.Rate Up if you found this helpful.Some (advanced) warnings:It is unbeatable if you don't have a clue about programming. You will most likely drop the game.Even if you have adequate skill in reading program code, you have to mess around with an awful code readability, where they use coloured crystals to store data. (If you are colour-blind, do not buy this game!!! You will NOT be able understand the code!!)  I do not recommend this as a programming learning game.  The in game editor code style is really weird, for example, creating an object:object-> (blue crystal)set (red crystal) = valueset (green crystal)= false (blue crystal):set((red crystal)2,(green crystal),false, posX)(blue crystal):init(whatever colour crystal) -> ""Hello World""(blue crystal):doSomeStuff((whatever colour crystal))… comparison with more realistic program code that does the same:define object as Somethingobject = new Something(value,false,false,posX)object.doSomeStuff(""Hello World"")… you see the difference ... :(			"

												The first half is pretty standout on it's own. Cute, fun, and just the right difficulty. There are a lot of ""hacks"" that seem like huge game-breaking advantages that are either necessary or don't impact the game at all. And then scripting is introduced.I ended up looking up a guide for most of the second half. At first I thought that was a negative, until I realized that's something you do when coding for real.Props as well for letting players mess with variables that will actually crash the game.			"

												So many problems with this game. DID NO ONE PLAYTEST THIS GAME.- Crappy art makes it difficult to tell where you can walk.- Can't enter numbers in the hack UI by typing, must press and hold arrow keys to change values. (so if something has damage=1000 and you want to change it to damage=0, press the left arrow and drink some coffee)- Some items that do different things have the SAME ICON. You litterally don't know which item you are using.- I get stuck every 10 minutes or so I where to go. At one point the NPC says ""lets continue through the swamp"". The swamp is right in front of you but is a dead end. Need to walk a long ways back to a different part of the swamp to progress. Things like this happen all the time.- This game should have been sci-fy themed instead of wizard/fairy. It just doesn't work and is kinda dump.- You have to use some items a second time to stop using them while other items require pressing ESC. Pressing ESC while using the former items opens the game's option menu....DID NO ONE PLAY TEST THIS GAME!			"

												The game is unique in the way that it set out to be. You pretty much need to be at least at an intermediate level with coding knowledge to have any chance of getting through this game without guides. It was fun to do quirky things like toggle friend/foe of enemies and hacking your character. However, the game does not provide a sufficient ramp up for those who simply don't understand the subtleties of programming. The common person probably wouldn't know what a ""tick"" or ""init"" function's purpose is. It was also frustrating that they pretty much expose the entire game's code. This can make for some very bad situations where you might actually break the game. You can always roll back but there's no indication of wheter you're making good progress or not. In the end even I had to refer to guides for a few puzzles, if for nothing else, to make sure that I was on the right track.Check this out if you have programming experience. If not, go ahead and playthrough but make sure you've got a guide handy. Give yourself maybe 30 minutes/puzzle and if you're not making any progress, just look up the answer. Otherwise you'll probably find yourself hating this game.			"

												I enjoyed a lot the game, its atmosphere, story (mainly the final talk), and winks to old games.Definitely is for people who has some programming background, but you do not have to be a hacker (just the basic stuff: conditionals, loops, subrutines...). But if you are, you will not edit tons of code in vi as you may imagine. In fact, the scripts fit in your screen and the ""edition interface"" (consisting in rooms and hackeable objects) is quite time wasting, but I understand that is for non-programmers.About the programming language, you do not have to know lua at all, the scripts are quite intuitive.In summary, I have had fun hacking puzzles in a new way, so I recommend it !

												Very disappointed with this game.  Had a LOT of potential, but ended up being a waste of my time.The game has an interesting premise, but the execution is sorely lacking.  Hacking items gets old, especially since the world resets everytime you exit a room.  So that puzzle that you've completed already?  If you leave the area, you'll have to do it again.  And there's a lot of backtracking.  The idea of hacking items is interesting, and kinda cool the first few times, but eventually I just ended up running around enemies instead of hacking them, or just letting them hit me because I knew I'd heal up within a few seconds.The enemies you DO need to hack (guards, mostly) can be finnicky.  You want them to go to a specific location, but often times I'd have to hack them one direction at a time to get them to the correct location.  And since, as mentioned above, you have to do this everytime you re-enter an area, it gets REAL old real fast.Also, there's NO direction in this game.  I ended up using a walkthrough pretty religiously, because for the most part, I had NO idea where I needed to go next, or what I needed to be doing.  When I entered a puzzle room, I didn't know if I needed to come back later, or if it's something I could potentially solve with the tools on hand.  (Note: usually it's the tools on hand.)  But they certainly weren't clear about what needed to be done - although once you did it, it did appear fairly obvious most of the time.And even using a walkthough, I never finished the game.  The coding goes from changing values, to starting to do a bit of algorithmic stuff, to indepth coding REALLY fast, and as someone who codes for a living, the coding was either too simple, or stuff I didn't want to wade through to make sense of it.  And I know they had to ""simplify"" the interface for interacting with code, but my god if it didn't make my head hurt trying to figure out what I needed to deal with.  But eventually I just gave up, and quit the game.The final insult? In quitting the game, it crashed my computer - this is one I'm deleting from my library and will likely never fire up again.  I can't say I'm at all impressed with any of the games Doublefine has come out with lately, from the unfinished DF-9 (or whatever the hell it is), the ""we need more money"" Broken Age (which I sadly backed - it's the only kickstarter I backed I regretted, and there were kickstarters I backed that I never saw anything from) and this, which feels like a really cool concept coded up by high school comp-sci students.tl;dr - Don't waste your money.  It might be worth picking up if you can get it for free, but I still think there are better things to do with your time, like anything else.  Watch a Let's Play, and you'll get to see the best and the worst of it.			"

The art is fantastic and the characters are vibrant. The game has charm, and I'd love to see more of it. And that's the problem. The game is rather short. It seems that the team working on it was told to pack it up and sell it as is. At the very least, I had hoped for the game to reach a higher level of public appeal and become a primer of sorts to introduce some programming concepts.

												A short, shallow adventure with the noteworthy gimmick that the player is able, in specific circumstances, to access and alter elements of the game’s programming. Initially, this entails little more than being able to tweak speed, damage, health and similar variables in order to bypass obstacles, but it eventually escalates to making poorly-tutorialized and potentially game-crashing alterations to core game scripts – by which time the game has become a tedious exercise in pouring through lines of code.

												Excellent idea for a game, but the execution is lacking. Everything is close to be great, but lacks polish. The art is blah, the animations are very basic, the ""hacking"" interface is pretty good, the ""story"" is blah. Maybe its because I expect a better product from Double Fine, but regardless I found it difficult to actually have a fun or meaningful experience with this game.			"

												This is an awesome game for programmers. It may at first appear limited and boring but later in the game, when you get access to whole game code and even the things, that you don't have access before, then things start to get interesting. As it involves hacking, there can be multiple solutions to one puzzle in later parts of the game. And I have to hand it to developers for awesome use of dynamic code loading. The game may be quite old now, but it's so, so good... although I would not really recommend it to people who don't know a thing about programming, because successfully completing it requires at least some ability of code analysis and debugging skills. It has a few bugs here and there but it is to be expected in a game so highly open to modification by a user. Overall, great game despite a few flaws that other people are describing here!Disclaimer: I am a programmer ;).			"

												Wonderful game! If you like games like Zelda, or Ittle Dew, this is the game for you. Hack 'n' Slash bring some comedy to the gameplay with quirky character design, and somewhat whitty dialogue. The gameplay is as the title suggests, a hack and slash. BUT, the twist is your sword won't do any damage, instead you'll have to manipulate the game as you play, rewriting pieces of code to suit your needs at that time. This is definitely for someone who might have an aptitude for understanding code (or looking up walkthroughs).Towards the end, there is a LOT of room for mistake, and I even caused the game to crash a number of times beacuse hacked together buggy code. It would seem Lua doesn't like my ""creative"" solutions to the problems at hand. But the autosave feature is well implemented, and when you resume a game, you pick at what point in space time you wish to continue, so I was never left stranded, nor did I have to start over.All in all if you take your time to enjoy the game, it will last for 6 - 8 hours, which left me a little wanting when the credits started to roll. I hope Double FIne will double down and incorporate this unique gameplay aspect in another game.			"

												Its a pretty good game, there is more or less a couple ways to do things, but really you not hacking by using code, but rather changing the in-game engine that's running. So its not really a computer-hacking or programming-hacking game, but rather a game engine-hacking game. Its a good game overall, like 7/10. My main points for giving a 7 and not higher, is its really more of an adventure game, than it is a programming game, or hacking game, and its a little to expensive for the level of the game, but on sale, its worth it, and still fun.

												This is a good game in concept. You run around with a little sword that allows you access into what appears to be that entity's global variables, adjusting things such as HP, direction, alligience, etc. It has a decent storyline, and the game was actually quite entertaining.However, it gives you the sense that you are simply running around. There is no real sense of direction, similar to Pokemon that you just walked around until you found what you wanted, but to a bigger extreme.The coding puzzles where you actually saw machines were not designed to encourage learning. My mentality going through those puzzles was ""Ok hit this, look at random crap that makes no sense, change something, hit this, hit this, change, hit, change, OH I SOLVED IT!!"" I am not a foreigner to coding, but the coding setups they have you work with are not intuitive in the slightest.The game was incredibly short. I finished the game in about 4 hours, including loitering, screwing around with random objects, and having no idea where I was going. And the developers haven't made any contact or updates with the public really. It needs more content.Overall, the game felt like a side project, something that a few people casually worked on in their spare time, with user input being virtually useless, and no level of satisfaction from actually completing the puzzles. If you have money that you must spend, don't spend it here. But if you get the game for free, it will give you a couple hours of enjoyment			"

												I usually don't give negative review, especially to indie games, and even more so when they are original.Unfortunately this game didn't really click for me. I'm not sure if it's because i was playing with the wrong mindset but I couldn't solve some of the puzzles (until half of the third chapter i had already had to read a walktrough 4/5 times) so I decided it wasnt worth it continuing to play like that. It's not even that I don't like playing puzzles (portal and talos are between my favorite games) or logic games (shenzhen or spacechem), its just that something just didnt feel right. I really would like to recommend this game, but i'm just not sure that I didn't like it because of my mindset or because the game is actually bad			"

												I love this game.  As a programmer who grew up on the Zelda franchise, it hits all the high points for me!  Aside from [Lua] syntax that I'm not familiar with, the concepts of object orientation and programming were immediately familiar--but in a visually compelling way.If you don't have some programming experience, this game may be frustratingly difficult.  It's not one where you can simply play by the conventional rules of the game; in fact, you'll be frustrated if you do.  It's a game for cheaters.  Some of the areas felt like they had bugs (such as walk regions that weren't passable) that could have just been more clever puzzles and easter eggs that only the best hackers would enjoy. Meanwhile, the storyline is smart and interesting.  Visualizing complicated relationships like this reminds me of the D!sney movie ""Inside Out.""  The cast of characters has amusing, quirky personalities in proper Double Fine fashion, and the breadth of exploration within the story makes for an intriguing gameplay.			"

												Another game from Double Fine for those who have the basic understanding of reading algorithms with a funny storyline.I have learned some programming at high school and took some mandatory courses at the university, so I know the basics, but for those who don’t have the background I won't recommend this at all.This game lacks any real tutorial for teaching the basics and even I had difficulties at the final puzzles and had to look for the solution.This game is NOT for those who don’t understand basic programming and sadly it will not teach you some and because It very short then I highly recommend to buy it at a high discount.

												This game feels like a demo. There just isn't much too it. I can say one of the things in it is walking ... lots of walking. It is one of those games that pads game content with meaningless travel through bland and stale open areas.  The character intro to the game was simply dumb .... sorry, I have no other words for it. Spoiler, the hero falls into a prison cell then breaks his sword trying to open the lock ... yay ... story is for noobs right? I had no idea who the bad guy was or why I was fighting turtles and birds. The ""hacking"" in the game seems like a cool concept, but its not. In normal adventure games you will push a rock and it will move BUT NOT HERE! You have to hit the rock, toggle a command in a popup menu over to increase the number of pushes you can do and the distance, THEN you push it. If this sounds fun to you then this game was made for you because you will be doing it hundreds of times!Tedious, boring ... with a misleading ""quirk"".			"

												I was somewhat lukewarm on the first half of the game -- the puzzles are okay, and the variable tweaking is a neat mechanic, but it wasn't until the second sequence when the code becomes properly accessible that I was dazzled. The game got really hard; I was stuck on several puzzles, and im sure the methods I used were brute-force at best in some instances, but the sensation of being able to dive layer after layer into the code of the very game I'm playing is something I've never experienced before -- something primal and strange and wonderful comes with the realization that reality is your plaything. Remove falling off platforms, change your own movespeed, break everything again and again until you find a way to break it that doesn't make the universe keel over. It's short, but I don't know if length would've improved it. The true coding of the game is bewildering at first, and remains half-indecipherable, but whole experience was enjoyable, with decent writing and art to round out the game's mechanics. Hack n Slash could've used a bit more polish to smooth out the learning curve and pay more attention to certain tools or toys that are used once, then loiter forever in your inventory, but overall it was at the very least, a very interesting experience. Grab it on sale if you're not sure.			"

												First things first: I really love programming games and puzzles. And the first half of the game is very enjoyable. The save system is quite unique and resembles a branching history graph like in vim, cool stuff.But the part I was actually the most interested in, the procedurally generated levels based on the game code, proved to be the worst part of the game. The items that make up a room look too similar, the overlay text overlaps and is hard to read and the bomb/loupe portals often took me places I didn't want to go to. And while some rooms are vast with a lot of space to move in, especially the library at the end is a cramped navigational hell of corners, narrow passages and unwanted scene transitions.Worst of all, my game screwed up so badly I cannot even finish the game with the help of a walkthrough when warping back in time to the the tower entrance. And I don't feel like starting from scratch as I don't see much replay value in it.The game is fun, the gameplay feels fresh and really innovative, it has some nice characters and cheesy dialog.

My main complaint is that eventually, you have to start reading the walkthrough just to figure out how to win - mainly because it got too complicated and wasn't easy to visualize what each step did. I'd recommend it for the story, but I'd probably ask that anyone making a similar game make a more intuitive system.			"

												I really wanted to like Hack 'n' Slash as one of Doublefine's games and as a programming tutorial but it falls short in a few important areas, making it neither particularly fun nor educational. This game's a near-miss that feels unfinished in some respects.You take on the role of a girl who finds herself in a dungeon with a sword that can hack any object with a USB port, able to change the parameters of things around her. It starts out simply enough with a door that can simply be set to be unlocked, but rapidly begins to encompass more. Enemies have entire lists of parameters and even idle behaviors that can be changed to either make sense or give silly results, like making a turtle do nothing but 'turn left' with no delay, resulting in him spinning as rapidly as possible in place. You're encouraged to break the game in gentle fashion and given artifacts that can change the flow of time or that display the variable names of everything around you. This creates a very open-ended experience where there are several possible solutions to puzzles, like hacking a guard to be good instead of bad so he stops chasing you, or changing your own speed to be much higher than that of the guard so you can simply run around him.Where the game runs into trouble is how it introduces programming concepts. The first couple of acts deals only with parameters and has simple puzzles. Later on, the player is given access to dive into functions and things suddenly start getting messy. Collision detection can be a little dicey which can lead to confusion about what is editable and what is not in a function. Additionally everything is written in Lua which is fine, but someone without programming experience will have difficulty deciphering anything beyond the first couple of function-based puzzles. By the final act, the player is given access to quite a lot of scripts with minimal hand-holding and the Lua scripts become multiple-page affairs that all link to each other (as expected from real code) but I found the code very difficult to read and parse due to the way the player navigates through all these scripts.The graphics are cartoony and fun though it's not always clear what is a path out of a room and what isn't. The controls are a bit weak between the mediocre hit detection and the inventory system that only allows you to access four of your items at a time, sometimes requiring you to switch back and forth between items in your bags. Screens reset often when going back and forth between them, usually not a problem but occasionally resetting events that have to be done again and again to get by. As much as I like the concept and theory of it, the clever bits of this game are overshadowed by the clunkiness. If you're looking for a programming game, perhaps try Glitchspace or Human Resource Machine.			"
