												The final chapter of developer Daedalic Entertainment's award-winning point-and-click adventure series is sadly coming to a close. Goodbye Deponia completes the trilogy following the exploits of one of the most hilarious antiheroes ever to grace the gaming scene. Since the first game, Rufus has failed in every attempt to escape the garbage world of Deponia and enter a life of luxury on the floating spaceship city called Elysium. Does Goodbye Deponia finally see our ""hero"" achieve his dream? Well, no spoilers here. You'll have to finish the story and see for yourself.What I can tell you is that Goodbye Deponia keeps the exact gameplay formula from the past games, but cranks up the insanity to stratospheric levels. I wouldn't have thought it possible after some of the jaw-dropping moments found in the second game of the series, Chaos on Deponia. After all, we saw Rufus offer a shoe to a homeless person to eat, purposely get our leading lady Goal struck by lightning, and knowingly had baby dolphins chopped up and processed into cans of tuna.I kept wondering whether Goodbye Deponia would finally see Rufus mature, and even find his moral center. Nope. Rufus is just as egotistical, self-congratulatory, and selfish as ever, with a horseshoe shoved firmly up his♥♥♥♥♥♥ At times, you'll be ashamed at yourself for laughing at some of his pranks, but it's impossible not to. The scriptwork in this final chapter is absolutely flawless, and delivered pitch perfect by the veteran cast of voice actors.But it's not just Rufus and his antics that deliver a gold-star performance. The entire ensemble is crafted with loving care, each character with their own personality that after two games you will have found yourself emotionally attached to: Doc as the master tinkerer that Rufus is always trying to belittle, Bozo and his pacifist nature, even Rufus' snobbish ""twin"" Cletus, whom you're never quite sure who's side he's on. And lest we forget Goal, whom Rufus tries to charm to no end, who is more adorable than ever... you'll see why.As a point-and-click adventure game, Goodbye Deponia follows all the standard conventions. Gameplay consists of jaunting through areas, searching for items to pick up and interact with, with puzzles scattered around that require solving in order to advance the story. However, the Deponia series crashes through conventional realism barriers due to the nature of the story and the idea that any item can be plausibly accepted by the player since the action occurs on a planet comprised of trash. Thus, Goodbye Deponia requires you to think outside of the box... way outside. Any obtainable object can be placed in Rufus' coat pockets, no matter the size, whether it's a living creature or an open flame. These objects can sometimes be combined to create new items.Characters help at impasses by retaining any conversation options that provide hints to solving the particular dilemma.Visually, Goodbye Deponia is as gorgeous as ever. It's not so much a technical improvement over the last two games, but rather a clear sense of style and creativity that comes from Daedalic's artist, and the dedication that goes into each hand-drawn scene. The background animations in each area depict the dilapidation of the garbage world, although the actual travel of each character has set animations that at times feels out of place.The music and sound effects feel genuine to the backdrop. Everywhere you go there are oddly constructed gadgets and poorly maintained appliances that fizzle, rattle, and chug along. The ambient music is filled with industrial-style synthesized beats, all very appropriate to the scene. And of course, the break in between each chapter is one I eagerly look forward to, where our banjo-playing bard of a narrator regales us with a jovial recap of the action and the manly chorus closes it out, followed by an epic orchestral climaxI apologize for anyone hoping for more tidbits about the story itself, but as the final chapter in a cult-inducing series, I have little doubt that fans will want to experience each sidesplitting moment of Goodbye Deponia for themselves. It is a great finish to a truly original tale, and a trilogy that anyone not already familiar with the series should absolutely purchase and enjoy. The only tragedy of Goodbye Deponia is that it truly is the final farewell to all our friends on Deponia.			"

HUZZAH, GOOD THINGS COME IN THREES!Short Verdict: Slightly better than the previous games. Must-have for point-and-click fans. Nice humor, interesting story, great puzzles, unique characters, hours of fun!Overview: Goodbye Deponia is the third and last game in the adventure, point-and-click trilogy made by Daedelic. You control Rufus, a self-centered jerk who, more than anything, hates Deponia - some kind of a junkyard planet - and wishes to go to Elysium. Well, if you played the previous game, you know now he wants to save Deponia, too. The result is a game full of comedy, awkward moments packed with fun, and even romance.Pros: The interface is really great and easy to navigate, including the new feature of being able to control 3 characters during a fairly long part of the game, switching between them and exchanging items The story is interesting, packed with good quality humor, and you'll probably have lots of fun in the way Good length for an adventure game, probably the longest in the series The puzzles are really nice in general--the game provides you a few not-too-obvious hints when you interact with the world. Also, if you need additional in-game help, you can press space to see the hotspots, which is always good as an option. I think you can do it without a guide, if you can deal with some frustration that helps you forward. Characters are really cool and fun. The main character is embarrassingly annoying, but that allows for some ""role play"", you can say, when you try to think like he would as you try to solve the puzzles. Great voice acting The 2D graphics are really amazing The BGM is really awesome--specially the Huzzah songsCons: Definitely the least playtested/polished of the three games. There are a few minor mistakes in the speech, subtitles, translation, and even some small not-game-breaking bugs, like when I manage to make Rufus remain small when moving closer to the camera The puzzle scenes close to the ending dragged, and they kinda lose the hand on controlling the climax, and, ultimately, the ending was not much satisfying There were some parts of the game that didn't seem well thoght-out. For instance, you can go through a long quest in which you have to use something like 6 or 7 items in order to obtain another item, which you still don't know the use for. Others were sheer trial and error that didn't make much sense to me, even in hindsight (but the overall balance is still positive)Bought on: Steam Store for R$ 6,24 (US$ 4.99 on the US store at the same time). If you don't have any of the games in the trilogy and think this game is for you, it might be a better idea to buy The Complete Journey (the full trilogy) instead.Verdict: If you're a fan of adventures and point-and-clicks, you most definitely have to check the Deponia series! It's precious. I'm not easy to please when it comes to humor and comedy, but Deponia just manages to do it better than all other games I've played (well, maybe except for Sam & Max, imnsho). Also, like I've said, the puzzles are really smart, the story is interesting, characters are unique, and basically everything you need in an adventure game is there. Don't miss it! But make sure you start with Deponia, then go through Chaos on Deponia before playing Goodbye Deponia, or else it won't make much sense.			"

												If you've played the first two parts of the Deponia trilogy you pretty much know what you can expect. Except it's even better this time: three times the Rufuses, three times the chaos. Do yourself a favour and get this game if you've played the first two, because it's not only the grand finale, it's probably also the best game in the series. If you HAVEN'T played the first two... Well, go read my recommendations for Deponia and Chaos on Deponia instead then!EDIT: After some consideration, I think I should make special mention of that one specific part of the game. If you've played it you know the one. It's the one joke that is just absolutely not funny, and where I think the devs definitely stepped over the line of what is okay and what is not. It left a sour taste on what is otherwise a funny series. However, I still recommend it for all those other moments.			"

												Ugh.Let me just say this now to begin with. The game itself is definitely worth playing. It was a fantastic title and a fitting piece of media for those that played the other two titles. I'm giving it a no in recommendation because of the ending.This is similar to Mass Effect 3. The creators' desire to have this out-of-the-box ending ended up ruining my love for the whole franchise. Instead of giving us the tv tropes ending we were hoping for, they decided it'd be better to have this open-ended depressing conclusion that makes you want to eat fecal matter to wash out the taste.Should you play it as a fan of Deponia? It depends. Are you playing it for the humor and the puzzles and don't really care for an ultimate happy conclusion? If so go for it. If you're like me and got invested in Rufus' and Goal's story, then do yourself a favor and ignore this.			"

 “You should be glad I'm with you to point out all your stupid mistakes.” Goodbye Deponia is a point & click adventure and the final part of a trilogy by the company Daedalic Entertainment with emphasis on character and story development. Atmosphere & presentation: + Original comic look creates an interesting world.+ Appealing musical background.+ Balanced difficulty level of puzzle sections. o Complex puzzles can be skipped.- The sometimes illogical item combinations can lead to a break in immersion. Characters & story: + Humorous depiction of the protagonist and side characters.+ Witty dialogues and unconventional conversation options.+ Amusing plot development based on split personalities.+ High quality voice acting.o Based on the German origin of the game, some of the jokes are lost in translation. Summary: Daedalic Entertainment has been able to forge a series with cult status. Great comedy, fun characters and several heart-felt moments, all wrapped together in a well-animated package bringing the trash-trilogy to a worthy end.

												So, at this point you've looked into playing Deponia, Chaos on Deponia, and now you've decided to treat yourself to getting Goodbye Depoinia.  Perhaps it was a steam sale, perhaps it was something about the game that caught your eye, or maybe your just a big fan of Point and Click Adventures - either way welcome to the third installment and last of the Deponia series.     Play the game to enjoy the story of Rufus, the lowest scum of the planet who works to put himself above the rest, falls in love, and works to improve the quality of life (seemingly for himself and a human from beyond the stars).  Unfortunately, while the story works and has some interesting twists along the way... I can't say I am a fan of some of the major choices in this game.Not a spoiler: In game 2 of the series you have to make Tuna out of Baby Dolphins.  If you were not bothered by that puzzle, fine for you.  What the THIRD game does is worse.  Not only do you have to feed children to a monster, and break up an inter-racial couple, but then you have to sell the black woman into slavery.  I wish this wasn't a joke.  It seems like the ONLY black woman in the series, is used in a cruel manner by the main protagonist. I wish there were alternative solutions to these puzzles.  Guilt driven enough to killing orphans and ruining lives of others, is probably why I will not return to playing this game for nostalgia, and warn you now about it before buying it.			"

												The last in the Deponia series. I found it a fair bit easier than the previous two but perhaps that might be because I've become used to the games logic.Some of the humour is lost in translation (quite literally bcause some of the lines would have been far funnier in the original german) but it still gets some really good laughs even if a few fall flat.If you enjoy point and clicks with a sense of humour and the absurd, play this game... hell play the series.

												The most funniest part of the trilogy. And the hardest one. As for me it was perfect example of quest development, so unpopular nowadays. Here you have easier mini games, and x3 difficulty in open world (mainly about inventory exchange). BUT! The ending was so unclean! I can't say it was actually ""THE END."" or ""TO BE CONTINUED..."". May be soon we will see new title ""Hello Elysium"".			"

												The Series Continues!Deponia has been great, from start to finish. Which is something I’m happy to be able to say. There is nothing worse than a franchise that gets progressively worse the more sequels that are released. The Deponia series has managed to remain interesting and new.First off, I have to admit this game wasn’t exactly what I expected for a number of reasons but none of which knocked points off. Despite any feelings at the time of playing through it I would still say this is one of my favourite point and click adventure series of all time.Story wise, it was definitely enjoyable. It took unexpected turns a few times which was great but the ending for me was a little questionable, or at least it felt that way at the time. I would be utterly lying if I said that it ended how I imagined it would. I’m ill and half brain dead at the moment so naturally… I got confused and I cried. As you do. But I would say it was just unexpected and in all honesty I’m not even sure I know what was going on. It wasn’t even necessarily bad or upsetting! I noticed a very subtle difference in language that was used in this one, the characters swear every now and again. It was a little bit of a shock the first time but it was actually really amusing the way they did it. The characters are as loveable as ever, both main characters and side characters. I especially like their re-use of more insignificant characters.Voicing, sound effects and music is pretty much the same throughout the series (you notice a jump up in quality from first to second but the third is pretty much the same as the second) but I think it fits well, you start recognising certain music to mean certain things to get you a little more engrossed or emotional over the situations in which they are used. Definitely doesn’t come across as lazy or recycling.As always with point and clicks there is always places where you get stuck, or there is a somewhat un-logical solution to a puzzle that you come across that ends up being frustrating. Deponia manages to keep a good balance between the items you use together being creative but logical. I got stuck quite a lot during this third one I won’t lie. At one point you are controlling 3 different characters that can influence each other and maybe that is why I was having such a hard time. You are essentially playing 3 different point and click games at once. Maybe it’s just because I’m brain dead at the moment being ill, but I found this third game harder than either of the previous ones.Achievement wise, there is definitely a lot more in this one then there was in the last 2, or at least it felt that way. It took me a total of 18 hours to complete this game 100% and that includes about 2 and a half playthroughs. Admittedly I might have been able to do it in less if I was paying proper attention but I completed the game causally the first time around.Quick shout out to the chorus guys, a very charming part of the series being the singing between chapters. I always look forward to their songs. But all in all it’s a great game and a great franchise that I have come to be very fond of. I’d say definitely go for it.TL;DR : A great end to the series. Engaging story, fun puzzles, great humour, wonderful art, loveable characters, good music/other media and easy to 100%. It’s a done deal!For anyone interested, My Review for Deponia:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/214340For anyone interested, My Review for Chaos on Deponia:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/220740/ "

												The weakest entry in the series, with a disappointing ending that's 100% pure cliche tripe.The first time it played suicide for laughs wasn't funny, and the next dozen or so times they beat that topic into the ground weren't any better. Then there's the sexist jokes that wouldn't be funny even if they weren't completely incompetent, how it played pedophilia for laughs, and etc...Then there's the problem it has with reusing puzzles - replacing creativity with tedious repetition.Seriously, don't buy it.

												Review for the whole saga.First of all, I don't really like point-and-click games, but for some reasons... I loved Deponia saga. Pros:Puzzles: In a lot of point-and-click you have to figure it out on your own, without hints, and so you should try to combine random items\click everywhere\etc... In Deponia you'll get tons of hints, in dialogues\descriptions\etc... you'll always find great hints.Awesome graphics Awesome musics Awesome voice acting Nice storyFUNNY ! Dialogues\puzzles\descriptions\even trying to use the wrong item, will make you laugh. The whole saga takes ~30h, it's never repetitive Platypuses RufusGreat inventory system Cons:Last chapter (Goodbye Deponia) it's a bit buggyI don't want to spoil so I'll just say that I'm REALLY REALLY REALLY disappointed with the ending...

												It is finally time to say goodbye in this final episode of the Deponia trilogy. This game was classy in the first episodes and it stays classy in this one.As everyone knows by now: Deponia is on it's way to get extinguished for higher reasons and lower thinking. Rufus needs to escape or, yeah, maybe he needs to rescue his planet. There are hard times for everyone in this episode and it kind of feels a little bit darker than the other games, but not that much that you couldn't enjoy it.You can't miss this game if you played the first two and if you didn't play the others, well I only got one question than:ARE YOU INSANE!?! Don't miss out on one of the best point&click-adventures out there on earth (which probably means in the whole universe as well)10/10 Rufus, you get the girl. Rufus, you get the code.

Most NPC's hate you cause you only bring misery to everyone around you. So what do you do? Triplicate yourself! You gotta love this game! :DAlso...terrible, terrible ending.

The  only reason what I don't like is how they ended Goodbye Deponia. I was very disappointed when I saw the ending. More like a confusing open-ending like the first Deponia game. It just doesn't make any sense. Now what I really hope is a Deponia 3.5 (or Goodbye Deponia.5) with a epilogue that shows us a true and not-so-confusing happier ending.Sorry Daedalic team. The bottom line is this in caps that Rufus can even understand. ENDING SUCKS. Unless you want to make it up to us by making a epilogue to a true and happier ending that Goodbye Deponia failed to show us.			"

												(8 out of 10: Genre Adventure)This is conclusion over the whole Trilogy of Deponia.The good:+ Great hand-drawn graphics+ Amazing Soundtrack from Finn Seliger (incl. Jan Müller-Michaelis awesome voice).+ Good Voice actors+ An interesting setting with a decent story to go on.+ The humour in the series is always a hit and miss. There are scenes which are ridiculously funny (to me) and others are not funny at all. But overall its good.+ Mini Games (with rewards doing them).+ Mini Games are skip able!+ Cut scenes are well done.The bad:- Sometimes odd puzzles- Often kinda simple animationsThe ugly:- The Ending: For this long journey Rufus is going through, it is an unsatisfying ending which is as quick as Anakin turning to the dark side.Conclusion:A great adventure series where, at one point, you give a disgused speech to an armed army of Organons calling them all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s multiple times. Not only you can get away with it, the witty writing will make them believable cheer for you instead. So if you like adventures, try it!			"

												Goodbye Deponia is a satisfying conclusion to Daedalic's trilogy.It has the imaginative puzzles of the first Deponia, a satisfying move away from the terrible puzzles of Chaos on Deponia. It's lengthier than the previous offerings so there is a great deal more to do, some locations from the previous games are revisited albeit in the form of different areas of those places. and most importantly Rufus, is still a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but is not nearly so callous as in the previous games, a final recognition of his  character development. HOwever As for Argus and Cletus, well once again Daedalic fail somewhat there, in fact the largest rub I've had with the Deponia games is the lack of true understanding of their characters psychology. Daedalic tend to go for gags and tropes with the characters there to fill in the holes. This is unfortunately very apparent. It's a pity the writers have focused on the humour more than on their character motivations, it does seem to be improving however as they have gained in experience through the series. The bizarre Piers Anthony humour still abounds, and the game has a plethora of pop culture references to find and discover. The quirky art style is still just as appropriate to the underlying themes, and the vibrant, mechanisticly lush environments are as wonderful as ever. The music (much of it rehashed from previous games) is enjoyable without becoming overwhelming. As for the Chorus Guys... well their lyrics are still just as awkward to try and ""sing""...Overall I will recommennd the game, however it needs to be played with Deponia and Chaos on Deponia as well, so if possible try buy it as a part of a package deal, and not standalone.

												In many ways, I am extremely disappointed that this series had not reached what I felt was a higher potential, but it also delivers a frantically great experience that will have you entirely immersed in the fascinating world it presents.Throughout much of the game, the humor that was once so charming crosses partly over to being crude as well as insensitive. And, the opportunities they had to develop these characters more, for us to see them thrive and gain more through their experiences, to grasp the reality of their situation, then to grow wiser as a result, was all missed. At its core, all the characters are static. Rather than growing and being the preferable dynamic characters they should have been, they learn nothing and remain the same. It really is a shame, because all these characters are so likable and interesting. Instead of development, we had been given an abrupt ending that very poorly tried to end the series with an open note, but absolutely failed to do so.The gameplay is improved, however. The first section is very well-done, and I found myself enjoying it far more than any other part of the series thus far. As the game went on, it became progressively more cryptic and difficult, but still managed to maintain a somewhat fresh twist on the point-and-click formula. The settings and environments remain beautiful, and the animation never failed to impress.The Deponia series, despite its shortcomings, proved to be a very memorable trilogy of games filled to the brim with a sense of wild imagination that spurred my mind alive. It possessed additional potential that could have propelled it to become a true classic, but as it stands, I feel it is still well-worth your time if you're even remotely interested in this type of genre.Edit done due to a minor grammatical error in the review.

												The epic 3-part adventure comes to an end... or does it?It'll make you laugh and you'll be sad to let the characters go when all is said and clicked. I'm missing those guys already. If you liked the first two games getting this one is a no-brainer.			"

												I wanted to like this game, I really did.  The first game in the series was pretty enjoyable, if a little short, and the art style and setting were unique enough to allow me to get past the loathsome main character.  The second game was maybe a little better, with better puzzles at least, and I really looked forward to the final game in the series.But it was terrible.  Start to finish, this game was terrible.  The puzzles were contrived, overly complicated, and all but required a walkthrough to complete.  A good adventure game has some logical connection between different puzzles, with items that conceivably could be combined or used together to move the character further along the story.  If that's what you're looking for, look someplace else.Well if the puzzles were bad, maybe the story was good?  Nope.  I won't spoil anything, but an interesting twist revealed about halfway through has no real implication on the ending - despite the world-changing ramifications of it, all it amounts to is an excuse to make puzzles more convoluted.  The main character, Rufus, only becomes more obnoxious and disgusting as the game goes on until you're just left feeling filthy for having helped it all happen.And the ending.  Don't listen to the people who talk about redemption, about ""people only wanting a happy ending"", or any of the other long-winded explanations for why this is a good ending.  It isn't.  It's terrible.  My wife and I just sat there watching the credits until we both realized that yes, that was it, that was really how this trilogy was going to end.  It was a massive disappointment and I just want my time and money back.Please don't buy this game.			"

												(8 out of 10: Genre Adventure)This is conclusion over the whole Trilogy of Deponia.The good:+ Great hand-drawn graphics+ Amazing Soundtrack from Finn Seliger (incl. Jan Müller-Michaelis awesome voice).+ Good Voice actors+ An interesting setting with a decent story to go on.+ The humour in the series is always a hit and miss. There are scenes which are ridiculously funny (to me) and others are not funny at all. But overall its good.+ Mini Games (with rewards doing them).+ Mini Games are skip able!+ Cut scenes are well done.The bad:- Sometimes odd puzzles- Often kinda simple animationsThe ugly:- The Ending: For this long journey Rufus is going through, it is an unsatisfying ending which is as quick as Anakin turning to the dark side.Conclusion:A great adventure series where, at one point, you give a disgused speech to an armed army of Organons calling them all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s multiple times. Not only you can get away with it, the witty writing will make them believable cheer for you instead. So if you like adventures, try it!			"

												This was a hugely disappointing conclusion to the amazing Deponia series. Not just because of the lacklustre ending to the plot, but also because of the ugly nature of many of the acts of Rufus. In previous games he was a crazy but lovable hero, whereas in Goodbye Deponia, he is responsible for selling a black woman into slavery to a monkey who forces her to dance in a skimpy outfit, whilst you feed her boyfriend to some sort of mutant parasitic monster burrito vendor. He also is responsible for the deaths of a group of orphan children that he comes across, and feeding a baby an entire bottle of anti-depressant drugs. At the end he is also finally responsible for the death of his biggest fan, who jumps off the Highboat when Rufus falls. Overall, this game was a massive let down, and the ending to the plot made it even more of a waste of time, as the eventual result could have been achieved by just letting Cletus and Goal return to Elysium in the very first game, but many more lives would have been saved in the process. If you love the Deponia series - Do. Not. Play. This. Game.			"

												The only real curve ball this entire series tosses at you is the ending.  It seems like Daedalic gave up, rather than Rufus.  Yes, some of the humor is in very poor taste, particularly in the sewer, but I would say the ending is worse.  If you want to finish the series, by all means pick this game up, but if you still want to like the series when you are done... don't.			"

												Goodbye Deponia, the 3rd and final game in the Deponia trilogy. To be honest, when I finished Chaos on Deponia I simply didn't want to believe I was about to finish a so far amazing trilogy. I had a lot of fun with Goodbye Deponia, and it's probably my favorite in the trilogy. There is just one thing about the game that I cannot stand but I am sure that everybody has previously mentioned. The ending. I just finished the game about 10 minutes ago and I really don't know what to say about the ending. I'll summarize the ending with 2 words; BULL.♥♥♥♥♥♥ I really dislike the ending of this game, I was really starting to enjoy it. Especially after the speech and the Organon hymne, but nonetheless the ending is complete and utter crap for a game this good. *SPOILERS*So basically, after Argus, Cletus, and Rufus are all stuck in the Rotor, Goal comes and is confused (of course) of which one she should save cause the 3 all look alike First of all I call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tWhile Cletus and Argus may look very similarRufus is more tan, doesn't have a goatee like Cletus and Argus but I digress.Goal ends up saving Cletus letting the real Rufus fall.Like ♥♥♥♥ are you kidding me?But anyway for an ending of a single game I might accept this, but for an ending to a TRILOGY? Where you're definitely not going to make another game in the series? No. Absolutely not.Despite this ending I am really sad to see this series go. It was a fun ride throughout it.I recommend Goodbye Deponia, BUT only after playing the first 2 games because you'll have absolutely no idea what is going on. To summarize:Pros: Pretty much everything, the graphics, the soundtrack, the humor, the colorful cast of characters, the locations, the unique puzzles, the drama.Cons: The ending. If you loved the game throughout the whole journey, you'll be a bit disappointedI'm honestly sad and surprised to have ended this seriesOnly thing I can say now isHuzzah, I'm off now, goodbye!EDIT: After now thinking about it, I don't dislike the ending as much as I did when I first viewed it. If anything, the ending just gets me choked up because of the music at the end reminding me how much fun I had with the trilogy. Overall, I still recommend the game, but don't expect a happy ending because the whole trilogy had sad endings, this one being the saddest hitting you like a truck when you actually realize that Rufus did and DIDN'T deserve to be on Elysium because frankly, he was an♥♥♥♥♥ but throughout the games, he did all that he could but people still doubted him and trash talked him, and when he was just a jump from Elysium he sacrificed himself, just so he could give his ""friends"" a better life, just so he could prove them wrong, like Goal said, there were so many opportunities where he could've gone to Elysium with her but he didn't. Just because he cared too much about his fellow Deponians, so in the end he sacrificed it all, so he didn't get to Elysium after all, so what? I mean we were all hoping it but as I've heard from other fans of the games they have said that Daedelic games always have unhappy endings, but hey that's just what I've heard, if you want to find out for yourself, buy the first game and try it out, as for me, I still whole heartedly recommend the trilogy and it is a fantastic series that I will always hold close to my heart.I just hope Daedelic gives some closure on wheter Rufus survives or not, granted he did fall from a huge distance into a pile of needles and survived but I digress. TO END MY LONG EDIT, I'm off now for real.""Huzzah he's off now for real!""the ending will always give me feels ;~:			"

												As the third instalment in the DEPONIA trilogy, you pretty much know what to expect by now. Like it's predecessor's, the game looks gourgeous and is accomppanied by a pretty good soundtrack. However, looks aren't everything and It's sad to say that the game lacks in both the story and in it's gameplay. The puzzles, for the most part are pretty selfexplanatory. For the most part. The game still has some annoying parts in which you are pretty much forced to try everything with anything, before you can comprehend the strange logic of the designer. Escpecially the last third is riddled with this kind of gameplay, when you are in control of three different Rufus's. Speaking of Rufus, he's still the most annoying main character I've ever seen in a point'n'click game. He's outright obnoxius and overall unpleasant human being, with no regard for others (except Goal, of course), and same can be said for the writers. The script contains borderline racist/feminist undertones, and has more than few characters whose lives are destoyed so completely, that it left me with an honest resent against the writers. And don't even get me started on that ending...The game is also riddled with gameplay bugs and audiovisual glitches. I ran in to a game breaking glitch not once, but TWICE!At the first part of the game when I'm supposed to extract certain things from a suitcase, the game simply denied it. I could not open the suitcase, thus forcing me to start from the beginning (previous save didn't matter, the problem wouldn't go away). The second time was at the last third. You are supposed to fire a cannon to distract  certain people from singing. It worked at first, or at least I thought so. The singing stopped but it wouldn't let me move past them. So I exited the scene and came back, only to find that the people were once again singing, and no matter what I did, I couldn't break the loop. Overall, the game falls flat, just like it's predecessors. In all honesty, the only reason why I even picked  this game up was the fact that I wanted to finish the story, and although they made some improvements to the quality of the puzzles (with some exeptions), the finished product feels rushed and unpolished. And SPOILER The ending is utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!!! The one responsible with it should be taken behind a barn and be put down!+Overall presentation+Minigame puzzles (huge improvement over the previous ones)+When it actually tries, the Story is fun and engaging...-... but sometimes it's downright disturbing and cruel-Rufus-Numerous glitches			"

												NOTE: This is the same review for the other two games in the original Deponia trillogy aswell. I thought that as they are a continuation of the same story that they should stay together. What the game isThe Depnonia trillogy is a classic point and click game on a wold filled with garbage. In the trillogy, you assist the, at first forgettable/dislikeable, protagonist Rufus try to reach the floating paradise of Elysium. Over time, the originally forgettable Rufus uses his witty dialog to slowly get you on his side rooting for him on his quest.Pros+Amazing storyThe story, although only really played out during cut scenes to new areas, is deep in detail. It pulls you in, really pulling you into the world.+FunnyNot many games have blaitently funny dialog, but these games definatly do. Rufus has funny responses to other characters, his own acvtions, and stuff you try to have him do.+CharactersAll the characters seem fleshed out quite well. Each has a uniques personallity, displayes different emotions, and just act different. The variety is also pretty good.+EnviromentsMost enviroments are well detailed with other people and objects to bring the scene alive. In some cases, youll get people who are from other games showing up in the envirments aswell.+MusicThe music worked well with each area you would be exploring. Although mostly being simmilar themed, it all was different and interesting. Cons-Animations/MovementThe walking animation on Rufus, for me was a bit weird. He didnt really face where he was going and took odd paths to where he needed to go.-DurationSome areas seemed too short, while others were too long. It was an odd thing and may have just been the way I solved the puzzles in each area, but it struck me as odd how I could clear one area in ~30 min and another in 2+ hours.Final OpinionThe Deponia trillogy is an amazing set of games that brought back tthe nastolga of point and the point and click style. The quirky dialog was fun to hear and laugh at resonces. The story makes the narcissistic Rufus someone whos actions have you rooting or cying for the duration of his adventure. If you have some time free I can highly reccomend all the games in the Deponia trillogy and Deponia Doomsday.			"

												My favorite game of the trilogy is this last one, although the ending might not be satisfactory to a lot of people (I have mixed feelings about it: it's a downer , but also  redeeming ). I'm not going to review it in detail, but make some generic comments about the 3 games.The best thing in the whole series is the main character. When you think Rufus can't get crazier or more offensive, he walks the extra mile; in this one, among other things, he shows an indifference to children (well, that Rusty was a little annoying indeed)that must be shocking to most people. The way he gets to other people's nerves (specially Toni and Bozo _ I missed Wenzel ) is hilarious. And what about what he does to poor Goon and June? And the hommage to Donkey Kong?I also love the ragged bard's appearances, introducing the chapters with well written lyrics (with very irregular metric _ reminded me of some songwriters from my country, like Jorge Ben and Edgard Scandurra). The games are really funny and the voice actors are great. The puzzles and minigames... some of them are so out there that you'll probably will have to resort to a walkthrough once in a while. The same can be said for quite a few of the achievements (specially the ones that demand that you do something really stupid for at least 10 times); I doubt someone can get all of them in a single playthrough. If you're a fan of point and click adventures, this trilogy is a no brainer. Not a masterpiece, but very good.			"

												First of all, why are you reading the review for the third game in the series? If you are interested in the series, look at the Deponia 1 reviews or the complete trilogy and if you liked the last two game and want to have a complete experience, buy this one. K? K.[SPOILS] The first three chapters of the game were great, thought the whole clone thing was far-fetched at first but I ended up accepting it and it did make from some interesting puzzles later on. Speaking of “interesting puzzles” later on in the game, how about that section where you have to get a print of a “fluffy bunny” and the actual pedophile you get it from. Or perhaps the part where you have to separate Goon and June, recruiting June into a job as a “monkey” (without much to wear…) for money, brainwashing Goon for burritos which you use to keep children warm, in the open mouth of a slime monster who specializes in eating children. Oh yeah, and the shop selling rope next to a therapist’s office and load of suicide jokes that come with it. I knew Rufus was manipulative, rude, and egotistical but, damn dude! I’m fine with some dark humor but that took me by surprise. Up until this part of the series that games have been pretty PG.I feel like the ending was fine. I would’ve really liked to see Rufus make it even though that would’ve been a somewhat boring and predictable ending. To have his character change and choose selflessness was a bold move.Still that doesn’t quite leave me satisfied. There are still a ton of loose ends like Elysium’s inevitable crash into Deponia, the cloning factory or Cletus is posing as Rufus (for the press? Not really too sure why that is nessesary). There is a ton they could go off, after all we haven’t had a Deponia game where any puzzles take place on Elysium. Also, Rufus is not dead, he’s fallen from high up before and survive just fine and since terminal velocity is a thing and the fact that it’s Rufus It’d be pretty easy to by him surviving. But I guess he wouldn’t become a sort of martyr. Either way, I think there’s a discussion group about ideas for “Deponia 4” so you can check that out for some more interesting ideas. Sorry for being too stubborn to accept the end of a trilogy, it’s just hard not to want more closure about some events even if it’s really not necessary.  "

												This comment contains a bit of spoilers. And forgive me my poor English.Simply put: if I knew beforehand that the ending of this series was this lousy I would've never bought even a single part of it. I wouldn't recommend to buy this series of games for those, who would like to play for an interesing story with pleasant ending, though despite the ending all three games are interesing indeed. I can even tolerate the fact, that you have no other choice, but to act as a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ doing some evil deeds around you not only unintentionally, but also deliberately. I could event tolerate all bugs and crashes of this series. But the ending is terrible. (Here comes the spoilers): Basicaly, the protagonist dies(presumably) and the antagonist gets the girl. Who the hell would think that this is a great idea to end a three-parted series of adventure games? I love the psychological and philosophical challenges of all Daedalic game plots I've seen so far (which also includes Memoria aside from Deponia trilogy), I like how in the end you always face some unpleasant decision, like (here's the spoiler for Memoria) to make your loved one stay with you without her being happy or to lost her, leaving her happy, considering that she completely forgot you and doesn't love you anymore, but why the hell am I supposed to enjoy the ending that kills off main character, who was desperately trying to make his life better and was constantly struggling against all the problems that came in his way? He certainly didn't get what he wanted. He was stuck with not a choice, but yet another problem, and the only solution was to literaly ""let go"" separating him from his love, killing him and making his loved one to go with not the one she loved. Total crap! I know that life is cruel, but why the hell am I supposed to be reminded of this fact in an entertaining game?			"

												All three Deponia games are truly a treat for adventure point&click lovers. An original tale in a different universe with a very unique ambient. In my opinion, Goodbye Deponia is the best Deponia out of the three, but you should not play it only, you should buy the trilogy and enjoy this amazing adventure Daedalic as been able to craft. Out of the three you will get about 30 hours of gameplay. One of my favorite games of the genre and a true 9/10.

												Goodbye Deponia, like all of the Deponia series, is held together by a junkplanet full of charm and character.  The characters are all enjoyable and unique, the laughs range from sensible giggles to side bursting and Rufus, the main character,  is a guilty pleasure of mine;  despite being almost utterly selfish, at times completely dense, having no respect for life or personal belongings and leaving nothing but chaos in his wake, I personally loved him and he's brilliant as the focus of a story I adored from beginning to end.That said, it is a point and click and carries the flaws of the genre, being at times obtuse and slow. The unique character of the series is prevalent in the puzzles themselves, alleviating that some.If you can look past and or enjoy point and clicks I'd highly recommend this anyone.See you on Elysium!

												tl;dr Awesome game, awesome story and best parental simulator 2015Goodbye Deponia, I bought the humble bundle for Sir, You Are Being Hunted and this and another game were sort of like side bonuses. Personally I didn't really like the look of Deponia at first glance (I couldn't really tell what it was about exactly) but after getting into it it reminded me of the many point and click adventure games I used to play when I was smaller and the humour and puzzles are engaging as well.Anyway, I kind of regret playing the third installment of the trilogy now but im definetely considering getting the previous two games just to fill in the blanks.POTENTIALLY SPOILER-ISH (Doesn't reveal anything but I talk about ending 'feels', and other reviews talking about the ending and stuff)So there are a lot of reviews talking about a crappy ending but as a new comer to the series I found that the game successfully hooked me onto the main character and his goals (pun not intended) and by the end of the game I was both sad, angry and kind of... meh, like you know that empty feeling inside when you finish a good game?Admittidely some alternate endings would have been nice, not necessarily good or bad ones but... alternate. Personally? I was only sad/angry about the ending because I actually liked the character, not because it was a bad ending. "

												Let me start off by saying that I am new to point-and-click games. I bought the Deponia trilogy when it went on sale for $14  on greenmangaming. Worth? I think so. I really liked the story because it has it's funny moments. But I suppose because I am new to this genre, I would often find myself stuck and wondering what do next. If it wasn't for online walkthroughs I would never have completed this game. But after completing it with much help, I'm glad I picked it up. It was fun, memorable, and something that I am not used to playing. I suppose trying something new was what made this game refreshing for me.  I would recommend it for that reason alone. Buy if on sale.			"

												This is the 3rd game in the Deponia Trilogy.Pros: Great animation, good soundtrack, beautiful background art, excellent detail in almost every scene, double-click to fast travel, skippable puzzles, good voice acting, the story is brought to a close.Cons:  The solutions that Rufus has come up with to overcome obstacles in the previous games were never friendly to his fellow man (or animal), but he gets particularly nasty in this game.  While this game is a dark comedy, anyone who is extra-sensitive to real-world social issues will be offended by some of the events in this episode.Summary: If you played and enjoyed the other 2 games, then play this one!  If you cannot stomach dark humor of the Southpark variety, you're better off not playing this one.			"

												Received for free via Steamified.Wow. Absolutely stunning. For people who want to miss out on the rest of my baller review, here's a TLDR:Overall: 8/10Pros:-the story is top notch, on a basic narrative level the game does a very good job-manages to mix up the gameplay in a lot of surprising ways, which is especially notable because it's a point and click-the art is really fleshed out-characters are well developed, each with their own unique quirks and attitudes-the soundtrack and voice acting is reeally well doneCons:-the game suffers from a few problems that many point and click adventure games share-gameplay can get pretty confusing, especially in the Thid Act- the game can be slow at times, especially when trying to figure out some of the more involved puzzles.Okay, so time for the rest of the review. First off, I have to say that I am a really big Daedalic fan. These guys are easily the one of the most consistent producers of high quality point and click adventure games in modern video game meta. They're really consistent with their quality and have a really good line up of games. Also, they crank out games faster than Jeb Bush dropped out of the presidential race, which is a really good rate to be at. Having said that, Goodbye Deponia, is no exception. It is the third entry into the Deponia series, and serves as a type of conclusion to the story, as the fourth entry serves more as a nostalgic revisitation of the characters rather than a canonical entry. Goodbye Deponia is a really great conclusion to the series and has a lot of good qualities, and the cool thing is, you DO NOT need to have played the past two entries in the series to enjoy this game. Although they're necessary to fully enjoy the game's little references and homages to past titles, the game does a lot of things very well that allow it to stand on its own. The game features a lot of minigames and untraditional puzzles that require a lot of thinking outside the box. All of these minigames, however, do have a ""skip"" option for all you purists out there. A big feature of all the Deponia games, especially this game, is the constant quality of the art style, soundtrack, and voice acting. Every single artistic aspect of the game is polished to near perfection; the attitude of the game is greatly portrayed through the characters' dialogue. Each one has unique qualities that make the game pop. The game, however, has its downfalls. As a point and click adventure game, it executes the formula very well. There are a few very confusing instances, especially within the Third Act, that I needed to use a guide for. Also, the game ends in a satisfying yet open ended way, leaving the player with satisfactory feelings, while leaving much still open to player interpretation. Although great, this game still had flaws and areas of improvement. But then again, games that don't have those things are few and far between. As such, I give Goodbye Deponia a solid 8/10.			"

												Soooooooo... Having liked both previous game (the second less than I would have hoped, but still), I read many reviews before starting this one and when I saw the four major complaints (which I will explicit afterwards), I was scared of being utterly disappointed. Well, that would have been a mistake. Goodbye Deponia is a great game. I still prefer the first one, but this one is arguably better constructed/paced, funnier and ultimately more enjoyable. Now for the complaints (spoiler free-ish):The puzzles are bad: The main issue with the second game was that it was damn near impossible to complete it with the sole hints the game provided. While playing the first act (which is moreover badly designed), my fears came true. You don't know what to do, how to do it and why you have to do it. At one point, the game even mocks you so, telling you that the solution is the least obvious one. Well, I insisted, took a walkthrough and moved on. Then, starting with act two (the ""Hell"" section), it got better and the puzzles, while more complex, were better designed and explained.There is a racist segment about slavery: Yes, it exists. No, I didn't find it funny. No, it is not as bad as it seems. Rufus is a prick (sometimes a lovable prick, but still), it is explained why (not excused, far from it), so he does something horrible without thinking of the consequences and he's a d**k about it afterwards. If you exhaust every dialog option, you'll see that everything is not black or white (sorry for that one, but I had to)There is a child molester: Yes, and Rufus tells some kids that it is okay to go into stranger's vans. As it happens, the children never go in, as they know better (morality is saved, yeahh). Afterwards, the joke (still not funny, I agree) is at Rufus' expense.The ending is a downer/bad/not-the-ending-I-wanted: So the conclusion of the story is open-ended... Well, most people hate that, leaving to the imagination what could have been said. Those who would have liked the happy-ending with marriage and kids (which was unlikely knowing the protagonist) or something with less loose ends will be disappointed but it doesn't mean the ending is bad, or sad for that matter (if not for a pessimistic interpretation).

												I don't play point-and-click adventure games. And I've finished not one, but three games in this series. This game has a story which reminds me of Terry Pratchett and Douglas Adams books full of crazy nonsense jokes and absurdity while being colourful and well-drawn in its own cartoonish manner. The story itself is quite solid and I've been laughing throughout all three games.Don't get me wrong, all the bad things present in point-and-click adventures are present there, besides maybe pixelhunting since you can highlight objects you can click on. But everything else is still there. I've been using online guides to play this game and I assure, the sheer pleasure of all the nonsense in this game and the beauty of cartoonish art style outweight the negative elements of the genre I hate and I love Deponia, Chaos on Deponia and Goodbye Deponia.

												The third of the series. As I've mentioned in my review of Chaos on Deponia, these additions (chapters?) should have just been a massive expansion as very little of the gameplay was changed as far as I can tell. Not a bad thing, just an observation since the story does continue directly where it left off.I enjoyed this one quite a bit, from the improved character development to the voice acting. Add in a little more of a solid storyline in this one, and the soundtrack was considerably better in my opinion. A new mechanic where you were allowed to control multiple characters at once was a neat touch. The puzzles seemed to make a little less sense in this game for some reason, I found myself saying more often, ""How do you even guess that..."".I sort of agree with some of the other reviews that the ending was ""meh"" and really sort of left you wanting something different or worthwhile.

 Huzzah, good things come in threes! I played the first two games, and I must say I absolutely LOVED them.I wondered for a long time when the third and last installment would be released, only to find out a few days ago that it had already been released in the end of 2013, I got extremely excited to see that finally I would be able to complete the trilogy.I must say I absolutely adore the series, and would recommend it to anyone that likes point and click adventure games, it's got a great sense of humor, lovely characters & story and tons of entertaining puzzles.Also, every time you finish an ''Act'' you get a dude that sings a song for you. Every time.That's just lovely.			"

												If you are a fan of point and click adventures, the Deponia series is a must have. The story is funny and unique in a novel steampunk-esque setting. The puzzles are often fair and the three games all offer new styles and ideas in gameplay. The art is beautiful and fun to watch. Really, these are some of the best games of their kind. However, you really should start with the first game (Deponia), as the story is progressively told over the course of the trilogy.Tl;dr: Awesome game(s)! 5/5			"

												Third one of the Deponia Series. Not bad. Sadly, I am still unable to complete the game without a walkthrough. The clues for some of the puzzles are just too obtuse or ambigious.PROS1. Similar to my other Deponia ReviewsCONS1. Requires a WalkthroughI'm probably really lousy at this, but there were a few puzzles that stumped me. E.g. Paper Plane with a YRK key. How the hell would anyone consider adding weight to a plane design be good? You try to reduce weight, not add weight.2. Too LinearNo matter what you do, there is only one ending. It's a false choice.SUGGESTIONS1. Multiple Scenarios/EndingsIt doesn't make much sense to have a single ending. Even if you had to, could there be multiple outcomes for various scenarios?			"

Short version: 81%Goodbye Deponia feels like a collection of rejected story ideas meshed together as a somewhat chaotic adventure game, that somehow acts as the final chapter of the Deponia trilogy. But it’s worth it for the ending alone.Long version:Goodbye Deponia is somewhat of a rehash of the previous episode, Chaos on Deponia, in terms of story structure: yet again one of the main heroes (this time Rufus) is split into three, and you have to complete separate episodes for all of them to eventually progress in the main storyline.The problem is that these sub-stories feel like reused, underdeveloped ideas from cancelled titles– for example the starting sequence in the hotel feels like if it is set in an entirely different universe. There is little connection between them, they are full of plot holes, and one of them is rendered pointless a minute after it is concluded. Not to mention that Rufus gets an origin story that is questionable at best, midichlorian level unnecessary at worst.This stands in stark contrast with the last act, where the arcing plot reaches a surprising, clever, and fitting end. This takes up only a fraction of the story, but it is written so well the game is worth for this alone.The puzzles are closer to the difficulty level of the first game; there is a new element in the form of item swapping between Rufuses (similar to Day of the Tentacle), but it is rarely used. The minigames offer more challenge, but they can be skipped here as well.In conclusion, Goodbye Deponia cannot live up to the rest of the series, but strangely it provides an adequate conclusion that makes it recommended for anyone who went along for the ride this far.

												I would call the last entry in the Deponia series a welcome step up from the second game, although I found the ending a bit unlikely.I still had to bring out the walkthrough on a couple of occasions, but I would say that the quality  of the puzzles is much better than it was in the second Deponia, and there's generally less clueless wandering around, having no idea what the game wants you to do. I think some of that is because it can be difficult to get into Rufus' sociopathic head:  Rufus cannot be redeemed - not even counting all the chaos he caused in the first two games - his actions lead directly to the (probable) death of children and breaking up a happy couple and then selling them into slavery.That said, overall I would call this a good final romp in the world of Deponia. I don't know that it's worth $20, but it's worth picking up on sale.			"

												This game with all its fun art, quality music and witty umor, let me down on the ending. No spoilers but it was a bummer, not that it did not have some redeemable heroic aspects for the ending and some mild closure, it left me wanting some specific things that I think we all would expect for Goal and Rufus' relationship. Somebody decided to opt for a more uncommon or ""what if?"" and slightly tragic ending, than what we were all looking forward to. Oh well...that being said, I did have some great humorous experiences from the three games, just don't get attached to any of the characters and expect something like you would see in the end of a interesing/humorous Japanese anime love story, that just never ends up right and most always ends up leaving the audience confused or wanting for a happier conclusion or a conclusion at all. Eye of Satinav series at least takes that aspect (and frankly values its audiences time more) into consideration for its players, and in the end they are more satified for it. Enjoy!  So I will recommend this game only for the aspect of storyline conclusion.			"

												The final game in the Deponia Trilogy. The one that supposedly decides the fate of Rufus's home planet. The one that despite surprisingly offensive humor compared to the other two, somehow takes the cake for the best in the series. But it barely does so.At first, i would've given this verdict to the second title in the series, Chaos on Deponia. That one is much more innocent and sophisticated in nature. The way the gamer gets to explore Goal's moods in her three separate personalities really helps to expand upon the plot of the series. In a sense, Deponia introduces Rufus, while Chaos on Deponia introduces Goal. These two are what got me interested in the storyline. Highly interested, in fact.Now, let me first state a point that I rarely involve myself deeply in a game's storyline and characters, much less follow them so intensely. This is coming from an RPG fan who has ventured through the lands of Skyrim on the XBOX 360, plays the once popular MMORPG RuneScape with all its lore-induced quests almost daily, and enthuses over almost every modern rogue-like on Steam. I may also add that the Deponia titles are the first true point-and-click games I have purchased. I look at the others and turn them down. I desire the thrill of gameplay that Skyrim or Diablo or even Binding of Isaac can give me. And yet, none of those could enthrall me as much as the Deponia series did.At its core, this series is about a boy who chases a girl. A young, imperfect, self-centered, arrogant male, who chases the woman of his dreams, who happened to fall from the sky. Neither of these two would ever meet under normal circumstances. Everyone seems to be trying to split these two apart. The sheer fantasy of this is what originally stole my heart (and about 30 hours of my free time).I started Goodbye Deponia with the same hope that most other players had: that there would be a happy ending. I played through roughly half the game before I sought a walkthrough. That's when I noticed the common phrase ""bad ending."" Naturally curious, I decided to watch other gameplay from that point on.I spoiled the ending for myself. I was devastated that the game developers threw such a fatal twist. But yet, I continued my own playthrough. And arrived at the same ending. And was subsequently disheartened by that same ending.But why should I give this a thumbs-up when the ending was this horrific? Simple: I wanted to know the answer to the questions. The questions that Deponia threw at us when it left. The problem is there will never be a Deponia 4. The developers have said this time and time again.So why not create your own ending?Yes, that's right, create your own ending. You may think how that would be possible, considering how the game only has a single path to completion. So why would you create your own ending? To hypothesize the answers to these questions and perhaps create a new ending.Many seem to dislike this ending. I am not saying they are incorrect; in fact, I also dislike how the series ended. But it also gave me inspiration. It allowed me to dream of an alternate ending in which everyone succeeded. That is the beauty of an open ending.The question you might ask me is, ""Why should I care?"" My answer is this: If you have made it this far, you can see the end for yourself. And if you dislike it and want to change it, you too can dream an alternate ending. Heck, you could write an entirely new story. We, the fans, can create an alternate, happy ending. Rather than outright complaining about how the ending to Deponia was an absolute kick in the teeth and spreading hate, why not harness that negative energy into another, alternate ending? Or a new project in general?The ending of Goodbye Deponia was not a good one. However, it was an inspirational one. We saw our hero, Rufus, never quit in achieving his Goal, despite any and all adversity. Despite his mishaps. Despite his egotism.He simply never gave up. And in the end...he still didn't give up. And if you have watched the ending, perhaps Rufus won't give up then, either.This entire series can perhaps convey the message that one should never give up. It's not over until it's over. You can do it. You can create another ending. You can achieve your Goal. You can.This game, despite its abrupt ending, controversial humor, simple puzzles (compared to the first two), rambling dialogue, and descent from innocence into madness...is the best one in the series.I'm not saying you should buy this game, nor am I saying you should pass. I am simply describing a feeling of inspiration. If you want another opinion, read some of the other reviews. Read both positive and negative. Judge for yourself whether or not you want a poor ending. Watch some footage on YouTube. Heck, buy the first two titles, or the Complete Journey Edition, to see for yourself whether or not it is worth the trauma to continue the storyline for yourself.All I am saying is no matter what, resist the urge to give up, and achieve your Goal.P.S. Why is this review not in Deponia: Complete Journey Edition? Well, I don't have that version. I just have the three standalone titles.			"

												The third installment of the tale of Rufus and Goal brings to its final conclusion a story about the survival of the fittest at the expense of the weak, the personal drama of an anti - hero who tries to make amends for his mistakes though he never learns from them, and a vortex of explosions, disasters and failed stratagems that began with the first game in the series. Although it falls somewhat short compared to the superb Deponia (1) and despite some flaws in its execution, this 18-hour long game that features a solid allegorical background and great puzzles is anything but a failure.

												Easily the best game of the seris. The puzzles have indeed been bought dowm in difficuty in this instalment, but that decrease is made up by being able to control three Rufuses at the same time. Some say this was time consuiming, but I think it was nice addition that I didn't think I would like at first. Storywise, while it has the usual jokes (even some very strange ones this time around), humor, and non-sense that you'll expect from the past Deponias, the story in this one is perhaps the best and the most meaningful of the three. It is withought a doubt, the highlight of this installment along with the accompanying music, which is also likely the best soundtrack of the three in my opinion as well.Eitehrway, if you really liked the previous ones, you should defintly get this one. If you haven't played any of them and you are considering this, I'd recommend catching up on the previous two before you do. Not only because it's a direct sequel to them, but the ending will mean so much more if you do.			"

												Perfect end to a perfect trilogy. Hilarious as usual, with some really nice puzzles. The same tutorial from the first game, that repeated in the second game, appears again in this one, and it offers a nice twist to the story while doing so, along with three Rufuses! That's right, it's the ultimate chaos. Sad ending though, it's time to let go. One of the things I loved about this series, which is not exclusive to this series, is that Daedalic provides official save files in their website for all of their games, so it's very easy to go back to any point of the games to get those achievements you might have missed, saving a lot of time.

Those games also have actual puzzles to solve.This...game starts out in the same flavor as the other two but half way through, it totally goes off the rail. The humor isn't only crude, it's downright insulting. The puzzles are nothing be sheer annoyances. It's like the developers wanted to just be asses to their customers just to complete the experience.Finally, the ending has got to be one of the absolute worst in gaming history. Especially if you spent the time to complete the other two, it will be a total let down.Play the first two and save yourself the pain of this one.			"

												This is the best in the Deponia series. Things started slow on Deponia, gameplay and story were a lot better in Chaos, but this is the best. It seems that everything you do matter and progresses the story. I found a few bugs running this game however they did not prevent me from having lots of fun. Recommended for any deponia/deadalic or adventure game fan.			"

												I love this trilogy. This one was probably the best GAME for me - the puzzles were good, not too easy, but not so hard that the only way forward was to cheat (I only had to ask my friend Google for hints, not just the answer like in some places in the other games where the puzzles were just too obscure) . The gameplay is also clever - minor spoiler here -  the way that you have to work through three Rufus' stories simultaneously is very fun indeed  - and the humour is up to scratch (mostly). But, alas, like seemingly all of my favourite games, this one has its flaws. For most of the game, it was bugs for me. From the start it was a bit buggy - quite unlike the other two games, which were fine - problems with the drop down menu, visual glitches, audio glitches when people were talking. All of these things were rare and minor - but occasionally it would completely screw up, and Rufus would start walking through things, and that meant I had to go back to my last save. That, on top of the minor bugs, was very annoying. Luckily, I save often enough that it wasn't a huge problem.The other problem was - you guessed it - the end (no spoilers, I promise). Now, I don't have a problem with it per say. On reflection, the actual way the story ended was fine, if not exactly happy. It was the execution that bothered me. It was over too quickly, I didn't expect it to be over and I was, at first, disappointed. The clips didn't seem dramatic or clear enough as to what was happening (It did NOT help that they were slightly buggy, and cut together awkwardly, in my case). When it was over, it took me a few minutes to work out what had actually just happened. It was a good ending - sort of - but it felt badly done, and rushed. I also wish that they'd tied up a few more loose ends, if only to give me a little more time in Deponia before it was over, to see where the characters ended up, after three whole games had made me care about them. As it was, I felt like I'd been kicked out prematurely. As a trilogy, this wasn't always perfect - but I do love it. I like the world, the humour, the characters and the story. The puzzles throughout are mostly good - some a little obscure - but this game, the finale, was definitely the best, for the solidarity of the story (until the very end) and puzzles which actually left me with a sense of achievement rather than of frustration. I'm very happy to have played them.Trilogy - 11/10Goodbye Deponia - 9/10 (bugs. Was it just me who got these? Buuuuuugs.)			"

												Also. Die ersten zwei Teile sind sehr viel besser. Der dritte Teil hat Witze die schon sehr sehr hart an meiner Schmerzgrenze liegen und ich kam bisher mit dem humor der Spiele bestens klar. Es hat sehr viel mehr Minispiele die man zum Glück überspringen kann, denn ich finde sie sehr sehr nervig.Später im Spiel kontrolliert man 3 Charaktere und die Rätsel werden sehr knifflig finde ich aber gut so. Die Story ist echt seltsam, mir gefällt sie nicht so sehr wie die der anderen Teile, ist aber trotzdem noch gut.An manchen Stellen kann man sich die Lösung verbauen, das fand ich ziemlich gemein. Mit Enden hat es Deadalic nicht so wirklich, die Enden fühlen sich nicht wie Enden an, sie sind irgendwie nicht ganz rund, das war bisher bei jedem Spiel so bis auf The whispered world (davon gibt es dann einen zweiten Teil) und Memoria.Im großen und ganzen schon zu empfehlen, wenn auch nur um die Story abzuschließen.

The graphics are stylish, which is usual from Daedalic and I just love the whole story. Only thing which is bothering me are the natures of the characters, since they seem to come out a bit too strong...However, this is one of my favorite point-and-click games and with some great graphics and puzzles like this I just can't get myself go scatter-brained.

This one is a bit longer than the other 2 episodes, I found the puzzles to be much harder and less logical than the other 2. Still the story takes a unexpected twist, an interesting one, though I can't say I enjoyed the ending.Recommended if you played the 2 other episodes.			"

												by far the best in the series! Had some truly hillarious moments (the ones that make you laugh out loudly; while alone starring at your PC monitor; not giggling, or smiling, but laughing)Many people have said negative things about the ending. I've played many games, that were such a let-down in the end. Sometimes because of the ending being boring, or of it being abrupt, as if the developers had run out of time and they had to put it in a box and ship it without making the actual ending.But this is not the case with goodbye deponia. The ending is indeed a bit odd, I can admit that, but one can't say it's underdevelopped. It's a proper ending with nice decisions, cinematic and satisfying length. It's only that the story ends in a way you wouldn't had expected (or wanted) it to that led some people say ""it wasn't good"". Don't be fooled though! As you progress through the game, it gets more and more interesting, and the ending is right at the peak! "

												The last entry in the series and as usual, Deponia never ceases to amaze me. I am starting to think that is intentional of the developers to make the game difficult. Most of the puzzles' solutions I had to look up online shamelessly since it is just so ridiculous to have figured them out. Without any exceptions did I exclaim: ""HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT SOLUTION?!"" It reminded me of when I played games like silent hill or Resident evil and combine a horseshoe with glue to get a jetpack... that speaks to you... Insults you... and tells you to drive it... with a potato... but you have to wear sunglasses to do it.			"

												This series (it is a series, so if you're reading this and looking to buy it, then you should get all 3 games) is the closest I have come to filling a void left by the disappearance of a great genre from gaming. In fact, this game didn't just come close, it did the job perfectly. If you too played some of that last generation of 90s point-and-click games (Curse of Monkey Island, Toonstruck, Discworld) and want something that matches up to that greatness, then this game is it!Sure, it has a few tiny issues (mostly translation issues from German to English), but these can be very easily forgiven since Daedalic got the mix of funny cynical charaters, story, puzzles, dialogue and story just right, picking up where these great games left off and drawing on everything that there is to be learned from them. If you like classic point-and-click game you WILL NOT be disappointed. They haven't fiddled with the genre or tried to bring it to thr touch screen like certain other devs have - they left perfection as it was, focussing instead on what matters in these kinds of games instead of trying to re-invent a genre which doesn't need to be re-invented.Perhaps the only thing I am annoyed with is no native Linux support and wished the devs would port this like they have with some of their other games. If you do use Linux, all three games run well on Wine - but obviously there is no guarantee or oficial support, so I would wait for a native version.			"

												It's a good adventure, a tad shorter than the second game, with a fair amount of difficult puzzles.   I thought that the animations were cheaper-looking than in the other two games.  Also, the ending left me hungry, but it does, more or less, wrap up the series.  It didn't come close to being what I'd hoped, but I recommend it because it's a good (not great) game with a decent story, and you won't get to the end of Deponia without beating it.Best parts of the game:  The Bozo family and Cowboy Dodo.

In this  game the story is continued to the end (hopefully not -.-). I highly recommend this game if you liked the others, just to complete the story. It was again really funny and I enjoyed it. This part was a little bit better than Chaos On Deponia - the second part - but I thought there would be a better ending. It is not bad but not expected. Anyway, you have to play this trioligy, if you like adventures! And if you are clever, you will buy the extended version of it with specail features ;-)			"

												I'm only pressing ""Yes"" because I believe the game ended in the most perfect way.The first two games, you play as Rufus. A really unlikeable character who is just awful to everyone and everything around him. That's the biggest problem with the games, imo. Rufus is such an awful person it's difficult to root for him (Even though there are a few times in the trilogy where you really feel for him) or want him to succeed, because his whole thing seems to be ruin everyone elses life to try to make his better even though it never works out.This game is no different. There is a lot of good humor in here, and the other characters are pretty good, but god damn Rufus is just so incredibly unlikeable that it hurts the game.Back to why I pressed ""Yes"" on this review, I believe the trilogy ended in the way it should have (SHOULD HAVE!). I know they made a fourth game (sigh) but I probably won't ever play it, so this is the last game in the series for me and it ended the exact way I feel it should have. I recommend the entire trilogy just so you can experience the ending.			"

												This is a solid continuation of the story presented in the first two games, but unfortunately a poor ending to the otherwise (mostly) excellent Deponia series. The ending is unsatisfying and leaves far too many story threads hanging to provide real closure for the story. On the other hand, it leaves things wide open for a Deponia 4, but it appears the chances of that happening at this point are very close to 0. Poor ending aside, the story was mostly great, but some of the puzzle solutions were a bit dark for my tastes. I get that Rufus is supposed to be a jerk, but some of the solutions go far beyond that.From a technical standpoint, it's a huge step up from the earlier games. In both the earlier titles I had a lot of problems with minigames not working at all (and even a complete game breaking bug in the first game that required downloading an official savegame file to fix) but this one worked flawlessly.The puzzle difficulty is about right (although as with any adventure game some of the solutions are so random and obtuse that you'll probably spend a significant amount of time with trial and error unless you use a guide).Overall, I enjoyed the ride I had with the series (in spite of the ending) and can easily recommend it if you're at all interested in adventure games. Make sure to get the whole series in a discounted bundle (happens semi regularly).			"

The puzzles, music, animation and art were all pretty well done for a point and click. HATED the ending though, like for realzies. I understand that the character development came full circle and the whole selfless act was sort of needed, but I invested so many hours to watch the main character die multiple times just to find out that the ending I wanted/worked for/expected/etc doesn't exsist.  8.5/10 (lost a whole point from the ending)BTW the music (while being repeative in beat) is freakin majestic.

												Review time, well then let's compare the good the bad and the ugly.The good are the the graphics, characters and the music. I wasn't a fan of the graphics stlye at times, but that's due to personal aesthetics rather than quality. The sound on the other hand was very good indeed.The bad and the ugly are the same as they were in the previous part. The biggest problem is that the game's quirky style of humour weakens immersion and makes you not care about the plot. And then there is Rufus. Yeah, it's been said, but i really don't like the guy and he does his bit to undercut the plot too.I won't spoil the ending, but despite what a lot of people say, i don't think it was that bad. I mean it wasn't ideal, but it definitelly didn't ruin the series and did give an ending to the saga, such as it was.			"

The game had a pretty interesting plot point in the middle, which could have been a turning point in character development, but they blew it for laughs. And those aren't really laughs either, just ""oh noes"" moments.(For example... Rufus finds some orphans, whom, in order to advance the game, you first have to send into the van of a paedophile, and then feed to a monster... I have no idea if there was a time and location where that counted as ""funny"", but it sure isn't now.)Really. The writing is a serious mess. The jokes are unfunny and sometimes downright insulting. And if you think ""well Deponia is supposed to be like that"", this game is totally nothing like the earlier ones. Really. Those were funny, most of the time. This is just, well, cringy. And the finale is completely off the bat, and does nothing to redeem Rufus, OR the writer.			"

												""Goodbye Deponia"" completes the trilogy with a lousy-lousy-LOUSY ending. Authors state that they aren't going to change it or make another sequel. Dammit.The game itself is meaner and less logical than the second part but nevertheless is one of the best adventures in past years. Even the horrible ending doesn't ruin the trilogy and if you want to experience the story (and you should)... well, you don't have a choice.			"

												If I do have to say so myself, Goodbye Deponia was probably the least favorable in the series, but still good. If you take a look at the release dates of each game, you'll notice that Deponia and Chaos on Deponia are only a few months apart from each other. Goodbye Deponia, on the other hand, wasn't released until October of 2013, which was almost a year after Chaos was released. I don't know if the developer team lacked the interest to continue the series until fans persuaded them, or they maybe just ran out of resources, like ideas or characters or plot. In any case, you'll almost immediately know why when you play Goodbye Deponia.It did have a good beginning, one that hooked the player's interest. Daedalic Entertainment tookthe risk of stripping Goal to her bare underwear after Rufus holds on to her outfit while they are on theskyline heading towards the Organon cruiser, which was never introduced in the other two. They sit on this crane, trying to detach Bozo's cutter from the cruiser, which loosens itself off when Rufusaccidentally found himself unscrewing the screws. The platform they were on all of a sudden detaches, moving at blazing speeds. Goal grabs the crane when it detaches from the platform while Rufus is holding on to her, in which the strip occurs and the two separate. Goal ends up endlessly spinning on a giant rotating axle. I mentioned that is was a risk because, although it would attract many male gamers, including myself (which, I will admit as my guilty pleasure, caused me to play the series in the first place), it might pose a threat to Daedalic's reputation, because the first two games in the series were known to not have those kind of elements. Oh, by the way, Goodbye Deponia resumes almost immediately from where it left off in Chaos, so Goal still has her split personality broken up into three cartridges. She acts as Lady Goal. Can you imagine if she was Spunky Goal that whole time? Hah!Gameplay is just as traditional as it was in the first two: you play as Rufus, and your job is tocollect objects, combine them, and use them on other objects in order to advance the story. The puzzle elements, including its difficulty, are retained in this version. Sometimes the puzzles can get so frustrating to solve that you compromise, looking to an online walkthrough as a hope for finding thesolution, which, on more than one occasion, I had to rely on.I will also mention that Goodbye Deponia is to differ from the first two games because of itsdarker, more depressing mood. Swears, although they appear as infrequently as the first two, are a little bit more provocative. There is a part where (spoiler alert) Rufus essentially kills Goal by accident by injecting a high dose of sodium-whatever through her heart. In Goal's last words, she utters, “I love Rufus,” while she has a twerky smile. They happened to be on the Organon cruiser when, after striking her, Rufus gets thrown overboard and lands into his own “hell,” which represents his hatred of himself in what he had done. It looks just like the tutorial stage. Rufus can actually insert the yin into the slot and, after pressing the button, you can see him getting crushed. A bit weird, huh?To be frank, any attempt that the game made to make me laugh (which were many) wereextremely few. The only time I remember giving a genuine “haha” is when Rufus is dressed like Cletus and he is trying to distinguish between himself and the real Cletus and another person, who is also disguised as Cletus. Rufus proves himself by saying to Goal, “I know what color underwear you're wearing,” or something along those lines, “you're wearing purple!”“How did you know?” she asks.“Uh, uh, because I saw you getting changed this morning!” like his typical responses. Otherwise, most of the other jokes were quite adult that I found no pleasure in.Toward the end things get a little better, but by the time you complete the game (which isnoticeably shorter than the first two games), you're left frustrated because the conclusion was poorlyput together, and you're left with so many questions that went unanswered. A couple of the majorquestions I have is, how is Goal still alive? Why did baby Goal, after taking in the nucleic acid, transform into Donna? What happens to the real Rufus after he drops below the engine of the longboat heading to Elysium? Why did Rufus clone himself in the first place? Now that Goal has re-evaluated Rufus, is she still going to marry Cletus? As well as other questions that I have but are not on the tip of my tongue so I can't ask them now.If you're a hardcore fan of the Deponia series, and you want to see the plot expand into ever-morecomplex events, then by all means, be my guest. I'm afraid, however, that it's probably not the wayyou're going to expect it to develop the way you wanted it to be. I, for one, was hoping that therelationship between Rufus and Goal was going to be more romantic in this one, and that the playerwas going to be able to explore Elysium (or, what about playing as Goal?), but of course, something in the game always gets in the way to detract from the main objective, and Rufus ends up losing Goalanyway. The only time I've really seen any romantic element between Rufus and Goal in any of theseries is on Chaos, where Goal kisses Rufus not once, but twice (despite the fact that Cletus is her fiance?) So to label the series as “romantic” doesn't fit into it so much. To play this game, though, you had better finish Deponia and Chaos on Deponia first, because if you start with Goodbye Deponia, you'll be struck with extreme confusion. I do wish that this wasn't the end of the series.			"

												Goodbye Deponia is a humoristic point n' click adventure game that tries and succeeds at emulating the old style of LucasArts' games of old, mainly Day of The Tentacle and such.The graphics are absolutely beautiful, the backgrounds and characters are hand drawn, but the animations aren't, making it feel like the animation style of modern cartoons made in Flash. Don't get me wrong, it still looks gorgeous, but the animations might seem a little robotic at times.The gameplay is pretty much what you'd expect from a game like this, you use your mouse 100%, you click to move, gathering new items and objects to solve puzzles and you talk to people to hint at a puzzle solution or to advance the game's progress, sometimes the character conversations themselves are puzzles to solve.Speaking of wich, the puzzles aren't too obtuse or cryptic, but keep in mind that you also have to mix up certain items to make progress. This game also has plenty of minigames to break from the normal point n' click stuff and they get really weird really fast, with the next one even more outrageous than the last.It gets a little complex by the mid point, because you start controlling 2 clones of yourself at the same time, going as far as to interchange items between the three, wich is actually a really neat idea, just keep in mind that you need to keep track of who's having wich item.The sound design is a little hit or miss, the music is okay, conveying the right mood for the room or situation you're in, the sounds are okay too, but the voice acting is a little hit or miss for me, most of the voice acting sounds good in my opinion, at least for comedic purposes, as most of them sound ridiculous and exaggerated, but there are a few times where you just can't hear what they're saying for how low their volume is, making the use of subtitles a must.And finally the story. Going in blind and without previous knowledge about the previous games didn't deterr the experience for me, although it probably would've helped to get to know certain characters better, because they do reference the past games A LOT, but not so much as not to enjoy the third game on it's own.The character of Rufus is what will make or break the game for some, he does a lot of despicable stuff, like making the lives of certain characters a miserable living hell, he whines a friggin' lot and some of his lines can get very annoying very fast. I know it's intended to not be taken seriously, but come on, leaving children to their fate on a monster infested sewer did make me rise an eyebrow, is this really the guy we're supposed to root for?The ending left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth, but not so much as to ruin the game.All in all, if you've played the previous games, you'd probably already know if you want to play this or not, especially considering this is the conclusion of the trilogy, just adjust your expectations for the ending. And for people who haven't played the series before, I'd say you're better off starting from the first game and play them sequentially, BUT if for any reason you only have or bought this game, then go ahead and play it!It really is a lot of fun! =)			"

												When Deponia turned to Mass effect 3.Spoilers ahead. I think its a problem with a trilogy system or something, that dev teams are unable to cope up with the demands and end up with a product that could have been Elysium ,but instead becomes deponia.Just like mass effect 3 there are amazing and shocking moments in the game,it has in deponia series a very storng story line.But in the end they just ruin it to the core.words cannot express  the lack of creativity the ppl have in terms of ending the game.i did not pay for the triology to see the same end over and over and over again.it just leaves a bad taste in the mouth when u are unable to think of anything new.to add to the insult i bought the premium ed of this game thinking it will be awesome but in the end they pull what i feel is mass effect 3 end.i will be much more careful in buying games from this studio henceforth.

												Sadly I have to give this game a thumbs down! It is really disappointing for a fan of the series. Yes, the game on the outside looks much like the other two games did. As I began to play the game there were a number of scenes that were very controversial in my mind that turned the once known light hearted humor into some very dark humor. This destroyed the story for me throughout the entire game and even the ending that I thought would be a good closure for the series way was not. I was left with more questions than I had for Deponia or even Chaos on Deponia (And yes it has been said that Poki does not plan on making a 4th game, something that I am actually thankful for). I guess many of the other elements to the game were similar to the first two, but in some ways I felt like the game designers tried too hard to make this out shine the first two, which ended up leading them to a pile of garbage! I still recommend the first game and the second for that matter. Unfortunately they made the second game like most games and movies that come in trilogies, where the story is intentionally left wide open in the second installment. And while all of the games appear to have some loose ends, the first game was clearly my favorite and the best ending of the three. So in the words of the narrator.""Huzzah, just go play the first!""Check out my other point and click adventure reviews on my page!			"

												This game is so frustrating on so many levels for it is very challenging to advance with the game. It took me more time than the first two Deponia games combined to finish. And I even replayed both gameplays! While I did enjoy the puzzles, I absolutely despised having to go through the agonisingly  e n d l e s s  dialogues. I progressed very little with the story that I considered myself lucky I stumbled upon random items, accidentally combine the items, even had to unintentionally switch the items in the inventory between the Rufuses. I admit I had to (constantly) look up walkthroughs to progress with the game.The 3rd Deponia isn't as enjoyable as the 1st Deponia in terms of gameplay and storyline. In the first game, you're on board with the story of this egotistical narcissistic self-proclaimed ""hero"" saving his home and envisioning his life on some flying utopian city but in the third game, the story changes in a way that cheapens the efforts of the earlier games. The focal story is there: Rufus still needs to save Deponia from its impending doom but introducing the character Hermes into the story as their “creator” wasn't as meaningful as intended. It makes everything seem flexible; you can clone literally anyone. If you can cheat death by cloning, surely you can cheat doomsday by crafting another crummy Deponia-esque world.I was curious how Rufus and Goal were going to protect Deponia, since the two games have been relentlessly trying to accomplish that. So why not own the third game as well? At the start, I was neutral about the 3rd instalment, however the game drags on, and it just became repetitive, monotonous, and tiresome. Nevertheless, I actually liked the unorthodox ending. It shows Rufus’ development from a self-centred egomaniac to a somewhat altruistic noble hero.5/10 for gameplay – too much dialogue and hidden items but good puzzles (puzzles were simple enough to solve); 5/10 for story – did not fancy this Hermes and the cloning factory but has a nice enough ending to conclude the whole trilogy. Overall 5/10 – Kind of on the fence with this last one. While the first two were a lot more enjoyable than this, ""Goodbye Deponia"" still has some decent puzzles and ended the story on unconventional but refreshing terms.			"

												The final episode in the Deponia series, pushing the series into a final and satisfying conclusion.  While not as strong as the first game, if you've followed the series this far, you will not be disappointed by the conclusion.As is to be expected from Deponia, you follow the adventures of Rufus, an unlikable individual who manages to break everything around him, as he tries to now save Deponia from being blown up, maintain a barely healthy relationship with Goal, and not kill everyone around him.  The recurring characters are who they are, and if you like or don't like them, this game won't change anything, but that will mean the difference in if you laugh or cry when Rufus faces tragedy.  I don't like Rufus and laughed at him.  I did like his flawed humanity throughout the series though.The writing and animation has improved a lot since Chaos on Deponia.  This also follows the translation where a lot more effort and reviewing has been put into it.  The developers knew they didn't want their series to fall down on its final moments and put the extra effort into making sure the final game went well.  Some of the jokes can fall from jovial to borderline offensive.  As an example, you break up an inter-racial couple and make the black woman in the couple take a job replacing an organ grinder's monkey.  Some of the events are engineered to make you feel less positive about Rufus or yourself.  While most of the game doesn't skirt that level of unfriendly, your mileage may vary with some of the humor.The puzzles follow the same blend of narrative and dialogue puzzles they have in the past.  The difficulty at the start is not too bad, with the game reaching a high peak somewhere toward the middle.  Once you reach a certain point, the game rushes to the conclusion with the difficulty of the puzzles easing off and they become little more than pauses or intermissions in the narrative.  Much like the Chaos on Deponia, the game does use some puzzles which cause you to think outside the box and outside the conventions of normal adventure games, with tone puzzles, creative use of cursors and positioning, managing multiple characters, and plenty of red herrings.  So, you may find some of them easy to do if you think outside the box or you may get frustrated and have to consult a walkthrough at some points.I've praised Daedelic's gameplay adjustments enough to not have to mention them.  They are here as well, you have the mouse-wheel inventory, the hot keys, and the highlightable interactable objects.  They all make the game much smoother and don't bog down the game or story in the minutia of inventory clicking or mouse searching.While I don't think they've recaptured the magic of Deponia, they don't have to in a conclusion.  This is a satisfying ending to a memorable adventure game series which, through it's ups and downs, kept me entertained for a long while.			"

""Respect your fellow community members by not posting any inappropriate artwork, including but not limited to, racism, sexual content or nudity, or gore.""Advice the devs at Daedelic should have heeded before embarking on the latter half of this game.Really, though, if you enjoyed the first games in this series, don't even think about picking up the third. If it's in your library, don't bother. Abandon ship at the end of Chaos and go about your life with memories of the time you spent in Deponia. Seriously. The ""humour"" present in the second half of this game is downright offensive in about every way it could be. Suicide and mental illness as punchlines? Racism? Transphobia? Paedophilia? While the previous two games veered into questionable territory along the way, they never managed to be outright uncomfortable. Unlike Goodbye. God, I wish I could be saying otherwise, I wish I was typing some sort of positive summary of my time spent with this trilogy. But I'm not. From the moment a found therapist's referral was put down to a character having 'clearly lost his marbles', something in me sank and, let me tell you, it didn't stop sinking. I swear, at some point during the game's second half the writing team was switched out, the change was so marked. Previous character development and traits were thrown out the window. Rufus, despite having joined the rebellion with Goal, pelts a pair of female recruits with endless mysogynistic comments about how they don't belong. He's shown having been drawn to Toni and ""sassy"" Goal (although, in hindsight, that might just be down to the fact that women in this series are almost exclusively baby-like or outright aggressive), yet the idea of women in that position is so alien to him he can do nothing but make relentless jokes? Not that that was anything in comparison to being able to sell one of the series' only black characters (who dances, nearly nude, as an organ grinder's monkey) to the grinder himself, who is rather blatantly drawn to be more ape than man, a rope salesman set up opposite a therapists office, nooses adorning his shop's roof or being able to lure children into the path of a paedophile. That last bit makes my blood boil just writing it. This game isn't just distasteful it's uncomfortable, even to think about, at this point. The whole series, the whole beautifully drawn, well acted series, has gone from something joyful to something I'd love to be able to purge from my steam library for good thanks to the bad taste it's left in my mouth and the knot of discomfort it's left in my gut.Who, at any point, thought any of this was okay? Seriously? Because it's not, it's just ♥♥♥♥ing not.TL;DR: Grossly distasteful, unfunny and unfaithful to the first two entries. Save yourself the time and don't bother. Daedalic can suck my daedelic.			"

												One of the best adventure game I seen. Indeed, Deponia trilogy the ultimately best adventure series in the last years. At this time our protagonist is tripled to do three times more fun and chaos in usual way. Perfect atmosphere, hilarious dialogs, unbeatable (literally) love and totally unexpected final. And recommendation to interesents: please buy two first parts too and start from very begining. Otherwise you'll lost the most of fun.I'm actually feel sorry for Openbot - poor thing. Cletus got what he wanted... more dragons, hehehehe :)  I feel that Deponia series actually will be tetralogy or get even more series. And i hope, that Daedalus developers will release Deponia for Linux and mobile devices too - at least for Android and IOS.			"

												    Great game, great atmosphere, great characters, great story, funny diaologs (not that funny but it's satisfying), nice puzzles( not too hard), mini games are fun but not very challenging. But there is bugs,bugs,bugs,bugs in all of three games and developers shows absoluetly no effort to fix this. And they don't give any support about your complain.     I don't understand people who is complaning about end of the game. Not every game suppose to finish with happy endings. I didnt like it very much too but it doesnt mean game is bad and doesnt worth to play.       Long story short, if you like point&click you should definitly play this game but 20 dollars is too much for this. I am not reccomend you to buy until %75 discount. Developers didnt pay full attention to the game why we should pay full price?			"

												Just complete the last in the Deponia series and the ending, I felt was lack-luster. Certainly not what I was expecting and no idea what to feel about it.If you like the others, then best to get this one to see how it ends, but it won't end how you'll expect it. There are many hidden items in the game in the form of platypus eggs. Really strange breeds too. Not had much experience with other Daedelic Entertainment games, but I enjoy this series and it got me interested in their other games.			"

												Disgusted, honestly.Everything was fine until the last stretch of the game, when suddenly I was forced to listen to jokes making light of suicide and mentally ill. We're expected to have a giggle that a rope salesman who's set up shop outside a therapist's office is making a pretty penny, and, in his own words, has a ""rope for every neck!"" The therapist then proceeds to recommend to you an exorcism. Thanks for that, dude. Super sensitive. Nice.I thought I could push through - it was a stumble, maybe something that didn't make it through translation so well, but it got worse! Rufus, who has never been a shining example of feminism, I admit, began to spout overtly misogynistic comments and honestly, they were out of character, even for him. It's not the first time he's been sexist - I remember him asserting that cleaning was Toni's job, right? But there was a nuance then that's gone now. His implication before was not that it was Toni's job because she's a woman, but more that, through process of elimination, it was Toni's job clean, only because it was absolutely not Rufus' job. He's always been selfish, a bit of a knob tbh, but he doesn't look down on women. Here, instead, he outright states that the idea of female soldiers is laughable and that they shouldn't be allowed to join the resistance because they can't fight. Has he forgotten that he and Goal joined together? Seriously, given Rufus' dating history, he seems to chase after women who'll bite back. Why has this so suddenly changed?Though really, don't think that this is the reason I stopped playing. It's not. It isn't. Push on with this rubbish, and you'll get to hear distasteful race jokes galore (what's that? Only several black characters in the entire series and one of them is continually mistaken for a monkey? Ha ha ha ha wow). You will also get to literally sell a black woman into slavery. She will be forced to stand there, dancing, in a bikini, and you get to tell her she should be grateful for the opportunity. If you're not bothered yet, this game has more in store! Did you know that Rufus lures children into the path of a pedophile? Did you know he later kills those children? He can even make a pencil rubbing of the pedohile's genitals and show it to them before killing them, just for extra laughs. Fantastic. So incredibly disappointed, tbh, after how much I enjoyed the first two games. Would really like to hear Daedalic Entertainment justify using child abuse, transphobia, slavery and suicide (among other sensitive issues) as a punchline, but know it's never going to happen.			"

												Part three of the Deponia trilogy.Holy ♥♥♥♥, what a game. This was worth it's 20€ - the dialogues are even more hilarious than in the previous titles (especially at the reception!), the puzzles are easier to solve (which might be a bad thing for some, but for a retard as me that's a good thing) and the story has suddenly become WAY more awesome than it's been before thanks to a pretty big, awesome, great, ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ing awesome ""incident"" - and the ending was one of the best I've ever seen. Also the music is absolutely great and there are so many hidden things and gags in this game you could play it several times and still be amused.Seriously, buy this game! Buy it twice!I really liked the first one, the second one was even better, but this third title has defenitely become one of my favourite games of all times!			"

												It's funny and as addictive as the previous two games in the series, but ultimately my least favorite. Of all three of the Deponia games, this is the one that had the most frustratingly illogical/plot-holey puzzles, and a really hideously racist joke/setup in one part that was just reeealllly not cool. But I stuck with it, because I totally fell in love with this world and its characters over the course of the series. But then that ending -- what a disappointment. After the story treads water in chapter after chapter of meaningless, disconnected puzzles, to spend seemingly so little time and effort on that ending, it just felt kind of lazy. The series as a whole deserved better, IMO. Play it to get series closure, and some interesting story developments, but don't expect the sort of culmination this story deserves. 7/10.			"

Killing Children, calling ppl ""monkeys""....hard digest....Daedalic really really screwed up the game.and then, the special cherry. The worst ending ever.No, NOOOOOOOOOO, why you ruined deponia for me. i liked where everything was until 30% of this game...the last half of this...horrible thing ruined everything!!!!CMON, that is the conclusion of this tale? ....So sad as a gamer to see such....rushed ending and creppy characters evolution...Congratz, Daedaelic did what organnon always wanted and destroyed Deponia.

												PLAYED 14 HOUR (bad connection so Steam never saves playtime), THE GOOD:The art and animation are amazing. The sound effects, voice acting, and background music are also solid.THE BAD:Nothing else in the game manages to be as consistently good.MEDIOCRE PUZZLESDeponia (1,2, and 3) try for Monkey Island style point & click. Occasionally, they nail it and a puzzle is both clever and clear, requiring a creative leap that seems obvious in hindsight. But most puzzles are obtuse and progress is poorly messaged. INEPT TONEAll 3 games have a crass tone, which the writer argues is satire, but often lands shy of that target. I found the game (not just the character Rufus) to be notably sexist, generally insensitive and inept at its humor. Perhaps it was lost in translation but ~70% of what were supposed to be ""jokes"" didn't strike me as funny.WEAK ENDING (BUT NOT BECAUSE IT ISN'T HAPPY)I found the ending unsatisfying not, as other posters have complained, because it is open ended or depressing. Rather it had no gameplay significance. I did the final ""unselfish"" action for the same reason I did all the selfish actions before: it was the only way to progress the game.I cared quite a bit about the character's change but mostly in context of those he hurt.I'd rather he fail to save Deponia, not get the prize girl (Goal), and even die, but only after making some actual impact with his character change. As it is his change seems tacked on and half hearted.DON'T RECOMMENDUltimately the series was a visual delight tarnished by its grating protagonist and thematic content.Not worth the hefty time investment required.

												A comment on Rufus, particularly: I absolutely hate him. He is utterly self-centered and willing to harm anyone and anything to get what he wants. The fact that he is incompetent about it is supposed to make him more endearing to us as an audience. The positive reviews seem to indicate such was the case for most people. But I am not one of them. Consider the following (spoiler alerts): In Deponia 1, he doesn't want to do the dishes. OK, fine, neither did I. But he will go to great lengths to make espresso for a pretty girl, even to the point of flooding a ""friend""s house, blasting underneath three others', robbing Gizmo of a fair amount of his equipment, etc. He thinks nothing of picking up an unconscious girl, whome he claims to ""love"", with a crane and dropping her onto a pile of coal to ride, with every possibility of falling off, down a mine track. Then, when he goes to clean her cartridge, he doesn't do it delicately, as such fragile components need tender loving care. Don't you think if he loved Goal he would have cared to clean her cartridge more delcately? Instead, he messes it up even more, corrodes it, and scratches his name into it!! That's not funny! That's giving a person brain damage! That's intolerable. And that's just the first game!And he doesn't get any better in the next two: In the second, of course, he buys the cheap cartridges and splits Goal's personality, all for the sake of a ten-cent all-day sucker. The nerve! That's not adorably selfish. That's despicable beyond words. And what he does to Baby Goal - he does realise she's completely under his power in that state, right? It's just like handling a baby. He is basically no better than Ian Watkins (a recently sentenced paedophile who used to be a famous musician - God rest his soul ) when he hits on Baby Goal. He's even worse when he abuses her childlike trust to use her as a living lightning rod! Would you do that to a child? Is that an acceptable abuse of a child? No. We should not give this guy our sympathy where it is not due. And the vast majority of his character is not sympathetic in the least. It is almost entirely abusive, and I do not think anyone can credit it to the reasons Hermes - God rest his soul - gives for why Rufus is the way he is. Rufus is not merely a jackass. He is the jackass to end all jackasses. When he killed Goal in the pod - I don't care whether that was an accident or not - the game should have ended there, or Rufus should have changed utterly. As previous reviews have mentioned, that, of course, didn't happen. He is no better by the end of the game. And, worst of all, not only is this despicable specimen of intelligent life the protagonist, he's the guy you play for the span of all three games. You follow him everywhere. You ARE him. I hated a lot of the choices I made playing this game, because I could not make a moral choice, a good choice, if the story was going to advance. I can think of better writing than this. I think most people can. If Poki was just trying to be as crass, or selfish, or harmful as one can be while saving the world, he hit the mark. But to call Rufus a ""hero"" - I sympathise with Bozo. I applauded when he exploded in Rufus's face, with the baby vomit all over him, and the antidepressants in his hair. It needed to be said. And more, much more, besides. The way the game ends - it's almost a relief. Almost. But, Poki, you've left everyone to ""die in their sins"". You let Rufus die in his selfishness. You've left Goal to die in her misguided love. You've left the Deponians to die on Elysium, Elysium to die probably on Deponia. At the end of the Deponia trilogy, the world is not a better place. And, Poki, maybe that's how you see the world. Maybe that's how the modern world sees the world. But it is not so. Poki, I read your forum post (translated into English). All men have a goal in life, a race to run, a fight to fight. Neither should we settle for the garbage on the ground, nor shoot up to the Heavens. Heaven is not enough. Rufus was made for more than Elysium. He could have been the next Doctor Who, or Captain Kirk, or (God forbid) a Saint Francis or even Buddha (well, perhaps not Buddha - except on caffeine). These are men who adventured. Who helped make their worlds better, in little ways, wherever they went. Rufus could have been the subject of a new series on TellTale, or somesuchthing. And, fo course, he could have come to know the neverending adventure - God Himself. And someday, I plan to make a response to this dreadful series along those lines. I surely wish to, anyway. No story should ever play out the way this one did. Ever. This is Hell.			"

												Hi, i just felt i had to open my mouth on this one. I'll start with saying that I truly loved Deponia & Chaos on deponia. Those were two marvellous games, i laughed and had a really good feeling about this game (i had not felt that since ""grim fandango"" or ""broken swords"") But this third game is NOT the final opus you would expect. It's horrible, seriously, to go from the two first opus to this one crap. Suddenly the humour is totally random, with really bad taste humour. And i did search why. And i found why : the lead artist Jan Muller-Michaelis, who founded the game, who wrote the texts and scenario of the first two episodes, has been set aside to only direct voice acting. So, the whole thing falls apart. I will NOT finish this game, this is a total disappointment (and i won't go further since i found the above mentionned tragedy and since i have read what the rest of this mascarade is about on other forums and i really don't want to have the tainted memory of this third crap in my mind instead of the first two chapters) Also, my impression is the guys who have taken control of the writing are nothing more than ♥♥♥♥ing racists (the ♥♥♥♥in kkk club in the hotel, the peep hole ghost, that black women called ""monkey""... seriously ♥♥♥♥ off...)

Mine went into a haywire loop at the ending, which as you can see, didn't make me jump of joy.Without the glitches the final game's story's just as good as it should be.Ps. The two previous games didn't have any glitches.			"

+ The game is incredible itself.This trilogy is the only point-and-click quest that was so hilarious I couldn't help but follow all the unbelievable story line, sometimes taking a break for a real, real good laugh.- But the ending is just a low blow.I was foolishly waiting for something incredibly funny and bizzare to end the adventure but alas! The ending was supposed to make us sad. So it did. So much for a good laugh.A boring part with a bit of a spoiler:To be clear, I am not the one who is that stupid (though I am a bit :P) to think that everything should have a happy ending. But I'm pretty sure that an ending (whether happy or not) may be suitable and may be not. In this particular case I find it totally contradicting both to the mood and the idea. And I do believe that a good comedy ending is either happy or brilliant (or both of these). In this particular case Rufus sacrificing his identity isn't the former and defenetely not the latter since it's very predictable (providing you giving up a thought ""Don't be stupid, the story writers have proven to be way too good to mess up an ending like this!""). A total disappointment! "

												I really enjoyed playing the first two games in the Deponia series. I would rate them as some of the most enjoyable adventures I've played in the last few years, and I've played a lot of adventure games.I didn't enjoy the third Deponia at all. Partly it was because the main character, Rufus, is sucy an annoying person. For a while his self centered nature is amusing, but the jokes eventually start to wear thin. The puzzle solutions are also absurd at times. All of the Deponia games have at least a few bad puzzles, unfortunately Goodbye Deponia has more than a few.Daedalic use to be one of my favourite developers/publishers, but their last few games have been very poor. After Blackguards and Goodbye Deponia I've given up on their games for now.			"

I've just finished the game (don't let Steam trick you with my playtime) and I'm downright disgusted to what this series is, opposite to what it could have been.A miserable ending to a game that was already withering and choking on its own ""so clever jokes"" in the second part. Shoehorned situations just for the sake of adding more illogical puzzles and a plot ripe for philosophical debate dumbed down to what a five-year old could have done with the topics. Sad.

												Do not purchase this game or any Daedalic games for that matter, nor trust Steam.  There's a major bug which prevented me from finishing this game.  After contacting Steam, they palmed me off to the game makers and i received the below email from Daedalic after I still hadnt heard anything about the patch to fix the game.  ""Sorry that you haven't heard from us in a while but we haven't forgotten about you. Unfortunately, so far there is no patch for Goodbye Deponia and I cannot tell you as estimated time of arrival. Also, we cannot refund your game since this is Steam business. We cannot initiate refunds since we did not sell the game ourselves directly. We are very sorry for the inconvenience.""Kind regards, Your Daedalic Support Team19 Feb 2014To date there has been no patch, Daedalic are not being accountable for their product.  Steam have been just as bad and both have behaved like amateurs.  Daedalic support have not replied to my last email about the patch.  Steam have not refunded my purchase because they claim i have ""played too much"" of the game, although was only half way through.  Daedalic emailed me saved games to try and contunue from, but this cut out a huge section in the middle and I could only play the game from the last scene.  Shame on both Steam and Daedalic, I would NEVER recommed using either of them. "

												The third installment didnt get any better and it wasnt because of the ending. I dont want to put any more effort into these reviews so I am just copying and pasting what I said in the first two. I wanted to play the main trilogy before writing a review and I am glad. For a most basic critique I am not a fan. I don't want to divulge because I believe the target audience will not care what I have to say but people who do like this game have specific characteristics I would not like to associate with. But I will never recommend this game. It had great possibility but unfortunately it is not a game I would suggest to any of my friends nor anyone interested in games. :-/  I am disappointed it had high enough sales to make a fourth installment. But I get how our society is, so I am not surprised.			"

												I have played through the trilogy of the games, and the only thing I have to say is that I'm not very impressed.While the gameplay of this game is certainly vastly better than the others, including proper puzzle tutorials on how the puzzle worked, I can't help but feel as though something is wrong. As though, somehow, I've been cheated out of something.Oh, right, a respectable ending.[Spoilers be beyond.]This game, its script writing, and everything about it seems to revolve around puffing up the writers' and developers' ego, and focusing almost entirely on their own egocentric views as placed through the main character, and multiple references back to the game devs and writers that break the fourth wall only seem to shore up that representation. It's like what happened in Bubsy 3D, only far less charming when presented by an over the top, sexist, egocentric madman, who, until the very end, was the same worthless bag of trash until he finally found a reason to sacrifice himself. Even then, we didn't get that saddening, emotional ending that would have left everyone satisfied with the series on a whole, and willing to close the book. Somehow, an editor boards the ship and ends up falling with Rufus just to break that tragic ending with more self centered egotism.If this had been some character like Deadpool, I might have made an exception. But it's not. He was not shown as some bad♥♥♥♥♥chopping his way through those that opposed him while making sly comments and breaking the fourth wall. No, he was a bumbling fool who stumbled through danger and solved menial puzzles, caused suicides and death, nearly causes the destruction of his home planet three times, puts his friends in immeasurable danger, and at the very end, when we finally get to feel sad and sorry to see him go? We're not even given that.You know, the worst part of this game wasn't really Rufus, though he was the character that said it, it was how the writers decided to approach sexism. To the point where talking to any female who is not Goal became an ear grating experience, and not just from listening to Toni either. Rufus, and the way he talked to females, most notably regarding Bambina and Lottie outside the tank, was disgusting, and over the top for even Rufus. It felt like the writers at that point weren't calling out how bad sexism is, but were, and likely still are, sexist themselves!Now let's talk about another part of this game. Cloans. Really? ... Actually, that's not that bad, no.It was Hermes. I took one look at him and I said ""Star Child."" For those of you who have played the Mass Effect series, who know how bad of a taste those two words leave in your mouth, then you must see exactly what I mean. He was the cop out. He was the ""I have all the solutions to all of your problems!"" guy. While I will admit that his exposition certainly did make some of the mysteries of the trilogy fall into place, we then follow it all up by having him commit suicide. Oh bravo, BRAVO! Way to touch on that situa- Wait, did I say touch?No, once again, the writers, or perhaps not them, perhaps someone higher up was ""touching base"" with them constantly and telling them what to write. Either way, the writers blatantly show another facet of suicide later on (rope noose store) and even have a therapist suggest one of his patients kill herself. I'm sorry, but what happens if someone who suffers from severe clinical depression picked this up, played it, and saw that? Do you really think some people aren't going to be affected by that? I mean, as someone who, at one point in his life, had to deal with those tendencies, it's horribly offensive, to say the least. Not that I'm claiming the writers ever came up with any tact regarding insults no matter the character those insults came from, or what or who they were about.But I can't deny this game having its moments. Romance between Goal and Rufus was certainly charming, to say the least. Finally seeing Bozo snap and slap the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Rufus was also very, very nice. Seeing his ""father"" unravel himself in front of everyone else, seeing Rufus finally get his time under the spotlight, and truly having their support for one, final plan... That was finally a moment of heroism when it was never even once allowed before even when the PLAYER wanted to make a right decision in the series. Oh, and you thought I forgot about that.Oh no, this is something that NEEDS to be touched on, even if it wasn't a big problem in this game. Stopping the player from making the right choice, and instead taking that option from our hands. That is just disgustingly pitiful, and a clear show of a lack of effort there. Nothing gets me angrier than when my ability to decide a key moment means nothing in that moment. It's not funny, it's just a disgusting way to allow the writers to slack.So, all in all, can I recommend this trilogy to to other people on the internet? It highly depends. If you like puzzle games, and don't give a rat's♥♥♥♥♥about the story, please, get this trilogy in the full. The puzzles are actually quite fun once you understand them, and often very well crafted. Even if you enjoy your puzzle games having a story, but are still mostly in it for the puzzles, get the trilogy. But if you care about the story and the characters, walk away now.The story is ruined by the characters, the comedy does not exist outside of some slapstick moments, and the twists are oh-so-predictable.Finally, I have to include one last bit. I'm not an SJW, and I will never be. I don't want anything that I've said to be thrown under their banner, even though I know half of it will. What I said in this review is entirely of my own opinion, and only my own. I touched on the things that felt like they were well over the top, even for a character like Rufus. I enjoyed the gameplay, which was quite honed and well made, but I could hardly stand more than a few characters in the game. This is not a book I close with contentment, but with contempt. Good day to you all, I need to get some sleep.			"

												My personal opinion on the trilogy:Pro: - beautiful animation- great character design- fantastic music- the 2nd episode had lovely and funny sections, much more than the others- Bozo lashing out at RufusCons:- self-aware AND non-self-aware unfunny sexism: despite the voluntary crassness of the interaction with female characters, it's easy to notice that in general, women in this game are either non-interactive background or full-on clichés/plot devices. I'm struggling to remember any woman playing a somewhat neutral role such as vendor, therapist, journalist... the ones we see working are part of the main cast and mostly fall into tired female tropes.- self-aware unfunny racism. See Rock Paper Shotgun article and other comments- the writer(s) built a somewhat consistent character, but not a consistent world: friends and foes are mostly differenciated by their aptitude to put up with the main character, which is very high for both, despite all logic. The world does not react to the main character in general, making his antics tiring by the third episode rather than entertaining. We can't empathise with the character nor can we with the world, which is the shame.- Not only the main character doesn't change throughout the series, but his actions become more selfish and tasteless as the story progresses. - deus ex machina explanation which binds the whole story together- we never get to play in Elysium- disappointing ending.Overall, I felt that the first episode was suprinsingly charming, because of the discovery of the great design, animation, music and somewhat original setting; the second introduced great new areas, clearer puzzles, and more funny moments even though the character becomes a bit tiring and his actions more cringe-worthy; by the third I no longer felt like investing myself heavily into the world and puzzles and I cringed much more than I laughed, both due to tasteless scenes and bad story.This is a no for me.

It was really funny with many emotional moments. The handpainted locations are made with love for details.Rufus (you) will have clones in this part which will give you a new interface option after a while. You can switch between your clones all the time.Goal (the girl) will be more childish as in the last part. ;)Can you save Deponia?

												The artwork is fantastic, and the puzzles take a good amount of time to solve. The length feels about right. While many will warn you to stay away purely because of the ending I urge you to experience the game nonetheless. Part of why the ending feels so sour is despite the apparent unlikeability of the protagonist you still feel something at the end, but that said the ending is just hard to sit with. I definitely was not feeling good at the end, but thats because this game made me invested. That investment makes a rough ending worth sticking through. FTR when I say rough ending I do not mean bad. It is well thought out, metaphorically important, and the right amount of subtle allowing different players to take away from it differently. That said I think few players will be satisfied with this ending, but that's only to say we want Daedalic to give us more of this truly unique world and its fascinating array of characters.			"

												Goodbye Deponia is the finale of the Deponia series, and I can only say that the quality of the game just keeps getting better, and that it has left me with many unforgettable moments, namely the ending which almost brought me to tears. I want to say many things about the story and the characters, and the potential that I felt was unfulfilled, yet justifyingly so, but I will try to refrain from writing any spoilers in this review.As the last game of the series, the puzzles are only getting harder with the addition of managing multiple inventories instead of just one. There were definitely more times where I had to look up a walkthrough to find salvation for my overheating brain than the previous two games, but the challenge definitely makes the game entertaining to play (kudos if you can play through the game without looking up the solutions). Throughout the game you'll find various character references to other games/movies, and you'll have quiite a few giggles interacting with them as the MC. And finally, the adventure was simply beautiful and... magical. I never thought I'd be so emotionally invested in a point-and-click adventure game, but I've never been more glad to be proven wrong.If it's not clear enough by this point, I am very impressed with the game and would recommend it to those who has already played the previous two games. For those who have not started the series and are looking for a game with a challenging-but-not impossible puzzles, a few good giggles and a great story, then I will say that being able experience the adventures of Deponia is worth every single penny in your wallet. (Maybe not literally, but the retail price is still a decent value ^^)			"

												Goodbye Deponia is not the strongest game in the series for me, but that could be just because of the ending. Fans of the first two games will definitely want to grab this one and say farewell to Deponia. The gameplay and puzzles are the same style as before. Since the game is translated, some of the humor and jokes are lost in the translation.+ Excellent performance by the voice actors.+ Engaging puzzles and good point-and-click game mechanics.+ Soundtrack and effects are on point, contributing to the atmosphere of the game.- Some puzzles and item combinations can seem really illogical, as per Deponia norms.- The ending.

												10/10 one of the best p&c adventures I have played.I have read quite a few negative reviews that critized the game for it's unlikable character and crass humour. In my opinion, you don't necessarily have to identify with the main character to enjoy the story, and with regards to the humour - I found it brillant. Black humour = best kind of humour.Some of the puzzles are not that obvious, so in a few places I had to resort to a Walkthrough  Guide (if you are the kind of guy who likes to talk to every person in the game 10 times and combines every object with every other object and every person and hotspot in the game, you will not have to do this), but most of them are fairly easy.

												Compared to the previous two titles, Goodbye Deponia pushes the limits of dark humor. You, the player, sell a black woman into sexual slavery. You lead children onto the doorstep of a pedophile and later into the  mouth of a child-eating swamp monster. You drive a man to suicide.  We were first introduced to Rufus as a well-meaning buffoon. But as we progress through the trilogy, he becomes increasingly despicable and unempathetic. It becomes difficult for the player to project themselves onto this character.Rufus was given a redemption ending. I feel that this was too sudden a change of character. It makes the finale less tragic and memorable. Character development should not just happen and the end, but rather revealed as a continuous process resulting from an accumulation of experience.Like the previous two titles, the production quality of Goodbye Deponia is very high. If you are a fan of the series, you should enjoy its finale.			"

												A great game in the same mold as the first two. You definitely need to play the first two to have any understanding of what's going on but that's with any trilogy that follows a story. I don't think any of the games are worth the $20 price tag but they are constantly on sale, and now that all three have been released they are sold on sale as a bundle. Worth getting if you're even a casual fan of point and click adventures. Some puzzles are challenging which is good and you really never find yourself slamming your head into the keyboard. It's geared towards a more mature audience so if you're getting it for your child you can find something more age appropriate. Otherwise a great game in the point an click adventure family.			"

												A conclusion to the (what should be an award winning) saga. Goodbye deponia falls short in storytelling and character development, but compensates by new ideas and wittier (and sicker) humor. The story itself is a bit ""loose"", meaning it does not feel like a complete narrative but like weakly tethered sub-plots. However, the puzzles are not as vague as in the previouse games, and the abundance of minigames makes it very enjoyable.Also, Rufus is a character I 'oh so love' to hate.8.5/10 for the numerics junkies			"

												Stating the obvious - this has been a really fun and entertaining trilogy with a spirit of weirdness similar to Monkey Island. Yes, it is also true that the ending of this last third part is not really well thought (my guess is that the creators were surprised after the success of the first part and after all those turns in the plot just didn't know how to end it). But overall, it is playing THROUGH the entire series that makes you enjoy the game. And at the end - have faith in Rufus that he always knows how to come out of trouble unscathed :-)			"

												This is the third and final installment in the Deponia series. You need to play the other games for this one to make any sense, as it is a direct continuation of the story.The main plot (while as convoluted as ever) does a good job of wrapping up all the loose ends, and it fills in all of the backstory question marks. I thought the ending was cheap and unsatisfying, though. The puzzles were on par with the first two games, although this chapter throws in a new multi-inventory system that adds an extra layer of complexity. There is also a heavier reliance on needing to perform actions in a particular order. I liked, or at least tolerated, most of the mini-games in this one. There were no hair-pulling sequences like Platypus Bataka, and it was easy to get all of the achievements.Goodbye Deponia contains an array of new locations, but brings back most of the side characters from the first two games. You also eventually gain the ability to switch back and forth between multiple parallel story-lines.The pacing is better than in the second game, but it still feels like a slog. I think by the third game, I just got sick of taking twelve steps backward for every one step forward. It would have been nice, for once, to feel like I was actually working towards an end-goal, instead of spending all my time band-aiding the problems caused by Rufus's idiocy and recklessness. I think if you combine Roger from Space Quest's bad judgement, Leisure Suit Larry's sexism, Urkel from Family Matters' accidental destruction, Mayhem from the Allstate commercials' intentional malevolence, and the cast of Seinfeld's problem-solving skills, you might get something approximating the experience of controlling Rufus. In general, I felt there was a tonal shift from ""generally funny with occasional dark humor"" to ""everything is awful and every joke is at someone's expense."" Chaos on Deponia had its own morbid and uncomfortable moments, but Goodbye Deponia purposely goes out of its way to make Rufus as irredeemable and disgusting as possible. While it makes sense in retrospect, it is difficult to play through. I missed the comedy that made the earlier games palatable.  [Major trigger warning: the content of this game contains images and dialogue related to depression and suicidal thoughts]What can I say? This is an irksome and doleful game that happens to have high production values and decent point-and-click puzzles. While it is a fitting end to the series, I don't think it was necessarily the right end. I give it a 6/10.			"

												The third and final installment was the best of the series not only for its powerful, emotional points but it for the thrills involved. I was also happy that I completed all of Act 2 by myself without the use of the walk through.  Plus controlling more then one Rufus was pretty neat and some dynamic differences. Still there are some points I was not happy with. First I was appalled with what happened between Goon and June which really really made me feel absolutely terrible. Second I wasn't extremely happy with the ending either. Still, its a good series. If you like point and click adventure games then this series is a good one but I still think that it would be wiser to mash the games together into one title instead of three. A sequel would also be a nice gesture but I doubt that will happen any time soon. These kinds of games are just not my cup of tea but I""ll keep playing the pack I got for awhile. My favorite part would have to be the songs between chapters.			"

												A great game in the same mold as the first two. You definitely need to play the first two to have any understanding of what's going on but that's with any trilogy that follows a story. I don't think any of the games are worth the $20 price tag but they are constantly on sale, and now that all three have been released they are sold on sale as a bundle. Worth getting if you're even a casual fan of point and click adventures. Some puzzles are challenging which is good and you really never find yourself slamming your head into the keyboard. It's geared towards a more mature audience so if you're getting it for your child you can find something more age appropriate. Otherwise a great game in the point an click adventure family.			"

												This one is a tricky one to recommend. It has the same quality of humor and zany puzzle-solving as the first two, but (1) there is an extremely racist joke/puzzle that some people will find shocking rather than humorous and (2) the ending is the most controversial since Mass Effect 3. On balance, I do suggest it. But play the other two first -- or get the Complete Journey to play all three.			"

												Deponia... What can i say about this game?That its an amazing point and click adventure would be an understatment! The world, The characters, The... well... EVERYTHING really!Absolutly BEAUTIFUL and with my whole heart I can say I am so very happy I found this game!Deponia was a wonderful adventure!but...With even the greatest of adventures... trouble can show through.I will not spoil anything.The ending was very... disapointing. Without going too deep into details, I will say that the end to Goodbye Deponia was so very out of no where and left a bitter feeling in my heart. It honestly made me sad... and not the ""Good"" kinda sad either.I felt like the protagonist had been robbed of a victory that quite frankly he deserved. You can tell that the ending was supposed to be Bitter Sweet. But it was far too bitter and not enough sweet. PROs:The story is fun and quirky! Childish enough for a young audience, Crude enough for the adults. The puzzles are never too easy or hard. The game is full of FLAVOR! The Deponia series as a whole is oozing with color atmosphere!CONs:The ending...Final verdict?PLAY THIS GAME. PLAY ALL 3 OF THEM.If you are a fan of point and click adventure then you NEED this in your life right the hell now!If you are on the fence, Buy it when its on sale. Take my advice. I am not a fan of point and click adventures and this game won my heart! Play it!			"

												10/10 one of the best p&c adventures I have played.I have read quite a few negative reviews that critized the game for it's unlikable character and crass humour. In my opinion, you don't necessarily have to identify with the main character to enjoy the story, and with regards to the humour - I found it brillant. Black humour = best kind of humour.Some of the puzzles are not that obvious, so in a few places I had to resort to a Walkthrough  Guide (if you are the kind of guy who likes to talk to every person in the game 10 times and combines every object with every other object and every person and hotspot in the game, you will not have to do this), but most of them are fairly easy.

												This review contains spoilers.Again, the third installment is decently comparable to the first two.The puzzles were a hit or miss (with some such as the surgeon puzzle giving no indication of progress).Voice acting-wise and humour were decent, the developers attempted some new humorous concepts such as the one in Bozo's family area - which to me - got old super fast.The story's ending also was extremely unsatisfying.The little musical jingle that was sung every chapter got worse and worse over time from the previous installments.... to the point where they kept stuffing words into the song that didn't even rhyme or match the rhythm.However, with all this said, I *would* recommend the game considering the story-telling investment I put in from the first two stories.

												Goodbye Deponia is not the strongest game in the series for me, but that could be just because of the ending. Fans of the first two games will definitely want to grab this one and say farewell to Deponia. The gameplay and puzzles are the same style as before. Since the game is translated, some of the humor and jokes are lost in the translation.+ Excellent performance by the voice actors.+ Engaging puzzles and good point-and-click game mechanics.+ Soundtrack and effects are on point, contributing to the atmosphere of the game.- Some puzzles and item combinations can seem really illogical, as per Deponia norms.- The ending.

												I've played all three, loved every minute of them. But man, that ending killed it for me. It felt so abrupt, so pushed together. I'm truthfully just really disapointed in it. An ending of a trilogy is supposed to make you feel good, provide closer, and have you look back at all the hours you put into the game. I think Daedalic is just really great at making cliffhangers at the end of their games. If there was a 4th installation,  maybe of rufus actually getting to elysium and goal then finding out that cletus was pretending the whole time  , I would maybe have a better resting feeling about these games. It was still fun, although I had to look at the walkthough pretty frequently if I didn't want to lose my mind. Just wish there was more to the end.			"

												I have never enjoyed a game so much while liking the main protagonist so little, though I will admit that by the end of this game, the third in the series, Rufus has started to grow on me (much like a fungus), and I have enjoyed seeing the development of his character played out. This point & click puzzle game was challenging at points, while offering the option to skip some of the more involved mini-games if you are not so inclined to puzzle over them. The comedy in this series can sometimes be a bit edgier, and maybe even a bit questionable in a few places, but the game play and storyline is overall highly entertaining and rewarding.			"

												It's different and amusing enough that I still recommend this ""just alright"" conclusion to the Deponia series.Rufus is an interesting character in that he forces the player to make bad moral choices due to his ignorance. On the issue of the sewer scenes, particularly June and the organ grinder, the jokes themselves can be distasteful, but their main focus is to emphasize Rufus' idiocy.The art is still the most redeeming quality, just like the first two games.The game can feel dreadfully long when I consider the difficulty that had me stumped more than once.My advice: buy on sale, don't take it too seriously.

Overall:  It's a good point and click adventure.  I absolutely recommend if it's on sale.  Whether you want to pay full price is up to how much of a point and click enthusiast you are.Story: Now with more Rufus than most can handle; this Deponia is extremely heavy on the dialogue but takes the puzzles and misadventures to the next level.  Many point and click adventures have degrees of moon logic where a nonsensical combination of items and actions somehow solves the problem, but Deponia makes it somehow seem almost rational in hindsight.  Rufus often made me simultaneously gasp in horror and laugh at some of the stunts he pulled on his fellow Deponians.Gameplay:  It has a moderate amount of pixel hunting.  Some of the scenes are extremely cluttered and can make finding the one thing needed difficult.  The puzzles in Goodbye Deponia are much trickier, which I found to be both more satisfying and more frustrating at times.  Expect patient trial and error spotting the hidden patterns or occasional google searches.			"

												This series is absolutely amazing! The story is funny as hell and for my personal first point and click adventure game I could have not picked any better one. The grafical desing is amusing and the buzzles give you a decent enough challenge! I beg you please if you get stuck dont take the easy way out ! just give it a little time you will feel so amazing when you figure things out! For all three games at that prize is basicly stealing so definetely check these games out atleast out of curiosity! Each game is great and get better from start to finish ...you will laugh ( a lot) and you will sigh you will aww and you ill cry!			"

												It is a great finish to a truly original tale, and a trilogy that anyone not already familiar with the series should absolutely purchase and enjoy. Goodbye Deponia is a wild rollercoaster ride - a bigger, smarter and funnier adventure than the previous. All in all, Daedalic have crafted an excellent adventure that does justice to the series, topping it all off in a satisfying manner.			"

												Rufus was not hero that we wanted, nor was he the hero we needed, but he became loved nonetheless. His name is Rufus, Ruuuufuuuus. This is why people still play point and click adventure games and enjoy them. Great story, humor, character and the world, 3rd installation of Deponia has it all and the fans wont be disappointed.

												Following through the trilogy when it first came out and watching the story turned out the way it did in the Third and 'Final' installment was honestly one of the unexpected turn about you ever think would happen for Rufus and Goal. There's no need to talk about the gameplay, no one plays an adventure puzzle game for that. Deponia's artstyle certainly isn't the most realistic but it holds many charms in its own ways that fits the game theme. Every dialogue through out the three games is surprisingly well-planned and structured into producing Deponia 3, there's really only a handful of dialogues in the game that is nonsensical. This game is worth playing through for the story as all the secrets comes unveiled with every step in Goodbye Deponia.			"

												Daedalic did to this trilogy the same that BioWare did to Mass Effect, an excelent trilogy (totally a must play) with a shi-tty ending. However i still recommend you to buy and play this beautiful trilogy with tons of fun, good ambience and easter-eggs from other point 'n' click adventures.7/10 ( 'cause the ending)			"

												7/10.Not hilarious but fun as the prequels.  Aлso, good length - about 20 hours of play (although i didn't do a time-run :)One comment for English Translation - i didn't play the original German, but the sound-balancing in english translation is unacceptable.  Equalizing, leveling, compression.  Come on.  Especially when it comes to Organons speaking.  The damage to my eardrums was irreversible first time Organon sang their hymn.			"

												I am re-writing this review after thinking about this game more.This game is a very funny... tragedy. It left me listening to the blues for weeks. Yet, it made me do more thinking after I finished it than any game has. This series is worth re-playing. Things you miss in the first two games or dismiss as silly jokes take on a whole new meaning in light of this third game.Notice please that the worst parts of this game take place in only one area -- the sewer. There are many complaints about the sexism, racism, etc of this game. It is making a point here about how terrible the Sewer Rufus is. The other two are no where near as bad as that one. Details like this are easy to miss -- as they are more suble than the over-the-top humor everywhere. Thats why it's worth replaying these games --After you get over the ending, that is....			"

												If you have played the first two games, you know what to expect. If you haven't, go finish them first. My only gripe is that these games are too difficult. And don't be put off by the ending. It might not make you feel completely satisfied, but it perfectly completes the character of Rufus.			"

												The way Rufus is justified in the later part of the story is just... wrong. Rufus is not a lovable silly hero. The very word Ego Maniac doesn't even cover him. We're talking about hardcore sociopath that doesn't care about anyone but himself. I thought that was the point of this game. The point of the very character,  what makes Rufus Rufus. Why all of a sudden a hero-washing? Ewww.			"
