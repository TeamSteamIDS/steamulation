												edit: updating review. evidently its getting some attention, so I figured I might as well expand and clarify.tl;dr edition: neither good nor fun. do not buy unless its deeply discounted.I can not refer this game in good faith. There are 2 major things wrong with How to Survive.Firstly, take a look at the DLC. If How to Survive truly is an indie game, control of the project has been overtaken by greedhead corporate dumb think leadership. Someone (likely 505 Games) has opted to make DLCs out of basic features that should have been part of the basic game. Examples are an extra harder difficulty and a hardcore feature. Other DLCs (Heatwave) resemble what would have been unlockables for games only a generation ago. Lastly there are the DLCs that suggest the core game was released unfinished taking the cutting room floor scraps and selling them off as DLC when they got to them later. I don't know if the nickel and diming customers business model bothers you, but it sure as hell bothers me.The second problem is the game itself. Its not good. How to Survive is a perfect example of the tidalwave of schlock being put out by the burgeonning indie industry. It is an inferior imitation of mainstream titles like Diablo and Torchlight. It tries to be unique and original with additional survival features like hunger, thirst, and sleepiness, but they're implemented in a way that make the game tedious and annoying. The quality is painfully amateur and inconsistent. Struggle as a melee character, but have 2 triple bladed boomerangs and you're so golden the game gets dull. The content is particularly slim. Each island is painfully small. And the game itself manages to be as repetitive as Diablo and Torchlight, but in the most flat, boring, and completely unrewarding manner possible.How to Survive lives up to its lousy meta score. No idea why this game has such an overwhelmingly high positive customer review count. The $15 asking price with the lazy DLCs is crazy to me. Other games How to Survive is trying to be are the same exact price and offer more and better quality content minus the annoying survival gimmicks and DLC. Specifically either of the Torchlight games.Honestly, my recommendation is to not buy How to Survive at all. If you absolutely must take the plunge, as stated in the tl;dr above, buy it when its 80-90% off. That way you won't feel too ripped off when you find out how painfully below average it is.			"

												Now first lets get the positive out of the way.The games graphics are fine for what it is.The story can be funny sometimes.The co-op challenges can be fun with a friend.Now lets get to the real review where we look at what they promised and what they delivered.The game is an ok size however it's extreamly limited in size for it's price.If you forced yourself to go slow you would take maybe 6 hours to finish this game.Another problem  is the content  the guns,melee weps, mutants ect is all really limiting.Some might disagree with me there but think about it theres maybe 8 guns, 3 chainsaws , 6 melee weps and 1 ammoless total op wep.Now for my Largest disapointment with this game it's promise  ""experience for zombie game veterans""There is NOTHING veteran about this game it hands everything to you on a silver platter.There's sleep areas at night prebuilt impervise to any zombie attack that you only need to clear out once.Night creatures are as deadly as a new born kitten.Ammo is WAY too common i had 2,000 ammo constantly.There should never be a weapon that can destroy armys without some sort of price ""i'm looking at you boomarang""You should not point out on the map where the players have got to go.The crafting tells you what's possible.....The ""hardest"" mutant is the easyest thing to beat with a handgun.Food is too easy to aquire.Water is Way too easy to aquire.Items respawn.....Changing difficulty only changes what damage they hit.......And i could go on with this list for acouple more pages.All in all this game was a disapointment and broke it's promises.Before you say i did not play long enough know that i defeated the game twice  and defeated half the challenges with friends.I played through twice to see if anything at all changed i really had to force myself to with a dieing hope that something hard or fun would of been added.Update#Online co-op is lag and bug filled and has serious annoyances that i had hoped they might have removed.The difficulty and enemie numbers are the same.You and the other player are forced to share the screen meaning you can't move far from eachother.The match making system is pathetic as it's auto finding where you select options and hope that someone else has the same options but a diffrent character.All in all no real change to the game still not worth the money.

 Once Bitten, Twice Shy A fun, 'Diablo'-esque Third-Person RPG, ""How to Survive"" caught me a little off guard. At $2.25 (Summer Sale 2014), I certainly wasnt expecting much but was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this title from 505 Games. Campaign | Gameplay: The story is straighforward - play as one of three protagonists stuck on a deserted island infested with zombies, and learn 'how to survive' long enough to find a way out. The gameplay is fun (and told from the perspective of a top-down isometric shooter), good graphics and atmospheric sound, M&K controls that are intuitve and responsive, features a broad selection of weapons (from Axe's, Machete's, Bow & Arrows, Molotov Cocktail's to a wide variety of guns), and interesting characters. The game's strength however was the Inventory setup - which allows you to collect a seemingly random mish-mash of junk from your travels around the island and combine them in various ways to create useful items (Eg. String and a wooden stick to create a fishing rod, An old bottle, kerosene and a scrap of fabric to create Molotov Cocktail's, An old rubber tire, an axe and string to create body armor etc etc).Flaws: Uneven difficulty spikes, and sparse 'Save' points cause needless frustration in an otherwise enjoyable experience.  'How to Survive' might not break any new boundaries but 505 Games have taken on a disparete variety of gameplay elements and executed extremely well to create a refreshingly fun, zombie-horror romp. At $2.25, this one is a no-brainer - A Definite Recommend (8/10) Want More Recommendations?

												This game starts fun. The graphics are decent for the top-down style. Good lighting and water effects. Day and night cycle where night really amps up the challenge by making you watch your back constantly. A diverse crafting system. Decent skill tree options. Some of the voice acting is funny (I think intentionally) and unique. I liked the survival aspects, which is the point of the game. You have to monitor your hunger, thirst, rest, and health. It's all manageable. You can collect empty bottles to store up water reserves, hunt animals and collect plants to cook at a campfire for food, collect herbs and create bandages to restore health, and secure a bunker to sleep in. The combat is solid. The controls are easy. You craft increasingly strong weapons as you progress and different weapons have unique advantages. The machete cuts through plants and carves arrows from sticks, the bow is powerful and the arrows recoverable, the gun is rapid fire with plenty of ammo on the islands, the boomerang is very powerful but not as smooth and fast as the bow, etc. Melee combat animations are fluid with just enough variety--more than I expected from a game with this visual style.While the gameplay mechanics are very solid, the storyline becomes more of a chore than fun unfortunately. It's a series of fetch quests that take you back and forth across the maps. Every time you pass one direction and clear the large amount of zombies, you have to then fight them all over again on the way back due to a fast respawn rate. This turned the game into a slow fetch quest grind for me and I lost interest about halfway through. If you make a wrong turn, it's even worse, because now you're fighting respawns over and over and you're not even in the right spot of the map. You can't save the game except at story checkpoints and that can take a bit of time. Perhaps, if I could save at will, I could have tolerated the grind in smaller doses. Maybe it's just me, but I had trouble with the quest early on where I had to collect meat from a deer. I kept wandering the map looking for deer and could never find them. When I finally would spot one, I would have to clear hordes of zombies to clear a path to it and these actions usually scared the deer away, leaving me to wander yet some more. The worst is when you're hunting deer at night and the extra zombies come to chase you down. You need to keep your flashlight on these nighttime zombies to keep them at bay, which makes focusing on the fleeting deer more difficult. The game says you can track the deer once you injure it by following blood on the ground. It's not that easy to do when the ground is already covered in excessive blood from slaying zombies. I eventually caught the deer and made the mistake of cooking the meat, which didn't complete the quest, so I had to repeat it all over again.I really wanted to like this game. I actually told my friends how much I enjoyed it at the beginning. Then the grind just beat me down. There is also inventory issues. Some of the crafting recipes call for 5 or 6 items. You're already stocking ammo, weapons, water, food, bandages, quest items, etc and the 25-item inventory fills fast. I don't really consider this a negative, because it more accurately reflects the reality of surviving on these islands. It might frustrate some players though. 25 slots is still considerably more than some games permit. One small nitpick when it comes to resting: you aren't allowed to unless your rest meter is low enough. One time I was by a shelter at just over 50% fatigue. I couldn't rest before setting out on the next leg of my journey. That's just silly, because you can make adjustments on the other survival factors whenever you please. As much as I would like to recommend this game for all its positive, interesting concepts, I just can't because the story is a major drag.			"

												I get the impression that I don't understand How to Survive.  The number of legitimate looking positive reviews indicates that whilst others have enjoyed the game I haven't.The survival element from which the game takes it's name seems tacked on with little effect on game-play.  In the hours I've played I've never come close to starving or dehydrating.  A little message pops up telling you that you're becoming thirsty or hungry and that's solved by drinking or eating one of the many things in your inventory.There are wells and bottles and canisters everywhere; I've haven't felt any tension or had to go on an epic quest to find water.  There are also edible plants everywhere so whilst meat might not always be on the menu starving is not going to happen.Sleeping is ... strange.  There's no building or reinforcing shelters and no bedrolls or similar.  There is one special shack per island that has a closeable door.  That's the only place where you can sleep.  If you're 51% tired you can't sleep but if you're 49% tired than you must.  There's no wait command so sleeping through the night won't happen unless leave your character to get tired.As survival games go there's no real element of survival in 'How to Survive'.  Fallout 3 with Primary Needs or State of Decay will give you a much better experience. "

												I really tried to give this game a fair try.  It simply wasn't as interesting or enjoyable as it appeared to be in the Steam store.  The premise is neat but the execution is lacking.  Crafting could be cool, but most of the time your tiny inventory is full up with junk.  You have no homebase so there's nowhere to store excess stuff.   Also, where you sleep for the night is highly limited and really annoying.  There is usually only one secure bed shack per island.  And for some reason, when you go to try and use it, a red light and alarm goes off every time, alerting tons of zombies to your location for no real reason.   The most entertaining aspect of this game is watching the short ""Kovac's rules"" videos.   Save your money and buy State of Decay instead for a much deeper zombie survival crafting game with a better plot.			"

												Don't get tricked into thinming this is a 3rd person zombie survival. It's like dead island but in a 3rd person perspective, giving us a barebones diablo clone with no enemy variety. You talk to NPCs and do quests, you can craft many weapons, but as long as you get the bone shurikens you should have no trouble.The cutscenes for the ""how to survive"" book are sometimes clever and funny. But it's far from enough to save this game.If you would have to get it regardless, wait for a sale. A big one.			"

												I bought this game on sale, thought, what the hell.  What a pleasant surprise.  It's like Diablo 2 gameplay, with zombies/mutants as your enemies, and one of four survivors as your hero.  The gameplay is very fun, although it does get a bit stale with a lack of diversity among the zombies/mutants.  Couple the lack of diversity with a completely OP weapon (cough, triple boomerang) and you've got a recipe for boredom.  If you want the story mode to remain challenging, I highly recommend avoiding any boomerang, as they are fast, powerful, ammo-less, and there's no such thing as durability in this game.  Killing zombies with a shotgun made out of a tube and duct tape is much more rewarding anyway, right?Still, easily worth $15 and a play through or two.  The challenges are were the challenge is (play on words intended).  You get your character dropped on an island with no equipment, a real ""out of the freezer into the frying pan"" kind of experience.  The challenge is reaching your escape under the allotted time, without dying obviously.  The crafting system in this game is beautiful.  You can make guns out of tubes, boomerangs out of bones, armor out of tires, and potions/elixirs galore from the plentiful plants on the islands.  Very rewarding indeed.The talent system is... meh.  It seems like an after thought, and there is a real void of any interesting talents.  Everything is just passive ""make explosive arrows"" ""carry more explosives in a stack"" ""make X potions"" ""do more damage on headshot"" kind of thing.  Would've loved some Dead Island-esque execution talents or some character specific special moves.Bottom line: Buy it.  You can easily get 10-15 hours if the idea of a Diablo-ish zombie game with great crafting sounds fun to you.  How to Survive gets a 3/5.Tawokwww.GuildLeaders.com "

												This review is coming from a stand-point of about 7 hours of solo play.Do I like this game? It's okay, I mean, it's nothing special, it's a twin-stick zombie survival game with a somewhat interesting crafting system.The game-play, it's basic and easy to understand as all twin-stick games are. Nothing new. Which is totally fine, I mean it's a tried and tested system.The story, I haven't finished the story, simply because I hit too many BDN (Board, done now) moments. I just couldn't do another fetch quest. That's all this game is, fetch quest after fetch quest after fetch quest. When did I hit my limit? When the drunk pilot wanted his cargo, where was it? All over the islands... All twenty pieces of the damn stuff. I quit, I was done with the game from then on. The characters were, eh. The only person that interested my in any way was Kovac, mainly because SPOILER ALERT he's apparently the one crashing the boats into the islands SPOILER ALERT OVER. I say apparently because I have no idea if he is or not, though if that was him on the radio at the start of the game it makes sense as he seems to have a radio station at the top of his island. I digress. The characters are cliche to say the least, oh no a mother and daughter that are split up on a terrible island, the friend who was bitten but has the thing you need to get off the island, the crazy old lady, the apparent friend who is actually the villain, the disabled knowledgeable one who spends all their time tinkering with your escape rout and the drunk.May as well look at this games big point, the crafting. It's okay. I mean you can make things, cool yeah, okay. I never bothered with the potions. The guns? Didn't bother with them either. Melee weapons? Rusty machete all the way. After I built the boomerang I just didn't need anything else. Nothing. And when I upped it with the red stone, nothing else would do. Now when I say I didn't bother with it, I mean I built every combination I could within 7 hours of play. Tested it, and still found the boomerang to be the best thing to use. Chainsaw? Nope. Flamethrower? Nope. Shotgun? Nope. Boomerang. Always.Survival. Pha. My biggest problem surviving was diverting my attention from my current fetch quest to trek to water holes, or where I knew deer were or to safe houses when I got a little tired. Fuel for bombs was the biggest problem for my ""survival"". I had so much food on my person I could have fed all the survivors I had found with ease. Three jerry cans of water kept me going for days. Ammo was of no concern, I had stacks of the stuff on every island just sitting there. The zombies, or should I say, ""Monsters"". Well there are ones you can kill in one hit, ones that have helmets, ones that have body armor, ones with both, tall ones, ones that come out at night, ones that explode, ones in fireman suits, zombie deers, zombie emus, and a big old boss thing. At first the ones that came out at night were a challenge but then, boomerang one hit kill. The ones with both pieces of armor are just annoying, takes two head shots to kill them, one to knock off the helmet and one to kill 'em. And when they're coming at you in a pack, it's just easier to run off and come back later. The firemen, hint hint, head shots, lots and lots of head shots unless you got yourself a means of using electricity. The deers just run at you, shoot twice, dodge, rinse and repeat. The boss thing is just like a very very weekend version of the Tank from L4D. They just seemed like distractions from the endless fetch quests.Oh yeah side quests are, you guessed it, fetch quests. -_-The camera angle is lovely, seeing the exploders just as they enter their area of effect is just dandy.The lock on and head-shot system is good too, when your backing away from a group with your trusty boomerang out and it's just about to go red and another zombie bumps your target out of your aim and you gotta start over again. This is especially annoying against the fully armored zombies. Great.The leveling system seems just, pointless, the most useful stuff is getting the upgrades that slow down your hunger, thirst and drowsiness. Everything else seems just like fluff to me.The most fun I had in the game was going off doing the missions for the scientists on the islands where I was super-under prepared, there was a challenge, and it was ridiculous. Experiments that could change the magnetic fields surrounding the islands? Sounds good enough to me!Is this game worth the price tag, maybe in co-op. Maybe. However would I play though those opening missions again? Hell no.			"

												Well i really enjoyed this game and have just finished it,all the time i have added up is actual in game time and i enjoyed every moment of this well made and entertaining game.Ok you start by picking a character so i choose ABBY (thought she would be faster and have more stamina) and of you go,the graphic's in game are good and the ZOMBIE'S (if thats what they are) come in variou's form's from you standard walk and run and chase (and they really do leg it after you) to other varietie's thet i will let you discover for yourself (allway's best to find thing's out for yourself so no spoiler's here),i will say this there are about 6-7 different type's and i wish there had been more.The music in game is good and you really do know when something is coming as the tone change's and then LOOK OUT as its usually something you havent seen before.How to Survive Launch Trailer - YouTube

The script is really well written and my most memorable character is KOVAC,he has been stuck on the island (island's i should say) for some time now and his ""HOW TO SURVIVE GUIDE"" is probablly the funniest thing in the game and the animation that goes with it had me laughing out loud a few time's.Now dont get me wrong the game isnt a ""comedy survival game"" at certain points its more ""survival horror"" as in you have to manage resource's and keep an eye on what you have but KOVAC'S ranting's add a real comedy overtone at certain point's in the game (usually when you find one of the aforementioned ""how to survive"" pages from his book)As the game progress'es you come across path's that are blocked and shed's that wont give to your weapon or anything else you are carrying,but beleive me you can and do find a way to open up these inaccesible path's and in the process find new challenge's and new item's and quest's,and that has you going back to island's you thought you had finished to find out what secret's are there (even more so now with the new DLC for download which introduce's new island's,new character's,new weather condition's,new weapon's and to top it all of LAVA-hell yeah).How to Survive: El Diable Islands DLC Trailer - YouTube

			El Diablo Islands – brand new DLC for H2S Steam version - is now available! Don’t wait further to download it and venture on a new set of volcanic Islands: discover new fauna and characters, learn to...		

The quest's in game have you on the most part collecting thing's and either handing them in or combining them with other item's to make something else to hand in to the CHIMP who has the talking PARROT on his shoulder (why a CHIMP has a talking PARROT on his shoulder i have no idea),and this is my only complaint not enough variety in the quest's you receive (but overall this doesnt spoil the game).Now i said before about resource management and this play's a big part of the game as you hunt down supplies such as food and ammunition,but then that's where the other big part of survival comes in ""CRAFTING"".As you go round the islands (there are 4 of them) you collect various thing's from exotic plants to metal plates to harpoon gun peice's ECT,and these all come in handy when crafting new potion's and weapon's and also armour,the crafting system works well in this game with you finding pages of KOVAC'S book and then you go hunting down said part's to build that shiny new shotgun or peice of armour,sometime's i stumbled upon thing's myself by being in my inventory menu and clicking on a new item only to discover it could be combined with something else and something else to make me a new ""SPIKY HELMET"",but most of the time you find that you need the pages to discover some hard to make recipie's or hard to make gun.SEE MAKING SOME NEW GUNS AND POTIONS IS'NT EASY,EVEN KOVAC STRUGGLE'S!!!!!


""I can imagine that,your even finding it hard making new weapon's"" (CANT DO THEM IN THERE KOVAC) 
A Screenshot of How to Survive
By: The-Skull-Will-Conquer




Also in the game you get tired,hungry and thirsty so you need to sleep,eat and drink (DUH NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT),you purge your hunger by finding berries that are edible or after killing a boar ect and then you cook the meat and eat it,you stop your thirst by drinking from pool's of water which are scattered around the island's or by carrying water in a bottle ect.But when it come's to you being tired that's when the fun kicks in,now when you are tired you can find a plant that keeps it at bay (but they are not to easy to find) or you can find a safehouse,OK you might say but when you first find one the door is locked and the light inside is on red-you open the door and then the alarm goes of.Then the zombie's come in numbers,not huge at first but as you play and open up more safe house's the number's increase.Many a time i panic'd as the horde flooded in one by one getting bigger,but as you play and the horde gets bigger and more numerous so your gun's should get better and also your armour.And thats what the game is about getting better at surviving and dealing with what the game throws at you,trust me you wont get far on the basic weapon's and if you try to you will fall flat on your face with every attempt.So you hunt for the rarer items and get better at the game and then the game become's that little bit easier to play and more enjoyable for it (trust me even with some awesome gun's and armour there are still fight's you will struggle with).So i reccomend this game to anyone who likes a good challenge and wants to learn ""HOW TO SURVIVE"".(I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE CLIPS OF VIDEO'S PUT UP IN THIS REVIEW AND THEY BELONG TO THEIR RESPECTIVE OWNER'S AND ARE THEIR'S BY COPYRIGHT)			"

												Personal Rating: I'm having fun killing zombies and running for my lifeClassic Rating: ★★★★★Pros:✓ Story and characters (main game has 3 but you can add Nina with a DLC): You have to escape alive from some zombies' infested Islands. Every character has their onw skills, perks and final attack blows.✓ Gameplay: very well implemented twin stick shooter from a top-down perspective.✓ Crafting system: one of the best aspect of this game, you get many different ways to craft items, stuff and food.✓ Weapons: lots of weapons. My favourites are bow and boomerang - you can fire feathered and fire arrows with the bow, while the boomerang is very useful with a few enemies (it hits when coming back too and you don't waste ""bullets"").✓ Graphics: I find this game to be very detailed and aestetically pleasant.✓ Sound effects are a bit reapeating over the time but they help a lot to understand incoming enemies.Cons:✘ Lots of quests require you to go searching for some missing ""part"" and go back once you get it - I'm not really complaining though.✘ It's a bit hard to find items scattered on the ground if you don't walk over them (that's how a popup appears and tells you what you found).✘ Saves are a bit tricky because you only get one slot, so you have to be very careful - if you save in a bad moment you may compromise all the campaign. Also, you can only save manually inside bunkers, but this point adds up to the survival theme.Highly Recommended; sold quite often in massive discounts, just wait for the right moment.			"

												TL;DR  - This game is boring and repetitive, but a couple of the DLCs will make the game a lot more fun. The ""Kovac's Way"" DLC is a MUST HAVE! Without this, the base game is trash. If the difficulty is too hard for you, get ""Hello my name is... Nina."" DLC, her skills make the hardest difficulty more manageable. ""El Diablo Islands"" DLC will adds a lot more content if you liked the base game.DISCLAIMER: I bought all the DLCs, and all my playthru and review is based on my experience of having all the DLCs activated.WARNING when buying DLCs, the ""Heat Wave DLC - x 3 pack"" is the same as ""Heat Wave DLC - Kenji's pack"", ""Heat Wave DLC - Abby's pack"" and ""Heat Wave DLC - Jack's pack"" combined! DO NOT REPEAT PURCHASE!The game is quite interesting at first, but it gets boring and repetitive very soon. The game consists of fetch quests from start to finish. While fetching items, you got to take care of your other needs other than health.During the early game, you might need to spend some time gathering food and resources, but once you venture into 2nd island, food water and sleep are just things that take up some of your limited inventory space. And if you are playing solo, inventory space is VERY LIMITED! I play co-op with my friend, and yet we are still struggling on holding all the quest items and crafting ingredients.Crafting might seem complicated at first, but in fact there are only a handful of recipes to do.Playing co-op have their pros and cons.- Co-op have a very lousy camera. Both players share the same camera, therefore when both players wander too far away from each other, off-screen zombies become very dangerous.- The connection is quite crappy, it will de-sync every couple of minutes, ruining a lot of fun. Also, the desync will cause the joining player to take a lot of damage sometimes. - Quest rewards will only be given to the host player, so if the reward is a good gun, only one of you will get to use it.- Food and drinks must be shared.+ You have double the inventory slot.+ You have double the health, so when one is dead the other can try to survive and revive the dead player without having to reload checkpoint.The other game modes are a waste of time.If you collect 100% achievements, you will need these DLCs.Kovac's Way DLC Barricade! DLCOne Shot Escape DLC El Diablo Islands DLCYou will also need a lot of patience and luck.			"

												I picked this game up full price, from it's description it sounded like the type of zombie survival game I always wanted to play. Sadly it was a major disappointment, it's survival aspects in name only. All the elements are sort of there, the ""open"" map, ammo, limited inventory, food and water requirements and rpg stats, but their implementation is all wrong.  Few of them really matter, you get tons of ammo as drops, and managing water and food is pretty irrelevant, you quickly stack some items for that so that it's more of a petty maintenance than an aspect of survival.The so-called open map is really just swathes of map with small pathways cut into them, with just a few open spaces that are usually there just for the sake of variety it seems. The only ""Open"" element is that of course it isn't a linear game and you can run back and forth between areas and quick travel between maps, but it's not far enough from just mundane backtracking.The combat isn't too bad, it works for this type of game, if it wasn't for the overabundance of ammo and the overpowered weapons from the very start. Combat soon feels more like something you just do on the way and not much more enjoyable than running from place to place.The crafting is another annoyance if you need a particular item, you have a limited inventory, that's okay, you shouldn't be able to carry everything with you.. but then there is no storage area. It's already not fun to run around this island aimlessly, I don't want to have to run around looking for that one damn ingredient, usually for a quest (what else is there to do in this game?) Just a limited item storage for SOME things, I can decide what to get rid of later, but a few times I've already dropped something I needed to find again, much to my annoyance.The overall feel of playing this game was BOREDOM. I was falling asleep at my comp, I soon couldn't take it. It's not too relevant but the final straw was all the damn ""Krovac's Rules"" cutscenes. Think he's a neat quirky charcater? Wait till you have to endure overwrought, way too long, unskippable video tutorials with the same crappy music, for something that should be explained in 2-3 lines of text. Don't want to be mean, but it's kind of important to remember what a survival game is so we can actually get a good one. This just isn't it. It's very deceptive, because the gameplay it describes is far from the experience this game actually provides; a top down action game with bad map design and useless aspects that are little more than busy work, that drains the fun out of the concepts of crafting, exploring, or survival.

												An incredibly boring, unbalanced game, that fails to deliver anything meaningful.First, the crafting: This is the game's only true strength, but it's still lacking. There's only a handful of weapons and minor upgrades to them for you to create. A weak machine gun, an average machine gun, a strong machine gun. A rifle. A wooden bow, a metal bow, two upgrades to add onto them. Everything boils down to a couple of tiers of equipment that do the same thing.Second, balance: The difficulty curve is all over the place. At the start of the game, you will get mauled, guaranteed, by all the zombies. You'll only have a stick to defend yourself with, which is slow, weak and inefficient against the sheer number of zombies. Then you can finally get a ranged weapon and the game becomes yawn inducing, followed by the second island, where helmeted zombies might actually land a hit on you if there's several of them.Then you get to the third island and, despite further upgrading your bow AND gun, find that neither are all that effective against the zombies there. How ineffective are they? It takes two perfect head shots to take them down, assuming they don't have a helmet. They also come at you in droves and your movement is slowed by the swamp.Then you find the recipe for an upgraded boomerang. This weapon outperforms bows and guns quite easily, in terms of speed, damage and lack of ammo consumption. It's only weakness is that you have to wait for the weapon to come back before you can throw it again, but this didn't cause me problems at all. Between the long effective range, high damage and hitting twice, it's often able to take out multiple zombies per throw and the delay is actually pretty low.Third, the enemies: There is nothing remotely interesting about any of them. There's regular zombies, progressively faster and stronger zombies, fat (explosive) zombies, head crabs and giant zombies. Nothing new to report. Oh, and there's also zombie deer and what I believe are emus. The birds just zerg rush, so they're also boring. The deer attack by charging and can stun you, which makes them one of the more interesting enemies, if only because their speed means they'll actually hit you.Fourth, the plot and characters: The plot is bland. You're marooned on an island and have to survive. The characters are all varying degrees of insane and unlikable. I'd guess that the game was aiming to be parody, but it's just so unfunny and overall dull that I honestly can't tell if it's being sincere or not.Fifth, the quests: Every single one is a fetch quest. If it's not a fetch quest at first, it will become one soon enough. Also, get used to failure, because it's guaranteed. Unless it involves getting to another zombie infested island, you're not  actually accomplishing anything.And then there's the monkeys. With pet parrots. Who give optional fetch quests, because clearly we didn't have enough of them already, right? These are what make me wonder if the game is meant as parody, because they so clearly break the bleak mood of the game. Unfortunately, all they accomplish is changing my mood from apathy to annoyance. The squawking really gets old.Sixth, bugs and nitpicking: One bug I keep running into is that, after I took the skill that showed certain plants on the map, some of the plant icons would remain after harvesting while others wouldn't. A similar problem I kept running into with the skill to see animals on the map was sometimes the icons for them didn't show up, despite the deer being close enough for me to see its antlers.Also, there's a sound bug with the boomerang. Sometimes after throwing it, the sound continues even after it returns, which gets annoying very fast. Usually it happens when I open the inventory menu while it's still airborne, but sometimes it just happens.And one last, little annoyance, of no real significance: The voice acting doesn't match up with the dialog boxes, like they were using two different versions of the same script. The ideas are all the same, but the words are different.			"

												+ Crisp, minimalist UI+ Excellent tutorial; fun, interactive, and does a good job of displaying some of the charm of the title+ Voice-acting was of about average quality+ Minimap is functional and easy to read; objectives and points of interest are clearly marked and hard to miss+ Very detailed environment; the design and amount of inclusion is meticulous+ Foraging is wonderfully implemented; by doing away with bold POI markers in the overworld, you find yourself constantly searching for familiar leaves, shapes, etc.+ Except for a few small qualms I had with the crafting system (noted below), it is largely excellent; there are a refreshingly large variety of combinations+ You have the option to 'uncombine' items that you've crafted, thus freeing up the materials for re-use; this little quality of life feature is incredibly useful, and I feel that many crafting systems throughout the gaming world would have benefitted from it+ An appropriately moderate variety in creatures+ Some crafting recipes are only available for certain characters, thus increasing incentive to replay+ Exploration is both rewarding, and very much encouraged throughout the title+ The story did a suberb job of managing to not take itself too seriously, without falling into the classic pitfall of being cringey and annoying+ While the hunger and thirst meters fit well into the game, it was the fatigue meter that really stood out as a breath of fresh air; this added a bit more challenge and a greater feeling of urgency to the game+ Hunting was very fun and challenging; tracking wild game through a monster-infested island could be quite the rewarding challenge+ Nighttime operations were very well-handled, in that a setting sun very much puts you on edge if you're out in the open and far from a campfire+ Melee combat was solid and satisfying- Zombies are largely generic copies of only a handful of models- During daytime, inventory is slightly too transparent; this results in a fair bit of squinting, but wasn't an experience-killer- You cannot craft stacks of items- Aiming (I used mouse and keyboard), while for the most part excellently designed, could occasionally prove frustrating and unreliable; picking specific targets out of an oncoming horde (something you will NEED to do) is difficult when you're cursor is constantly jumping between several front-rank targets- Could have benefitted from a larger, more comprehensive skill treeLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												How to Survive... Hmmm. This game has much to be said. JOIN ME BELOW *swooooosh*PROS- Nice graphics (doesn't require a beast computer)- Cool finishing moves when killing zombies- Really nice crafting system (simple yet complex)- Good sounds (althought it could use some different zombie sounds)- Nice camera view (""in the sky"" view like league of legends, dota, etc.)- LOCAL MULTIPLAYER (me and my bro have played this since I've gotten it. Many fun memories made!)- Cool survival (has hunger, thirst, tiredness and health)- Amazing and challenging enemies (A GIANT CHARGER LIKE THING AND A FAT SANTA)- It actually has a story modeCONS- Add more characters (there are only 3 as of right now without DLC [5 with DLC])- More long range weapons (maybe add a crossbow or something like that)Those are literally all of the cons I could think of... I've sat here for at least 3 minutes thinking about what I've experienced so far.OTHER THOUGHTSI got this game for LITERALLY $1.49. Deal of the year if you ask me. I think it's worth $15 as long as you have controllers and friends to play with ya. - I love this game. It is a fun and unique game that makes many fun and enjoyable memories. WELL DONE, DEVS. JUST ADD MORE CHARACTERS AND KEEP THE UPDATES COMING!!JAKES RATING8.2/10APPPPRROOOOOVVVEEEDDDDThanks for reading my review!! It means a lot. If you found it helpful then let me know!!

												I tried to get into this game and like it, but the myriad of negatives overshadowed the few positives in the game. More often than not, I felt like I was fighting the clunky movement, mechanics and horribly designed UI more than I was the zombies. Not even the saving grace of co-op could make the horrid combat worth my time.I've been told once the game pacing picks up and you begin gearing up the game becomes more bearable, but I'm not one to slog through several hours of bad gameplay to do so.

												This game is actually very good, and I'll be buggered if I know why it wasn't more popular.  After all, neither the ""zombie"" or ""survival crafting"" genres seem in much threat of extinction at this very moment, but, well...maybe the sheer quantity of such gaming experiences is precisely WHY this one got lost in the shuffle.     Really quite the little undiscovered gem, which isn't to say it's a 100% frustration-free romp, but my complaints are relatively few and minor, namely:  It's a tad LONG for my tastes (then again, just about all games these days ARE, hahaha); the aiming mechanism is sometimes frustrating (especially with melee weapons, which it's hardly even necessary for); and the night-time sequences, while spooky at first, become increasingly tiresome once you realise all you really have to do is stand next to a camp-fire for ten minutes and you'll be home-and-hosed (though the temptation to wander away and get up some bonus XP is most definitely there, and usually just ended up getting me into needless trouble...but that's just the kinda eejit I am sometimes).   But on the whole, ♥♥♥♥ it, it's pretty darn fun, not without humour, and certainly not lacking in hearty bloodshed.  Best zombie game since those two that Valve did, that I'VE played at least (and I'll play just about anything with zombies in it, let's face it).  Definitely the BEST ZOMBIE GAME SET ON ONE OR MORE DESERTED ISLANDS to be released in recent years (not pointing any fingers at any infinitely better-known and infinitely LAZIER franchises with similar thematics which I could mention, of course)!  I'll definitely be playing it again sometime, and if that's not a recommendation, well I'll be a Coco's uncle (sorry, but you might have to play the game to get this little in-joke...go on, you know you wanna)...Verdict: 9/10.

												This game is fun, albeit short. It may be fun to play in a group, however i played it for the campaign and it only took me about 2 days to complete. If there was more to the game i would heartily recommend it, i still wouldnt give it a bad score, it just seems like it needs more content. Also there was some issues with throwing molotov cocktails in the game, the aim was really wonky and a few other bugs that were sort of annoying. With that being said though its not a terrible game, just not a truly amazing one. Im going to vote no on recommending this particular title because of the lack of content. The building your own weapons was an interesting component but it still wasnt enough to save the game imo.			"

												A neat little game, short but entertaining. Best thing about it is the easily accessible crafting system. Gather stuff that you find all over the islands and combine them to powerful items. Manage your character and limited inventory space, find water and food so you don't starve, find shelter to sleep when you are exhausted and protect yourself from the creatures on the island. Kill hordes of Zombies with your ever improving crafted weaponary and armor and find a way off the island.This game is not hardorce survival horror. More a top-down shooter.			"

Posted: July 9, 2015
-Quick Review-Atratzu's Rules: Chapter 1, this game is excellent.How to Survive is a zombie-survival game developed by EKO Software and released October 2013.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: As with any “zombie apocalypse story” there's only so much you can deviate from the status quo. You wake up after a shipwreck, find you're on an island with zombies, need to go do a number of fetch quests while all the wimps hide and you bring the carnage!Gameplay: This is where the game impressed me, but before I jump the gun and explain what I like... the controls are very basic, use mouse buttons to aim and fire/swing, ASDW to move, the game is played from the third person fixed above view camera.(Atratzu did some research and learned that this view is known as “Isometric view”. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that's the term you're supposed to use. Isometric-fixed-camera?)Now to explain the fun part, like most survival games these days, How to Survive has a “Crafting system”. I'm a sucker for crafting, I feel like it gives me one of the strongest sense of progression...But I'm also biased and desensitized to it (translation: if you don't like crafting, don't touch this game). You need to scavenge various materials to make weapons, tools, and food. There are different types of herbs, sticks, animals, various junk items that become useful later, and more.The other main feature I would like to point out is the “leveling system”, mostly everyone is familiar with this concept by now, in this game when you level, you get skill points that you can spend to get different perks and abilities.Achievements: How to Survive has a total of 43 achievements. There are four categories: 1) Completed while playing through the game on you first play through (about 7-12+ achievements, depends on how thorough you are when you play). 2) Complete these special abilities/conditions. 3) Difficulty related achievements... These are always the roughest achievements to get in the game because it requires Mastery and stubborn determination. 4) Lastly, there are DLC achievements so if you want to go for 100%, you'll need the DLC (about 6 achievements).Price: How to survive is priced at $14.99 This game will definitely earn it's value from gameplay, My personal preference is that I always want a game to last one hour for every dollar. If you'd like a better deal I recommend waiting for a steam sale; be it summer or winter.I also need to mention that I didn't actually buy this game, it was gifted to me by Eyriana (other names: “Decimaeya” and “Unreal”), so thank you for the gift!Conclusion: There is one more feature that should be mentioned before I wrap up my review; there is multiplier and local co-op, but I haven't played those modes yet. To quickly recap, the story was stereotypical, the gameplay was crafting + looting * Zombies, the Achievements are generally hard earned + DLC, and the price is fair because of how long you'll play the game.I recommend this game to anyone who likes the following genres: Zombie, Survival, Crafting.

												NOTE that for the record I use a Xbox 360 Controller for this game 100% of the time. There will also be a bullet point Pros/Cons review near the bottom of this.How to Survive is in my opinion a well done game to say the least. The game has a simple yet elegant combat system that I found satisfying, it takes patience to truly master zombie slaying as you must take time to zero in your aim for those rewarding headshots. This is better then many other games as it adds a touch of needed skill to it. The game also contains a decent variety of zombies to slaughter including some undead animals that prove to be quite scary when encountered. Many zombie types also require you to change up your strategy as a nice bonus, while you normal zombies can be dispatched with melee weapons, zombies such as Fatties require a ranged approach as they will otherwise blow up in your face upon death.      One issue I had here though was running zombies tend to get spastic when right on you and I found it hard to aim at them as they attacked while running circles around me. The island settings also do nicely, between varied terrain and well done lighting the game's presentation is both beautiful and terrifying. One of the game's strongest points is its well done crafting system, playing the game I constantly found myself wanting to find new items to combine to produce more deadly weapons and armor. This is further expanded by crafting and adding attachments such as scopes for homemade guns to decrease aim time or pulleys to give your bow more damage. Another nice mechanic the game has is a day and night cycle where at night an abundant number of more mutated and aggressive zombie type foe come out to play, what really sets this apart from other games is your ability to fight these off by simply staying in the light. With a campfire your safe and to travel you can simply grab a torch from the fire, however you will drop the torch to the ground if you need to use any other weapon, and while you can use a flashlight with a weapon it is a directional light, so if your not careful these creatures can come up from behind you and attack. The game also sports a decent Hunger/Thirst/Sleep system that adds just a little more spice to the difficulty, however if you acquire both skill perks to double these meters you'll find yourself rarely having to maintain them.        The game contains a few different character to play as each with different stats and available skills to acquire. A couple of which have a unique ability to craft a specific item only as them. As said the game does contain a leveling system in which each level grants a skill point of your choosing, however out of the 12 or so skills I had playing Jack I only found 4 or 5 of them to actually be worth something. While the story isn’t the best it was still rather entertaining and when taken the time to scavenge and keep yourself properly equipped the main story ran about 15 hours for me across 2 days of constant play. Now though the game lacks any sort of structure building mechanic the game does allow you to drop items anywhere and will never disappear which really came in handy as I tended to have a hording problem in this game. I have a friend that I got to also get the game and together we found the multiplayer gameplay just as fun, you can either to a simple challenge which is essentially an island with a single goal such as finding a plane to escape. You can Co-Op the story, this part was especially cool as while my friend was just starting his story I was well into mine and I retained both my stats and all the items on me allowing me to easily aid him in his story. All in all I'd say this game is worth trying especially for any fan of zombie and/or survival game, to those of you I'd say you wont be disappointed.So in a nutshell:Pros:-Satisfying combat system-Addictive crafting system-Well done setting-A decent story both in quality and length-Enemy variety-Day/Night cycle-Hunger/Thirst/Sleep systems-Level and skill progression-Multiple playable character-Rebindable Controls Cons:-Zombie AI can be a little wonky but rare-Camera style made some areas extremely difficult to navigate-Some what low variety of melee weapons-Controls for aiming seemed to be off at times (Xbox 360 Controller)One final note is that I found that getting information on more advanced stuff was hard, especially seeing how typing ""How to Survive..."" in an internet search engine usually found unwanted results.My finally score for this game as a long time zombie and survival game lover is a solid 8/10, while its of course not a AAA title it does very well with what it has and I find myself strangely addicted to continue playing and watching as my character started as a hopeless shipwreck survivor and evolved into the perfect survivalist.

												Disapointing Co-op. Console Influence shows with the 2 players stuck on the same screen which is really clunky and frustrating. The game gives you the impression of being full sandbox open world at first sight, but really you're stuck on relatively small Islands the whole time. The Islands themselves are quite cagey, mostly a succession of narrow spaces.Crafting is simplistic. Suriviving isn't really hard and playing story mode feels almost entirely linear. Lackluster option menu, especially as far as graphics are concerned.Wasted money and Waste of good potential. There are too much decent zombie games out there who do what this game tried to achieve, but better.			"

												I've played this game for six hours so far, for $3 its a great game. This game is a 3rd person shooter type of game, the only thing I felt the game lacked so far is that you can't pan the camera around your guy; this makes it a little hard to see how many zombies are going to come running after you next.The game has still been allot of fun to play through so far, I think I am probably about half way through the game at this point and I have not gotten bored of playing it yet. You start out with a stick as a weapon, then you find better weapons or craft better weapons by finding Bluprints to create them.I think they could have done it a little differently in terms of sending the player out to fetch things, so far there is this one guy who asks you to do all kinds of things and I just get this feeling that the guy is a lazy bum; who doesn't lift a finger to help you out in the least.They could have really improved that aspect of the game allot, the game is already pretty good; if they would have done something a little different with the quest line the game could have been exceptional.That plus the inability to pan around your character take something away from this game. Its still worth playing so far, more so than some of the games that are allot more polished and higher priced.			"

												Would recommend if it's on sale. Overall, I'd give the base game a 6/10, and the DLC 4/10. Later in the game, it starts to wear on you/become repetitive, but you just have to press on through. There's a bit of a learning curve for a lot of aspects, but once you get past the first island, things become a lot mroe clear. Pros:Nice storyline. I'm not generally a fan of zombie games, but it's a mix of nature survival and zombie survivalCrafting lets you do different things without being too in-depth (though pretty linear/few overlapping components)Plentiful ammo, so if you use it properly, no real need for time-consuming CQB once you get going in the gameWon't do any spoilers, but there are interesting twists and turnsThe ""Kovac's Tips"" are a nice way of doing in-game tutorials; informative but fun and creativeThe base game does a pretty good job of being clear about your goals, good map icons (though the DLC loses that in a lot of ways)Overal enjoyable to play, and keeps you drawn in for the base game (though for DLC, see above point)Cons:The camera angles... it's a fixed cam, or rather a series of fixed cams that semi-randomly rotate. No way to adjust your veiw. Sometimes enemies will be a few feet away, but you can't see them because of the camera angles.You need to stockpile all your ""dropped"" weapons in a couple centralized places, or you'll lose track of where stuff is - no system for keeping track of what you drop (no chests, storage system, or map to show where stuff is)After the main game, not a lot is explained well enough - have to google A LOT later in the gameLots of grinding later in the game, and though it says you're getting xp, it's essentially meaningless becaue of how the upgrades workIf you move offscreen, a horde of zombies could appear where you just were. Constantly clearing the map everywhere you go is a huge painZombies respawn way too fast. If you can back-and forth between islands (or even off-and-on screen sometimes), everything fully regenerates right awayNighttime combat: think Hyrule field from Ocarina of Time - no way to stop annoying pests popping up throughout the night, and from all around you. A bit of a pain to deal with throughout the entire gameCan't sleep through the night unless you're tired (at most, every-other day or every few). No way around nighttime combat			"

You are shipwrecked on an isolated island, a desperate castaway in a total freakshow world.How will you survive?Yes, how will you survive this mediocre ""action-survival"" game, a game which we've seen one too many times?How to Survive plays like a isometric action-survival game (think of Diablo mixed with some minor elements from Don't Starve). Basically you run around, collect stuff you find while you mow down zombies with the collected stuff you've crafter. Usually with a rusty machete, chainsaw, an axe, a boomerang or some makeshift gun which looks more like a vacuum cleaner than a deadly weapon.Let's just get it out of the way, the combat is extremely boring. It's boring, tedious and lackluster, and when you got thousands upon thousands of zombies chasing you then you'll get bored relatively fast. The developers also added a finish-move/take-down mechanic when the enemies health drops too low, but even that function is in most cased an hindrance for you to use.The difficulty is also laughable. On the games website it says:  ""Try the “Iron Man” difficulty for a demanding hardcore game experience. Calling the Iron Man difficulty a hardcore experience is an insult to people who crave hard games. I died a few times because of my own stupidity (I used the take-down move and it got me surrounded), but other than that the Iron Man mode is a walk in the park. I never had any problem finding ammo, food, water or shelter.There isn't a lot of ""surviving"" to do in this game, the crafting is tedious and the items you can craft are very limited. Craft yourself a triple bladed boomerang (with spikes) as soon as possible (on the second island) and you'll never want to use another weapon ever again.Ammo, food, water and shelter can be found everywhere, it basically becomes a chore to survive, and that chore isn't even remotely fun.The game also suffers from being ridden with bugs and is also terribly unoptimized. When you got an almost new computer with an i7 processor, 16gb ram and a 2gb memory card which has problems to render the water properly, then you know the developers were pretty lazy.I wouldn't recommend this game, not by a long shot. It's simply not worth your time or your money.			"

												Updated on 26.10.14I really don't know why the game How to Survive managed to get that low MC score.It's really beyond me...Let's get back to the game itself.The graphic is really cool .The terrain ,swapms ,trees ,wreckages and characters aredesign beautifuly ,and there is no one bad thing to be said about gameplay either.Everything works smoothly as it should.Even sounds and other special effects are created with precision and they sound...real!Two things that strike me while I was playing How to Survive was :Very interesting crafting system allowing you to craft almost anything by combinig items you have found or salvage from surroundings .Example :if you combine Rusty Helmet and bones you will get spiky helmet ,or combine a bottle of water and lemon and you will get quess what...? A lemonade!!!You may find car tires ,metal sticks ,or piece of hard rock and create some veryusefull stuff.There is another interesting aspect to your quest for survival I forgot to mention :some items such as raw meat or fish ,need to be cooked first ,otherwise you will get sick.The second thing that need to be mention here is guy named Kovac (such a character!!!)who appears here and there giving you best advices called ""Kovac's Rules"" to help you survive your mayhem .Kovac is smart and very funny in his simplistic way and he is superb additinon to How To Survive.So...maitain you health ,thirst ,hunger ,and tirenes .Create armor ,and weapon that will help you kill even the toughest Zombies .Develop your survival skills ,forage ,and hunt to get fresh meat .Do anything and everything to survive this excellent horror game .After months of absence...When I came back to H2S game I was really amazed of what the developers did to H2S...The game itself became even more interesting .You are able now to create more weapons ,find more stuff on the ground , and create better armour than before...H2S is more excting than before ...you got more achievements to  score and more receipies to discover...Love this game and it's latest update's .Love it!!!Dan.

												I tried to like it.. but I just can't. It doesn't looks/feels bad, but why do I feel taste of s..t  in mouth after playing this? Here is why:- UI is terrible, full controller support game, means: no hotkey for windows, some ugly ""scroll skill/use skill"" buttons. 90% of my deaths in game is because of panic and inability to switch weapon.- inventory is crap, if you have some number of stackable items and pickup any amoung over stack maximum - you will loose extra, no joke here, last update of this game was in 2014, so there is no hope for fixing. There are stupid limitations, like 6 molotov max (MAX! i can carry loads of items, but allowed only 6 molotovs!), bullets stacks in 500, arrows in 100, wooden stick in 10, etc. - camera... oh my.. What is the use of long range weapon with camera which looks from above on me and hiding anything of turn?? Approaching anything from north means it will charge before you see it.- targeting.. I want to see how the guy who innovate this targeting system plays the game, because I think he never bothers to do so. I crafted 100 explosive arrows to waste 90 of them trying to shoot barrikade.. it targets anything else, but not goddamit barikade which I have to go through to progress.- respawn.. while trying to create a ""base"" (to keep all unknown loot and valuables) I had so much pain.. moving half screen away and then back to find dozens of zombies coming from nowhere.. really?- farming.. oh yeah, crocodile quests. I killed like 100, but never seen claws or head and they are needed for quests. Same goes for deers. What are the chances to have their head dropped? 0.0001%?- map.. best names of locations ever: ""Isle of <insert some strange word here>"", I can't remember names nor pathes, map doesn't let me to see all islands, how I suppose to navigate all that crap?- night.. the fact is: it's not dangerous enough, but annoying as hell. It's bad to explore (you see bad), it's bad to travel (you may run into a pack of zombies, or worse), it's impossible to skip. The only way to ""sleep"" is to get tired, I can drink while at full thirst, but I am not able to sleep..- craft, best example of how to make crappy and annoying craft. constant inventory micromanagement. some items have ""undo"" option, some not, go loose your precious component while experimenting or click 100 times while crafting few items..- bugs: items dissappears when dropped (loose my chain component, never been able to make it again), overstacking inventory issue (described earlier), constant crashes (luckily on map loading)..I could easily finish it.. wait, I couldn't it. Can you? Don't think so.			"

												Don't let the low metascore fool you.  This game might not be the best zombie/crafting/survival game ever made, but it has a lot to offer when playing co-op.  Even if the game feels as though it could have been bigger.  The idea of keeping your character fed, hydrated, and rested while exploring zombie infested islands and crafting useful items from scraps is a fun idea that is implemented well with this game -- the world, items, and crafting options just seem a little lack luster.The survival aspects of the game, eating, drinking and resting, are presented simply.  Safe houses must be discovered and cleared out for the character to have a safe place to rest.  This part of the game works well.  The safe houses get progressively more difficult to clear, and they are spaced appropriately throughout the game.  It would have been nice if the islands were larger.  The player must search for wild edibles or hunt for food.  Foods can be cooked and combined, but a lot of the times there is little to no reason to do it.  While it's fun to make a dish a Fish 'n' Chips, there is no difference from that and just a cooked fish.  This part feels as though it could have used more work.  Maintaining good hydration is another survival aspect that is done simply and effectively.  Fresh water can be found around the island, and the player can store water in different containers.  These containers can be re-used for water again, or for storing other liquids.  Various fruits and items can be mixed with water to make ""mix drinks.""  This part of the survival felt as though it got more attention.  Every new drink that was discovered had different effects, and that led to more creative use of inventory space.The back packs are a tad small; however, if you are planning on playing co-op, which I highly recommend, the back pack size works extremely well.  It took extra coordination between my partner and me, but that added a lot to the co-op.The combat is solid and balanced.  What would be overwhelming at first, in time becomes just another brawl on the beach.  The learning curve fits well with the progression of the character.The story is nothing exceptional, but that's not why I played this game.  However, all of the npcs are voice acted which is a breath of fresh air.The asking price for this game feels right on.  It's a steal when it's on sale.

												How to survive – more like how to not get frustrated :D-Before a friend and I could even play the game we needed to restart the game 3 times and even during the game it would freeze and a restart was needed. For example talking to character made the whole game freeze so we didn’t try to talk to the character again :D- Another thing that really annoyed me was that you are not able to save the game in the Main Menu. You need to wait till you get to a checkpoint or something similar. If you die before the checkpoint…yep playing everything again. Frustrating.-The looting system in the coop mode is horrible. If one person picks an item up only one of the player has the weapon so on. Also if you get a reward, my friend and I had the problem that only he gets the rewards and I get nothing. And that at the beginning of the game. Frustrating. -Your character has 4 “needs”: Health, hunger, thirst and exhaustion. So you always need to make sure you have food and something to drink. But if you play as a pair it’s not easy to have always enough food for both. Having these needs gives the game a realistic touch but I found it frustrating :DBut even if the game is having some bugs and so on I had fun playing it.+The crafting system is nice and easy to understand.+I liked the bird's eye view of the game. It’s something different from what you normally play.+ The game is about Zombies. So yeah….fighting zombies is fun :D+The animations looked sometimes really weird but I still like them. For example the character has different “finisher moves”.If you don’t have high expectations the game can make a lot of fun,especially if you play the coop mode. And I think if the developers take they their time and erase those bugs the game will be even better :)  "

												This game could have been something special, but it is clear it was unfinished, rushed to release and then abandoned, so that work could be started with the sequel.  It is a shame when you consider the potential.  The gameplay starts out being fun, but quickly you are forced to notice a deliberate lack of polish.  The cut scenes look like something from a high school class.  Much of the game and the ""story"" felt uninspired.  The skill tree did not give meaningful choices.  You will notice more if you play the game yourself.  It's all the little things that add up and kill.The main issue for me was there were tons of bugs and desynchronization issues that soured enjoyment.  Some bugs include characters disappearing from the screen, permanently losing items and weapons that took a while to build, quest tracking issues forcing you to guess the way, and game pausing constantly for lag in the middle of battles.  It leaves you feeling frustrated because you cannot seem to go more than 5-10 minutes without encountering a bug, especially when they impede your progress for the umpteenth time that session.  There was a breaking point that I reached where I just got tired of dealing with it all and just decided to finish the game, forgoing the rest of the DLC and side quests.I will mention that I played this strictly coop and I wonder if part of the problem we experienced was due to lag from one of us being in Europe and the other in the US.  We have played tons of games together in the past and it is definitely not the norm for connection issues to be as bad as this game.With the game beaten I feel like I can say that I gave it a fair shot, but I do not recommend it.  I might increase the recommendation to a maybe if you would try it singleplayer or if your coop partner does not live over seas AND the price is around a buck or two.  But I cannot justify encouraging the devs, so I am not recommending the game and I am staying away from purchasing the sequel.			"

												Pros:+Interesting crafting system+Funny Dialog+Comical Tutorial+Local and online co-op+Nice, but simple looking top down graphics+Kovac (NPC)Cons:-Skill tree bland-Semi-Linear gameplay-Extremely limited inventoryYou have ship wrecked and when you awake you find yourself surrounded by zombies and you quickly pick up a stick and the carnage begins.How To Survive is a twin stick shooter of sorts with survival elements thrown into the mix.  The survival aspects in this are like you'd expect.  You will need to find and drink water, find shelter (and rid zombies of it) to sleep and kill the local wildlife to eat their meat so you don't starve to death.  You can even make fishing rods to fish as well.  There is a crafting system and it was somewhat unique and fun in my opinion.  You gather up resources you find throughout the island(s) and you can craft things like axes, bows, body armor, guns and explosive devices.  You will also be finding plants scattered about and you can combine them and make healing items.Herbalism ranges from making healing items, tonics for shields, better aiming and so forth.  For the most part all I ever used were the healing items.  Making shields and what not only lasted you 15-30 secs and it's gone.  There wasn't much threat throughout the game unless you neglected to upgrade your weapons.Threats on these islands range from your normal zombies to zombies in full tactical gear to giant Resident Evil Nemesis creatures.  Even the wildlife can turn and cause more problems than the zombies do.  Zombie deer?  You betcha!  If you happen to die you end up leaving a tombstone on the ground.  There's nothing for you to retrieve, but once your friends log in they can see where you've perished.  I saw plenty of people I recognize dead all over the place.There is a story throughout your adventure and your goal is to get off the island.  There are other people stranded which act as quest givers.  Quests are mostly just fetching items or off to see your next NPC that always comes with funny dialog.The DLC consists of challenge modes, the barricade mode and an extra story line that takes place on El Diablo Islands.  The challenge modes are just that.  Complete certain game functions without dying and nothing in your inventory.  Barricade mode is you build a base and keep the zombies out of the base to protect a wounded friend.  You run around and pick up wood and make ""barricades"".The base games story mode took me around 14 hours to beat and El Diablo Islands takes 3-4 more hours.  Max level is 15 and you can respec the skill tree 4 times.  The full game runs around $20 (including all DLC), but can often be picked up for $2 on sale.  Well worth it if the above seemed interesting to you.  Fans of this game asked the devs to make a 3rd person view and there is one availabe.  So, if you'd prefer to play this 3rd person over top down then check that one out instead.  It's the same game just different perspective.It's a great time and it was great fun.  Always looked forward to finding my next blue print so I could upgrade my gear.  Recommended!			"

												Game runs smoothly, I didn't encounter any bugs and after you're done with story mode (I obviously am not), you can try to play in local co-op, co-op and multiplayer. There are several modes included and hardcore difficulty will make you cry (even normal one has its tough moments). Incredibly deep crafting system makes you craft something completely useless and this is the first time I saw something like this in any kind of crafting games.How To Survive is an indie gem that looks cheap, feels cheap and plays lovely. Basically, this is one of those games you've dared to love before huge web portals and trend-fueled magazines told you it's not OK to love these kind of games because of I don't know what reason.I recomend to all my friends...so get it now and embrace the zombie survival :D hooooooooooo yeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaa			"

												How to Survive is one of the Best Survival games I have played so far [24/3/2015]. It is about surviving [Duh] and finding many ways to Escape off the Island/Place that you are at. You can either play online, offline [local co op] and co op with a friend [counted as online]. There are alot of weapons you can design and make, to fight your way through. There are zombies that are weak, boomers and Mutant Giant zombies that have like zillion health.You can meet survivors all across the map, and they are asking for your assistance.This is a very fun game, I recommend and really consider you to buy it.Rate: 10/10			"

												How To Survive is a very decent action game with pretty graphics and a nice, extensive crafting system. But after a few hours it's just that; pretty graphics and crafting, in addition to killing zombies. The killing feels satisfying by the way, but you basically go from one point to another, all across an island, doing basic quests. And if you're done on one island, it's on to the next one, which is basically the same as the previous one only bigger. If it were only more interesting. Giving the player more to do would've definitely helped this game out, especially since there's so much stuff to craft. In the end it's just ok-ish, but still worth a look.[Rating: 70/100]			"

												So, I played 3 hours of this.It is a nice game. I bought it in sale for 2.19 the whole pack which was worth 21.99.I think I got more then what I payed for. 2 first hours I discovered the game. Good mechanics. The fights are interresting. One of the best part for me is the ""crafting side"" and as I've not even been through more than two hours, I guess it is gonna be even better.The third hour, I decided to start again now that I understood the basics of the game. This hapens in most action/RPGI've only played solo. I gotta say, I'm playing on easiest difficulty and it is still somewhat difficult. The first boss killed me twice before I butchered him.I intend to play online, but for now, I'm pretty pleased with the games.To rectify, I payed 2.19 for this(Full content with DLC). I haven't even tried the two other game modes that comes with it (Challenge and Barricade, I believe)  For that price, I recommend it to anyone.For the full price, I would make no recommendation, still need to try it more.But if you like a good Hack'n'slash thrown more into survival/crafting than adventure/action, it may be for you.

""Greetings! If you are reading this you are probably afraid for your life. You will be lost and hungry, and, if you have not already, you will encounter the many zombies that live here. Please, stay positive!""Positive: - Kovac is funny.- Functional and intuitive crafting system. You can also uncraft and modify your weapons to your liking.- Controls are simple and respond well.- While the main story isn't particularly long or difficult, there are challenges to really test your skills.- Decent story. Somewhat unexpected twist at the end.Negative:- Navigating the inventory could be frustrating at times.- It's a shame that there isn't a storage box somewhere. Many times I carried items for far too long only to eventually throw them away.- The beginning is much harder than the end.- Once you craft decent ranged weapons the difficulty plunges.Conclusion:I enjoyed how to survive a lot more than I was expecting to. I recommend you play this game with someone else as it makes the whole experience more enjoyable. It's also nice to have double the inventory space (if you share items with your teammate that is). This game won't blow your mind, but it's a nice way to spend your time.			"

This game is entertaining, challenging and involving, while I play I am always wondering what will happen next and it is built in a way that it is not too easy but you rarely get stuck you flow greatly throughout the whole game, the plot is great and it's also quite humorous which is not something you normally have in most survival games. You can play on your own or with friends, although the multiplayer view can be sometimes frustrating it is always amusing to go through the story with friends by your side.

(Though once or twice will make you smile a bit)There are a lot worse games out there, but this game just really doesn't deliver on what it hints at in the trailers and previews.If you want it, do yourself a favor and pick it up on sale.(I also don't understand why it keeps popping up on the new releases list.)

												Very competent isometric zombie survival aRPG with a lot of depth and challenge. Its by no means perfect, for me the biggest issue was the excessive level of padding. For instance why cant I just use this one boat to travel to all the other islands and instead need to move to different locations throughout zombie infested islands to reach different boats in order to get to other islands? Padding that's why. Where HtS really shines though, is in the crafting department. There's a lot of stuff you can craft and improve as you discover new recipes books or just by experimenting with the stuff you have in your inventory. The combat system won't turn any heads around, but its not too shabby at all IMO, especially the ranged combat mechanic. Now, the lackluster skills tree and the clown mobile safe houses mechanic was a little weird and slightly detracted from the experience, but not by much. I'm definitely looking forward to completing the Story(which was surprisingly cool with a nice twist at the end) mode on the highest difficulty and playing some more coop(which is pretty sweet btw) with my buds.

												I started to play this game on a friend's recommendation, and I've decided that I should listen to the said friend's taste more in the future. I wouldn't go far enough to declare this game a gold find, but It is a decent time kill with a story. You pick one of the pre-created characters and open your eyes in an island that you have no memory of arriving. Then, the fun begins. Yes, How to Survive is a fun game, with a neat co-op option and some interesting DLCs. It is your basic zombie hunt/survival and some good time. The setting isn't actually creative, yet the crafting options are diverse. Me being a fan of the isometric camera really tips the balance on the game's favor. If you are into hack & slash rpgs, and 'Lost' crossing over 'Walking Dead' sounds interesting to you, you should buy this game. Oh, btw: there is a decent discount going on at the moment, so It will be a good time as any. Have fun!			"

												There is plenty of truth to what people are saying about the story mode / vanilla game being incredibly dry, fetch quest ridden, and poorly designed both from a character growth and survival mechanics standpoint; as well as the complaints about buggy online mode and the general lack of difficulty.*however*The Challenge and One Shot Escape modes are fair challenging and reasonably engaging, and imo make better use of the survival mechanics.My advice is not to get the vanilla game and to go for the DLC package when it's on sale and enjoy a some play time with a roomie or significant other (basically someone that you see every day that you can just like, casually pick up and play games with) and to not take the game too seriously.Must-play if you like quirky, stupid, and broken games. The ragdoll physic glitches will have you in stitches ~			"

												After so many hours of playing this game I can only recommend buying this when on sale or if you have some extra money you want to spend and have good friends on skype or teamspeak to play this with.It really is fun and all but some bugs can be pretty annoying for some people. Achievement bugs, two cursors, zombie bugs, item bugs etc. Look into the forums to see what I mean. But their are also a few game breaking bugs which make you restart (Sanchez Packages not stocking).Anyway I break it down to this Pros:- lovely mixture of survival, zombies and crafting- the koop is the best way to play this!- El Diablo, Barrikade are lovely additions to this game even tho I prefer El Diablo over the other because new island, new items, new extra storyline- different zombie types- lots of BOOOOM- looting and collecting while abusing the A Button... just give me all the stuff- crafting all kinds of different weapons and figuring out what does what- Bumerang <- best weapon ever followed by burning stick- different characters with different abilities and weaknesses- animals, plants the whole environment looks lovely but the fog is a pain in the butt- KOVAC! this ♥♥♥♥ing character has a lovely voice actor and beats everyone else. His guides and rules are also pretty fun.Cons:- The game contains some game breaking bugs which can't be fixed and need you to restart from the beginning. - bugs, funny bugs, helpfull bugs but yes some bugs like standing zombies, stillwalking when dead zombies, stuck zombies- some pretty much unbeatable achievements- weird target systemAs I said, if it wouldnt be fun I wouldnt have played it for almost 75hours by now. If you love killing thousands of zombies with axe, bow, gun or just a ♥♥♥♥ing stick, collecting items, solving quests, looting and crafting, you cant do anything wrong with this game.  "

												How to Survive plays like an isometric action game but with more emphasis on managing resources. The campaign strands you on an archipelago of zombie-infested islands, and you have to do quests for the other survivors to try to escape. Along the way you'll find tons of crafting materials to make weapons, armor, meals, tonics, and other goodies to help you survive. There's also a skill tree you progress through by leveling up and a full index of recipes to learn and rare flora & fauna to discover. The combat is solid if a bit floaty (kind of feels like Path of Exile if you could play it with a controller), and I especially like the ranged combat system. You aim with the right stick, and the longer you hold your aim steady, the more accurate it becomes until it becomes a headshot. Really makes fights against hordes tense as you struggle to make every shot count.The crafting system is very cool, with tons of options and things to discover, and also somewhat forgiving as it often lets you uncombine items if you don't like the results. However as some have said, the limited inventory REALLY works against the design. You won't really know what something is good for until you're able to combine it with something else, so naturally you want to hold on to one of everything. It's just like the crafting system in Teleglitch, actually... except here there's like 10x as many items to hoard, and just as little space. I imagine once you have some experience with the game it's easier to know what to keep and what to toss, but up to that point it can get frustrating.The story and writing are barely serviceable, but that seems a small consideration in a game like this. There's co-op and challenge modes if you tire of story mode, and each of the three playable characters (there's a 4th DLC character) is persistent across all modes. If inventory wasn't so limited I would be extremely pleased with this game, but as it stands it's worth the asking price.			"

												Quite nice and adorable game! Adds up some humour as well. Nothing extraordinary, just a game that follows the current fashion given by games such as Dead Island, Minecraft, Terraria and many more (survival, zombies, craft). Reminds Fallout. Helped me to relax and forget about my worries for a time. Would be fun to play after a whole day in an office.			"

												It seems this game was built of blocks or which is more appropriate to say - of patches like Dr. Frankenstein's monster: the general canvas of zombie, gameplay of isometric shooters like Alien Shooter, Alien Breed, Crimsonland etc., Lara Croft look of Abby and Tomb Raider styled menu, spiced it up with the Borderlands-ish Kovac. So it turned to be a very-very poorly made game with very-very cheap animations, bad controls, imbalanced weapons system (the best weapon in the game is a boomerang made of bones which can be made on the second isle (after 30 minutes of playing), not clear crafting system, not a breakthrough gameplay, pretty common story, a mash of re-used graphical solutions and an obvious lack of the art direction.All of the said above is usually requires more than an update, but a core functionality re-work, thus quite unlikely it to be fixed. I wouldn't recommend it for buying despite it's in a $5 bundle, also before buying I would suggest consulting the forums about the above mentioned points.			"

												I finished the single-player campaign for this about a week ago. How To Survive is a comedy action RPG where the player chooses one of four characters to play. Each character has different attributes and you weigh up their stamina, agility and strength. You're presented with an array of missions with the eventual goal of escaping a collection of islands filled with the undead. The format is very similar to Diablo or Path of Exile. There's also an online Co-Op mode.I played through with the agility character, Kenji which has a talent tree geared around marksmanship and hunting game. I usually opt for agility characters in games. I also played the game on normal difficulty, in retrospect I probably should have chosen hard as i found the game started to get a bit predictable and too easy toward the end.Managing inventory is key. Much like DayZ, your survivability depends on what food, materials and ammunition you carry around. You craft your own weapons out of parts found lying around the island and upgrade them as you find better equipment. Over time your character will become hungry, thirsty and tired. You need to food and water, but it's nowhere near as scarce as DayZ. My god:""I'm starving"" Starving? Again!? I Just fed you ya fat slob! It's the apocalypse for Christ's sake, no more Sizzler buffets for you.How To Survive has a lot of comedy in it. Kovac's character is pretty funny and the guides you find lying around the place are good for a laugh. The story is done pretty well too. Simple, but it has a good ending. The game is pretty forgiving on normal difficulty when it comes to hunger and thirst. You could get by without even carrying water, just drinking from wells when you find them. I'd recommend people familiar with top-down RPG's to start the game on Hard.If you want to flay these things, you're gonna want the Triple Sticks Cutting Boomerang. This thing is so OP. Just spamming it will kill anything that stumbles into your field of vision. Towards the end of the game it becomes a bit too easy with this weapon. That said, you can play the game on a harder difficulty which would offer more of a challenge.Would recommend How To Survive to anyone who enjoys the Diablo style, top-down-view, single character RPG's. A decent 8 to 10 hours of single-player game-play. Usually 15USD, I got it for 5 on those sweet sweet steam sales.			"

												A neat little game, short but entertaining. Best thing about it is the easily accessible crafting system. Gather stuff that you find all over the islands and combine them to powerful items. Manage your character and limited inventory space, find water and food so you don't starve, find shelter to sleep when you are exhausted and protect yourself from the creatures on the island. Kill hordes of Zombies with your ever improving crafted weaponary and armor and find a way off the island.This game is not hardorce survival horror. More a top-down shooter.			"

												I can't believe that this game has so many good reviews.Don't get me wrong, the concept is something between mediocre and good.Did I enjoy the game? Yes I did. 50% of the time. The other half is pure frustration.Bugs, some broken NPCs, weird and repetitive quests, bad designed menus and controls and so on and so on.Example for bugs (experienced in muliplayer):-after restarting the game there is a chance to lose random items (one of these items was a boomerang)-after resetting my skills I lost my passive skill, it's gone and can't see it in my skill tree anymore-second player sometimes can't see certain enemies-there is a NPC that repeats its dialog over and over again-you share one screen in coop - you can't see♥♥♥♥♥♥most of the time-there is a quest in which a NPC drops into the water and gets kidnapped afterwards - problem is: this particular NPC is already kidnapped even without triggering the quest and makes the story confusing. You can find the exact same NPC in two different locations at the same time.This game is released since !!2013!! What the heck did the dev's do? Patch the F****** game already!!Design flaws:Menu navigation and design is something between bad and -not good-. Everything that has to do with survival feels lame unnecessary. Like, I never took water with me. I don't see any reason to waste inventory space for water. If you really manage to get to 100% dehydration, you must have ignored the wells every few 100 meters. And even if you dehydrate completely, there is no real penalty. Also hunger has a rather small penalty.And by the way, it's way too easy to get food. Constantly respawning animals break the survival feeling.Animal respawns work like zombie respawns. Just a few steps in the wrong direction and all the animals and zombies are back, Sleeping is also very weird. You only can sleep as long you are under 50% sleep. If you're on 51%, the games gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥ You have to wait until you're tired enough.You drink water from you bottle -> you get your bottle back. (Seems about right)You produce a lemonade and drink it -> you'll also eat the glass. (???)You cook meat -> 100% Food and 25% Health restored. (Seems about right)You find a new recipe in which you add mushrooms to your meat -> 100% Food (What happened to the 25% Health? Idk. More items -> less effective.)TL;DRWeird arcade, non-survival game with too many bugs and design flaws.I don't get how this game could get such a high rating.If you can get this game for 1€/$1 it's kinda worth your money.Otherwise, don't think about buying it.

Crafting system is amazing.Islands are pretty,and each one of them is unique. Large amount of enemies.CONS:Inventory managment is extremly lame.Travel system is bad. Other in game characters will be totally ignored by zombies. There are a lot of incorrect subtitles.There are few bugs including combat system.Im giving 6.5/10 for this game. "

How to Survive has a little crafting in it, a little bit of RPG elements, and the story is entertaining.Crafting and scavanging while surviving as the only survivor of a shipwreck on an island crawling with not just the undead, but also other survivors and wild life is quite fun.You actually have to make sure you stay well fed and hydrated while also sleeping for a few hours every now and then, otherwise you will end up with little to no energy while fighting the zombies and that means less damage is dealt. Also, there are slightly more horrific zombies that only come out at night, but these are thankfully very sensitive to light so if you have a torch or flashlight, you will be able to keep them as far away from you as possible.Of course, you are able to craft your very own weapons and armor from the stuff you can find around the islands and these makeshift items will provide a much needed edge in your struggle to survive and maybe even escape these crazy islands.How to Survive is a good game and I highly recommend it.DISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

												The game as a whole is entertaining and for the price right now (1$) it's a steal. The combat, crafting, day and night cycles, random weather events, and random enemy spawns is awesome. My only gripe with this game is the fact that when you play COOP, only the Host gets to keep exp and items earned during said session, your ""guest"" you buddy would get diddly squat after the session. That is unless the other player syncs with the Host, problem with that by doing so it overwrites your local character save to match your host, what that means is if the host hasn't gotten far into the game you risk of losing items since the game matches you to it's host game. It's pretty weird how they handled the COOP portion of the game. Though that's my only negative it kinda is a big deal since i got this game with the sole purpose of playing with my friends.This is just a heads up to other buyers regarding COOP. I recommend this game but be aware of the limitations of the coop mode for this game.			"

												Buy it while its on sale. Its fun enough for awhile, but tends to drag on quiet a bit at the end. recipes are meaningless to collect as you can figure them out on your own. enemies are repetitive with not too much variety, there is only so much you can do with zombies after all. the animations for kovacs rules were fun, but you dont see them anymore after a certain point early in the game. most of the voice acting isnt great, ramon being the best example. personally, I think he sounds a bit like Brian Posehn. Overall, with little variaty in enemies and weapons or scenery, its not a game I would play again. though I did ""beat"" it. I say ""beat,"" actually a bug made it impossible to go any further during its finale rendering it unbeatable unless I started from the beginning. Its pretty short though, definetly not worth whats being charged for it. get it on sale.oh, also I had access to all of the DLC, even though I didnt buy the DLC and didnt even have the DLC in the list of DLC for the game, which was bizzare but ok. I guess.			"

												I was unsure about this game because of the mixed reviews but I bought it for under $4 during a sale and I'd say I got my moneys worth.The game felt pretty unique to me with the combat and crafting systems as well as the general environment and night/day cycle.  The graphics are reasonable, sound is good, gameplay is fun.  A certain degree of strategy is certainly required as there are different types of zombies and environmental challenges.You have to manage health/thirst/sleep which I love in a survival game.  There is also a day/night cycle and special enemies come out at night.The coop mode also shows promise but I have not yet tried it.WeaponsThere is some variety to the weapons you can craft (ranging from a simple bow to a compound bow with fire arrows to pistols to SMG's to assault rifles to shotguns to precision rifles) and they are satisfying to shoot enemies with.  I like how you have to 'focus' your shots to get headshots.  You can make molotovs and bombs too.Crafting/InventoryThe crafting system works, isn't too clunky but isn't extremely exciting either.  You're very limited as to how much you can carry but I've rarely found myself in need of something I didn't have (at least in regards to ammo/stims/food/water), it mostly just becomes tedious when you're trying to collect items for crafting.StoryThere's not much to the story but it loosely strings together a series of tasks that keep you going.AbilitiesThe level-up perks, or ability tree, or whatever you want to call it is kind of a waste - it will make your stats and abilities slightly better but nothing exciting.

Posted: February 1, 2014
												How To Survive is one of those games I've come across that while it is an overall average game I can safely say I'm not touching it anymore. The first time I heard about How To Survive it sounded like another survival game on a zombie apocalypse, with crafting elements, drinking, eating, cooking, hunting etc. After playing it I can safely say it's not exactly as it was advertised or as the videos seem to show you. How To Survive is an isometric shooter, pretty similar to the Alien Shooter and Zombie Shooter series, which in my opinion are very good ones, but with a slight different twist to it. Graphically I'd say the game is rather nice looking but nothing that will blow your mind and animation quality is somewhat rough and to be desirable. The sound assets are pretty poor in my honest opinion and the voice acting is something to laugh at but it does get the job done. Story wise the game has fairly little to it, you stranded on a series of islands and there you find that these islands are infested by zombies are other creatures, you also find various survivors and Kovac, a guy who helps you and gives you tutorials, which are present as chapters of his survival book and they teach you the basics of the game, Kovac is probably the only funny guy in the game because he has a russian/soviet accent. The game features a serious of basic mechanics such as fishing, crafting, hunger, thirst and tiredness. Fishing is best done at dawn and at sundown, as you might expect hunger and thirst are dealt with eating and drinking while tiredness is either dealt with by eating certian fruits or capturing certain safehouses, when you open the doors to these safehouses it will trigger a wave event of sorts, alot of zombies and creatures will come at you and after you've cleared the area you can enter the safehouse, close the door, and then you can save your game and sleep on some sort of bed that is laying on the ground. Now the crafting along with the inventory management system and the way it works is probably one of the things I was most disappointed by, your inventory is fairly limited in terms of space and that's to be expected from something that is similar to a survival game but the fact that you need to go to the menu and check each recipe individually and that you have to select an item and then you click combine and it will show you the items which you can combine that item with is rather frustrating to me because it won't tell you what you will get by combining those items together without you having to check the menu, I'm pretty sure they could've had putted something that indicated what would the outcome of that combination will be but whatever. Nonetheless in terms of actual crafting recipes it's actually very varied, you can combine harpoon grips with diving tanks and some other stuff in order to make a pressurized pistol, shotgun or submachine gun, the ammo for these guns are found in zombies bodies and I believe it's mainly metal scrap, shrapnel and screws, of course you can also craft various kind of armour such as combining a soldier helmet with a bone in order to make some sort of horned helmet or mixing plants in order to make various kind of potions such as shield potions, aim potions etc. Now the combat, the combat is probably the best thing from How To Survive, you usually have melee and ranged weapons and the melee weapons are pretty standard, machetes, stone axes or chainsaws, and you can charge your melee attack if you keep holding the attack button which will result in increased damage, ranged weapons are maybe the best way of fighting, there's various types of bows you can craft and when you kill someone with a arrow you can go to their body and get the arrow back so this is a very efficient way of taking out individual or small groups of enemies and you can also make incendiary arrows. The aiming system is fairly enjoyable actually, you basicly have one button for shooting/attacking and another one for aiming, by keeping the aiming button pressed a little circle will appear around the enemies head and the more you keep it pressed the little the circle will become and eventually it will become a red crosshair which means it will be an headshot which is the most effective way of taking down enemies the way I see it. However by the time you figure this out the game starts introducing you to zombies with soldier helmets which will require you to take their helmets off and only then taking them down and the same happens with zombies with kevlar vests which require you to charge your melee attack in order to chop their head off. In the end I didn't really enjoyed How To Survive but I can surely say that is a good game, even though it tries to get you in an emotional way at some times and it fails horribly, in my case it just wasn't what I was expecting it to be and so I ended up just abandoning my playthrough and I don't plan to go back and beat it. Overall I'd say that if this is what you're looking for you should grab it, if you're not sure yet I'd recommend waiting for a sale.			"

WAY TOO MANY enemies, in case nobody notice, this game called How 2 Survive, not How 2 Kill everything you see. it's more of a hassle rather than challenging to constantly meet enemies and kill them agan, bactrack also find more enemies, sigh. respawn are also a pain though, just when i kill all, they just suddenly here againsome might say  about it's already good as it is, it's better this way but not in my case (ive played 29 hour because i had to kill too many to count and i do bactrack alot).it's not hard, but really annoyingi did finish both campaign (main and DLC) with kovac way, and no3 is the worst continued by no 2			"

												I am getting this review out a bit early, but I'm doing this because you still have 16+ hours to get this game and bunch of its downloadable content for a mere 1,89 € (or you can get the base game for 1,39 €, but come on!).In my one hour long first session through the world of How To Survive, I've learned I have a great indie gem on my hands that combines isometric hack'n'slash RPG game with crafting and quasi free roaming.

												Its a good game, that manage to have a complex crafting in a not very complicated game. The story is its weakest point, it becomes a bit boring and the islands are quite small. It's more of a run back and forth type of game, still gameplay is satisfying and there is co-op. PS. There is a survival aspect, hunger/thirst/sleep that does not over complicate the game because its easy to keep the values on green in story mode. In some of the survival modes it can get much harder!			"

												The game is fun in single player, but in multiplayer it is impossible. It's only playable with 1 friend and the one who doesn't run the server is pretty much like a sidekick in an old RPG game. When receiving items from characters, only player 1 gets them. Then after that, player 2 gets player 1's old items which are inferior. I recommend you play this game in single player only. It's a load of fun.			"

												I bought this for $1.99 during the Christmas sell.  Figured, 2 bucks, what the hell.  Holy crap!!  It was so worth it!!!  I immediately was hooked and just had to keep going!  The crafting system is a little chaotic at first, but after a while its the whole reason to play... to see what kind of crazy crap you can put together.  And you get to kill endless zombies with all your maniacal contraptions!  Electricuting a zombie until their head explodes while walking through lava!  You won't do THAT in Resident Evil!  Definitely worth picking up.			"

												How to Survive can really call itself a zombie-survival game. Besides killing zombies it is important to eat, drink and sleep. You can collect plants, hunt animals or go fishing to get food (don`t forget to cook your stuff at a campfire first). Fresh water is only available at watering places and safehouses provide a safe place to sleep, but they have to be ""cleaned"" first. Nearly everything you find can be useful and combinded with other things. Not only all kinds of weapons, but also armour can be crafted. The main problem you will have during the game is that there is not enough space in your inventory to carry everything you find. The story itself is quite simple, washed ashore on an unknown island you play one out of four different characters, each having other skills, and try to escape from the island. To do so you have to explore different islands and learn how to survive. Apart from the storymode there are special challenges playable. What I liked most about the game is the possibility to craft lots of different useful things and the fact that you can play the storymode together with a friend!			"

												I am getting this review out a bit early, but I'm doing this because you still have 16+ hours to get this game and bunch of its downloadable content for a mere 1,89 € (or you can get the base game for 1,39 €, but come on!).In my one hour long first session through the world of How To Survive, I've learned I have a great indie gem on my hands that combines isometric hack'n'slash RPG game with crafting and quasi free roaming. You get regular zombies, but you also get a lot of mutants, so it keeps you ready for anything. Game runs smoothly, I didn't encounter any bugs and after you're done with story mode (I obviously am not), you can try to play in local co-op, co-op and multiplayer.

												A Reposted review from roughnecks that I thought matched my opinion.Personal Rating: I'm having fun killing zombies and running for my lifeClassic Rating: ★★★★★Pros:✓ Story and characters (main game has 3 but you can add Nina with a DLC): You have to escape alive from some zombies' infested Islands. Every character has their onw skills, perks and final attack blows.✓ Gameplay: very well implemented twin stick shooter from a top-down perspective.✓ Crafting system: one of the best aspect of this game, you get many different ways to craft items, stuff and food.✓ Weapons: lots of weapons. My favourites are bow and boomerang - you can fire feathered and fire arrows with the bow, while the boomerang is very useful with a few enemies (it hits when coming back too and you don't waste ""bullets"").✓ Graphics: I find this game to be very detailed and aestetically pleasant.✓ Sound effects are a bit reapeating over the time but they help a lot to understand incoming enemies.Cons:✘ Lots of quests require you to go searching for some missing ""part"" and go back once you get it - I'm not really complaining though.✘ It's a bit hard to find items scattered on the ground if you don't walk over them (that's how a popup appears and tells you what you found).✘ Saves are a bit tricky because you only get one slot, so you have to be very careful - if you save in a bad moment you may compromise all the campaign. Also, you can only save manually inside bunkers, but this point adds up to the survival theme.Highly Recommended; sold quite often in massive discounts, just wait for the right moment.			"

												Diablo 2 meets Fallout meets DayZ.The result is a fantastic coop experience!1) GameplayWell, it's rather classical. Using either a mouse + keyboard combination or a gamepad, you're hitting / slashing / shooting zombies. It works just fine with both, and you can switch to an axe with a simple press if you're getting swarmed with your bow. Obviously the game is an hack'n'slash with zombies so you can expect all its traditional elements: special zombies and bosses. How To Survive also features a neat craft system, so you can gather as much crap as possible in order to make the weapon of your dreams. One issue with that though, the inventory tends to be full most of the time since it's so small. As for the survival, you can hunt, gather plants or fruits, water, then cook it all before heading to bed.2) StoryYou're a survivor, so you meet other survivors who just happen to want the same thing as you: survive in order to escape the zombie outbreak. Though the game is rather humorous, guess we'd all turn out crazy if zombies started to invade the streets.3) GraphicsNothing much to say. The game looks nicey with ""realistic"" graphics, which somehow manages to feel refreshing. Hooray, no pixel shading!4) CoopIt's as good as the singleplayer: there are more enemies and they tend to hit harder since you're two. Yes. Two. That is a bit disappointing, but at least they did it right. Well, almost. Both players have to stay in the same ""screen"" in order to progress, so don't expect to finish a quest while your partner is farming xp.5) Conclusion: I picked it up for almost nothing and didn't actually expect the game to be that good, def one of the most pleasing hack'n'slash and coop game I tried. The survival elements and the crafting system tend to spice up the gameplay, which is just what the genre needed to last longer. I'd love it even more if the game was a little longer though... 8/10			"

												God I play a lot of zombie games... I wonder what the new ""zombie"" will be and how long it will take to get here? Oh well, I shouldn't let that get in the way of telling you about How to Survive! HtS is actually a very enjoyable little game, kind of like Zombie Driver, Alien Breed and Diablo II ran a train on Krater. I can't put my finger on it, but it really did feel like I had played HtS before, and to me that's a really good sign that a game is made properly (at least to my liking, anyway). I found it challenging, but not so much that I wanted to go Super Saiyan on my screen, and was genuinely interested by the plot twists and creative story. I found this surprising because HtS, at first glance, looks like your run-of-the-mill horde grinder, but upon closer inspection I found it to be much more.The crafting system is elaborate enough yet easy to understand, that it is not only enjoyable, but essential to the gameplay. The environments are colourful enought that you don't feel like you've been sating at ants scurrying across tea-stained paper for hours, though a little more variation like cave systems would have added a bit of contrast. Everything worked, no bugs, no pulling my hair out looking for fixes or walkthroughs, and the in-game tutorials on how things work were humorously done, adding an element of comedy that you don't often see in survival games.If you're beween AAA titles and you're looking for something casual to break it up a bit, How to Survive has to be one of the best little games I've played in a long time. Fun, interesting, satisfying.			"

												I really like the game, it's fun, beautiful graphics, the combat system is fast paced, the crafting system looks really good with endless possibilities and along with all that, Kovac's humor is very entertaining.If it feels like there is a ""but"" coming, to me there is.The game is great, has very well thought out elements, but it's a little more hack and slash, action game, than a survival or RPG.Has all the elements of a great RPG, skill tree, crafting, but, it always feels very linear.You have a story to follow and a path to follow and although you can go back to pick an extra herb or gather more resources, you feel you don't really need to since the game is progression in front of you and behind, is behind.The DLC available adds two game modes that feel a little more ""open end"", but, still feels like this could have been huge and falls just short of it with the constrains imposed by the design followed.Good fun though, and with co-op you can laugh with a friend while hacking through hordes of zombies, that die in countless ways.

I am sure you will get a lot of positive emotions while killing hundreds of zombies, crafting new weapons and stuff and performing the tasks. Of cause it's much better to play with friend because this game is just made for co-op. But there is also a big problem in this game - bad optimization for PC version :P Also it's rather weird that developers don't make chat.

												Not a bad game at all. Game starts off by leaving you stranded on an island with virtually nothing but your wits and clothes, and was quite an enjoyable experience for me. The talent system felt kind of lacking and pointless to me, however, and the game offers only up to about 15 hours of gameplay i'd say. After that it'll probably rot in your library un-touched. Combat is not too bad, controls are pretty solid, graphics are kinda nice, and the game is an ok pc-port, dis-regarding the fact that controller buttons still show up instead of keys. I would say to wait for a %50 sale+ since the game won't last you very long. If the storyline had been longer or had more things to do, i would consider buying it full price (I picked it up on a sale for $3)UPDATE: (10/3/14)Lately, a lot of other DLC have been added to the game which potentially boost the playtime of it to around, say, 20-30 hours depending on how fast you play. If you do plan on purchasing the DLC along with the game, go for the bundle (If you want the El Diablo Islands DLC you'll have to wait a bit before they add it to the package). Question is, do i recommend the purchase of the DLC? The answer, however, is totally dependent on how you feel about the game and whether you enjoyed it or not. I consider H2S a hidden gem on the steam market of the zombie/survival genre, and I would recommend the DLC if you have the money. Even without DLC, the game is completely playable and should still provide a fun experience. Basically, if you have your doubts about the DLC, don't buy them. If you liked the game, get the DLC. (Try and wait for a sale also, unless you just want the game that badly)TL;DRDLC add about an extra 10 hours to the game and I do recommend if you enjoyed the game, if you have mixed feelings then i don't recommend them.

I love the idea of crafting guns(there isn't much gun crafting choices though), hunting for supplies(plants for healing and materials), I hate that some materials don't respawn (but that's just makes it too easy rite?) but overall a really enjoyable game.PROS :-- Nice graphics- Very good enviroment- Crafting is nice- Zombies?- solid story- Enjoyable gameplayCONS :-- 1 page bag space- No chest or place to store items ( drop them on the floor at a safehouse is the only way )- Realli nt much gun crafting options with limited materials- music ( Don't expect any awesome soundtracks )- Can transfer items to different character (you will need to have a fren or play the 2 player option and keep switching between keyboard and mouse controls)			"

												This is a fun little game which might kill a few hours for anyone who is a fan of the zombie survival genre. The crafting system is a bit basic, but fun nonetheless, and the combat, while clunky at times, can be downright hilarious when you're making zombies explode by throwing around a boomerang you fashioned out of their own ribcages.

												Smooth Gameplay,Graphics are fine,Audio is decent,Crafting is quick, simple and all sorts of combinationsKovac's dialogues are funny and entertaining.The Story Mode isn't hard,One Shot Escape and Barricade in Kovac' Difficulty is nerve-wrecking,but great sense of achievement once succeed.Highly recommend using Nina, skilled in bow and fiery ammo.Only lacking I can think of is a Storage box, so do not have to arrange inventories on the ground.Had played the game before from another platform, and seeing the big sale on steam.Just had to buy it again in June16  to support.I Recommend.

												I really did enjoyed this! I don't care hypes only if it helps the atmosphere. This game looks good, sound good, and moreoverly plays good. Has some bugs and has an overall short story, but it's fun and that's what i search in game, not how detailed the shadows are, or how much leafs can be counted separately on trees.The game actually a shorted top-down version of Dead Island.A little tip to make a very strong weapon that can help through the whole game even at most boss fights. You need 3 bones, any sharp weapon and a flint stone. Use the sharp weapon on bones to make them into bone blades, combine them with theirselves, and lastly combine the result with the flint. The end is the strongest boomerang weapon, cheap and can be earn early.Tip 2: There are some recipes that are not in the survival guide, you have to figure those out by yourself.			"

												Solid game for the most part. I definitely enjoy the fact that you can co-op campaign, however there are some issues with the connection. Frame rates keep dropping and the game will just time out and reset your progress. Somewhat frustrating as the game is relatively difficult and when you grind over an hour without being able to lag over to a save point and the game times out, you kind of want to cry. Still, when it works, it's a brilliant game. 4 out of 5 from me.			"

Usually all islands in how to survive it is just corridors .Now i want say something about  quests : often in this game we will walk in the corridors from one NPS to another NPS  to help or do something our campaign will be  short therefore i think this game only for eight or ten hours then will be not so funny. Yet one minus it is small backpack if you want have a lot of things it will be not so easy because you don't can retain all things in your backpack . But nice graphics and  good gameplay with co-op make this game very interesting and funny .8\10			"

												Zombies here zombies there zombies everywhere!Kovac rules! This game is sinister and addictive. First you have only a wooden stick and your mission is simply to survive. You find different parts of guns and you can combine those to make unique killing machines. The most efficient guns are a bit too complicated to combine and you will lose important parts due to limited inventory. Sometimes it is frustrating to kill everlasting hordes of zombies just to get different part of island.  There is also some monkey business. It is worth to cater monkey’s needs you will get precious goods. But all in all, story is vividly sick and there are some twists. Iron man mode is challenging but not impossible. Challenges are welcomed variation and I recommend playing those after the story mode. And the infamous Angry Deer Helmet, you will get it eventually after finishing survival hobbyist achievement. How to survive is wonderful slice ´n´ dies game. Truly worth of $5 on the sale. "

												First of all wait for a sale otherwise its not worth the full price.Although it has a survival system(including thirst,hunger and tiredness)the game focuses much more on action and the leveling system is a joke.The game is good but could be great with some adjustments.It has some awesome moments but it lacks in simple things.The level of detail in graphics its pure awesome(dismemberments,blood etc) and the combat gameplay its not bad at all i just wish they had a free aiming system to make it more challenging.The crafting system is one of the best i have seen in any game however it lacks variety,and weapons dont give you a reason to use them once you craft the triple boomerang.It lacks a lot of balance and content(way too short story) and a tiny world to explore.If you are to survival genre i recommend it.Overall 7.5/10 it is a good game but could be better.

												I’ve wanted to get my hands on How to Survive since I first saw the game released on steam, and now that I’ve had my time with it I’m absolutely overjoyed to report that it was not a letdown!H2S is a twin-stick zombie crafting survival game in which you wake up on the shore of a lost island and must fight your way through the jungles to gather some survivors and escape. While it’s about as far from a unique game concept as one can get, How to Survive is finally a polished and competent entry into the genre. It’s far from a flawless game, but the voice acting is solid, the crafting has enough depth to last through the campaign, the game controls well with both mouse and controller and the visuals are very well done.If you’re looking for a good survival game to satiate your hunger, How to Survive will be very filling.

												Anytime during a game i am telling myself ""This could have been better if..."", or ""I wish they would have done this..."" its usually not good, which is rare for me. But H2S has so many good things, its in the vein of when i first played S.t.a.l.k.e.r.(one of my all time fav) or Dead Island(good game) there are too many systems going on for it all to come together to make it great. As an example, there are only a dozen or so enemies and they will spawn in exactly the same point every time, the level up system doesnt really make too much sense on why it is so limited in scope. I could make explosive arrows, but not ammo? I held onto some of the unique flowers never finding any use, etc. But god damn if i didnt have fun and that is what it is all about. I thought the story was actually pretty good meaning B movie quality good, and some of the side missions are ok but very rewarding. The game looks really good, comabt was solid, and the crafting is actually pretty smart. If you run through games and nit pick at every little thing i wouldnt recommend but if you enjoy exploring and doing quests its a worthy journey. "

												Grabbed this one for $3.75 during a Steam sale, and easily got my money's worth. It's a top down action game in the zombie genre combined with a bit of crafting. There's only about 10 hours of game play, and that's hitting all the side missions, but there's a certain charm to the game. There are several instructional videos in the game, and they remind me of Team Fortress 2 in their style. I don't think there's much variation in the characters and their play styles unless you force it. For example, I took Jack due to his melee skills, but found myself using the ""machine gun"" from the time I got it until the end. I suppose I could have gone melee all the way, but why would I do that when I have a perfectly good ranged weapon? I do have some qualms about the crafting system as you'll run out of space in your backpack and won't be sure what you need, and what you don't without researching things you can build in a menu accessed in the start menu, which is part of the main menu. That was confusing, and took me out of the game. If the game is based around the survival guide, I should be able to access it IN game. A minor complaint. Anyway, check out the video to see if the gameplay looks like something you'd enjoy, and if so, grab it next time it's on sale.			"

												How to survive… (and die a few 100 times), but that’s ok Kovac knows best!! This game is pure amaze ballz. I’m not into the Multiplayer zombie games were its PVE and PVP were I have to have annoying other players kill me off. This is a pure multiplayer (even though it’s just u and one friend) PVE survival shenanigans. Firstly, although the game may be fun as hell, and it is, I personally had a few bothersome problems that for me alas made the game a not 100% pure epic game; it still became a 98% pure epic game. Problem Uno was the inventory space and no chests in the safe houses. This is a personal opinion as I felt the inventory space (after upgrading it twice) still didn’t cut it for me, possibly I’m a crap survivor but was always frustrated in what to keep and kept chucking things and then having to look for them in each safe house that were thrown on the floor alone the way or in one pile. So a sort of Storage chest or more bags on us would have been nice. Problem duo I felt the Story mode was a bit too short I really wanted more and would have liked more quests and more of a longer story in general (even with the DLC as I have em all) I still wanted more to taste. Lastly and less moany the game is really fun all I’ve played so far was the Story mode, twice as well as collecting everything, so I really still have a lot to tap into this game. With the many DLCs that were cheaper with the game all together in the amazing sale there is still a massive amount of game 4 more different challenges that I still haven’t tried yet. The crafting in the game was just mind-blowing the amount of detail and simplicity they put to make crafting enjoyable as well as was so deep and rich that I simply couldn’t craft everything. The weapons are all mostly different and very fun in their own way (boomerangs are the best!!!) as well as the interesting ways of staying alive with cooking cool foods, drinking interesting drinks and making powerful potions to give u that slight boost in the most impossible situations. Oh and don’t forget the beautiful explosions and Molotov’s. Defiantly strongly recommend this game and will defiantly be getting How to survive 2!!! 10/10!!!!			"

												I picked this one up since it was on sale for £2.99. It had previously been on my wishlist, since it features local co-op. Not a bad little game from my first play with it. Isometric (Diablo-like) view, decent enough to look at and with a good sense of humor. Gameplay is a hybrid Action-RPG/Survival/Crafting type of game. There looks to be 4 main islands in the game, which you can hop between when you fix boats etc. and explore. It has a hunger, thirst and fatigue system that works all together with the crafting. Crafting in this is actually quite good. I have made myself a handmade gun that shoots scrap metal (think Flak-Cannon) out of various materials I found. I also crafted a bow and arrows, and even some ""fish and chips"". Ehem. Like I said, this is a humorous game. As soon as you hear one of the fellow survivor ""Kovac"" reciting his ""Survival Manual"", you will know what you are in for. Similarly to 7 Days to Die, night time is a difficult time to be out and about wondering without sufficient supplies, since you get a new type of fast zombie at night, that can rip you to shreds in an instant. Campfires, torches and flashlights work quite well against these guys though, so as long as you have one, you are okay. So, it's nothing special, but I bought it mainly for local co-op anyway, for which I foresee it being good fun. For the price I paid, it is well worth it. Jimbo Rating: 6/10			"

I thought it was just a meh game, but it's not. It's actually very good.this game is kinda like diablo 2 with zombie as it's theme. you are a survivor that cast away in remote island and trying to find a help and keep survivepro:- cheap- a lot of customization- great scavenging element in zombie survivor game- great music, environtment and  kovak's unique video tutorial :)con:- repetitive- npc meet zombie, and zombie ignores them like they are statue.. - text for island is hard to read :( I know it's minor thing but for a guy who is bad in sense of direction like me it's confusing if you don't know the where you stand now- there should be a button to display item scattering on the ground like diablo has- silly quest.. why do we have to get parcel. it's zombie apocalpse , we don't have time for that :(there is santa zombie that will explode when you shoot it. I'm not sure if it's like that. I played it during winter. it's highy recommended!			"

You can choose one of four characters to play with, each character with different skills and a nice Co-Op as well.I didn't like the inability to pan around your character, but hey, you will survive without it, no worries. Its still worth playing so far and it's a lot of fun. Addicting, amusing side quests, cool graphics, a nice crafting system, decent skills tree and a fun story / Lost like.

It's good RPG survival game with huge world to discover. There are 3 kinds of game: story mode, challenge and kovac's rules, (or something like that) but with DLC only. I recommend it to all survival fans and to people, that like having fun with their friends (You can play co-op up with 1 friend)P.S. If You want to win story mode easily, just make   boomerang and upgrade it :)			"

												It's a small survival game that is ment to be played with your friend. You can craft, hunt, sleep, drink, store water, cook , day/night cycle... and so on. Online co-op is just released and there are still bugs wich I hope will be fixed. You have 2 modes on 4 islands wich is a decent content  for this price range. To have a realy good time it must be played with your friends on team speak because only the host gets the rewords and you need to plan things over. Over all I would give the game 80 points. This is not a DI  or DayZ but for this money you can have so much fun.			"

												Buy it when it's 3.74, its well worth it.  Excellent crafting system for a game focused around killing zombies and a great skill tree as well but its not as diverse as i would like it to be.  Overall great game for 3 dollars 8/10			"

												Lovers and enthusiats of survival apocalyptic games will spend hours playing this one.The story might be not interesting but the ending is evil as you wouldn't imagine. The gameplay is easy and the content DLC are challenging. So in resume the whole game is great, no matter what will cost you, this game is all worth it.			"

												This is a very generic and low budget zombie survival game. The only unique mechanic that sets it apart is the ability to disassemble created items to their basic parts. It does not work on certain items, particularly advanced armor. The rest of the game is low quality top down zombie shooting. Your field of view is very narrow so there is no sniping. The camera is also a fixed viewing angle which causes too many problems both from a player standpoint and a game design standpoint. However this is all moot because the actual playable area is very small. There are several islands which are all designed in basically the same way. Here is an example of some of the level design: Talk to NPC. NPC gives mission to find X item on Y island. Follow a winding path that features many areas to fall down or access previous areas of the level but only features one way forward. See barricade that is indestructible regardless of total damage done to it. Find a ""safe"" house. Open door of ""safe"" house and have a swarm of zombies attack on the area is clear of zombies. See campfire near safe house. Take route to find location near final destination. See another indescribable barricade. Visit objective. The indictable barricades can eventually be destroyed but only very late into the game. They basically serve as walls until destroyed and then they become massive shortcuts. The survival aspect is pitiful. You have four status bars to keep track of: Health, Hunger, Thirst, and Tiredness. They are easily taken care of and really only serve as a nuisance to take up backpack space. Uncooked meals kill you. Cook meals increase the hunger bar's fullness and occasionally heal a small amount. They never go bad and there are only two basic ingredients that are edible, raw meat which comes from any animal and special white plant which is found in various locations. It is possible to carry water but there are so many sources of water (expect rain) you'll never have to worry about it. Combat is heavily biased towards guns. There are almost no melee recipes but there are gun recipes. Ammo is abundant and all guns use the same ammo. Bows are basically handguns and every gun is a fully automatic that at worst rapidly pumps ammo but is lethal at close range. The greatest gun I could create at ""high"" for every state, including accuracy, so I could actually aim at enemies off screen and kill in one hit. But really the best weapon of all is the tri-blade boomerang with spikes. Take a melee blade and combine it with a bone. Now you have a sharpened bone. Combine two sharpened bones. Then combine a third. Then combine a piece of flint. You can add the flint with just two bone blades.This is basically the best weapon you can have. It hits multiple zombies, it is incredibly fast, and best of all it doesn't require blueprints.Which leads to the biggest failure of this game. The crafting system isn't based on experimentation and it has a terrible UI. For the UI you click on an item, see if the combine item is there, click combine and see if you have another item that can be combined with. But you need recipes for many of the items in order to make them. Most of the time you can't just combine two random items and see what happens. During the first bits of the game yes you can and the amazing tri-blade boomerang can be made at this stage but later in the game you'll simply be finding recipes for items that you could have made with ingredients you found hours ago that were useless. Also the crafting is additionally resctricted by a player's level and unlocked skills. So even though you'll unlock the recipe for fire arrows pretty quickly unless you spend the point to make them you won't be able to. Luckily you can at least use items that you haven't unlocked a skill or blueprint for. Just don't uncombine it.The skill tree is a joke. The player characters have slightly different stats but it doesn't matter. Even though I choose the character with the lowest stamina and accuracy I was easily able to shoot or run away. I died a few times but mostly boss deaths or zombie-animal attacks which who will charge you rapidly and suicidally. The only part of the game that I was impressed with was the standoff in the mist. Rain is occasionally used as a weather effect  but only during a final stand is an effect used to really change up gameplay. The mist moves which creates a realistic affect of obscuring sight and requiring character reaction. The massive amount of hidden zombies actually creates a sense of panic. Unfortunately one exciting part of a game is not enough to redeem it. The quirky survival manual voice overs are really the only positive thing I've taken away from this game.			"

												I was originally quite interested in this game until I saw the low Metacritic score, which I am EXTREMELY glad I overlooked, because this is now one of my favourite games. I just wish I had ignored the low score earlier. METACRITIC IS WRONG.I am seriously amazed that the Metacritic score is currently sitting at 60%, I would definitely put this game at a 90+%.Basically I was looking for a game that I could play Local Co-Op with my girfriend, and this game does not disappoint, her and I love it. She is not an avid gamer either and it is not easy to get her into a game.I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone looking for a great Local Co-Op experience.As you can probably see from this review, I don't typically do this, but I felt compelled to give this game the respect it deserves. IT IS AWESOME. I want to write more, but it's late and I have to go play How to Survive instead of studying for my exam tomorrow morning.So I guess the main issue I have with this game is that it's ruining my grades at school and keeping me up until all hours of the morning.If you have somehow managed to read to this point, STOP WASTING TIME AND BUY THE FRIGGING GAME ALREADY.

												The crafting system wasn't nearly as deep as I'd hoped. The story didn't even seem important, or like it was even there. All I did for the two hours I played this game was run around playing errand boy, the kind of stuff that would simply be a side mission in a major title. Boss battles are boring, every time I ran into one it would get stuck on something and be an easy kill. The only good part of this game is I got it for literally pennies with money from selling trading cards, and partly due to a steam sale. If I'd spent a full $14.99 on this game I'd be very upset.

												The game itself is actually okay but it annoyed me enough to not recommend it.Reasons for this were:- Random bugs adding frustration. (I never did get the in-game video displaying, only sounds...)- Frustrating inventory system. (20 empty bottles takes up same space as 1 bottle with water in it. So if you have no more room in your inventory and you have 20 empty bottles and fill one up with water, you cannot carry it anymore.)- Santa clause zombies 'ho ho ho' what the. I hope that's just a joke for christmas because it is annoying and completely kills any attempt at immersion.- Sometimes crummy camera angles causing you not to be able to see what you're trying to attack.- Zombie Deer perma-stunned me. Looked like he was just standing there and I was standing up and hitting my head on his to fall back down again.			"

												I wanted to love this game but i simply could not. The graphics are nice at best and the game just feels generic. The entire game involves going from point A to point B slaying enemies along the way until you reach your objective then collect a Item or talk to a specific person. That is all you really do for the short campaign.The characters are also mostly forgettable,with little dialogue that actually matters.The cast is not anything special and it is a small cast to boot.The story is escape the Islands....thats it!!!! There is a twist or 2 but it comes to late to save this bore-festOverall:After a single playthru you will probably never touch this game again it tries to do so much but doesn't nail any of it with any great sucess.

												How to Survive, is a game that at first most likely, will underwhelm you. if like me, you are oh so sick, of zombie this and zombie that (the walking dead is an exception to my numbness to the undead genre all hail Rick!) but alas how to survive is, *gulp* a zombie game, but a zombie game, that has something... something that makes you..fee...l kinda fuzzy inside. and that something is heaps of charm, the fine folks at EKO Software have let their love of this game shine. this open world  hack em slash em  oh look an crafting game could have succumbed to the mindless body count by numbers, vapid characters and gore that is used, just so some kid on a MT dew binge can go cool! you will find none of this you will find in how to survive. characters are not, what this game wants to win you over with, they are not likeable have no personality and you do not care about them they are tools for you to explore, How to survive's atmosphere to play with the games crafting system that gives focus, to the characters health, rest ,hydration and the games playful ingenuity. How to survive or H2s if you are in the now, Lets you make up your mind in its crafting, want to make a gun? sure but do not get upset if it backfires why? well you made the thing stupid, How to survive will not hold your hand in your crafting endeavors, you will be told how to craft what makes this and that, but the games crafting combos are massive and can catch you off off guard, sometimes in wonderful ways( its something you just need to find out first hand honest. all I can say is that I have a new found respct for STICKS!) you will collect pages, as your journey unfolds pages from one of the most likeable NPC'S in a game (my opinion) the questionable and charismatic kovac AKA the guide dude. a russian accented inventor/author/POSSIBLE CRAZY AS A 3AM TEAM FORTRESS 2 PLAYER WHO LIKES TO ASK PEOPLE HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT CATS IN HATS fella, who will  show you the ins and outs of the game and who will gloat in his Knowledge of the island and its offerings. like meat? good! but cook it first! or you will be sorry, thirsty? well thats nice but do not drink from the swamps! or you will.. oh you get the point. its the details to things like what will make you sick and what will see you to victory that set how to survive apart from its bloated zombie brethren,  its a game  that you need to think not just hack and slash and yes there is plenty of that as well but the zombie asskicking is a way for you dear player to level up and unlock abilities! abilities that let you set fires, aim better  and just flat out become a badass. OK now that I have typed all this really stuff about How to survive I do have a few,(but minor) gripes. the aiming can be touchy, the mouse is your aim in the form of an ever present yellow arrow/sometimes red aiming circle/ and is your firing ability. this can be an issue when faced with undead clusters or a animal who you wish to turn into food, while the standard W-S-A-D key layout is how you move the character, you will not aim and hit a target unless you hover right over it and this is a one at a time system, so get clicking like a mad man and or chick. lucky the badies drop, pritty quickly (rember to level up!) also the crafting layout is more or less a hey try this and see what happens, you pick what you want lets say grip(the first object needed for a gun) you will be given the options, in yellow highlighted app looking boxes what the grip will craft with. if you click by accident on something that you did not want( you know the eh♥♥♥♥♥♥I did not mean to do that moment) it will, craft with out a prompt, then you must uncraft and pick what you wanted in the first place. this can leave the player feeling annoyed and disracted from the quest that they are undertaking. but good news for you, overtime and practice the picky aiming and just so fireing mechanism get to be reflex like. How to survive is a game made from passion and the drive to, offer a new take on a beat to death genre, no this is not Left 4 dead and it is not way any means trying to be. no mindless running and gunning no vast amounts of weapons laying randomly about no sir and or mam. this is a game about finding things makeing things out of things useing your head to make things and showing you, yes you. that How to survive is the difrent kid on the block and seeks to prove that not only to you but to the field of gameing as well.

												Well what can i say about How To Survive,Its a zombie apocalypse kind of game that is done in a kind of top down third pesron view,ive only done over an hour at the minute of writing this review, so i am still new to it in that sense,the pro's to the game are that as far as i have got there is a very good crafting system in place, the enemies, ""zed's"", have some variety to them and to be honest some of them you are going to have to think to be able to kill or get away from them,the missions resolve around go here, fetch this, do that kind of play,similar to state of decay, in that you have other survivors that you can help, in return they might give you something or even a weapon,the graphics seem decent enough, they are not triple AAA title good, but for what the game is and does, they arer fairly polished in that regards,Anyways to cut a long story short,YES i would say go and buy it, Especially if it is in the sale as i did,That way you wont be dissapointed if you dont like it,me myself found it to be a refreshing change to DayZ SA that i am currently obseesing on,Overall i would give the game a Overall Score 8/10Thanks for reading my review,Hope it has helped in making you buy this gameGood LuckCheersmark117hP.S.The survival videos that you find and the kovac's way tip's are funny as hell,And well worth it for the laughs that you will get from watching them...

Posted: June 25, 2014
												This is a fun game, but there is a fairly annoying (and prevalent) technical problem that becomes apparent the moment you start playing: A 'tip' caption keeps popping up in the corner of the screen, over and over, repeating the same few tips no matter how many times you've seen them or acted out the suggested behaviours. As if that wasn't bad enough, there isn't even an option to disable in-game tips when browsing through the game's options menu.I have contacted the game's support team about the aforementioned problems, and they have shown no response whatsoever. I see that a new DLC pack recently came out for the game. The developers should focus on fixing their existing product before they attempt to augment it with commercial add-ons.I like How To Survive's gameplay, graphics, and sound. The game controls fine with a mouse and keyboard, but the hints that pop up over and over (and over...) - which cover extremely elementary controls (i.e. How to move, how to attack) - make it clear that this game was designed primarily for consoles. Those hints also suggest that refinements that EKO Software had in mind when porting this game to the PC were mere afterthoughts. Players are granted the option to adjust the game's resolution and to play in a windowed mode, but that's about is as far as PC refinements go.In conclusion, although I'm satisfied with the core of the game, the reason why I feel it deserves a negative review is because the game is marred by two basic problems (one of which is recurring, demonstrates a lack of playtesting, and detracts from my enjoyment of the game). If the developers ever correct these problems, I will recommend the game, but as of now, I would not condone buying it (or its DLC, or any other product developed by EKO Software) until the developers address the problems I brought to their attention. If you feel compelled to play this game in spite of the issues I covered, do yourself a favour and wait until it is on sale at a very discounted price. Your money would be better spent on acclaimed games by developers who respect their customers enough to address basic defects in their products.ADDENDUM: An update published since last time I played How To Survive enables players to disable in-game hints/tips if they so choose (Main Menu > Help & Options > Game > Tips). This update is a mixed blessing: One the one hand, it's great that I can disable in-game hints so I don't have to see the same messages repeat over and over and over, no matter how many times I have executed their suggested behaviours. On the other hand, it sucks that the problem of excessively redundant tips continues to plague the game.In essence, what the update enables players like myself to do is to bypass a glitch that the developers are too lazy to correct. For all I know, if I continue to play the game, I may miss out on an important tip (for once!) because EKO Software's reluctance to address the underlying problem makes it very inconvenient to play the game with tips enabled.I have also noticed that I am frequently required to download updates to this game, and the updates are often huge. The updates are clearly not addressing the game's core mechanics and options, so it would appear that everyone  who owns How To Survive is being forced to waste time and bandwidth downloading DLC data that can only be unlocked by purchasing DLC content.

												This game had a rough start with me. I bought it with the intent on doing co-op and it went horribly! First, I couldnt figure how to set P1/2 to mouse+kb or controller (turns out you cant, it detects a controller ONLY if its powered on before launching the game AND it wont let you assign who is using it - its given to P1). Once we finally got going, we were almost immediately frustrated with the loot and xp system, having only 1 person with a stick and only the person killing gets the xp! We left it there, as it seemed to be one thing after another done badly...I decided to give it another try myself at some point and I am glad that I did. While there are some issues, Ive enjoyed getting into the game (just finished the main story as of writing this).While this is a good game, it could so easily be a great game if a few changes were made. There is no storage (fair enough, its a survival game!), instead you need to drop things on the ground, they dont appear to despawn, the problem is, if you are playing with breaks between sessions, you probably wont remember where a certain component that you need was left and with limited inventory space and without knowing what items are really going to be useful or needed next, you often have to drop things. This could have easily been addressed by allowing notes to be added to the map, lets face it, if you're trying to be real about it and all that stood between you being able to craft a weap was some tubing, you would remember where you put it!! Since Im not in a life and death situation (irl!), rather sitting on a chair with a controller in my hand and this item was dropped in a game somewhere last week, it stands to reason I may not recall ^^ This ONE change would really lift this game.As for the co-op, it needs to be tweaked to reflect there are 2 people playing (as it is, you are left playing the very same game as the single player, loot/mob count/exp/everything). 4 Things that would have made for a far better experience for co-op1) A little more slack on the camera (even solo the odd time it gets rather close and pointed downward, with 2 people having to share an already unforgiving view space....)2) Shared xp, straight up split down the middle - always - for everyone - always.3) Minor adjustment of available starting loot. It takes from the experience when one person can do nothing, doesnt matter if its ""only"" for 5 mins or 20 mins, it just isnt fun and shouldnt be this way.4) A more forgiving hit box for your partner. Just swinging a stick I found it easier to hit my partner than the zombie! Even if it appeared on my screen I was pointing at the zombie and it was slightly closer, I either hit only my partner or both! Whether it was lag, or just crappy hit box.I could do a rant about the dlc decisions (some weather effects not included in base game :O!!), I wont say more! I got it nicely discounted and Ive gotten my moneys worth.			"

												I decided to reinstall this game when I saw that it was on sale for less than 2 dollars today.  I'm really glad I did, because this game is awesome.  Sure the graphics aren't great, and the fighting is a little bit clunky, but this is the best survival game out there that is actually finished.  In this game you are stranded on an island, and you have to craft a lot of items to survive.  You have to manage health, sleep, hunger, and thirst meters to stay alive.  The crafting system is really simple, but it works really well.  There are a whole bunch of different things to craft, and you can play differently depending on the items you craft.  There is no story.  Even though technically there are characters and dialogue, it's pretty terrible.  But that doesn't really matter when you are just taking it as a surival game.  In the story mode I mainly skipped the dialogue.  The exception to this rule is the survival guides you can pick up.  These guides help you to be better at the game, but they are hilarious!  Kovac who wrote the book narrates and is a really funny character.  The DLC in this game is mostly just cosmetic, but at a sale price it is worth getting.  There are different costumes for each character, and the ability to craft fire weapons.  These fire weapons come in really handy.  There are also a couple game modes to buy, and even a new map to play.  The DLC is really cheap when it is on sale, so there is no reason not to get it.  There is online co op and local co op for this game, so don't worry about that.  It's often best to play with a friend, but you really need to play together.  I don't think that there is in game chat or voice chat so you will need to play with someone you know using Skype or something because this is the type of game where it is a lot easier when you have a good teammate and good communication.  I've been playing a lot of games like DayZ, The Dead Linger, Rust, and others.  These are mostly great, but the biggest gripe I have is they aren't finished yet.  Even don't starve is adding a multiplayer mode that isn't quite finished.  This game is completely done, and has a lot of DLC.  So while DayZ and other survival games will probably end up being much better games, this one is really good now.  As far as survival games, this is the one I would recommend you get if you are waiting for updates on DayZ or rust.  Other then the story you can also play the challlenge modes.  These are fun because you start each level with nothing and then you have to find and craft everything.  You can change the difficulty if you have already beaten the game and it will still give a challenge.  These modes add a lot of replayability, and it is fun to just play a couple challenges with a friend when you are short on gaming time.  At 15 dollars, I could recommend this game to survival fans, but at a sale price of 2 or 3 bucks, this game can be fun for anyone.  The crafting system is fun, the game has a lot of content when you add the DLC, and with online co op there is a lot of replayability.			"

												Hmm. I have to play it more, but off the bat my initial feeling is: lackluster. Imagine Diablo, but instead of a high fantasy setting, the setting is ""Zombie Island."" It's not ""bad"" per se; it's just not unique. It's fun and it's easy to play. The combat is a bit unusual (in a good way), but again: not anything that really grabs me. I'll write more after I've played more.			"

												Definately worth picking up if you're a fan of zombie games and you're looking for something other than DayZ or Project Zomboid. While not really bringing much in the means of innovation. The game is a TON of fun. The crafting system is pretty damn in-depth. While the missions aren't exactly perfect, they're do-able. But that's not where the game shines. For me, roaming around the various islands, looking for new parts to salvage, food to hunt for and sleep to manage is the main enjoyment here. I play this game more for the survival aspect, making sure i'm topped on ammo, making sure i have enough food and water, then making sure i'm back at a safe house before dark, too avoid being chased by creatures that only appear at night. Not to mention they've recently implemented Online Story CO-OP. I haven't tested this, but I assume it'll be just as fun, if not better than the single player. There are challenge modes to play, I personally like 'Island of the Fatties' on 'Iron Man' difficulty, it's a hell of a lot of fun, and various other challenges which are also great fun!Soundtrack is star, some of the tracks used are just perfect for the settings they're used in. and the sounds of the guns and weapons actually sound like what you'd expect in real life. All in all, definately worth the £11.99 it's priced at, although I grabbed this for a deal of £3!  "

The inventory management feels right (tho it's hell for a packrat like me).There's quite a bit of humor, for such a bleak situation. I have LOLed quite a few times.It's a little cheesy, a little wonky, but the game is just fun to play :o)			"

The gameplay (as said by others) is short but a lot of fun! I will say 10/10 for this game. Loving it! The crafting system is great with lots of recipies to be found.

												It's a lot better than I thought it would be, just by looking at it without playing it at first. And that reason is probably good enough to tell you that if you're into these types of games that you will enjoy it. There's lots of stuff to collect, lots of weapons and armor to craft so you will always find yourself occupied in a good sense of the fashion. The zombie killing mechanics are quite entertaining. The sprint button, weapon charge and aiming system makes taking care of the zombies fun.And there's always something to do such as monitoring your Health, Hunger, Sleep and thirst meters, ensuring they are substantial at all times. Also, the quests eventually lead you to new locations. There's lots to explore, in a well designed and graphically detailed world with new Zombie type monsters lurking around every corner, confronting you with new challenges. Not to mention the skill tree which is unique to every character, you will find certain skills to benefit your party early on. The Co-op gameplay has a lot going for it, and when you're playing online there are tombstones scattered around the map indicating where players from the internet had their characters die in the game. Overall, I am enjoying the experience, and I can recommend it.			"

												I decided to reinstall this game when I saw that it was on sale for less than 2 dollars today.  I'm really glad I did, because this game is awesome.  Sure the graphics aren't great, and the fighting is a little bit clunky, but this is the best survival game out there that is actually finished.  In this game you are stranded on an island, and you have to craft a lot of items to survive.  You have to manage health, sleep, hunger, and thirst meters to stay alive.  The crafting system is really simple, but it works really well.  There are a whole bunch of different things to craft, and you can play differently depending on the items you craft.  There is no story.  Even though technically there are characters and dialogue, it's pretty terrible.  But that doesn't really matter when you are just taking it as a surival game.  In the story mode I mainly skipped the dialogue.  The exception to this rule is the survival guides you can pick up.  These guides help you to be better at the game, but they are hilarious!  Kovac who wrote the book narrates and is a really funny character.  The DLC in this game is mostly just cosmetic, but at a sale price it is worth getting.  There are different costumes for each character, and the ability to craft fire weapons.  These fire weapons come in really handy.  There are also a couple game modes to buy, and even a new map to play.  The DLC is really cheap when it is on sale, so there is no reason not to get it.  There is online co op and local co op for this game, so don't worry about that.  It's often best to play with a friend, but you really need to play together.  I don't think that there is in game chat or voice chat so you will need to play with someone you know using Skype or something because this is the type of game where it is a lot easier when you have a good teammate and good communication.  I've been playing a lot of games like DayZ, The Dead Linger, Rust, and others.  These are mostly great, but the biggest gripe I have is they aren't finished yet.  Even don't starve is adding a multiplayer mode that isn't quite finished.  This game is completely done, and has a lot of DLC.  So while DayZ and other survival games will probably end up being much better games, this one is really good now.  As far as survival games, this is the one I would recommend you get if you are waiting for updates on DayZ or rust.  Other then the story you can also play the challlenge modes.  These are fun because you start each level with nothing and then you have to find and craft everything.  You can change the difficulty if you have already beaten the game and it will still give a challenge.  These modes add a lot of replayability, and it is fun to just play a couple challenges with a friend when you are short on gaming time.  At 15 dollars, I could recommend this game to survival fans, but at a sale price of 2 or 3 bucks, this game can be fun for anyone.  The crafting system is fun, the game has a lot of content when you add the DLC, and with online co op there is a lot of replayability.			"

												Overall, a very enjoyable game.It has the realistic elements of survival which most games take for granted (Hydration, Hunger etc). The Crafting section of the game is fairly easy to use and gives the player a good variety of makeshift weapons to play around with. However, the controls are quite flawed when playing with a mouse and keyboard as scenery tends to get in the way of the cursor, causing the character to spin around at the least oppurtune moment, leaving you vulnerable to some fairly rageworthy moments.Also... Zombie Deer are not fun... they are mean :'(			"

												Sometimes you find a game with a certain charm that simply brings a smile to your face with all of its various absurdities. Other times the game is really just that bad. How To Survive is a love it or hate it kind of game that combines a Diablo 2-esque interface with zombies as the primary enemies and a survival aspect. I've personally enjoyed the 'idea' of a survival game but, unless it adds real pressure on the player, generally the concept comes off as annoying. The 'Kovac's Way' DLC hopefully will add that sense of urgency with a more 'realistic' environment-- water in particular was simply never a concern during the base game.Weapon crafting in the game is interesting, allowing for a decent amount of combinations. The game attempts to emphasize how important bows and crossbows are (it makes sense, make your own ammunition, right?) but once you get the upgraded boomerang you'll be very hard-pressed to ever run out of ammo for any reason. I'm hoping that the deficiencies of both the survival and crafting aspects will be corrected in Kovac's Way.The Steam sale as I write this drops the price of the game down to less than $4; it's well worth the price for a few hours of crafting, burning, hacking, and Diablo'ing.

The largest problem was that after I finished the story mode I have not played it again.

Next thing i know its a few hours later and i am hooked. I was enjoying this game and any of the concerns i had in the first few minutes were gone. I knew the game would be short however as an average gamer who is not trying to speed run i found the game lasted the entire cold snowy weekend and i played a lot of it.My advice is if you want a fun title then pick this up and give it more than 5 minutes as it gets a lot better and more enjoyable. Glad i picked it up... LONG LIVE KOVAK!?!			"

												Easiest way to describe this game would be Dead Rising Island. In your attempts to survive, you explore various islands, killing various kinds of zombies (including zombie deer) and find items and recipes to make better armor or new weapons to kill the various kinds of zombies.It felt short, yet it seems like I've almost spent 40 hours on it, which including beating it on Normal and Ironman, as well as getting to level 21+ on the challenges.The Ironman difficulty seemed weirdly named, as even on Normal the game only has 1 autosave. The zombies basically just hit harder and drop less items.I managed to find a few people playing the coop, but the ones playing challenges without playing the main game are at a disadvantage because they don't know the recipes or have the levels/armor of a more experienced player.If you enjoy twinstick rpg/shooters, you will most likely enjoy this game.

I'm only a few hours in but so far its been pretty damn fun shooting, slashing, bashing, and burning zombies to death. Plus, I'm enjoying the survival aspects of the game where I always need to be aware of my hunger, thirst, and sleeping needs. I love crafting items and medicines from local plants and you can create a fishing pole and catch fish. You even need to hunt the wildlife in order to create new items.I bought the game on sale but I'd still recommend it at full price if you can't wait for another discount. Overall a pretty fun game.

The story mode does a really good job of teaching you the game without spoon feeding you the answers (KOVACS RULES), and the voice acting is hands down some of the best I've experienced.

												Quite fun, story is ok, character building and crafting gear good but when U find THE stones and use them on weapons (especially on triple boomerang)  it is over. U become meat grinder for zombie, and only final battle on higher difficulty become some challenge. But I just passed single mode and won't coming back for second run because when You already know the story it's just not entertaining enough.			"

												Fun but glitchyExplosive arrows still don't target barricades (The things you need explosive arrows to get rid of...). Targetting often swaps between enemies make it so you can't get a ""critical hit"", the bug list is sizeable and fixes are not coming. If you can stomach that it is a fine little game for the price point that has okay controller support and pretty fun multiplayer. Some of the DLC makes it more interesting. Short campaign otherwise and no randomization w/o DLC.			"

												There is no way to unrecommend a game, but this game has very few good features, and is overall, quite a weak game.Parts are extremely easy, and by parts, I mean everything. There is no survival challenge once you have selected the 3 skills to make your bars drain slowly, ammo isnt a problem with the boomerang, and enemies are predictable and slow. The ""night time"" is meant to have some kind of evil creature that is scared of the light, but the torch never drains so they are just free exp to my boomerang of 5 one shotting.I probably should talk about some of the good features, the characters are cool I guess.I think the best part of the game was trying to find places to sleep, these were spread decently, and alerted a large group of enemies when opened, which was fun, at first, until I just stepped inside and closed the door and dealt with what looked like, 100 zombies coming from a broom closet.Oh, the graphics are nice, apart from very repeating animations, the ""executions"" are nicely done, but always revert back to the stick, which forces me to change weapon again.Overall, I will give this game 3/10 for some nice graphics, and fun moments, but I would not recommend this to any one, unless you really, REALLY, love survival games.

												Picked this game up a while back and finally sat down to play it over a weekend and here are my thoughts:Starts off looking like a crappy little game... graphics, movement, sound, etc. I decided to give it a good shake and continued to play. Next thing i know its a few hours later and i am hooked. I was enjoying this game and any of the concerns i had in the first few minutes were gone. I knew the game would be short however as an average gamer who is not trying to speed run i found the game lasted the entire cold snowy weekend and i played a lot of it.My advice is if you want a fun title then pick this up and give it more than 5 minutes as it gets a lot better and more enjoyable. Glad i picked it up... LONG LIVE KOVAK!?!			"

												This game is excellent. It has a new element to the zombie genre, they take second stage to fighting your body. Especially in the Kovacs Road mode where wells do not refill until it rains, you can run out of power for your flashlight, and resources are scarce. You need water, food, and find a save place to sleep. Find it fast!!! The sun is going down..By the way, I'm on the first/second island chain and I'm in ecstatic frustration.Crafting is super fun. I experiment every time I find something new. ""Hmm I can put this on the helmet. Now it has spikes!""""Whoa I didn't know I could wrap this stick with cloth instead of just lighting the stick.""Weapon creation is even crazier. Try to combine stuff, everything. Tip in Kovac mode, try to eat fruit for water as a first line, and just fill containers with water. Or drink water and fill half with water and half with gasoline if you can. You really have to think ahead in that mode.			"

												In this game crafting is important, you don't find weapons anywhere and have to make weapons from objects you find, such as you make a bow with a flexible branch and reel.And as you progress you can make better weapons, armour and gold versions of weapons.As well as various other things like water flavoured with fruit and bubbles etc.So it makes it feel more like survival.I like how you can find books which have Kovacs rules which are rather amusing and give you sometimes useless or helpful tips on how to survive. Kovac is a rather interesting helpful character that is on the island to make the tutorial more interesting.And can find recipes around to help with crafting or you can try and figure it out yourself.You can play several characters each with different skill trees and exclusive weapons, so you can play different ways.Can save at the rest spots when you want once they are cleared. Which is handy.There doesn't seem to be very many quests and the islands you can explore are rather small and even though it's quite linear you can return to any islands you've previously been to as much as you want.Dislike that when people die all these gravestones with the persons name gets left everywhere like 50+ of them covering the islands even when it's someone not even on your friends list or someone you've never played the game with, I find it ugly and obtrusive and sometimes makes it hard to see things.I'd prefer if the game did not put them in or at least give the option to turn them off.The game causes a complete screen freeze lockup at least once a play sessions. Making it really annoying if you're trying a challange mode.When you open the map you can't interact with it in any way, and it does not list which island you are on with the map.And even when the pilot was no longer at his camp you could still hear a gulping sound like he was there drinking, it's the same with doctor miller, when she is no longer in the game you still hear her voice yelling out to watch out for zombies at the previous spots she was at.I find the game mostly fun and enjoyable, and rate it 6/10 better than average but not a game I'd class as good as it has annoying flaws. Still worth playing for a while. A game worth getting on special but not full price.			"

												A surprisingly satisfying blend of combat and crafting. The game does a good job of giving you crafting recipies fairly regularly, yet you are able to discover quite a few recipes  on your own. The pacing and difficulty curve seemed very good (I played on normal mode). Interesting story with semi entertaining characters and a few pretty good and well executed (if somewhat expected) plot twists.7/10 if you're not huge on crafting stuff8.5/10 if you are a craft fiend (like me)If you'd like to see how this game plays, here's my videos on steam: http://steamcommunity.com/id/morjax/videos/?appid=250400of my playlist on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMZD1JcBH-MLV06y8k4Nql2oyHkDc3uUQ "

												Despite all the Thumbs-down reviews about how bad this game is...it really IS NOT THAT BAD of a game. Considering I got the game on sale, it's a good time burner if nothing else. It's not a hack-and-slash or heavy shooter-esque game. It's mellow pace and you get to craft and combine items. Yes, once you've completed the game and gotten the top-tier weapons it bascially stops there and you can bascially just sandbox the entire time. But with the new things the devs are adding, it adds another degree of thinking into the game. I can go on and on, but my final word is just give it a try. No harm done.			"

												Overall, I must state I really like this game up to a point. Theres a stage- that alone, playing solo, is incredibly differcult to do. Thus, forcing you to play multiplayer. Considering most of my friends dont play this game it's very annoying.I love the simple backstory to the game, many say it's not in depth and boring. But its humourous- and entertaining. Makes up for it. If you enjoy a more in depth plot though- this is only worth it on sale then.But the main features about this game, well to me, is  the combat system I find it very enjoyable and interesting with all the different weapons you can make :) It's also classic type system in zombie games mainly melee until you mainly rely on guns.I do find the fact you have such limiting storing space a bit troublesome- as you have to decided what items are more important later on and if they're worth keeping. Like do you need all those arrows for the bow? Or just keep picking them up and reusing them etc.Other disadvantages include- the alkward camera angles at times. Falling off terrain when the screen lags into the water. etc.I enjoy this game a lot dispite these disadvantages, I find it very challenging but fun :)			"

Have a nice crafting sistem, making your own food, weapons, armor, etc Then you can overpower that with other combinations makin better armors or weapowns and making some ""elixirs"" to improve your aiming and things.It's fun. And have two levels of dificulty, challenges, three characters with skill trees... so... i'm on the first level of difficult and the thing are pretty serious... so i think the game offert a good amount of hours killing running and... fishing, sleeping, drinking and eating... And Remember allways follow the Kovac's Rules ;)			"

												First look: crappy diablo-zombie clone, with bugs, unintuitive interface and no graphic settings, though it's pretty much ok to buy it for less than a 1$.Second look with a X-box like controller: definetely better, the smoothness of kills and movements, i even spent an hour playing. Still i don't like Kovaks voice and user interface, and IMHO slightly high requirements for this game, and still it's not worth 10$. But now i definetely feel better for not waisting my 1$ :)			"

Ok, I'm done with it ..... To be honest- I hate writing negative Reviews; especially on games that seem to be rather popular like this one, also, I got it on summer sale for a mere 90cent.First, what's this game about?It's an isometric zombie hack and slasher game(literally, don't even think about being stealthy- that will not lead to success -.-) placed on different islands. Of course with some ""crafting"" just like all new games, although it's not really crafting. It's basically collecting items and clicking on them until stuff is created. (I won't go into detail about graphics as I really don't give a /&%/% about that- either you like it or not, right? Think graphics are ok)So what did freak me out on this game?Actually I really like the way this game is built up:It has a good sense of humour, different types of zombies and also of course some survival aspects such as the need to sleep, eat and drink. Anyway, as far as I remember, I chose medium difficulty and when I first ran out of food or water... I was freaked out to find some damn food! But when I finally reached point 0 on either of them... NOTHING happened. Is it good or bad? Well, actually it's good because finding enough food is next to IMPOSSIBLE! Until you get, sorry, ""craft"" your fishing rod. But of course just as in any realistic game, you can only get your fish to bite in either dusk or dawn. That leads us to the next problem: DAY AND NIGHT! It seems to me that days are like 5 minutes and nights last forever! Even more, while it's night, you not only get zombies(and there are already millions of it on each island) but you get to fight some UBER zombies which you have to scare off with a flashlight!).You can only save your game and sleep/recover in hiding spots which can be locked BUUUUT upon opening each hiding spot (which are maybe 2x2m big btw) an alarm goes on an endless stream of zombies appear from nowhere- some even explode :) Since there are also zombie deers... Whats next? Zombie trees that shoot nuclear raspberries? Also if you get into a thunderstorm (which is beautifully implemented) make sure, your health bar is up because once again, it's neverending AND!!! you get hit by lightnings every few minutes and you can't hide anywhere. Yes, in this game you are a moving lightning rod.Another pain in the A$$ is that islands are locked within(like in gta) and you have to solve some quests requested by some dump chimp by eg. finding yellow fruit or♥♥♥♥♥♥ to unlock it.Anyway, what made me giving up playing this game was this stupid... early 90s console type gameplay technology... I mean come on... let's say you escape from 83974987928479 zombies, jump into your boat/plane to a safe area with just one life point left, recover, explore other islands and return to that same place again... what do you expect?YES OF COURSE ALL THE SAME ZOMBIES WAITING FOR YOU AT THE SAME EFFIN SPOT!If you're as good as me, then you end up ""escaping"" on each island leaving you in a deadlock forcing you to write a negative review. :3 <3:3 <3:3 <3 Upon returning, you're basically dead as you're immediately hit by thousands of zombies.Anyway, to come to an end; it gave me like 5h of fun and about 2h frustration. If there was another option to rate this game apart postive/negative I'd say it just failed to be good enough to be positively rated. My frustration isn't that high because I just paid, as said, 90cent on summer sale.			"

												How to Survive is one of the best survival games I have ever played. It nails the crafting / surviving gameplay with magesty, providing a satisfactory, yet challenging experience. The last game that got me hooked like this was State of Decay, which also has an amazing survival feeling to it. This game knows how to reward the player when it has to, a feature most game designers don't give the needed attention. The co-op is personally my favorite aspect of the game, you can share items with your partner, give them drinks, food, weapons or health if they need it, and there's an amazing feeling of comradery attached to it, and even though there are other games that do the same, this gets it just right. If you're into zombies and survival games, you should definitely try it.			"

												I bought How to Survive hoping for a decent coop experience, After playing through the insanely short campaign and non-challenging challenges I can easily say that it's simply another bad game.The game mechanics seem broken, Some items that are easy to get early in the game are way better than what you can get later on. The only enjoyable thing I found was the crafting, it was interesting to put together a bunch of items and see what you end up with - but hardly worth it.The only reason that I played through this game is because of the story coop.If you're thinking about buying How to Survive I would really recommend looking elsewhere.

												I can't beleive there's a sequel to this incredibly boring, unfinished, slap-together of a game.  The menus/item selection is terrible. The 'rule books' you pick up on the way spend 3 minutes of your time to tell you one sentence of information.  The gameplay is slow and repetitive and offers absolutely nothing in the way of originality, (go here, get this, bring back, smash zombies on the way, repeatrepeatrepeatref****ingpeat).  The hints are for xbox, not pc (how can this not be fixed by now?  THERE'S AN EFFIN SEQUEL).  Oh, did I mention you can't sprint diagonally?

												There's a lot of hate for this game.  I'm guessing it's due to the fact that it's so linear.  Survival games are such a trend that we automatically assume sandbox or open-world.  This is not either of those, but that doesn't make it a bad game.  As a matter of fact, I think it's an outstanding game.  I believe all the hatred comes from perception.  Don't think of this is a survival game like DayZ, Rust, etc.  Think of it as an old-school RPG with survival themes.My only complaint would be the controls.  It's clearly designed for a gamepad and I'm currently using a mouse and keyboard.  It's slightly clunky when in the inventory.  But even at that, it plays well, it's just crafting is a bit odd.Overall this is a very fun game that is quite polished.			"

So far from what I have played its and RPG that kind of looks like a Diablo game but it takes place on a some tropical islands that are completely infested with zombies. So far from what I've played it's very entertaining. Seems like it's fairly quest based. If you are on the fence and it's on sale or you just got money to burn, Get it. Graphics are pretty good.I recorded myself playing some of it to show my friends what the game was like in attempt to get them to play multiplayer with me. Check It Out!!

Info___I have finished the main story twice - both in a 2 player co-op. First time, just after the game launched and it wasn't as much fun as it was a struggle with predefined controls (we played with Strike FX Gamepads). At the first playthrough my partner could not turn in place which made aiming impossible so she was stuck with a chainsaw and had to position herself properly. I'm skipping those issues in this review as there where major fixes which convinced us to finish the game again.Pros___The sounds and music make a great, horrifying experience yet the whole concept of Kovac and his guides of ""How to survive"" - a guy who seems to enjoy the battle for survival on a zombie filled islands helps you treat all those dangers lightly and find pleasure in hacking through hordes of undeads.The graphics are simple and that made us overlook some items like healing leafs since those bushes may blend with every other bush but it's a small annoyance.Story is interesting and although some quests may seem irritating (f*cking Sanchez and his packages) and repetitive (mostly fetching for items) the campaign is not long enough to make you bleed for this reason. Cons___The reasons you might find yourself flipping tables are mostly related to controls. The characters animations are kinda stiff and slow which made us fall from cliffs few times, making one of us wait for other to come back around or respawn if we fell into piranhas - from where you can't revive your buddy. I strongly recommend playing with controllers and please remember that making turns while running is futile so when you press that sprint button on a narrow high ground you are almost guaranteed to experience this problem.Another annoyance is uneven difficulty but that is mostly related to how fast you can react to given situation - some weapons are better for single, strong or fast enemy and others are perfect for dealing with hordes. And again because of the controls you might find yourself switching from ranged to melee weapons instead of switching from rifle to shotgun.Summary___This is a perfect game for co-op party, best if done with good partners or locally as cooperation includes handling items to a friend if your backpack is stuffed with ammo etc. You will find very helpful defining player roles such as melee/ranged/medic/crafter in terms of what you collect and how you handle fights. A fantastic game for rampaging those damn zombies that should give you around 10-12 hours of fun in main story and few more hours with challenges.			"

												Metacritic scores r mixed. I think dev promised COOp SP and didnt put it in the game. but they still Do promise and will implement it in the enxt patch or something.it is playable with gamepad and best way it gamepad. the gameplay mechanics r nice. u keep crafting different combinations of weapons, armor etc. u need to drink, eat and sleep. u can hunt animals, use their meat and skin. feather etc. variety is high but maps r limited? dont know yet. played for hours but still alot to do. Save system is no kids play. u can loose stuff easily. This game has big potential. i hope we can see more DLC or user content etc. Visuals r not best, animations r a bit dull. Variety of zombies should be more at the very beginning. but L4D series, Dead Island series does the same thing too. "

												This game looks like when a great idea miserably cannons into a mid-development budget reduction. When you start playing, you find it really interesting, newfangled and addictive, but it soon starts being linear and boring. You just kill zombies to find a quest, keep killing zombies to complete the quest and kill zombies again to get the reward. Damn, I bet you even have to kill zombies if you want to kill some zombies. Oh, and if you have to kill zombies at night, prepare yourself because you won't be able to step forward without having to deal with those night zombies. They're tough at the beginning but they'll become such a nuisance soon after you get your first ranged weapon.I can't find an explanation to this game's difficulty curve. You start playing and you can observe how difficulty increases as long as you learn how to play and then... then you get your first ranged weapon again. That's it. This applies to crafting and resources management too: ""Watch out, you've got limited inventory space, you'd better think twice what you carry and what you drop"". Ehmm... no. You may need this to hunt or you may need that to fish, or you could just choose to be a vegetarian and throw that s**t away. You may need to eat, you may need to drink or you may need to sleep: you eat and drink from one of those thousands of plants or wells you'll find with no effort and you can choose to never sleep again if you become a guarana seeds junkie. All of this mixed up with... surprise, killing zombies. Killing the same standard zombie again and again.Story is a nonsense, it doesn't follow any path and it's just absurd.It is supposed to be replayed again and again, choosing different characters and difficulty, but one is enough. In a scale from CRAP to AWESOME, I give this game a Low 'meh'.			"

												Should have read more reviews before buying this product -- I'll be giving it more tries, but my initial impression is not very good. I had hoped this would be a diablo-style zombie game... but what really shines through is that this is a lazy console port (or should be, it looks like it) -- that does worse what a lot of older games have done much better. Want a better game like this? Play ""Path of Exile"" -- the game is better, more attractive, has a better interface, shines over this game in almost every respect, AND has plenty of zombies in it -- as well as countless other monsters.

Not Recommended: There's some fun to be had in How to Survive and the titular guide has a lot of character in its appearances in the game, but if you were looking for the zombie survival type of game that the title promises, then you are going to be disappointed, and the game has a lot of jankiness that comes with a poor console port and some equally-poor design decisions.  There's just not enough to this game and too much frustration at points to recommend.Read the full review here[www.highlandarrow.com] "

												This is a game that had a ton of potential but sadly it falls flat.  The campaign can be completed in a few hours, theres little reason to replay unless using a different character.  There is a split screen muliplayer campaign but sadly no online version, instead there are a series of muliplayer online challenges which can be fun at first but get really boring after a short time.  I find the game to be a little to easy even on hardcore, it doesn't really feel like im actually trying to survive.  The redeeming feature was the crafting system, it's actually quite fun pieceing together scraps of garbage into new weapons that you can then use to bludgeon or shoot monsters with, but it's pretty basic and gets old fast.  To put it simply this game is short and it's boring.  I paid full price and regret it. If you really want to try this game i wouldn't reccommend paying more than $2.       "

												How To Survive is a very boring tedious game. It tries to cash in on the popular elements of games right now (survival, crafting, RPG elements) but does them in the most primitive way possible. The game ends up being an isometric action RPG where all your skills are nothing but passive upgrades, all your quests are fetch quests, and all you end up doing is backtracking constantly with zombies and hordes spawning offscreen just a few meters away from an area you cleared 15 seconds ago.Full review:

Its pretty bloody good, if your into this sort of thing. Its a different take on all the low quality first person zombie games that we got flooded with this year, and that in itself is refreshing :)I havent played many hours though, so I cant comment in detail on the games mechanics, but Id say its easily worth the £1.50 I paid :).

												I had had my eye on this game for a while but was holding out, since I wasn't sure whether it would be worth the money. When it came up on special for $3.99, I jumped at the opportunity to give it a go. It was definitely worth it and, if I had had the chance to try out the gameplay prior, I probably would have paid full price.Now, that said, the game's storyline isn't particularly long nor complex and, though you can re-play as three different characters, the story and NPC reactions are exactly the same (the character stats are different and do affect the gameplay for each, though not a whole lot). However, there is the option to play online with others, so there's that.BUT, what this game is is just plain fun. The crafting system offers a diverse range of weapon possibilities, there are a variety of zombie types, there are sleep/thrist/hunger meters and you have to keep an eye on them or your abilities/stats will take a hit, the gameplay ramps up in difficulty nicely as the game progresses, and... It's just a lot of fun!Gameplay is very similar to Diablo, as others have mentioned and I think it's a good purchase.			"

Wasn't really sure what to expect going in but I have been very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this title.Upon first entering the game I found that the default keyboard / mouse controls were a little weird feeling to me.  I switched to the Xbox 360 controller, which I much prefer.  Be aware that the controller needs to be on before you start the game.Viewpoint is overhead isometric, and gameplay is hack / slash / shoot.  Initially reminded me vaguely of a slow moving ""Zombie / Alien Shooter"" title in feel.  The game features a dynamic day / night system, and tracks hunger, thirst, tiredness, etc.  You must eat, drink, sleep, hunt and forage, and above all kill kill kill zombies.I found NPC interaction to be cleverly written, well voiced, and entertaining.  The game has a surprising amount of humor in both the dialogues and the situations you'll encounter, but most especially in the manual ""How To Survive"" for which the game is named.  The manual is written by loony survival expert named Kovac, and each chapter is hilariously written, narrated, and animated.  The manual also serves as a tutorial component as well, and presents each new concept step by step without feeling burdensome.  Kovac's manuals are definitely a highlight, and so good you'll watch them again just for fun.You'll be fighting your way around several islands that you end up stranded on, and each island is built to present an environmental puzzle to work your way through.  Certain areas and paths are closed off,  you will look forward to gaining new capabilities that will let you open new areas on the islands as you progress.The final gem of this great little game is the depth of the crafting system.  The islands are littered with loot (from zombies), plants, animals (to hunt), and various debris and natural resources.  Nearly every item I've found combines with something else in some fashion, and you will find crafting recipes through exploration as well.  This allows you to develop your arsenal as you go, tailored to your liking through the different craftable melee and ranged weaponry, ammunition, and armor.I definitely recommend this game.  Don't forget to chat with the local monkeys.			"

												So far this game is what I've been looking for!What you care about:Solid game play with an easy crafting system and yes it is a ton of fun.  I've been playing Co-op with a friend and its a challenge to fight the zombies off while still getting the things we need to survive.  Constantly crafting for each other and relaying on each others skills to help us as a group.UPDATE:I've been playing this game for a while and its F%#KING AMAZING 10/10.  Worth way more then what I paid.  Deep gameplay, interesting interactions with a co-op buddy, LOADs of crafting options.  Its not only fun to survive but its fun to figure out different ways to survive.  Its hard to STOP playing.			"

												It took me 8.9 hours to finish the main game on easy mode and I enjoyed it quite a bit.I died once when I was careless and got surrounded by big guys. It wasn't super easy, but it wasn't amazingly challenging either.I think the crafting system is simple, but decent. If you could craft more items that were really good, it would have made things more interesting. As it is, there were a couple of weapons that felt ultimate, and everything else was okay.This game is definitely a different take on the zombie survival game. It certainly has survival elements, but it was always easy to get food, drink and enough sleep.Overall, I quite enjoyed the game and would recommend it.			"

												Great game!  I got it during the Summer Steam Sale and really loved it.  Played both Single Player and Online Co-Op with a friend.  Single player may be a bit tough with limited space, but this is a perfect Online Co-Op game where there are several offensive/defensive styles to choose from (I went melee x snipe while my friend played bow & arrow x explosives).  Storyline was interesting.  Several bugs here and there, but it's tolerable.  I wish the original story was a bit longer.  I'll most likely buy the Kovac's Way DLC eventually.Is it worth $14.99?  Somewhat, but it does have a mediocre replay value behind it.  Seeing how it's a two player Co-Op availability, I think it would make more sense to have a two game bundle package discount.Would I recommend this game to others?  I already have.  A few of my friends bought the game and loved it as well.  It would be great if there'll be more How to Survive games in the future.  I'll definitely buy it!			"

												As with any game - get it on sale.  I liked the game enough to buy the extras.Co-op: online or livingroom (keyboard + controller)The default hard option is probably the most fun.Sound quality was lower than expected.Crafting system is elegant - you can craft everything from the beginning of the game.Game play is about 4 hours from start to finish if you're not on the DLC difficulty [expect another 2-3].  Don't play on DLC difficulty first.KOVAK made me laugh but I always wanted to kill him.7/10 original content6/10 dlc - easily cost more than the game even when they are on sale.			"

												Loved playing this couch co-op game. I played through twice, first with my wife then again with my sister.PROS:Fun co-op is fun!- encourages cooperation via surviving together- encourages cooperation via avoiding friendly fire- encourages cooperation via inventory management (ie. dedicating one player to be ""herbalist"" and another to be ""bomber"")- encourages cooperation via sharing resourcesCONS:Some quality of life issues, but easily forgiveable due to how fun the game is:- inventory management- ranged crosshairs are both red- checking each player's inventory covers half the screen (all if both people check at once)- quick inventory is hard to scroll through to use several different items while in combat			"

												I love this game! So far I have played for 86 hrs and have enjoyed them thoroughly. The only thing I want to see is a DLC with Kovac as a playable character to get his back story, see how he became such a badass.9/3/14 - so i have spent a ton of time on this game and still can't beat the (SPOILER) final ""mad zombie rush"" mission. people are saying this game was no fun and i am here to tell you it is pretty challenging on the easiest setting, and Kovac's way DLC amps that up to 1000x. The challenges are somewhat tough, wouldn't recommend tackling those before maxing your character out and their armor ;)think i got this one on sale but ot was worth more. Just hope they fix the EL Diablo  DLC soon.oh yeah, i liked this game so much i bought it on PSN as well. A little different game there but still worth it.			"

												I'd call this a good crafting/zombie killing game. I liked it all they way.Theres not much difficulty after you get the machinegun, but it's still fun to play.Normal and Iron man difficulty was a bit too easy though. Kovacs way isn't too hard either when you get the machinegun.The diablo islands dlc is a good addition, and was a good bit harder than original game due to the new monsters. I vote for more additions.			"

												Was an negative review, rewrote because of contacting their support with proof of purchasing ""How to Survive - Storm Warning Edition"" for co-op and since the co-op in this game is horrible they decided to simply just give me a copy of the newer version for free as a upgrade. :)So if you purchased this for co-op you might be able to get the newest version for free.-- Singleplayer --- Great if you can trade for it. most people will trade you gift copys for ~$3 worth of items-- Co-op --Completely broken if you're doing the story and nearly impossible to do, other gamemodes might work but didn't do them from all major bugs with story seen.

												If you took Lost in Blue and Resident Evil and threw them into a blender this is the game you would get.  You craft everything you need with the junk you find.  I have played for 2.5 hours as of this review and really enjoy the game due to the balanced game play, hilarious commentary by Kovak and his list of rules, and the questing is the right pace.  The characters and voice acting is really good and I enjoy learning the back story of each of the survivors.  I paid like 5 bucks for this title and it was well worth twice the price!  I give this game a solid 8/10 based on graphics, sound, and content.			"

How To SurviveThe game is about a survive trying to stay alive in a world full of zombies and animals trying to kill you. Along you the way you meet individual's along the way that tend to help you out for a favor in return. The game runs amazingly smooth. Almost any PC can run it.

												This lovely game combines the need to survive and classical zombie defense idea like none other has ever done before. Some people think this game isn't worth it due to its small storyline, but the developers are still working on this game, even after it's been posted. They plan to add a Workshop, new DLC, and additional side quests to improve the game further than it is already.It's a pleasure to see the neverending efforts given to this already tremendous game.

												I've had my eye on this one and decided to give it a go when it came up on Steam Summer Sale.  Wasn't really sure what to expect going in but I have been very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this title.Upon first entering the game I found that the default keyboard / mouse controls were a little weird feeling to me.  I switched to the Xbox 360 controller, which I much prefer.  Be aware that the controller needs to be on before you start the game.Viewpoint is overhead isometric, and gameplay is hack / slash / shoot.  Initially reminded me vaguely of a slow moving ""Zombie / Alien Shooter"" title in feel.  The game features a dynamic day / night system, and tracks hunger, thirst, tiredness, etc.  You must eat, drink, sleep, hunt and forage, and above all kill kill kill zombies.I found NPC interaction to be cleverly written, well voiced, and entertaining.  The game has a surprising amount of humor in both the dialogues and the situations you'll encounter, but most especially in the manual ""How To Survive"" for which the game is named.  The manual is written by loony survival expert named Kovac, and each chapter is hilariously written, narrated, and animated.  The manual also serves as a tutorial component as well, and presents each new concept step by step without feeling burdensome.  Kovac's manuals are definitely a highlight, and so good you'll watch them again just for fun.You'll be fighting your way around several islands that you end up stranded on, and each island is built to present an environmental puzzle to work your way through.  Certain areas and paths are closed off,  you will look forward to gaining new capabilities that will let you open new areas on the islands as you progress.The final gem of this great little game is the depth of the crafting system.  The islands are littered with loot (from zombies), plants, animals (to hunt), and various debris and natural resources.  Nearly every item I've found combines with something else in some fashion, and you will find crafting recipes through exploration as well.  This allows you to develop your arsenal as you go, tailored to your liking through the different craftable melee and ranged weaponry, ammunition, and armor.I definitely recommend this game.  Don't forget to chat with the local monkeys.			"

The gameplay is good, and all the elements of what you expect of a  zombie survival game are here (but it does seem rather cliched).

												Bought the Storm Warning Edition on Christmas Sales 2015 for 1,89euro.-Had lots of fun with a friend on co-op mode.-Killed hordes of zombies smashing them down with an axe.-Survived several days on the island and made it out to the next one.-Died from a lightning on a heavy storm.Game looks to be addictive enough if you are into this type of games. You can craft lots of tools and weapons and also there is a skill tree that you can customize your character in the way you want.

												Do i recommend this game? Yes and no. Its an awesome game with lots of diablo elements but the co-op feels unfinished and rushed, its like the devs made a singleplayer and thought ""oh sh#t we forgot about multiplayer, better add one quickly"". I'm mainly referring to the dialogues in the story, if you skip you have to wait for your teammate to finish. Also i dont understand why the devs would lock the screen so the two players have to be on the same screen, there goes your freedom to explore by yourself and meet up with you teammate by choice, so if your teammate goes afk or trolls you cant progress because you both have to be up eachother's @rse all the time. Like i said i recommend it but if the devs made all these changes the game would be a lot better to play with a friend.			"

												My stats say one hour played, but really it's about 6 hours on two different computers.  I wouldn't review a game after one hour.This is a pretty good zombie game with a bird's eye view, like good ol' games like Fallout 1 and 2.  There is a lot of crafting and lotsa opportunites to combine things to make interesting things.  It's got decent graphics and some interesting quests.   It is just a bit open world, meaning you go to fairly large areas to complete quests, but have some ability to wander around exploring. Overall, it's underrated in my opinion.If it's on sale and you like this kind of thing you should definitely buy it.			"

												This game is fantastic. I've been playing it for two days, just hit the Third Island and am having a great time. The Plot is good, the basic training Island in the beginning is a great approach at Tutorials, along with you friend 'Kovac' who helps you every step along the way giving you new skills and training. The game is fun, it operates in an overhead, 45 Degree-Helicopter View, with an RPG style Skill tree, and leveling system. You gain new items, Craft better weapons, and utilize Plants from teh land. And the best part, is that that it isn't a failed attempt at a Zombie game where they just throw tons of Zombies at you... In this case, you can actually walk at least 20-40 feet without running into any Zed, and you can even sneak around them if you choose to. It's a great survival game, and I recommend that you try it.

												A top-down survival horror video game that doesn't reinvent the wheel, but executes what it has very well and in a very fun way.The biggest three things this game has going for it is:CRAFTING.Explore the dangerous terrain to gather supplies and blueprints to craft badass weapons so you can live a little longer.LOCATIONSYou start off on an island infested with zed's, but as the story progresses you realize...YOU GET TO GO TO MORE ISLANDS INFESTED WITH ZED'S. It's truly refreshing to get a change in scenery for a game that's about crafting and grinding abilities. Which brings me to number three.SKILL TREENot only can you choose the character you want to play as - they each have their own advantages, but they also have their own skill trees. Progress your survivor the way you want to and fend off the dead for a few more hours.This game is challenging, but rewarding.You can play solo or with friends, there are mulitiple challenge modes.It feels almost like a top down Dead Island, except with death coming into factor more heavily.That being said, it's kind of unfair to lump zed games together, they each come with new ideas.This one is worth a playthrough.8/10			"

												Just finished playing campaign and I can tell you it is pretty fun for a day of gaming, I managed to finish after around 9hrs although only completed about half the acheivments. The third person view reminds me of diablo except with a zombie theme. Visually the game is pretty good looking and the bloodsplatters, gore and other details make for a welldone polish. Mechanicaly it is pretty standard for a survival game, except I found it alot easier when my playstyle kicked in. When I found the parts for the rapid-fire homemade gun the game became a run and gun shooter, with sleeping and healing being the only reason to stop moving. I never used the bow either witch is ashame although if I do a replay Ill definatly use it. If your looking at getting this game, recommend for people who are fans of survival type games and I would say its extremly better than any zombie flash games that could be found on the web.

I will be updating this review as I play.tl;dr despite the games lack of polish in some areas and redundent tutorials I've so far found the gameplay to unique and fun. And therfore overlook the areas where the game truely does fail and recommend the game. I can't speak to the worth of the game compared to the price but I did purchase it at %90 off which is well worth the risk even though most reviews are positive ones.First ImpressionsAs of this review I have completed the first set of missions and seemed to have left the tutorial portion of the game. It's been slightly more than an hour. You essentially get taught the mechanics b the first few people you meet, wihthout needing more instructions there are tutorial books scattered around the island which essentially repeat everything you've just found out a moment ago and add another 10-20% detail. I found these books to be redundant and took me away from the game I wanted to play. And speaking of them.... The tutorial books have figure based explanations in video form which for me causes my screen to spazz between the video and the actual game underneath, add in some crazy green digital glitches and some strobes and that's what I saw all the time, pluss the animations played at half speed. Luckily I got all the info I needed already in game. As a disclaimer I'm currntly playing on an Ultrabook without dedicated graphics, but everthing else is running smoothly.Ontop of both those tutorials you have tooltips popping up every other friggen second and often they simply alternate back and forth between 2-3 tips.And speaking of those tooltips maybe half of them have the same spelling error where instead of ""your direction"" it's ""you direction"". Seriously devs?!The irst safehouse you encounter there is a gameplay breaking bug where you can close the door so you are inside and you are still able to hit zombies on the outside, if there are more safehouses in this fashion (Its 1:1 atm) it can become a bigger deal to gameplay. I'm playing with a controller, for some reason the devs though it would make sense for LT to use your secondary weapon and RB to use your primarey weapon, this was terrible to learn and luckily found out that all controls are rebindable.Additionaly the Y button swaps your primary weapon. But it will only swap from melee weapon 1 to melee weapon 2. The same follows for ranged weapons. If i want to switch weapons during a fight I probably want to switch from melee to ranged No one thought that through straight. And then there's some general UI left unpolished where dialouges IMO fade in too slow, the menus aren't navigatable with an anolog stick - just the d-pad, menus can be a tad slow to respond or navigate.So these are some pretty glaring issues but overall I'm still enjoying the game. Good atmosphere that your life is in danger Appropiate difficulty and gameplay to match #1 Who doesn't like a crafting system out of junkyard scraps? Co-op (Which I haven't tried yet) Interesting user tombstone death thing - although there is kinda a lot of them, everywhere, always. Unique and challenging gameplay A skill treeSo again, all-in-all these are obviously not the best developers and makes me wonder what was happening during development and on the forums, but I still find the game very fun to play.

												Great game that combines survival, action and some comedy. It's like no other game of zombies.Good co-op game mode, just up to 2 players, but good.It would be greater if they add the posibility to zoom in and out the player.Bottom line...Its at 80% off till January 2 so, buy it and break a leg! :D			"

												Just finished a playthrough with Jack as my main character.  I have to say it is a really fun and well made game.  For $1.50 you can't go wrong.Some tips for the game.  It is hard!  Be prepared to be frustrated a lot throughout the game when you get overwhelmed by hordes or get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked by zombie deer.  But to make it easier this is what you should do.Clear out the sleeping areas when you are high on heath and even if you don't need to sleep.  They come in handy when you need it later.  When possible, try to sleep at dusk and wake up at dawn to maximize your day light hours.  Fishing is useful in the earlier part of the game, but once you see the ostriches (3rd island I believe) you should be fine on food.Save up the parts you need for automatic machine gun and build it as soon as possible.  This is the gun I finished the game with and you can find all the parts needed about half way through the game.  You will be low on health, hunger, thirst, and sleep at various parts of the game.  There is no way to keep your health full most of the time and even basic zombies do quite a bit of damage each time they hit you.  For the skill tree I think the best investment is, in this order.  Campfire, slow sleep and hunger, the gun skills until you get scope, (at this point you can make some scopes and respec to get the arrow skills)  the explosive arrows is a great investment as once you can make explosive arrows you can access the barriers and reinforced sheds without wasting bottles.Spoiler!  To beat the last wave of zombies I just stood at the right most point on the beach.  The water is behind you and zombies come from the left.  Use your automatic machine gun to kill all the mobs.  When the big guy comes out finish it off with explosive arrows.  Its a pretty tough battle even with the best weapons in the game, I believe.  I died twice before finishing it on my third try.  To make the fight easier be sure to make some Green Beef Soda before the fight to replenish health and get an aim bonus.  Its hard, but worth playing :)In addition to the main game, your can complete challanges that adds additional playability to the game.  I imported Jack from the main game and he shows up with all the armor and skills you found in the main game, but no items.  The first challange took me about 30 mins, and it is basically running through the first island.  Very recommended!			"

												etting fun from playing is the main purpose of games, isn't it? Well, this game is really fun. I am sure you will get a lot of positive emotions while killing hundreds of zombies, crafting new weapons and stuff and performing the tasks. Of cause it's much better to play with friend because this game is just made for co-op. But there is also a big problem in this game - bad optimization for PC version :P Also it's rather weird that developers don't make chat. No chat in co-op game... seriously?However, H2S is amazing :) Funny, interesting, vivid. Perfect game :)			"

												Recommended GameNice Graphics with the mix of RPG, Farcry 2 and Dead Island ingredients. Can rival most RPG zombie games in the steam store. Hell, it's way better than Dead Island Epidemic and State of Decay because of game mechanics and Co-Op. My only issue would be the following: + Larger Bag for inventory of items. + Some type of cabinet to stock other unused but otherwise vital items.+ A Merchant to sell items+ Fishing in the game is next to non-existant. Come-on, food is so scarce give us a better source!+ Profile type Saves of character progress. So you don't need to restart a Character eveytime you play a new game+ BUG ingame. Kenji dies everytime I reach Cenizas island for no apparent reason. I die as soon as I reach this islandFix these issues and you're GOLD! "

												This is one good game I am very impressed with it. It is really fun when your playing with friends you can do so much and you need to craft alot of things to keep alive! You get armour and weapons and you can make other new weapons and make them stronger. This game is very survival! You need to keep drinking water, eating food, getting rest and keeping alive! You can hunt and make fires to cook your food on! We had to fight this big guy which was pretty scary haha he came out of no where. This is very fun game to play I could play it for ages I would really recommend you guys buying this game because soon as you get it you will enjoy it very much. I rate this 10/10 because I can never get bored of this! I can just keep playing it with my friends and finding new things out! The campaign is nice and long and takes alot of time and keep finding the items you need to make new and stronger items! You all should buy this game!Have fun! 10/10			"

I will be updating this review as I play.tl;dr despite the games lack of polish in some areas and redundent tutorials I've so far found the gameplay to unique and fun. And therfore overlook the areas where the game truely does fail and recommend the game. I can't speak to the worth of the game compared to the price but I did purchase it at %90 off which is well worth the risk even though most reviews are positive ones.First ImpressionsAs of this review I have completed the first set of missions and seemed to have left the tutorial portion of the game. It's been slightly more than an hour. You essentially get taught the mechanics b the first few people you meet, wihthout needing more instructions there are tutorial books scattered around the island which essentially repeat everything you've just found out a moment ago and add another 10-20% detail. I found these books to be redundant and took me away from the game I wanted to play. And speaking of them.... The tutorial books have figure based explanations in video form which for me causes my screen to spazz between the video and the actual game underneath, add in some crazy green digital glitches and some strobes and that's what I saw all the time, pluss the animations played at half speed. Luckily I got all the info I needed already in game. As a disclaimer I'm currntly playing on an Ultrabook without dedicated graphics, but everthing else is running smoothly.Ontop of both those tutorials you have tooltips popping up every other friggen second and often they simply alternate back and forth between 2-3 tips.And speaking of those tooltips maybe half of them have the same spelling error where instead of ""your direction"" it's ""you direction"". Seriously devs?!The irst safehouse you encounter there is a gameplay breaking bug where you can close the door so you are inside and you are still able to hit zombies on the outside, if there are more safehouses in this fashion (Its 1:1 atm) it can become a bigger deal to gameplay. I'm playing with a controller, for some reason the devs though it would make sense for LT to use your secondary weapon and RB to use your primarey weapon, this was terrible to learn and luckily found out that all controls are rebindable.Additionaly the Y button swaps your primary weapon. But it will only swap from melee weapon 1 to melee weapon 2. The same follows for ranged weapons. If i want to switch weapons during a fight I probably want to switch from melee to ranged No one thought that through straight. And then there's some general UI left unpolished where dialouges IMO fade in too slow, the menus aren't navigatable with an anolog stick - just the d-pad, menus can be a tad slow to respond or navigate.So these are some pretty glaring issues but overall I'm still enjoying the game. Good atmosphere that your life is in danger Appropiate difficulty and gameplay to match #1 Who doesn't like a crafting system out of junkyard scraps? Co-op (Which I haven't tried yet) Interesting user tombstone death thing - although there is kinda a lot of them, everywhere, always. Unique and challenging gameplay A skill treeSo again, all-in-all these are obviously not the best developers and makes me wonder what was happening during development and on the forums, but I still find the game very fun to play.

												Phew...this is a hard game to recommend. It's fun for the first 4 hours or so, but the last few missions are a total slog. There's one mission near the end that's there purely to extend the life of the game and is just horrid desgin. There's some cute writing in this, and the voice acting is passibly funny. There are some serious issues though. Inventory management is some of the worst I've seen in a game. Also, I think this was designed to be convoluted just to extend the game as opposed to a logical design choice. You have to drop extra items off at one of your ""bases"" and it never fails that the one thing you need will require you to travel back across the entire game world. That mixed with the sluggish run speed makes for an extremely dull experience. I did enjoy the look of the game, and the animations / art are top notch. It's a 6-8 hour game that should have been a 3 hour experience. I wish they had a maybe recommend button. If you're SUPER into zombie games, or dig the robotron isometric style, I recommend it. If you're only passingly interested, skip this one and wait for a sequel.			"

												I have really enjoyed this game. Diablo 3, but survival and crafting elements involved. My only caution would be that there is very little to do once you beat the story. Once you get all of the good items, it becomes very easy. Thankfully challenges in the game make it hard to get to this point, but it is definitely worth the play. Look for a sale. I got my copy for $1.50 and it was worth every penny. If I had paid $10 I might not have felt the same... Overall a great game. I look forward to more from this developer.			"

												Absolutely brilliant!Me and my friend did a co-op playthrough of the game and even when we finished we could hardly stop playing!The storyline is interesting and keeps you thinking and questioning every character.The crafting system is really good, theres loads to make and some really cool contraptions.The graphics are good and the weather/daylight is really effective, especially with the newest DLC (which i highly reccommend)The survival aspect is suprisingly realistic, with a need to eat, drink and sleep at realistic rates.The progression and evolution of zombies throughout the game is awesome, with new ones every chapter and spawn rates increasing, not to mention the wildlife turning before your eyes :POverall, i would recommend this game highly, especially if youre playing co-op online or even on the same machine!Only advice i would give is to connect a controller/gamepad as it really helps :PHappy hunting, hope you survive!

												I've enjoyed this game. Good story, decent graphics, great gameplay.A little short on campaign-time, but that's compensated by the price and the extra challenge-missions afterwards. Even in solo-mode.Minor drawback: some of the text in Kovacs book didn't run synchrone with the images on my computer.Advise: beware of the zombie-stag.			"

												""Pleasantly surprised"" - Not a bad zombie survival game if old school isometric style gaming doesn't phase you. Given its short length its best to buy when its on sale cheap, the person who did the background music did a really great good job at setting the mood, the games gfxs and sound effects aren't bad either imo.After playing it all the way through im giving it a (non emo) rating of 8/10.

												Absolutely brilliant!Me and my friend did a co-op playthrough of the game and even when we finished we could hardly stop playing!The storyline is interesting and keeps you thinking and questioning every character.The crafting system is really good, theres loads to make and some really cool contraptions.The graphics are good and the weather/daylight is really effective, especially with the newest DLC (which i highly reccommend)The survival aspect is suprisingly realistic, with a need to eat, drink and sleep at realistic rates.The progression and evolution of zombies throughout the game is awesome, with new ones every chapter and spawn rates increasing, not to mention the wildlife turning before your eyes :POverall, i would recommend this game highly, especially if youre playing co-op online or even on the same machine!Only advice i would give is to connect a controller/gamepad as it really helps :PHappy hunting, hope you survive!

												This lovely game combines the need to survive and classical zombie defense idea like none other has ever done before. Some people think this game isn't worth it due to its small storyline, but the developers are still working on this game, even after it's been posted. They plan to add a Workshop, new DLC, and additional side quests to improve the game further than it is already.It's a pleasure to see the neverending efforts given to this already tremendous game.

The game is great fun - as long as you like being swarmed over by a bunch of crazy zombies. Find stuff - combine stuff - make bigger and better weapons.

												I've had my eye on this one and decided to give it a go when it came up on Steam Summer Sale.  Wasn't really sure what to expect going in but I have been very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this title.Upon first entering the game I found that the default keyboard / mouse controls were a little weird feeling to me.  I switched to the Xbox 360 controller, which I much prefer.  Be aware that the controller needs to be on before you start the game.Viewpoint is overhead isometric, and gameplay is hack / slash / shoot.  Initially reminded me vaguely of a slow moving ""Zombie / Alien Shooter"" title in feel.  The game features a dynamic day / night system, and tracks hunger, thirst, tiredness, etc.  You must eat, drink, sleep, hunt and forage, and above all kill kill kill zombies.I found NPC interaction to be cleverly written, well voiced, and entertaining.  The game has a surprising amount of humor in both the dialogues and the situations you'll encounter, but most especially in the manual ""How To Survive"" for which the game is named.  The manual is written by loony survival expert named Kovac, and each chapter is hilariously written, narrated, and animated.  The manual also serves as a tutorial component as well, and presents each new concept step by step without feeling burdensome.  Kovac's manuals are definitely a highlight, and so good you'll watch them again just for fun.You'll be fighting your way around several islands that you end up stranded on, and each island is built to present an environmental puzzle to work your way through.  Certain areas and paths are closed off,  you will look forward to gaining new capabilities that will let you open new areas on the islands as you progress.The final gem of this great little game is the depth of the crafting system.  The islands are littered with loot (from zombies), plants, animals (to hunt), and various debris and natural resources.  Nearly every item I've found combines with something else in some fashion, and you will find crafting recipes through exploration as well.  This allows you to develop your arsenal as you go, tailored to your liking through the different craftable melee and ranged weaponry, ammunition, and armor.I definitely recommend this game.  Don't forget to chat with the local monkeys.			"

												If you took Lost in Blue and Resident Evil and threw them into a blender this is the game you would get.  You craft everything you need with the junk you find.  I have played for 2.5 hours as of this review and really enjoy the game due to the balanced game play, hilarious commentary by Kovak and his list of rules, and the questing is the right pace.  The characters and voice acting is really good and I enjoy learning the back story of each of the survivors.  I paid like 5 bucks for this title and it was well worth twice the price!  I give this game a solid 8/10 based on graphics, sound, and content.			"

												This is actually really well made. It's fun, the tutorials are funny, you can really craft a crap ton of stuff really easily and kill a bunch of zombies with all your creative gear. The graphics and level design are great, and there's even a neat diversity in enemies to fight in different ways. The only complaint I really have with this game is the inventory. I hate it when games make you sort inventory, and this game does it a lot. I imagine this game being a lot more fun in co-op mode.Overall I see a working game here. If you like crafting and shooting zombies then by all means. Knock yourseves out ^^			"

												After playing 2 hours on this game I do feel rash to write a negative review although it didn't take me along time to see what the game failed to do, for instance, multiplayer. Multiplayer is hard to control as the screen is shared among both players and it feels like singerplayer but with someone else controlling the monitor. The game has multiple challenges which I did enjoy however I believe it would of succed more if had an open world sandbox mode, but that's just me. I don't feel as if this game is worth £11.99 or 14 odd so' dollars but I bought it for a quid on sale I feel like I got my moneys worth as it is a great way to kill time when your internet is down but I believe this game fails to create zombie survival game but has the 'scaverging' aspect. Overall I think if you enjoy playing offline or don't mind sharing a screen with someone then fine and the graphics and game coding are fine and I have seen no bugs and story mode is pretty good. However, this game could of done so much more but this is probably just personal preferance.			"

												Definitely a fun game to play especially co-oping. If you're into the diablo-esk type of gameplay and like zombies, this game is definitely one to try out. There are a couple issues with saving i found out. When you first start when playing the co-op you have to make sure you select save so your progress is saved. Thats actually quite important. But when you get into the game more later in the game and save it lags a bit and says ""waiting for player"" a lot. In the beginning there wasn't a problem like that. The graphics are fine, theres not terrible but not BlowYourMindAmazing. they do just fine. The story I thought was your average story. You start out as your character washed up on the beach, you find some guy who is ""infected"" chillin next to you and he tells you to find someone else. And there you go, off with your adventure to find that person and complete quests a long the way. There is a main guy named Korvac... he's an interesting character and makes you help his monkey friends for items.. I didn't find the items to be all that useful. Because I found most of them that I completed around the islands anyway. The audio can get a bit annoying with the zombies repetitive moaning but you either learn to ignore it or mute it :]. They do have a skill tree in the game that is useful. If you explore a lot in these type of games you'll find recipe's that show you the ingredients you need to craft items in game. But just because you've got the recipe doesn't mean you can just craft it. You do sometimes need the skill to actually create what it is you want to make. You do have food/tiredness/thirst meters also that you have to keep an eye on, there are skills that slow down the depletion of those meters so it all depends on how you play and how annoying you find those meters. I would personally recommend doing the skills that help you craft and boost your attacks and such because you end up finding items that help with the sleep/food/thirst so theres not much problem with maintaining that.Overall I would probably give the game a... 7/10? The main issue was with the fluid co-opping, those ""waiting for player"" moments got really annoying.			"

												How to Survive is not that bad. I only bought this game for the local coop part and it was indeed a lot of fun. What I didn't like in this game are the ridiculous zombie respawns and the inventory management. My friend needs to open his backpack most of the time to make arrows and stuff and I have to wait too since I can't move. There is not really a survival feeling about this game until I bought the Kovac's way DLC. That is what I expected from this game from the description page, low resources, more different animals, hard to survive in this dangerous environment and more simple realistic things that makes it more challenging instead of zombie respawn till you death. I don't like their DLC policy but I don't mind it since it is that cheap on sales offers lol. All in all it is not a ""must buy"" game but it does has it's good moments :)			"

												Edit: Updated with DLC:I've read a  few negative reviews left for HTS and I think they miss the point: Killing Zombies in this game is great fun. That's what zombie games should be right? The game is easily worth the $5 or less you can usually get it for on sale.The simple story and its minor twist was enough to keep things going. Crafting is a fun and there is enough reward to make this worthwhile. It was also great fun playing local co-op where you have to be careful not to shoot each other while being onset by a hoard. The challenge modes are great fun after you finish (you get to keep armour you earned in the game for this) - again even better in co-op.PROS+ Zombie Killing - fun!+ Good Powerups+ Nice Design overall+ Graphics, Sound and Animations are decent+ Good tension at times but without being too stressful.NEGS- It gets quite repetitive at times.- Small environments (islands are not very big).- The inventory size is many a tad limited which means even more wandering back to places to get things you need.- Frame rate drops suddenly on occasion and needs reboot. - Occasional crashes (but game does get saved automatically quite often).- Switching ammo type is a real pain (no quick toggle button).- Map should show where you dropped stuff. Too hard finding things you already found!- Terrible Spelling!!! Not a dealbreaker but so many typos!!- Diablo Islands achievments are way too hard. I had S-Ranked this game before the DLC but now I can't get that back despite 50+ hours work.This is a fun game and great value for money.Overall I give it an easy 7.7/10			"

												To start off I would like to say, that first; I got this game on sale and secondly; my computer isnt very good""How To Survive"" is a top down zombie survival game, you have to go around completing quests to get items for armour, guns, e.t.c. Sounds great doesnt it! BUT I managed to find soo many bugs in the short 0.8 hours of gameplay. To start of the screen was pushed to the side so I couldnt see 1/4 of the screen and even on fullscreen it was aswell, after I fixed that I tried to play the game but it wouldnt go above 5 or 10 frames per second THIS IS RIDICULOUS, so i thought maybe they will have somewhere i can turn down the graphics, but nope because this is a terrible port from the consoles it doesnt work the only way i could get it to work non fullscreen was in the steam settings. also it took me ages to connect my controller to play with my brother but the frameskip was still to much. This game is a poorly done PC port and if it was optimised for bad computers and FIXED THIER SCHITT then it would most likely be reccomened.Its not all bad though, we brought the game on the ps3 because I wanted to play it, we downloaded it on the playstation and its actually really fun, you have to build guns to shoot zombies in the face but as you go futher through the story the zombies get stronger and faster, for example there are deer zombies that you have to dodge and big boss zombies that you waste all your ammo on; there is also challenges like only explosive weapons and only chainsaws that increase the replayabilty rather alot. I really enjoyed playing H2S on my playstation but i with i could get it to work on the computer.To conclude, if your computer cost less than a grand, get it on consoles my 0.8 hours were only sorting out all the♥♥♥♥♥♥that the poorly done port had.

Could have been better, because has wonderful ideas, but whose implementacion fails for single player: the diagonal movement is dificult in keyboard, lacks of inventory space and the strong enemies are common, all of which force to play cooperative mode to apreciate the game; otherwise only with patience leaves good feel, but is highly replayable in challenge arcade mode.

												Absolutely AWESOME ideas in this bloody game filled out with some zombies just 1 think make this game a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥ - no online coop story (only coop story on 1PC for 2 players) but just online coop challenges (which are pretty hard and awesome) and the zombies should scream *** BRAINS *** (just kidding).

												Technically, it is almost perfect: Full controller support (like at least every non-FPS game should have), enjoyable co-op, pretty beautiful, isometric visuals. On easy, it has a very well balanced difficulty, especially for a zombie-killing game. Then again, I wouldn't complain about its difficulty, if I chose to play it on hard.No linux support, though. (Not that it incorporates DX11, to justify windows only support.)(I know that you tell about the existence of these features by looking at the side-of-the-screen steam icons, and that you don't need to read a review emphasizing them, but these are the first things that matter, and the reasons to try a game or not, in first place.)Aethetically, it is a really stylish, fun-to-play and rewarding game. I'd call it a hiddent gem, but thankfully, it's not hidden anymore :-)Dialogs are interesting, or at least non-brain-dead, and Kovac's instuctions are hilarious. With as-many-as-needed RPG elements, meaningful crafting and an interesting variety of weapons,it's definitely a must-buy, even if really tired of the 'killing-zombies' genre. (like I am).For you, when on discount ( < 2$ ), its bundle is probably the single best offer you can get amongst all games on steam. For me, a new standard of how well my money is spent on other games.			"

												Well i bought it for 10 €. It's not worth the money. But buy it whenever there's a massive sale. It's kinda worth when you buy it for 1.5€ or something like that. And you can play multiplayer aswell. So buy it for yourself and a friend, have some fun with it and maybe get the trading cards and craft the badge. :D As others have already said, the game gets boring because the story is stupid , same for quests.. but you can shoot zombies with your friend / s  online :O . That's something, right? :D Cheers.			"

												“How to Survive” is a survival game where your main goal is to escape a zombie infested island. It has some exploring, crafting, and survival aspects reminiscent of Don’t Starve, but with some Diablo-style click fighting and basic character advancement. Overall, I enjoyed the game, but I have a bunch of little criticisms that detract from an otherwise decent game. The game is a grind at times. It gets tiring having to fight again in an area you’ve just recently explored. You must go through way too many screens to load a saved game and you can only save the game at certain points. The dialogue/voice acting isn't great and most of the missions are simple fetch quests. Inventory management is a bit of a chore. The NPCs just stand in the open and never defend themselves or even get attacked. It disengaged me from the atmosphere.   Overall, I recommend How to Survive. It is good, I think it is missing a few refinements that could make it great. "

												I find this game to be really entertaining and runs flawlessly for me, and i dk what my friends problem is, the controls are easy to find, how ever the graphical settings are iffy and for some hard to find.... and yes it is a port that didn't have much time put into it, but the controls seem fine to me, and i have a wired 360 controller coming in the mail anyday now... i'd buy this game again!How ever my friend didn't like it caus he can't run it... here is his reviewThe game could be fun, but it is plagued by the issues of a botched console port. firstly it has no in game graphical settings under video or otherwise not even a brightness bar. if you go into steam client you can change shadow quality and the size of the window it opens in, as well as turn on Vsync or disable Vsync. no resolution, no custom key mapping and the only supported controller being a wired 360 controller makes this game a chore to play and not worth your time unless you have a top of the line PC I was buying this game for a friend who runs a lower end computer because there are not alot of quality mulitplayer games he can run, because of the fact that a simple game should run easily on his pc I opted for this game, before buying it we ran it on his pc using my profile and big surprise do to the lack of Resolution settings it runs at a whopping 5fps. unless you have a decent graphics card dont buy this game it will chug like a frat boy doing a keg stand when more than one zombie is on the screen the lack of basic graphic options makes it a chore to run on anything less than the reccomended system specs rather than the minimum, and of course it plays like a botched console port because big surprise thats exactly what it is.

												Well, yes - H2S has it's problems, mainly in the clumsy user interface regarding any inventory actions. And yes, it will get repetetive after a while. And yes, you will max out your character pretty fast, after which the surviving aspect of the game becomes pretty much a walk in the park. BUT. Doing all this is pretty charming, rather mindless fun. Nice looking surroundings plus rather different outtake and feel of zombie survivalism compared to the competition make it well worth your time and money. At least if you enjoy Diablo-esque light-RPG-hack'n'slash sort of affair. I've seen some reviews around complaining about juvenile and absurd humour. Each to his or her own; talking parrots with absurd quests, t-shirt wearing silly monkeys and heavy accented welder-masked half-lunatic made me chuckle a few times. When not chuckling, I've been having loads of fun with the insta-kill death animations, blowing heads, scattering limbs and blasting all kinds of zombie humans and animals with bolts and nuts.At the moment I'm struggling to keep my interest up in retrieving last 5 of the 20 packages to a drunken latino aviator, which tends to be repetitive pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ but I can't wait to get it done and get on with hopefully some more exciting aspects of the adventure. hen that's done, there'll be Horno isles to be conquered. And after that, there will be the challenges which I really look forward to, co-op playing-wise. People ith crispier playing pace will have probably about 10  hours worth gaming time ahead of them, with my snail-paced completism you can double or triple that easily.			"

												UhNot too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes insteadIngredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

After you completed fifty percent of the game -if you know how to play rpg games- zombies can be killed so easy. Even the bosses. If you are really into this game, trust me, wait for the next summer sale. It won't worth it if you buy now.			"

												UhNot too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes insteadIngredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

												This is one of the best games i've ever played. I liked the way that the story was made because of his circular feature (the story began with Ramon and Kovac, wich are the principal characters of the game and it is supposed to be continued again with them... I could say more, but i don't wand to give any spoilers. However, the story is very well structured and i recommend to follow it).On the other hand, i liked the variety of weapons wich you can craft from apparently useless things. The combat with ""monsters"" is such funny if you use the typically machete because you become untargetable while you are donig a instakill movement, wich can be a great thing when you are doing 1 vs 100 zombies, where you can kill all of them without taking any kind of damage. That doesn't means being a survivor, that means being a ninja :D. Madness!The game is more entertainer if you play co-op. You can revive your dead teamate, so you can ""live forever"", you are doing things together and stuff like that wich brings a lot of fun and laughters.			"

												“How to Survive” is a survival game where your main goal is to escape a zombie infested island. It has some exploring, crafting, and survival aspects reminiscent of Don’t Starve, but with some Diablo-style click fighting and basic character advancement. Overall, I enjoyed the game, but I have a bunch of little criticisms that detract from an otherwise decent game. The game is a grind at times. It gets tiring having to fight again in an area you’ve just recently explored. You must go through way too many screens to load a saved game and you can only save the game at certain points. The dialogue/voice acting isn't great and most of the missions are simple fetch quests. Inventory management is a bit of a chore. The NPCs just stand in the open and never defend themselves or even get attacked. It disengaged me from the atmosphere.   Overall, I recommend How to Survive. It is good, I think it is missing a few refinements that could make it great. "

												Well, yes - H2S has it's problems, mainly in the clumsy user interface regarding any inventory actions. And yes, it will get repetetive after a while. And yes, you will max out your character pretty fast, after which the surviving aspect of the game becomes pretty much a walk in the park. BUT. Doing all this is pretty charming, rather mindless fun. Nice looking surroundings plus rather different outtake and feel of zombie survivalism compared to the competition make it well worth your time and money. At least if you enjoy Diablo-esque light-RPG-hack'n'slash sort of affair. I've seen some reviews around complaining about juvenile and absurd humour. Each to his or her own; talking parrots with absurd quests, t-shirt wearing silly monkeys and heavy accented welder-masked half-lunatic made me chuckle a few times. When not chuckling, I've been having loads of fun with the insta-kill death animations, blowing heads, scattering limbs and blasting all kinds of zombie humans and animals with bolts and nuts.At the moment I'm struggling to keep my interest up in retrieving last 5 of the 20 packages to a drunken latino aviator, which tends to be repetitive pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ but I can't wait to get it done and get on with hopefully some more exciting aspects of the adventure. hen that's done, there'll be Horno isles to be conquered. And after that, there will be the challenges which I really look forward to, co-op playing-wise. People ith crispier playing pace will have probably about 10  hours worth gaming time ahead of them, with my snail-paced completism you can double or triple that easily.			"

												I literally loved this game so much, already completed it and did a few side quests as well.It's a perfect surival game, you spend time filling up jerry cans with water and gasoline, watching your thirst, hunger and tiredness levels dropping gradually, searching for food and combining items together to make awesome weapons, potions and armour.The melee combat is not as satisfying as the ranged combat but the ranged combat is so satisfying. I must admit when it first started I thought it was a bit tedious and boring but once it got started I was totally addicated. If it's not your type of genre then you probably just won't like it but if survival type genres are you will love this!Also I got this for about £1.50 on offer - best money I ever spent. My only grievance is just as I was realllllly getting into it, I completed it. Gutted - but now i'll just buy number 2 and 3 haha			"

												Just finished playing campaign and I can tell you it is pretty fun for a day of gaming, I managed to finish after around 9hrs although only completed about half the acheivments. The third person view reminds me of diablo except with a zombie theme. Visually the game is pretty good looking and the bloodsplatters, gore and other details make for a welldone polish. Mechanicaly it is pretty standard for a survival game, except I found it alot easier when my playstyle kicked in. When I found the parts for the rapid-fire homemade gun the game became a run and gun shooter, with sleeping and healing being the only reason to stop moving. I never used the bow either witch is ashame although if I do a replay Ill definatly use it. If your looking at getting this game, recommend for people who are fans of survival type games and I would say its extremly better than any zombie flash games that could be found on the web.

												How to survive is a top down zombie survival game with decent crafting and open envornments. The game was fun, challanging and had controller support which was a plus. Most of your time is spent running back and forth between the same four isalnds on boring fetch quest. The islands themselves are each different, complex, and each brings its own new threat. The story it self is nothing new, but who playes zombie games for the story? The game has a variety of weapons for all types of players and even towards the end of the game you can still easily become overwhelmed and killed. The three defferent characters arn't much defferent ecxept for two schematics I found which could only be used by one character.Overall the game was fun, but I recomand you play with friends as it can seem boring or annoyingly hard at times.

With the help of the mysterious stranger Kovac (complete with strange European accent), you'll fabricate ad-hoc armor from pieces of tire and guns from scuba tanks and flared pipes. You can make all kinds of gear. The combat physics make the game a blast -- if you have the time to aim carefully you can get head hits, but body hits can knock zombies back or spin them around to buy you time to take more careful aim.

												It's a fun isometric view zombie survival game. You have to manage not only health, but food, drink, and sleep.  Which are not hard once you get used to checking before you hit bottom. Building and improving weapons are cool, and switching between weapons is a snap. Some weapons are good all around, while some are best in specific situations.  The main problem in big groups are the exploding fatties,  shoot them with arrows to blow them up away from you or you will take damage.  The only problem I have is the final boss battle, because its pretty hard and I haven't beaten that yet. The challenges are pretty good, but as it says they are a challenge, so use a character you already have built up for those.			"

												How to Survive was a very pleasant surprise. H2S is an isometric survival RPG set on zombie infested islands. The story is nothing to write home about - you're trapped on these islands and need to find parts for your plane to escape. But H2S perfectly scratches that itch that everyone has for killing hordes of zombies with a chainsaw and blowing their heads off with a shotgun. The game doesn't take itself too seriously, but the light-hearded humour and the bizzare characters in the campaign fit in well with the ridiculousness of murdering millions of zombies while weaing a head made out of an angry tapir's face (yes, you can do that). The crafting system is intuitive and keeping track of your hunger, thirst and need for rest adds an element of realism. There are some complaints. Gameplay itself can become a little repetitive, especially with the fast zombie respawns. However, H2S's strongest point is the co-op play. The campaign is a total blast to play with a friend, either locally or online. It's not a surival simulator, but H2S is a solid mix of action, crafting and survival and is well worth a play.			"

My two big problems are that there's no penalty for dying, ironic considering the title, and that the challenge missions are even more linear than the campaign. Still, I recommend: 4/5			"

												Tried this game on a chance.  Had way more fun playing it than I thought I would.  The zombies are neat, the crafting is easy and fun, and it's not too long that I feel it drags on.  Haven't tried the multiplayer yet, but the rest of the game is worth the buy.			"

												I got this game on sale for less than $4 and I can say it's a total steal at that price.  I'd say it may even worth the full price of $14.99.  I've logged a few hours playing with my daughter in co-op mode.  The only complaint I have is that managing the hunger aspect of the game is a bit of a pain as food is too scarce.  Healing is also a bugger as plants and health kits are also about as rare as hens teeth. Overall, I've been enjoying this game, would buy it all over again and would recommend it to a friend, especially if it's on sale.			"

												Surprisingly, I've now spent a lot more hours on this game than other games on my list. Quite engaging crafting makes the gameply interesting. You will also want to explore to find good items which adds more into what makes the whole package of the game work. Only annoyance I find is that you do have to walk around to travel the different islands, since not everything is available on one island. Really, you will be spending a good amount of time walking around because apparently, the boats can only go a specific docks instead of allowing you to use one boat to travel to all visited islands. These docks are usually far apart, and you'll have to maze through the islands just to travel from island to island. That's probably the only annoyance that I've found. Story-wise, it's pretty ok. I've only played one character, and I can only guess that each character has their own story path to follow. As to what most reviewers can note, the crafting system for items you pickup is the bloodline of this game. Most story quest do require you to craft, and at a certain point, there's no reference for an item you needed to craft and you'll need to use your imagination (or google) to figure out what you needed to craft. 7/10			"

												The KB & mouse control annoyed me for the whole tutorial time, BUT after I switch to a controller it completely changed the world. This game is made for controller. Feel very natural. eg. I have to dodge and fight very cautiously when using KB & mouse, but when using controller I chased them back like an infected myself XDI couldn't sleep well in the first night after playing this, always thinking the ways to beat them or combining items etc. Obviously the symptom of an addict!

												This game is a nice little time waster, i haven't put many hours into it as of yet, but the time i did spend playing, i found to be enjoyable. I just can't seem to get addicted to it, the game play is just lacking. I felt as though i was grinding trivial quests rather than surviving, the food, hunger and sleep mechanics can be a pain for the most part. But once you get a nice little routine going, it's almost unnoticable.Overall its a decent game, good for the sale price, NOT the full price. "

												This game is a lot of fun.  It has a few aiming quirks, and inconsistencies with onscreen key-presses not reflecting changed bindings during the tutorial, but once I got past the initial intro the game really started to shine.  The basic story mode is a mostly linear progression through 5 islands.  It quickly ramped up my power, but the added DLC and side quests really gave it charm.  I'd recommend this game for anyone that loves Isometric RPG/Action games.			"

												Alright. Buy this game on sale, if you can. Generally, this is all it says on the tin: You have four relatively small islands to explore, the story mode is a bunch of fetch quests, and you gotta maintain hunger, sleep and thirst. Now I dunno about the other characters, but the one I picked had skills to slow down the three basic needs, which more or less made it feel like there wasn't much survival to be had here. On the other hand, before you learn these skills, hunger and thirst grow rather fast, and sleep is awkward - You cannot sleep outside a safehouse, but you ALSO cannot sleep unless the sleep meter is below 50%, but you ALSO wanna spend the night in a safehouse, asleep or not, because early on the nighttime zombies are too strong for you to handle. So, you're stuck standing there and waiting for your sleep meter to fall. Until you get that perk, which lets you stay awake for like two days at a time, and by then you might be strong enough to actually keep running around outside despite nighttime zombies.The voice acting is good, as is the crafting system - You find all sorts of random♥♥♥♥♥♥all around the islands, more than you could ever carry, and so you are bound to combine some stuff if only to save space. Eventually, weapons become a little overpowered in damage, but not in firing rate: While my incendiary bone bow with reels kills everything but bosses and undead deer in one shot, and pierces through enemies lining up, I often still find myself in a pitch because with SO MANY ZOMBIES converging, it's kinda tough keeping up. Add nighttime zombies to that(which you have to face with a flashlight to make em back off), and survival becomes relatively tough again.One major negative, though: At one point in the main quest, an old lady's cat dies. This is absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥and was unnecessary. I came for tough survival fun and to creatively kill zombies, not to get sad over the death of my favourite animal. :c			"

												I have 4 hours in this game. I just got it 4 hours ago. Currently I have been to each island yet not expored each island, and I can say this whole heartedly , im so excited on what im going to find next! This game pulled me in mainly because of the humour, the back story, and the main survival feel to it. The beginning tutorial is LONG, and I mean incredibly long. You get to the 3rd island ( which was about 3 hours in ) and your jsut getting out of it. I say that because they are still giving you instructions like your 10 and throwing a bunch of Kovac's books at you. Kovac is love, Kovac is life. He is the man with an accent. Love him. I feel he is going to help me out, but he may betray me in the end ( SPOILER ALERT {{ I mean he lent me a plane and all by me just asking. HIS PLANE }} ) Anyway this game shows minor humour a couple of bugs and glitches, and an interesting array of zombies to kill with a hatchet, sword, gun, bow, or boomerang ( NOTE : The boomerang is super O.P !!) I find myself intensely leaned in trying to see at night to make sure nothing is crawling up behind me, peering around corners for bloat guys, and constantly looking for a fuel tank to refil my stock of fire-arrows. This is immersion. I wish they gave you more character choices, and I found out certain weapons can be only used by certain people. I find that odd, considering that Kenji is the percission guy, yet Jack, the strength guy, gets a sniper + sniper mod basically. I plan to play a few more hours tomorrow to estimate how long this is going to go. I LOVE the fact that this is multiplayer. Alot of aspects in the game prove it to be mainly a multiplayer game. There can be Co-op, ONL. Multiplayer, and Challenges. I unfortuantly haven't made any time to play with my friends however. I need to find a flint and an iron sheet to upgrade my flint helmet to a reinforced flint helmet so I can go take on that bloater over there without losing more than 25% of my base health.			"

												This game is really good. When i bought it and had a look at the screenshots i wasn't really impressed, however the gameplya and the use of imagiation in the game have really brought it together. I like this game alot. Its one of those games that you need a friend to play with to be able to have more fun than what you usually would. I like how its no first person- there are too many games liek that. Thats what this game brings. A difference. I want to say that the online system is good, however the connection between players is poor as me and my friend at first found it a little hard to roam around with all of the stoapges needed to be made. I also don't like the quick constant spawn of zombies that appear as soon as you leave an area. There should be a bigger spawn time. But I like the crafting system and hunting system in the game. If i had to rate this, It would be 9/10 for the online and 10/10 for the game experience.			"

												This game popped up on Steam looking like Torchlight II with less cartoony graphics and focused on survival. So I got it on day one.Note BEFORE you buy:MULTIPLAYER: Currently you can play only ""Challenge Mode"" online with a friend, and the Story Mode can be played offline (same machine), which makes some sense for Console Gamers, but is nonsense for the PC. Also, the camera is shared and locked between the two players, a design decision which annoy any gamer in the world, I guess.The Story Mode Online CoOp is being developed, but if the shared camera is used, it will go bad.SURVIVAL: Surviving in an island that zombies pop up from nowhere without explanation, which food is spread all over, there's water and shelter ready and available in most areas. Don't buy it for the Survival aspect. Seriously.Graphics are fine, Audio is fine but lacks diversity (also, the ""creepy atmospheric sounds"" made me turn music off), Gameplay is kind of fun once you understand the game and can craft quickly, but there's not enough Content to really make this a big thing.The Presentation is weird. During gameplay, the game tries to install a creepy vibe (and fails), and during the tutorial videos (Kovac's Rules) it tries to play a Fallout-style ""you can die horribly but it's FUN!"" sarcastic theme that doesn't play along with the game.How long? Story Mode can be finished in less than 8 hours, 100%, if you know how to rush.Finally, Challenge Mode throws you in an island and you must find a plane and escape as quickly as possible. This does well for replayability, but still doesn't add any new content after you finished the game. However, IT IS fun having to think fast and craft enough weapons to survive the situation you're in (too bad the diversity is very low here).TL:DR: This had great potential, but..If it's over 10 bucks, look for something else.Or let it be your ""guilty pleasure"" for one day or two.

												Zombies around, but not the only way you can bite the dust?  Yessir,  to survive, you need to make sure you've got food, water and rest...or your dead...if not from being torn apart by ravenous undead, then by being a shriveled up corpse because you failed to gather the necessary chow and water to survive. Pretty fun game.  Co-op is fun.  Just got the game today and have not yet completed the story campaign yet, but it's pretty entertaining.  After my brother saw me playing, he got it too, so I started over with him with it co-op style.  Enjoyable.  I think the retail price, you'd be getting a bang for your buck.. Currently there's a 75% off deal.  Jokes on you if you miss this entertaining tidbit at this steal of a price.And remember kids, eat your honey.-Albear Einstein			"

												This game is a nice little time waster, i haven't put many hours into it as of yet, but the time i did spend playing, i found to be enjoyable. I just can't seem to get addicted to it, the game play is just lacking. I felt as though i was grinding trivial quests rather than surviving, the food, hunger and sleep mechanics can be a pain for the most part. But once you get a nice little routine going, it's almost unnoticable.Overall its a decent game, good for the sale price, NOT the full price. "

												This game is a lot of fun.  It has a few aiming quirks, and inconsistencies with onscreen key-presses not reflecting changed bindings during the tutorial, but once I got past the initial intro the game really started to shine.  The basic story mode is a mostly linear progression through 5 islands.  It quickly ramped up my power, but the added DLC and side quests really gave it charm.  I'd recommend this game for anyone that loves Isometric RPG/Action games.			"

												(I played only single player story mode) Not bad so far. Easy to understand. I like game mechanics, charcter advancement and crafting system.  Dificulty seems to be right. What I hate is camera position and its movemet. It makes the game quite often very confusing and player can do nothing about that. I wish camera angle was adjustable If not freely then at least in 90 degree steps. That would make the game much better. Because sometimes Im surounded by zombies an some fuc.ing obstacle like tree or shack prevents me to see my charcter and its frustrating when I die becuse I dont see properly what is going on. Anyway If you like zombie games I recomend to get it. Best during some special offer :-) Its not perfect but Its  quite enjoyable. Getting it for a deal price (like during this haloween special steam deal) its not definitely a disapointment :-) At least not for me :-)			"

												Crashlanded on a zombie-filled island, your goal is to survive. With a couple pointers from Kovac, you'll learn how to kill zombies, craft armor and weapons and find food/water/shelter.Can't say I particularily liked the story, but between the exploration, crafting, and combat mechanics it was a very acceptable waste of time. Game  is a little buggy and could be a bit more polished, but did not have any major issues. "

												I have 4 hours in this game. I just got it 4 hours ago. Currently I have been to each island yet not expored each island, and I can say this whole heartedly , im so excited on what im going to find next! This game pulled me in mainly because of the humour, the back story, and the main survival feel to it. The beginning tutorial is LONG, and I mean incredibly long. You get to the 3rd island ( which was about 3 hours in ) and your jsut getting out of it. I say that because they are still giving you instructions like your 10 and throwing a bunch of Kovac's books at you. Kovac is love, Kovac is life. He is the man with an accent. Love him. I feel he is going to help me out, but he may betray me in the end ( SPOILER ALERT {{ I mean he lent me a plane and all by me just asking. HIS PLANE }} ) Anyway this game shows minor humour a couple of bugs and glitches, and an interesting array of zombies to kill with a hatchet, sword, gun, bow, or boomerang ( NOTE : The boomerang is super O.P !!) I find myself intensely leaned in trying to see at night to make sure nothing is crawling up behind me, peering around corners for bloat guys, and constantly looking for a fuel tank to refil my stock of fire-arrows. This is immersion. I wish they gave you more character choices, and I found out certain weapons can be only used by certain people. I find that odd, considering that Kenji is the percission guy, yet Jack, the strength guy, gets a sniper + sniper mod basically. I plan to play a few more hours tomorrow to estimate how long this is going to go. I LOVE the fact that this is multiplayer. Alot of aspects in the game prove it to be mainly a multiplayer game. There can be Co-op, ONL. Multiplayer, and Challenges. I unfortuantly haven't made any time to play with my friends however. I need to find a flint and an iron sheet to upgrade my flint helmet to a reinforced flint helmet so I can go take on that bloater over there without losing more than 25% of my base health.			"

												I was quite skeptical about How to Survive. Ive played many a thoughless zombie shooter and honestly the genre doesnt advance much outside of indie developing, some of which doesn't pan out well. H2S is tons of fun, it plays like Diablo mixed with Dead Island. The crafting and leveling system is super fun and the combat is fun yet simple. H2S is up there with Project Zomboid, its interesting, fun, a little hard, and addictive. 8.75/10			"

												How to Survive was a very pleasant surprise. H2S is an isometric survival RPG set on zombie infested islands. The story is nothing to write home about - you're trapped on these islands and need to find parts for your plane to escape. But H2S perfectly scratches that itch that everyone has for killing hordes of zombies with a chainsaw and blowing their heads off with a shotgun. The game doesn't take itself too seriously, but the light-hearded humour and the bizzare characters in the campaign fit in well with the ridiculousness of murdering millions of zombies while weaing a head made out of an angry tapir's face (yes, you can do that). The crafting system is intuitive and keeping track of your hunger, thirst and need for rest adds an element of realism. There are some complaints. Gameplay itself can become a little repetitive, especially with the fast zombie respawns. However, H2S's strongest point is the co-op play. The campaign is a total blast to play with a friend, either locally or online. It's not a surival simulator, but H2S is a solid mix of action, crafting and survival and is well worth a play.			"

												one of the best and challenging survival/zombie apocolypse games that I have ever played, awesome crafting recipes and useful items, Kovac has to be the best character in the game and his guide is very useful, with the new dlc out called Kovac's way, it makes the game more challenging and fun.

												I bought this on a whim cause it was on sale and it totally won me over.  The gameplay is deliciously unpredictable the game elements are excelently balanced.  The graphics are average but the textures make the environment come to life around you.  The crafting system is a little clunky, but introduces further opportunities to specialize your approach to the game.  The story is nothing special, and maybe a little predictable, but it doesnt detract from the experience.  A highly enjoyable game with many hours of play.  I haven't tried the multiplayer (yet) but each of the challenge modes offer a unique experience from the other, and challenge you to take different approaches to how you play the game. I have 19 hours on a 3$ game and I do not plan on stopping there.  For the price its at, I think everyone should at least try it out.  9/10			"

												Pretty fun game, highly recommend playing with a game controller of your choice (prefer the xbox360 one myself).  The crafting system is enjoyable and once you get used to the controls (or have them set up the way your prefer) combat is enjoyable.  The difficulty is somewhat challenging, expect to die more than you are used to.			"

												Good game. Good action, nice shooting like the old classic game 'Alien Shooter', and a few melee attacks. Survival elements like getting foods and water add a nice flavor, but it is not the core of this game. If you are an experienced player of similar shooting or action games, I suggest the hard difficulty mode (Iron Man) from the begining, then you will taste a lot of deaths and alertness and some thrill.

												Personally i like this game a lot. Even tho it isnt like the usual first person zombie survival games , this game is very interesting in its own way. You have a large variety of possible weapons ( that you can create from basicly ..just trash )and the survival aspect really can be felt in this game. Having to watch over your HUNGER,THIRST and TIREDNESS is something extra to watch out for and it makes the game more intense.The only cons of this game : If you wana play COOP ...well you will wait decades for someone to join your coop session unfortunately.They did not hire any voice actors for the player characters.Also the game wouldv been a lot better if we could make our own choices.( something like The Walking Dead game or The Wolf Amongs Us )      Im talking about having a choice to make in conversations.

												One of the best local co-op experiences I had so far. A definitive recommendation if you like to play with a friend/girlfriend and two gamepads.One awesome thing is how, they solved the problem of local co-op combined with an rpg system. In this game one player can access the menu for his inventory, skilltree and equiptment without interrupting the other player, who can continue to fight/walk and even open his own menu.The story might not be the most awesome one, but i wouldn't say it is bad. It still has some small twists and keeps you going.I also recommend playing (a second time) on the hardest difficulty setting, which is called 'covacs way'. You have to plan and watch your resources more carefully.The one negative thing I'd say is, that it probably looses alot of it fun-factor when playing alone.			"

												Played the first 5 minutes with a friend. The screen doesn't focus on your character alone, so you're forced to play together and can't do your own thing. This makes combat very strange, since if player one walkes one way and the other gets attacked, he or she can't walk that way since the screen won't focus on the player. Movies don't work but they're a critical part in understanding the game. Don't buy this game.			"

												Rating: 6/10Fun Survival/Action RPG with a few shortcomings. The combat mechanics are satisfying as you get to kill zombies with various finishers and DIY weaponary. Creating items out of random loot looks cool but it isn't fleshed out very well. This is because the islands you explore is abundant with loot and you will always come across the most obvious. This makes things as easy as adding up 2 numbers. Of course this can be a good thing, but it makes the game lean towards Action rather than Survival. Of course the paid Difficulty DLC might fix it, but this doesn't count in the base game. The graphics are a bit dated and do have some glitches every now and then. But this hardly affects the overall gameplay experience, unless you are the kind of person who is all about good graphics. The game is also rather short so don't expect hours of entertainment out of it, and yes it doesn't have that much of a replay value either. But however I recommend the game because it is simple and fun for what it's worth. Buy it at a discount.			"

Everything is executed properly and very solid and i've yet to encounter any real bugs or glitches. I have so much fun in this game, i really enjoy finding the specific items to craft the ultimate armor.The only cons with this game are1. The low-impact perk/leveling system.2.Way to little inventory space (Needs upgradable bag) the  amount of time that you have to spend standing still to decide which items you want to drop and want to keep is extremely annoying. Especially since its a crafting game whereas you don't know which parts you may need in the future. "

												We all had that dream of being in a zombie apocalypse, tearing down through hordes of mindless brain-eaters as we show off our complete bad-assery. I know you have that dream but it’s not enough to just own a crossbow and ride a big bike towards the sunset. You’ve got to learn How to Survive! Developed by EKO Software and published by 505 Games, How to Survive is a survival RPG set on an unknown tropical, zombie-infested archipelago and your task is to find a way to leave the islands and survive while doing so!GRAPHICSThe game truly captures that “tropical island” feel with a very good graphics quality and it’s funny how when you are playing online, you could see other players’ tombstones on the area they died. Also, the character finishers are nothing but absolute awesomeness. The only thing I did not quite like with the graphics is the fact that being in isometric view, some loots appear so small and the marker sometimes does not help in locating or identifying them. (Grade: 89%)AUDIOWhile Kovac’s voice acting is comedic gold, I think the atmosphere of the game is quite inconsistent if you’re going to judge it by listening to the audio. All throughout, you would hear an eerie background music but then Kovac starts talking to you with his dark humor or you start reading some texts from the survival guide. All of a sudden, the game gives you that light, happy feeling which is in complete contradiction with the background music. In addition to this, I find it worth mentioning that there is a big audio glitch that reveals too much of the story way before it is supposed to happen. I won’t dive into details to prevent spoilers but you’ll know when you see (or hear) it. (Grade: 45%)GAMEPLAYInventory management; scarce supplies especially on higher difficulty; dynamic weather system; day and night cycle with the threat increasing at night; hunger, thirst, and energy meters, what else would you want for a zombie survival game? Even fishing is realistic! There is only one thing I did not like with the game’s great gameplay mechanics – there is way TOO MUCH ammo even in the hardest difficulty. Once you get your first gun, you can just forget about your melee weapons and just shoot your way to freedom. It kind of destroys the “look-for-resources feel” of the game. (Grade: 95%)STORYI don’t think there is any depth in How to Survive’s story. Right from the beginning, you can guess who the main villain is and the quests, both main and secondary, are just your standard “go and fetch” quests. There’s no background story for the characters nor the setting, as well as the infection. You’re basically there to fetch things for people so that they can help you get off the archipelago. (Grade: 65%)REPLAYABILITYWith the different characters having different skill sets, it is quite interesting to see how you change your gameplay style with each character. In addition to this, the DLCs added new game modes and game difficulties that would certainly stretch your time mastering the art of survival! (Grade: 98%)FINALSIf you are looking for a survival RPG game with a light story and a magnificent gameplay then this game is worth a shot. Despite the lackluster storyline and the confusing audio and atmosphere, I really think that How to Survive delivers quite well in terms of enjoyment, gameplay quality and, of course, hard lessons on how to survive an archipelago full of brain-hungry zombies!FINAL GRADE: 78% It's okay but Kovac wants a perfect score!

												Not the best RPG on the market. The quests are kind of dry and the skill tree is a joke. On easy your hero is kind of broken, so there's no chalange what so ever (just go from point a to b mostly and kill some zombies in between). Yet I'm having fun with it. It's a cheesy surviaval-zombie game. I enjoy killing zombies and crafting weapons and the surviaval aspect (again if you're not going for the easiest difficulty) is not bad implemented. I'm also fond of the humor in it. The Kovack Guides are fun and his rushian accent cracks me up. (+the cat quest)  If it's on sale go for it (I myselve got it really cheap with the dlc included).

Great variety of enemies. From night zombies to piranha zombies...I had great fun in local coop, keyboard + controller, with 12 hours of game.Absolutely reccomanded.			"

												1) There are far better zombie survival games for single player. However, I don't know many that you can play in local co-op. This may be fun for that.2) El Diablo DLC is almost as big as the main game, but it's buggy.3) There are nice achievements for completionists. "

												Honestly i don't see how anyone could dislike this game. Theres not a single thing to dislike. It's a solid. Well built game. Everything is executed properly and very solid and i've yet to encounter any real bugs or glitches. I have so much fun in this game, i really enjoy finding the specific items to craft the ultimate armor.The only cons with this game are1. The low-impact perk/leveling system.2.Way to little inventory space (Needs upgradable bag) the  amount of time that you have to spend standing still to decide which items you want to drop and want to keep is extremely annoying. Especially since its a crafting game whereas you don't know which parts you may need in the future. "

												Rating: 6/10Fun Survival/Action RPG with a few shortcomings. The combat mechanics are satisfying as you get to kill zombies with various finishers and DIY weaponary. Creating items out of random loot looks cool but it isn't fleshed out very well. This is because the islands you explore is abundant with loot and you will always come across the most obvious. This makes things as easy as adding up 2 numbers. Of course this can be a good thing, but it makes the game lean towards Action rather than Survival. Of course the paid Difficulty DLC might fix it, but this doesn't count in the base game. The graphics are a bit dated and do have some glitches every now and then. But this hardly affects the overall gameplay experience, unless you are the kind of person who is all about good graphics. The game is also rather short so don't expect hours of entertainment out of it, and yes it doesn't have that much of a replay value either. But however I recommend the game because it is simple and fun for what it's worth. Buy it at a discount.			"

												Not the best RPG on the market. The quests are kind of dry and the skill tree is a joke. On easy your hero is kind of broken, so there's no chalange what so ever (just go from point a to b mostly and kill some zombies in between). Yet I'm having fun with it. It's a cheesy surviaval-zombie game. I enjoy killing zombies and crafting weapons and the surviaval aspect (again if you're not going for the easiest difficulty) is not bad implemented. I'm also fond of the humor in it. The Kovack Guides are fun and his rushian accent cracks me up. (+the cat quest)  If it's on sale go for it (I myselve got it really cheap with the dlc included).

												A change from most survival games, this game feels fresh and right out of the oven, and just like newly made bread, it feels good, it looks good, and it pays off, this is a game that unlike most zombie survivals makes you feel like you are learning as you play it, every step you make its one more step to a better you, the way this tutorial is presented trough out the game is really silly and funny but it will give you the information you need. On the other hand, personally it crashes for me when i sometimes sleep, or im reaching certain areas, i noticed this is completly random and seems to be trigered by magic. as for dlc, i wouldt worry too much, worth it on an offert sale, otherwise just ignore it and enjoy the game!

												So much fun!Lots of islands to explore and lots of zombies to slay. All sorts of sidequests. Entertaining, light-hearted humor. You can find materials and mix them together to make all sorts of neat items. Runs smoothly for me, though my boyfriend had a few minor lag spikes. Some interesting enemies, some generic ones.Really the only things I don't like about this game are that it seems to be limited at 2 people for multiplayer and you share a screen (which can be a bit of an annoyance at times).Oh yeah, and the lightning sucks. I hate the lightning. The lightning is really annoying. Fortunately it only seems to be a major factor on one of the seven or so islands in the game.Also, don't throw your boomerang out right before talking to someone. If the boomerang is in mid-air when a conversation starts, it seems to result in the boomerang ceasing to exist. That's the only major glitch I've found so far though, and is easily enough avoided.Overall I would definitely recommend this game (especially for the summer sale price). It has been very entertaining and offers fun times with friends and a good amount of replay value :)			"

												I bought this game when it first came out and I played the challenges with my friend, it was really fun and interesting; and once you knew what to do and where to go the game got a bit easier. With the addition of the Kovac's Way DLC & Story mode co-op, my interest in the game was renewed and very fun. Bottom line is, I do recommend this game however, I dont recommend it at its base price. Buy it when its 4$ and itll be a good 4$ spent. Playing with a friend and using the chainsaw on them is worth another 4$ too :)			"

												How To Survive combines Survival Horror concepts with Diablo-style gameplay. It's a good choice for anyone who dislikes the old ""tank""-like controls of older Survival Horror games. Here's a chance to play one with more natural-feeling controls. You also earn experience points for killing zombies and accomplishing other tasks, and can level up a total of 15 levels. Each level gain allows you to choose a new skill for your character. There are three different characters to choose from and each has certain skills that are unique to him/her. The game also has an interesting weapon, armor, and item combination system in which you can combine items to create new and sometimes more powerful ones. If it sounds like it would be too complicated, don't worry because there are cards scattered around the game world that tell you exactly how to make different items and you can always access them again from the main menu.Some of the dialogue is juvenile (a lot of swearing), and there isn't much of a plot, but it does have a twisted sense of humor, especially in the guides from the enigmatic masked Kovac character that you can pick up throughout the game (and also access later from your menu).There are some challenging parts, particularly when you have to clear out a shelter from a horde of zombies. As you progress through the game, you'll have to redo earlier areas (the game is divided into four islands) occasionally, but each time you go back, new and more difficult monsters appear, some of which may cause you to rethink your strategies for getting through an area. There are boss fights, but one downside is that every boss is the same monster. It gains one new ability each time you fight him, but overall, once you know how to deal with him, he isn't that tough. There is a harder difficulty setting (though it's only marginally more difficult - I heard the item drops were supposed to be more rare, but I didn't notice a huge difference), and a Challenge mode for those who want to get more out of it.I bought this game when it was on sale, so I believe I got my money's worth out of it. I'm not sure I can recommend buying it at full price, but if it goes on sale and you like Survival Horror games and/or Diablo clones, it may be worth checking out. Just one word of caution for cat lovers: There is a part involving a dead cat. Good news is that it's already dead when you find it.Rating: 3.5/5			"

Но не заряжай его в магазин ибо можешь его проебать — выстрелить им. Найди другой пистолет и держи его при себе.Другая памятка:-Не паникуй.-Зомби-апокалипсис прекрасная мотивация для занятий спортом! В спортивной форме ты всегда сможешь убежать от зомби!-Захвати еду, питьевую воду, радиоприёмник, фонари, оружие и отступай в безопасное место.-В качестве точки для обороны лучше выбрать большой магазин или торговый центр (вот только не в электроники, ты же не будешь жрать телевизоры, да?) — там не будет проблем с едой и припасами.-Держись как можно дальше от плотно населенных районов — там будет больше всего заражённых.-Забаррикадируй все выходы, держись любой ценой.-Не позволяй окружить себя, не дай загнать себя в угол или какое-либо тесное пространство.-Помни, любой человек, укушенный или убитый зомби — прямая угроза тебе и твоим товарищам. Убей его, пока он не убил тебя.-Терпеливо ожидай помощи, но готовься к долгому выживанию.-Никогда не идите в места, где тишина. Там могут быть зомби.-Если убить зомби, обмазать одежду мертвечиной, возможно вы станете своим среди чужих.-Лучший совет по выживанию — запомнить как поступают ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ в фильмах про зомби и делать наоборот.

												I really wish I could love this game, but this game leaves me in saddness. I played enough of this game to see where it was going, it was fun at first, but the other people in this game just leaves you bored, and wanting them to just die already.this game only drags you on to get to know the main guy, and that guy is Kovac. I really liked what they did for him, He reminded me of a guy in borderlands, but if that is the only reason for playing then you sould just skip this game all together or watch a youtube video on itNow I do have a good part to say about itThe graphics are really nice, and the diablo feel of fighting feels nice, and not clunky, and that is really all I haveNow for one more bady part about this game is the co-op... I played this game with my girlfriend, and how she felt in the game was like a helper in fable two, meaning she was freaking useless, and the game used her like there wasn't a co-op player. That pisses me offSKIP THIS GAME!			"

												This game was a huge disappointment. I really wanted to like it. There are some cool things like combining items to make weapons and ammo, but it gets old fast and the three different characters don't feel distinct enough.  Elements of the controls make fighting large hordes of zombies awkward. When you die it tends to be because you just couldn't get your character to run in the right direction. Aiming  can be equally a pain as the auto tracking jumps everywhere. I have to say I haven't hated a game this much in a long time. The sprinkles on top are the odd bugs like the cursor vanishing randomly until you exit out the menu or sound effects from your weapons continuing on in a loop after you've fired. The only thing i regret more than buying this is the fact that I wasted 14 hours of my life hoping this would get better. You can't polish a turd.			"

												The game is short. Worse, it is a grinding game that is maxed at level 15 which limits skills learnt based on different character. Crafting logic is average and is limited. contextual controls is a little illogical. Some may say that there is more to come as there is download content section but the whole core of the game was a little bad. I have never played Diablo 3 before but I would rather play Diable 3 than How to Survive...			"

												It's a boring game. You are supposed to combine everyting on your hand to craft useful tools. But the actual elements and combinations are very limitied. The gaming is highly repetitive. There are only a few kinds of enemies, items, and actions. It is worth the price though, which is only $2.5 with a deal and a promotion code on Amazon.			"

												Like the title implies it's all about surviving (and scavenging for supplies). Create your weapons, armor and cook food from scratch - Anything you can find will be useful since you just got shipwrecked in the middle of nowhere.Each of the 3 playable characters have their own strength and weakness and it's up to you to sharpen them up when coming face to face with zombies in all shapes, literally. Specialize your choice of character with the skill tree, so they're suited for your survival strategies.Brush up your knowledge with ""Kovac's Rules"" survival handbook that are scattered all over map.Besides the story mode, there's also a challenge mode that you can play with a friend. The developers are really attentive with community and I will tell you why. When the game came out it featured local co-op for the story mode, but as you can imagine we want to play with people from all over the world without having to be sitting next to them. The developers heard the outcry and they're implementing an online co-op mode, RESPECT EKO SOFTWARE!Peace.			"

												This game is such an addicting game. It combines the fighting aspect like Diablo and the crafting of it too but puts it in a more ""realistic"" frame of reference. The story line is very enertaining, and it is made in such a way that you could just kill zombies all day. LOVE IT			"

												Probably one of the worst games I've ever played. Please do not waste your money on this. Controls are bad, multiplayer is bugged beyond belief. There is no sense of consequence while playing multiplayer, you can revive your partner an unlimited amount of times to half health. So the few threats in the game are easily overcome but having one person sacrifice themselves and the other just use ranged waepons (which the first ranged gun you get ~40 minutes into the game kills things in 1 hit). Also when you play multiplayer all of the quest items go to the first player, so the second player gets nothing. These are just a few of the fundamental problems with the game, there is 0 fun to be had while playing this. Please avoid.			"

												This Game is VERY Repetitive.  i mean, once you learn something through a character in the main story, you'll come across a Chapter in Kovac's Rules (The How to Survive Book) when you already know what to do in that chapter due to the character that has set you a mission telling you before.Enemy Design is just Recycled Zombies & Crawlers.During the Night, Crawlers will come out and you have to defend yourself using a Flashlight.. The Flashlight Controls are Terrible. I Couldn't even tell if i was controlling it with my Mouse or my Keyboard. Also something i found very funny, i had my control's set to Mouse & Keyboard, and it was showing me XBOX CONTROLS.. Also, this Game Relies on it's Comedy Factor.. It's not at all Funny.  The Jokes & Comedy are Poorly Written, and the Voice Acting is the worst thing i've ever heard.. Because i can't even hear the dialog. the Music & Sound Effects took over character dialog which ment i had to read the subtitles. even if you turn down the sound effects & music, it doesn't adjust at all.All in all, if you want to pick this game up wait for it to go on sale. it's weak and doesn't deserve the limelight it has gotten when there are indie games out there that people actually take there time with.Game Score: 3/10			"

												My son & I usually dont like top down games but we really really enjoyed this one on xbox when we played. so fun! So being we have a house full of game lovers I bought it on PC figuring we would all play together. NO WAY! The controls on PC SUCK!!!! it was never ported right AT ALL! so disappointing! I can play fluidly on xbox but on here I end up moonwalking to hit something and hit my son more than i do the zombies. WE HATE THE PC CONTROLS! they didnt change anything over to be pc friendly. even the instructions are still for xbox. lazy omg. I DO RECOMMEND THIS GAME ON XBOX! But I DO NOT recommend this game for PC. Wish I had not wasted my money on all 3 of these for pc based off of loving it on xbox. FIX YOUR GAME FOR PC!			"

Even worse though, it doesn't save on quit, you need to either complete a mission or travel to a different island to save your game.A disappointment all round.			"

												Where should i start... I don't know should i laugh or cry. At graphical and visual stand point game is quite good, but everything else is just dreadful. In game UI is just painful to watch, extremely small inventory (oh, you have chance to expand it only twice and even then it's not enough, 5 * 2 = 10, yeah, by 10 slots). It would make sense if you could actually craft stash and then put some items/tools in it, so you had bit space in your inventory, but no, instead, game wants you to decide to drop items somwhere in islands and then try to remember where did you scatter particular item/tool.Combat is the worst in this game. Your ability to kill zombie is by charging your item/weapon to maximum, because it will either hardly injure it or land killing blow, now keep in mind this sentence, when there is zombie horde that are running toward you, there is no chance to actually charge fast enough your hit to kill each on of them, so they surround you and you can't do anything about that because character does not know how to at least kick zombies off, light hitting is useless because you won't even kill one zombie by the time they will kill you. While fighting huge zombie/skeleton, he can throw other zombies right through barricades because you know, why the hell not.Survivng night in safehouse, guess what, suddenly zombie deer spawns 2 meters near you, then he sees you and tries to get in, he runs in front of gate then to the left, then back, then to the right and guess what, he got in SAFEHOUSE. HOW EVEN MORE BROKEN THIS GAME CAN BE?Gameplay wise short, repetitive and boring. I wouldn't call it survival, because in which game zombies will spawn out of nowhere in front of you. No idea how is the COOP, because i won't bother to play this horrible game again.			"

												This game is an absolute ♥♥♥♥ing mess. From the tone to the mechanics to the crafting system to the boss fight, there is always something to break.The game broke its own tone right from the start: It's the zombie apocalypse, except on an island! Oh, and there's two characters who the zombies run right past and ignore despite being fleshy treats to snack on. And there's also talking monkeys who ask you to find them gold artifacts. And you make your own guns. So it's a lot like Day of the Dead mixed with ♥♥♥♥ing Looney Tunes.I broke the crafting system progression by merely experimenting. I got the most powerful and cost efficient weapon (a three-winged boomerang covered in flint) not even halfway through just by ♥♥♥♥ing around with the crafting system, and only stopped using it to play with the other, more neglected weapons. I was able to make it even more powerful and game-breaky by using a redstone on it, which gives the weapon 50% more damage. This is like duct-taping Mjollnir to a ♥♥♥♥ing tactical thermonuclear missile.I broke the thin, easily controllable zombie hordes with my super-powerful boomerang. There are big boss zombies which are the Tanks from Left 4 Dead, but you can easily exploit the enviroment to keep them from ever reaching you while you make headshot after headshot on said boss zombie.The final horde battle is a 72-size Comic Sans exclamation point on the whole five page design document written by a high school kid hopped up on zombie films, Hunter S. Thompson's writing style, and Four Loko. In that battle, you're drawn into a seemingly unwinnable scenario, hitting all the zombies with everything you've got. It seems like a lost cause until you find the big cheat spot all the way on the western side of the arena, which has rocks that you can slowly climb up on and use to fall out of the boundaries of the arena. Then you can walk around the outside of said arena, pick the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t murder spot which suits your fancy the most, and effortlessly kill the ineffectual zombie hordes, including the Tank. When I did this in my playthrough, I lured most of the monsters under the bridge I was next to so they were humping the wall I was standing on, and threw Molotovs at them until the game told me I was the winner. HOWEVER: This game is still fun because it's so god damn broken, and I still recommend it over Dead Island. Dead Island is a real ♥♥♥♥ing snooze to play. However, I don't recommend it to anyone not interested in breaking video games over their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ knees.			"

												Another indie game that deserves recognition! How To Survive is similar to Diablo in the sense that you have the same isometric camera angle and you eliminate tons of enemies - this time, however, it's zombies instead of demons.You can pick one from the available 3 protagonists - each has different strength and their skill tree is also different. Attributes change automatically - when levelling up after a set amount of XP you get to decide only which skill to pick.Our heroes pretty soon meet Kovac, a mysterious fellow fully dressed in armor, who provides us with guidance as to how to survive. He explains eating, drinking, sleeping and the importance of - most of all - weapon crafting. There are dozens of items out there and they can be combined in various ways. When looting you'll bump into new guides regularly and these can be looked at from the menu.I like how many types of foods could be made to quickly quell our hunger or thirst. A special fruit or root even eliminated our tiredness. Sleeping is only possible at select locations - these are shackles that must be rid of the walking dead before they can be entered. Not only sleeping but saving our progress is done at these locations. You find materials, you eliminate zombies, you pick up some herbs and fruits, you loot, free some locations, rinse and repeat. This is How to Survive in a nutshell. There are some side missions, extra difficulty levels and a separate challenge mode offering even more entertainment.While an indie game How To Survive looks very decent. Once night falls new enemies appear who try to jump at you from behind. Your flashlight, however, provides the very source they are afraid of. This and fire are especially nice and I liked the fog effect, as well. The game employs some excellent physics effect, too. My favourite weapon from halfway through till the very end of the story was a boomerang I reinforced greatly with some bones and flint. Initially, however, melee will do along with a bow which you also get to make better and better.In any case, I found How To Survive an entertaining experience. Too bad some difficulty levels (including new enemies and weather effects) and additional locations are only available in the form of DLCs. Make no mistake: if you liked it you'll probably pick them up, too, it's just a shame they have to rely on the same concept as some of the AAA developer companies do.When discounted give How To Survive a try. But just the base game. And if you like Kovac and you accept his rules you can collect the DLCs, as well.			"

Rather than ""surviving"" you are really just clicking a bunch of times to do fetch quests from point A to point B while picking up loot. The graphics are poor, the action boring and there is nothing here that hasn't been done a hundred times better in similar free games like Path of Exile.Not worth your time.			"

												TL;DR: Good to kill some time. 3/5Fairly decent zombie game. This is not ROAM or anything like it (if anyone was confused about that). More like a very basic Diablo-clone in that it's sort of an action RPG with guns.Rather unbalanced. The best weapon in the game can be accessed by any character by the second level, which is the flint edged tripple bone boomerang. It is infinite uses and doesn't break. Once you add the golden augment to it, deals massive damage pretty quickly.I played most of my game with the bow until I found the boomerang and then even using guns seemed pointless. I suppose you could refrain from using the best weapon in the game, which would make things a little bit harder, but ultimately there isn't much challenge in this game.The survival elements are a little weak and aren't a huge factor once you spec into the tree that reduces the time required to spend on it. It ends up being more of a chore and a hinderance to backtrack through the islands for water or meat. Fishing is a waste of time and doesn't really work. (I'd only do it once to complete the fish n' chips quest for the Monkey.)The critical aiming mechanic is unique and I like it, having to time the circle for headshots.Story is a bit mediocre, but Kovac's Rules are amusing. It's a rather tounge-in-cheek game.If you don't have any other games to play and you want to kill a few hours, this isn't the most horrible game ever.			"

												I met this dude who got bit and he told me to get some @#$%in' drugs so I ripped some plants out of the ground and force fed him those. He was all right. Mission accomplished.He said to look for his old boyfriend who I found hangin' out on a beach surrounded by @#$%in' zombies! Like, how old you gotta be to know that zombies=bad? Damn. And he was on crutches 'cause he sawed off his own @#$%in' leg. Man, that's hardcore.This old dude and I become butt-buddies and he sends me on a series of fetch quests to get rope and engines and batteries, blah blah blah. On one of these missions, I meet the guy from Dead Space who's all like ""woo I am an angel, come to my secret lair and I'll give you my gun"" *wink wink*No thanks, Dead Space guy. But I go with him anyway and learn a whole @#$%-ton more about crafting. I learned some pretty sweet @#$% from this guy. So I get sucked off by a bunch of zombie @#$%in' ostriches and start selling drugs to monkeys for mystic sigils.I finally get a little creeped out by Dead Space guy and split to go find my crippled BFF. He's aight, just kickin' it on another island. Then there are these planes and a 9/11 conspiracy and little girls and a fishing sidequest. I @#$%in' love fishing sidequests.TL:DR4 islands of increasing sizecramped but great inventory / craftingloads of zombies but it doesn't seem tediousprobably fun onlinelots of opportunities to min/maxlinear gameplay w/ sidequestsMy only beef with this game is that you walk too @#$%in' slow.8/10			"

												How to survive was a huge surprise to me on how well the game actually plays. At first using the KB/Mouse was a tad tedious with the 3/4th view/camera and wonky walking angles but I got use to it quite quickly and by the end I didn't even notice it anymore.It took me about 8.5 Hours to beat the story mode on Normal, so it's not a long game but not a 2 hour sit and done game. Only issue I had was the inventory/crafting system. Finding all the materials to build/resupply your weapons was actually fun but the limited inventory space means you will spend more time micomanaging it then playing the game.Overall, it was a fun game and I could recommend to just about everyone.

												Okay, so I decided after playing this game I was going to write a review to help others. First, I must say, this game is Diabloesque with a lot of emphasis on 'esque'. Although many people would like you to believe this is a comparable game it simply is not. My first impression was cool, Diablo, zombies, survival. Nope. What I got was clunky controls poorly designed. I literally died a number of times because although I was moving one way, I would turn around hitting the air behind me and not the zombie in front of me. That is rough when you are being chased by a horde. So I went in to adjust the control settings, nope same results. All in all, if this game does have a great story, tons of humor, and an amazing crafting system all of this falls short with poor programing. I am personally tired of wasting hard earned money on someones ridicules idea of how games should be designed. Leave this to the professionals and get out of the business. Giving people eye candy and promising this or that simply does not compare to state of the art programing. I remember games like Baldaur's Gate and Fallout 1 and 2, even Icewind Dale, those were great games created perfectly. Stop greenlighting horrible games and stop wasting people's money. I do hope the developers take this review to heart. You may have my money now but you have not captured my heart nor will your company receive my backing in the future.			"

												Top down survival horror. The crafting system is pretty straight forward and assists in telling you what can be combined. The day night cycle is a nice touch with a type of zombies spawning only at night but is driven back by any kind of light, but has no bearing on your sleep meter. The food/drink/sleep meter works well, but I never had to worry about it as food and water was plentiful. Sleep was only an issue if I had to clear the nearest bunker prior to using it for sleep. I felt that for the first 25% of the game a lit torch did a pretty good job of killing everything, then using a crafted rifle that pierced enemies worked for the rest of the game. The game drags on later when you have to run across a lot of ground to get from quest to quest and a zombie deer proved to be one of the hardest enemies with it's turn radius/speed/knockdown which seemed overpowered.

												A decent tounge in cheek zombie adventure with what so far seems like a fair balance in difficulty. I also enjoy crafting. Little frustrated by controls and can't find the recipe screen. The tombstones are a nice added touch; kinda like Dark Souls in that aspect. 9/10			"

												I really like the gameplay in this game. It's lots of fun for hours. The combat is pretty good and this game doesent have like any bugs and glitches. But one thing over all, that i love in this game is crafting and pimpin' your weapons. The possibilities of crafting in this game are unlimited, you can do so much s**t, it never gets old. The characters in story mode are also pretty epic, the voice acting is good and this game is actaully sometimes pretty funny. It's also pretty nice that this game is really kindda realistic, you do some s**t that you would actually do in real life too, to survive in such stranded island. 8½/10, I really recommend this, and it's not even too expensive! Totally worth it			"

												The price is fair for me, but others may feel differently, so I will go into details over my gripes with the game and 505.Business Model: An extra difficulty setting for and extra 1.99 USD. This is the definition of bad DLC, something that should most certainly be an update or should have been included in the main game. Right now at 2.24 USD the game is worth it. I would say 5 USD and you have a good deal. If 505 Games had released all of the DLC to date for free, then I would fully support them and their price. However it is rather annoying when small things find their way as purchasable DLC. Extra content is worth buying after you already paid for the game, only when it actually adds extra content. Not just slight coding adjustments for diffuculty, or character reskins with a few ability changes.About the Game: It is a linear ""post apoc"" story on an Island. You will revisit  some parts of the island several times, and when the story is so linear like it is, that's a bad thing. Sure you can chose to go left or right to get to your objective, but that is about all the choice you have in big decisions like ""what to do next"". Gameplay is smooth, and so are the controls with mouse or joypad.  You can hunt, scavenge, and craft. However with a crafting system that goes in tiers, it limits your need for hunting/scavenging once you have made the gear you want. For instance lets say rabbits make tier 1, once you finish crafting that tier there will no longer be any use for rabbits. I feel like this is a big failure for a game about survival, I don't feel like I am in a survival situation when I pass items and say ""nah I don't need that, already made my larger knapsack.""Closing thoughts: If you can get it on sale, or you aren't concerned about trading 15 USD to something you may only put an hour or two into, then it is worth picking up. A good one to save for one of those ""ISP failure"" days. Or get a friend to join you in the co op. In my opinion, 15 USD would be fair if they were doing a little free update here and there to make the game more replayable. I payed full price for it, and my only major complaint is the fact that they want me to pay 2 more USD to make the game more difficult. Open the game to modders, and a difficulty tweaking mod would be made within days.			"

												Nice little game, best bought on sale.Combat is rather slow-paced and tactical (lol) - you can't run much, you need to aim carefully and prioritize tartegs to conserve ammo or to damage armored zombies etc. So, while the game let's you craft and use a full-auto shotgun with incendiary ammo - it's not always the best choice :)Crafting is simple, but fun. Most of the time you can disassemble previously crafted stuff and re-use the mats.			"

I was in luck, because I was going to buy this game someday and give it a try, but didn't want to pay 14 euros for it.Now I think I could have used that 1,39 euros for something better.There are few pros in this game, but the rest of the game was un-enjoyable. Pros- Crafting- Voice-acting could be good with animated facesCons- Inventory gets full quickly- There are so few places to sleep & save in- Movement is somewhat stuttering- Main story is ridiculous (and there are talking monkeys on the islands, wtf?)- Everything is taught and the feeling of discovery is gone- 14 euros for this is way too much "

												this game is actually pretry rad,only played a small bit picked it up yesterday on sale for less than 4 bucks and worth every penny sure it seems it will be a quick game (some folks have said somewhere round 6 hrs max for story mode) but to be honest depneding on what the developer has intended for furture releases it could get really big and heaps better by way of the old dlc system to be honest i would quite happily pay a few bucks every couple of months for exta story packs and more chalenges the only thing that irks me so far is the need to use keys to move the dude (if you are not accustomed to this style it gets a little clunky but eventually you get the hang of it) i'd personally preffer it left click to move right click to attack or if it was awsd at least make the dude go forward when hitting w instead of a,dosent seem to be able to be customised? but on the whole really well made game reminds me a lot of orginal far cry textures ,crafting system is al most identical to orgianl res evil,gameplay is very similar to diablo (action hack/slash) cept u get guns sure it is every straight forward but for 4 bucks and being a zombie fan you will dig on it 100% worth getting behind and hoping they bring out more islands or better yet the ability to eventually survive the island and travel home only to discover the world is ravaged by the zombie horde... i could see a great sqaud based rts elemnt being added to this games mehcanic no sweat 10 out of 10			"

												Excellent game! How to Survive isn't your average zombie game like Left4Dead, Dead Rising, Resident Evil, etc.. It's more than that, due to the fact that the point of the game ISN'T to just kill some zambambos. You will find yourself hunting animals for food, scavenging plants for medicine, building new armor and weapons, and sometimes even fishing, which was a suprise to me, since not many games include fishing as a semi-major point in the game. The downside was the repetitiveness. The hunting, scavenging, fishing, and killing gets a little boring after a while of playing the game. I know that it's not a big game, so I don't expect miracles out of it, and every game has it's downside so I kind of expected this. But they could have at least added some more objectives and things to do, though.Score: 6/10			"

												Its got something special about the game that is quiet fun, but the graphics after a Kovac's rule video screw up and turn everything super white and I can barely see. So I had to go through the game not watching any of the rules... Pretty screwy that no buddy caught this type of mess up in testing... I beat the game then tried the challenge games, but since Kovac has to pop up everytime to tell me how to play the challenge I can't see a damn thing. So now I'm moving on to other games since I can't see... Although if you do plan on buying this game I'd suggest saving before you watch any of the Kovac rule books so you can reload the game -- as in, shut it down completely then come back into it. That will fix the graphic flip out.			"

												I bought the game because it looked kind of hilarious, though I didn't think the isometric view + zombies would work that well. Turns out to be surprisingly well-put together, with great sounds and amusing crafting system (I say amusing, because half the fun is in combining every possible thing together and seeing what you end up with). The inventory management is a bit aggravating - would love to have something as simple as a 'sort' button to clean up your inventory and make things easier to identify at a glance. The food/thirst/sleep factors are interesting to have, but you reach a point where food, in particular, just becomes a completely minor concern rather than the challenge it should be. Overall, enjoyable to play with friends, though probably not something I'd get much out of on my own.			"

												Enjoyable game and worth the price I paid. Not sure it's worth full price, but a good game all the same. The problem with the game is the usual progress curve issue where you're at your best near the end of the game and it's over just as you're enjoying it. It's also a bit weird how the undead deer and emus are the most dangerous (apart from the gargantua style zombies).Overall, worth a playthrough.			"

												I am a huge fan of the rising emphasis on survival elements in video games, and this game did not disappoint. There is a deep sense of satisfaction to be had when you crush a zombie's head in with a stone axe you just crudely made. Aside from a few grumbles with the lack of camera control, a had a blast. The combat stays entertaining throughout your playthrough, and the sheer plethora of items you can craft is impressive.

												This action packed game teaches you how to survive in a island filled with zombies.If you can't find out how to know the basic controls and how you should take care of yourself,don't worry, you can find yellow guide books that shows you a video clip that teaches you the basics,each chapter book appears when the time is right.Now to the gameplay.You can get hungry, thirsty, and tired. That's one good thing about it.You have 3 different characters to play as, each character has its own special ability.You can level up, upgrade skills and create homemade weapons using for example diving tanks, tubes and scopes.After all this game has alot of crafting recipes.And that's not the best; You can also play co-op mode online or even 2 players in 1 computer(requires a xbox360 control or any other controls similar to it).Please note that this game doesn't have any endless mods of any sort if you rather prefera game that has no ending. You can only play campaign and challenge mode which you can finish.			"

												""How to Survive"" can be a pretty intense game on the harder difficulties, even with a co-op partner in toe. But nonetheless, this isometric survival game focuses on the management of your inventory, basic needs whilst being alert for the next zombie ambush. and it makes the game a great couch co-op title. It's intense at times, with a little bit of a laugh or sigh of frustration on the side, it's a game that you shouldn't look past even with the saturation of the ""Zombie Survival Horror"" genre.			"

It's different because you are basically by yourself and you can craft whatever you want. There's a story mode to get you used to the game, and you can also play multiplayer or just try to hold out for as long as possible. I love it and would be happy to play multiplayer with anyone who gets it 4.5/5			"

												How To Survive (H2S); What kind of game is it?2013 summers best zombie survival imo.Crisp graphics, serene setting and played on hardest mode forgiving and challenging.H2S; is a top down, action, rpg shooter with elements of crafting and survival; fish, hunt cook mix drinks...make explosives, chase down zombies and be chased by hordes of wild emus... It offeres a unique and fairly realistic point of view on the genre while also adding masses of zombies and keeping the arcade/action elements to the game.Storywise;Played as one of three unique heroes who've crashed onto the shores of a mysterious island, you quickly find friends and begin your long journey to escape this serene island paradise.As you set out you will meet a small cast of folks also trapped here, among them kovak, who will ultimately train you to be a survivor and if you are lucky make it out alive.Inspirations and fun perks;The game here takes generously from the many 'zombie survival guide' sub-genre and has a crafting list built around items and artefacts you may find among shipwrecks and abandoned towns on a tropical island, take chains, bike motors, jerry cans and a harpoon gun trigger and you have a chainsaw...Hungry? roast some emu meat add mushrooms and you have a steak fit for a Queen! Collect Items, fruits and trash, build weapons and ammunition, keep yourself well fed and hydrated! and lets not forget catch up on sleep now and then... this game will be a great romp through what is similar to a Dead island setting but very much unique in its own way.What I think and why you ought to give it a go! It seems to be an X-box port but I'm glad I found this gem.9/10, as it fulfills all my criteria, simple controls are made functional and fluid fair amount of variation allows for flexibility and a great deal of aesthetics are included to build immersion.You can dismantle most everything you build and re-build weapons to suit the occasion!I've just finished it, the only shame is it seemed to be fairly short and I would have enjoyed it more had I another island to explore with perhaps more variations in zombies and perhaps a better explanation of their existance! Value for money, the games $7~ AUD, really thats a burgermeal more or less, If you can get an hour out of this game, you are already winning... enjoy the experience and the warm sandy beach feeling, the soothing crash of the waves... the moaning of zombies in the night, while many seek to tackle the genre with cheap knock-offs H2S has done it right and went all the way to bring you a game done right.

												Bought this game on steam so it's a legit copy but after playing it for a week without any problems (beat it), mcafee somehow now thinks it's a virus artemis something and deletes the .exe file so now I can't play it.  After reinstalling the game, mcafee would delete it again, and again each time an install is made. Good thing mcafee only deleted this game otherwise had it deleted all my steam games I would go nuts! The only reason I'm leaving mcafee installed is to see what happens next. If it deletes one more of my steam game I will remove it and get a new antivirus. Stupid mcafee. Another reason why I don't post on mcafee forums and such is because their staff picks on you. I've read similar incidents where mcafee deletes steam executable files (.exe) thinking it's a virus or an illegitamate copy (torrent) but in fact it's a legit steam copy, however instead of helping you some staff members claimed you pirated the game. I guess they never heard of false positive? Mcafee staff members thinks their product is a god's send so there couldn't possibly be anything wrong with their product. The first thing they look for is if there is something wrong with you. Poor customer service and even worst product. I've taken some advice from friends and I'm thinking I will install Avast as my antivirus. Stupid mcafee! Why you delete my game file without notifying me to let you or not? Once again, it's a legit steam copy I even have the digital receipt as proof. ♥♥♥♥ing hate it when things like this happens and worst yet their staff members don't believe you. They think you pirated the game that's why their precious antivirus deleted it. SMH. The only reason why I'm writing this review is to make potential buyer aware that this game is unstable. One moment you could be playing it, then the next your antivirus could delete it thinking it's a virus. Buy at your own risk, however it is a fun game if you get the chance to play it.			"

												How to survive was a huge surprise to me on how well the game actually plays. At first using the KB/Mouse was a tad tedious with the 3/4th view/camera and wonky walking angles but I got use to it quite quickly and by the end I didn't even notice it anymore.It took me about 8.5 Hours to beat the story mode on Normal, so it's not a long game but not a 2 hour sit and done game. Only issue I had was the inventory/crafting system. Finding all the materials to build/resupply your weapons was actually fun but the limited inventory space means you will spend more time micomanaging it then playing the game.Overall, it was a fun game and I could recommend to just about everyone.

												Top down survival horror. The crafting system is pretty straight forward and assists in telling you what can be combined. The day night cycle is a nice touch with a type of zombies spawning only at night but is driven back by any kind of light, but has no bearing on your sleep meter. The food/drink/sleep meter works well, but I never had to worry about it as food and water was plentiful. Sleep was only an issue if I had to clear the nearest bunker prior to using it for sleep. I felt that for the first 25% of the game a lit torch did a pretty good job of killing everything, then using a crafted rifle that pierced enemies worked for the rest of the game. The game drags on later when you have to run across a lot of ground to get from quest to quest and a zombie deer proved to be one of the hardest enemies with it's turn radius/speed/knockdown which seemed overpowered.

												This game is very well done and the price is decent, I got it on my Xbox 360 and PC cuz i liked it so much. Also its quite original. Yet the multiplayer mini games are pretty dull, the Story is ok, yet dull. But what the game is more based on is the gameplay. Its amazing and very fun, i would suggest this to anyone. But, Try to get it when its on sale cuz its not a must have game but it is really good and i stronglly suggest it to peaple who like challenging survival games.			"

												[THE INGAME TIME SAYS 0 HOURS, THIS IS A GLITCH, I SPENT AT LEAST 5-7 HOURS WITH A FRIEND ON THIS GAME]This game surprised me! I bought it on sale for less than £1 not expecting anything good, I was just hoping for something decent. My wish was fulfilled and then some! THIS GAME IS AWESOME! It combines the survival mechanics of eating, drinking and sleeping seamlessly with the hack'n slash top-down gameplay that works so well. It was really fun finding parts hidden around the map to make better weapons, and when night falls... YOU WILL NEED THEM! The map is much bigger than I expected, made up of 6 or 7 islands you can freely travel between depending on your objective. Get this game if you have a friend to play with, because the entire story can be completed cooperatively. I would recommend this due to the many advantages two machetes give you instead of just one. This game is much better with a friend for sure, and provided us with hours and hours of fun. The combat system is simple but challenging, and your draining hunger, thirst and tirdness bars keep you constantly on your toes.			"

												Really fun game. Got your walking zombies, who sometimes run at you. And at night the running zombies come out. All of the zeds have something unique about how to fight them. The night zombies are much easier in the beginning stages, but later they become hectic by just adding in a few more, but still fun. If you are craving good excitement, just venture out at night.You craft food, weapons, and armor. Most weapons you can uncraft too! But if you craft two of the same armors, its mostly unsalvagable. Lame thing is that you can not take off armor, unless by putting on another armor so you can work on your favored armor. There is an X, but it is hard to understand.Really cool thing is that if a zombie is wearing a helmet, you can take that basic helmet. But there is no point in having 30 of the exact same helmet, except that they stack. No other use for an extra helmet.Ammo is unbundant, unless you craft a shotgun, which depletes many ammo per shot.Sure bullets come easy, but what makes the game hard is trying to survive when you are rushed by what didnt seem like a horde until it was too late. Healing plants are not as abundant as bullets. Which means... if you are swarmed you could eventually run out of health.Best thing! Is if you die... it leaves your gravestone where you died in singleplayer... where all other players in the world can see how bad you suck! There is no way to show others how well you did. If you don't have a gravestone, then you are either really good, or havent reached that area yet. But I still like the gravestones! (But, even in Kozac mode, the game still leaves gravestones for easy mode to view. So please do not view this as a detriment.)So ya! This game is a ""hell ya"" from me!Light Spoiler?I carry a pistol machine gun, a bow, and a boomarang all at the same time. I use the bow to attack rare mobs, or when I am swarmed by certain mobs. I use the boomarang when I dont need to spend ammo, and when I want my attacks to destroy normal groups of mobs. But when it gets hectic, I pull out the machine gun to take out an overwhelming force. None of this is necessary, but it sure is fun! Lets see... the boomarang is not good against zombies wearing chest armor, but you can aim for the head, it just takes longer than with a pistol. The pistol machine gun is great cause you can aim for the heads fast, but also if you miss, you can push back the armored zombies for a second shot by shooting them in the chest. And the bow, is always my favorite in video games cause of the silence, but this is all mixed up. Sometimes I use the bow when armored zombies are chasing me, cause it is fast to aim. But if you are overwhelmed, you need to use the machine gun. Also, the bow was much more satisfying way to kill before you upgrade it to push through enemies, but still, having the arrows penetrate is better than before. So its a difficult one to think about.Spoiler:Someone said ""you can kill the toughest zombie on the island with a pistol"". Sure... pistols do damage, and if you are great at dodging you can try to kill the boss anyway you want. But I am guessing the comment was directed at bloat style zombies, where if they get close to you they will explode causing severe damage. So... yes, using projectiles is a good strategy to killing bloats before they get close enough to do damage, which is still not easy. Using projectiles is the only way to kill seagulls. Its just a silly thing to say that pistols can be used to kill stuff.Spoiler:Someone else said the night zombies are like kittens. Well... if you shine your flashlight at them, they freeze. You could turn off your flashlight, like I did. But in later stages even having 2 or 3 coming from different directions at the same times can be overwhelming. You have to shine your flashlight on them each, then try to focus aim at one of them. And when there are 6 coming in and running away, its the closest to panic I have gotten in a game.			"

												A great co-op survival game! I would say it’s a mix between ""Alien Swarm"" and ""Don't starve"". Yes, it have a few bugs here and there, but still, while playing with friends it’s pretty fun. Crafting is on decent level, combining parts to create some weapon seems logical. Survival can be somewhat easy on normal difficulty levels, but as soon as you try to beat challenges on hardest difficulty level, you'll get some actual troubles. Moreover, the actual survival guidebooks are hilarious!			"

												this game is actually pretry rad,only played a small bit picked it up yesterday on sale for less than 4 bucks and worth every penny sure it seems it will be a quick game (some folks have said somewhere round 6 hrs max for story mode) but to be honest depneding on what the developer has intended for furture releases it could get really big and heaps better by way of the old dlc system to be honest i would quite happily pay a few bucks every couple of months for exta story packs and more chalenges the only thing that irks me so far is the need to use keys to move the dude (if you are not accustomed to this style it gets a little clunky but eventually you get the hang of it) i'd personally preffer it left click to move right click to attack or if it was awsd at least make the dude go forward when hitting w instead of a,dosent seem to be able to be customised? but on the whole really well made game reminds me a lot of orginal far cry textures ,crafting system is al most identical to orgianl res evil,gameplay is very similar to diablo (action hack/slash) cept u get guns sure it is every straight forward but for 4 bucks and being a zombie fan you will dig on it 100% worth getting behind and hoping they bring out more islands or better yet the ability to eventually survive the island and travel home only to discover the world is ravaged by the zombie horde... i could see a great sqaud based rts elemnt being added to this games mehcanic no sweat 10 out of 10			"

												+ Crisp, minimalist UI+ Excellent tutorial; fun, interactive, and does a good job of displaying some of the charm of the title+ Voice-acting was of about average quality+ Minimap is functional and easy to read; objectives and points of interest are clearly marked and hard to miss+ Very detailed environment; the design and amount of inclusion is meticulous+ Foraging is wonderfully implemented; by doing away with bold POI markers in the overworld, you find yourself constantly searching for familiar leaves, shapes, etc.+ Except for a few small qualms I had with the crafting system (noted below), it is largely excellent; there are a refreshingly large variety of combinations+ You have the option to 'uncombine' items that you've crafted, thus freeing up the materials for re-use; this little quality of life feature is incredibly useful, and I feel that many crafting systems throughout the gaming world would have benefitted from it+ An appropriately moderate variety in creatures+ Some crafting recipes are only available for certain characters, thus increasing incentive to replay+ Exploration is both rewarding, and very much encouraged throughout the title+ The story did a suberb job of managing to not take itself too seriously, without falling into the classic pitfall of being cringey and annoying+ While the hunger and thirst meters fit well into the game, it was the fatigue meter that really stood out as a breath of fresh air; this added a bit more challenge and a greater feeling of urgency to the game+ Hunting was very fun and challenging; tracking wild game through a monster-infested island could be quite the rewarding challenge+ Nighttime operations were very well-handled, in that a setting sun very much puts you on edge if you're out in the open and far from a campfire+ Melee combat was solid and satisfying- Zombies are largely generic copies of only a handful of models- During daytime, inventory is slightly too transparent; this results in a fair bit of squinting, but wasn't an experience-killer- You cannot craft stacks of items- Aiming (I used mouse and keyboard), while for the most part excellently designed, could occasionally prove frustrating and unreliable; picking specific targets out of an oncoming horde (something you will NEED to do) is difficult when you're cursor is constantly jumping between several front-rank targets- Could have benefitted from a larger, more comprehensive skill tree			"

												This game is really awesome as you have to survive to live. If you've played Left 4 dead/(2) you gonna like this game too. This game is all about survivng waves of zombies, caring about your body's basic needs and shelter. There's a wonderful storyline to the game and wants to rock your chair. Try it out. ;)			"

												Pre orderd the game, excepted for awesome experince and diffrent kind of zombie-survivul game. Was really disappointed with the game, boring and repetitive fighting system, unintersting story and lame crafting. The only plus in the game is it's Survivul Guide which is really funny and original. Buy this game only if the price is 5 dollars or less. 6\10			"

												Personal Rating: 4 of 10How to Survive is a tedious and repetative zombie outbreak survival game on island. As the name suggest, it focus on salvaging materials, crafting items, staying hydrated and keeping your energy up while cooking up ways to leave the island and fighting hordes of zombies.Sounds good so far? I shall put this review into point forms for easier reading.Pros- Graphics. The game environment, texture and lightning are all beautifully done.- Crafting. Many things to craft including weapons, arrows, armors , food and etc. I would say it is rather complete.Cons- Gameplay. Extremely tedious as zombies kept respawn and all you do is hack and slash the mindless zombies while strafing to avoid hit.- Inventory. Your inventory size are small so it gets filled up with meterials quickly. You do not know which item to remove since some of them are required for quests. It gets really annoying since there is no stash or safehouse to store the items- Map Size. You basically travel from island to another completing quests. The size of each island is relatively small where you can quickly explore the island in no time but zombies respawn too easily which does not make sense since you have just cleared the area and moving slightly off screen and going back will cause zombies to piled up.- Collision Detection. At times, when I was technically standing right in front of the zombie slashing it with my machete but no hit collission which is annoying.- Hunger, Thirst and Energy (Tiredness) System. I understand that this is a survival game and obviously these had to be incorporated but it does not bring out any fun or intense feeling at all, rather I feel that these features are so poorly deployed when it only waste players time and cause annoyance since each island has only a single water hole and safe house, you need to travel all the way back to the location simply to fulfill some progress bar. Also you cannot rest unless the tiredness warning appears (at around 40-50%). Event if you are right in front of the bed with 55% tiredness you cannot rest.- Combat. I cannot justify this but it appears that there are no HP bar or damage range for the zombies and weapons. It always takes the same amount of hit on the same monster to kill it (unless you execute them) be it melee or with a gun. The pistol for example, has three types of aim. Having your crosshair above a zombie will have a huge circle. Should you fire you pistol it takes around 6 hits this way to kill a zombie (excluding missed shot if there IS ANY). If you aim a little longer the circle will become a smaller red circle and it takes 4 shots ALWAYS. A little longer will change the crosshair into a red cross which always takes 2 shot to kill. The first shot will cause the zombie to stumble and second killing it off.- Plot and Quests. You woke up, washed ashore on an island meeting survivors and complete DHL (collect and fetch) quests. Most of the time, repairing whatever transport they have to travel to another island (I actually reached the third island to see the same dull quest all over again) and thats all I know because I cannot bring myself to play this game anymore.- Side Quests and Humour Factor. The game itself is a horror survival genre kind of game event with the side quests and the developers decided to add in some humor factor by adding a guy named Kovac who will guide you through the tutorial and leave some books (so called self written and published) by him all over the islands. Collecting the books will play a tutorial video that introduces some feature. In my opinion this kills of the game because it wasn't funny at all making this game lame. The developers also added monkeys which gives really lame quests that is totally unrelated to the game such as having you to craft a handbag or searching for their hidden mates where you have to search the island and be a the location at certain time. - Skill Tree. Two words: Dull and uninspiring. Skill tree is small and does not really affect the gameplay very much but to facilitate your character in a way. To name a few, there is a skill to reduce the progress of hunger, hydration (different skills by the way), starting fire (most basic) and showing more icons on the map such as rare herbs, monkeys and etc.Overall this game had great potential and I do look forward to see how it can grow but this current game really isn't worth the time.

												5/10Well, this game just glitched itself out of my library.  After 13 hours of crafting armor and weapons, killing hundreds of zombies, and fighting with the questionable survival mechanics and horribly limited inventory, I finally got almost to the end of the game - the mission where you have to find 20 packages for a guy named Sanchez.  Unfortunately, that's as far as I got, because the game glitched at least 2 package locations, where they were marked on the map but no package was there.  I tried everything I could think of, even cancelling the mission and restarting it, but nothing I did made those packages appear where they were supposed to be.  There's no way I'm playing through the entire game a second time on the off-chance it won't glitch on me again, so, there's 13 hours wasted.  I uninstalled this POS and I'm moving on to games that hopefully work well enough for me to actually finish.It's too bad, really, because the game was reasonably enjoyable up to that point, despite some pretty big problems.  The graphics were good, the crafting system was interesting, even if poorly explained, it was violent and gory as expected.  Nothing mind-blowing, but a fun diversion for the most part.   On the downside, the survival mechanics of constantly having to eat, drink and sleep became nothing but an annoyance after several hours, and the inventory system is downright terrible.  The inventory is extremely limited, given how many things you come across, both needed and potentially needed, and the lack of any central storage meant constantly dropping things you may need in order to make room for something you have to have, meaning that what you dropped is likely gone forever unless you can remember where you dropped it.  Another big annoyance came about when you tried dropping things in the various safe houses, only to find that what you dropped was getting the way of the save and door controls, forcing you to play musical inventory all over again to move those things to another place.Still, even with the cons it was an enjoyable enough game until it's crappy programming finally took over and prevented me from finishing the last 7%.  As a result I whole-heartedly do not recommend this game.			"

												The game is pretty standard at the start, with limited resources and an unknown evironment.  The melee combat system is challenging in both senses of the word.  It is a dangerous activity and you need to do perform it nearly perfectly if you don't want to get hit.  However, the mouse/keyboard controls feel clunky and I still didnt get used to the after 2 and a half hours.  My biggest complaint is that after an hour of play, the game never evolved any more.  Nearly all missions are of the same fetch and recieve type and you gain access to extremely powerful ranged weapons early on that make the fun of the melee system go away. tl;dr, interesting at first, but gets boring and repetitive very quickly.

												[THE INGAME TIME SAYS 0 HOURS, THIS IS A GLITCH, I SPENT AT LEAST 5-7 HOURS WITH A FRIEND ON THIS GAME]This game surprised me! I bought it on sale for less than £1 not expecting anything good, I was just hoping for something decent. My wish was fulfilled and then some! THIS GAME IS AWESOME! It combines the survival mechanics of eating, drinking and sleeping seamlessly with the hack'n slash top-down gameplay that works so well. It was really fun finding parts hidden around the map to make better weapons, and when night falls... YOU WILL NEED THEM! The map is much bigger than I expected, made up of 6 or 7 islands you can freely travel between depending on your objective. Get this game if you have a friend to play with, because the entire story can be completed cooperatively. I would recommend this due to the many advantages two machetes give you instead of just one. This game is much better with a friend for sure, and provided us with hours and hours of fun. The combat system is simple but challenging, and your draining hunger, thirst and tirdness bars keep you constantly on your toes.			"

												1 – GENERAL How to Survive is a Zombie Survival with crafting elements. When I've bought the game I thought it was more like a RPG, but now I think that is more like an hack and slash action game. That's immediate fun in my book. Graphics are interesting for a top down game. We can clearly identify different classes of zombies. They are not the best I've seen, but they are quite good. All other elements are just ok, and I have some issues with some of the landscape that sometimes doesn't allow me to see my player. Sounds are the worst thing of the game IMO, zombies sound like Muttley,♥♥♥♥♥♥Dastardly's dog in Wacky Races. Monkeys are simply annoying and parrots are just bad. But we forget about that when we meet Kovac. The best character in the game. Badass as hell. Great voice acting from him.  2 – GAMEPLAY I have some issues with mouse and keyboard controls, but they are completely ok when you get used to them, and after that I admit is not a bad PC port. The game is a simple go there, and do that. Freedom of choice is not big, you have to follow the rules here. Crafting is quite easy. Blueprints can give you a hand, but most of the time you can just press ""combine"" in your inventory and you will craft something useful. I could use more spots to collect since is hard to understand what is useful or not. I've never felt that feeling of toughness in the game. You have to eat, drink and sleep, but every island provides you enough stuff for you to survive with small effort. Ofc I've only reached half way in the game, so this can be worse with progression. It seems to me that the game has some replay value. It has different characters, different modes, different options to follow with skill tree.  3 – CONCLUSION It was hard for me to get in the game. First 2 hours where a mess, but now I just want to keep going. The game is very interesting and fun. OFC it's not a AAA game, but is very common to be on sale, so is very cheap. Go for it! As usual, some gameplay:

												""How to Survive"" is a mostly enjoyable Zombie survival game. There are 3 characters to choose from with different skill levels, but I prefer Kenji since he is reasonably fast and the best with ranged weaponry (bows, crossbows, improvised guns). The game introduces harder enemies rather quickly, so that you can never get comfortable but are always being threatened & challenged. The crafting element is sensible and well implemented eg wooden stick + flint = improvised axe; axe + wooden stick = basic arrows. However, crafting recipes have to be discovered first. There are a modest number skills to learn which increase your survivability, commening with Fire Starting.Annoyances: No manual SavesLimited Inventory SpaceMany clicks required to restart a gameDoesn't run with SweetFX ( a modified DirectX library with antialiasing, sharpening, saturation increasecolour modifications and so on, that can be configured via a simple Ini)Time passes too quickly so hunger, thirst and tiredness need to be constantly satiated)Relatively small mapsConstantly respawning enemies from the midgame on.Still, despite these flaws, it is worth playing, and is often on sale for under $4 in mid 2014.

												Great game play but movement controls kind of suck. Having to use keyboard to navigate limits control vs mouse. With keyboard, movement tends to be a hassle and zig zaggy. Graphics options are too limited. Customizability is just poor. But those are just minor annoyances.The co-op mode is horrible and buggy. It burns me that both players have to fit within the same camera view. I hate the feeling of my movement bound to a box. This would make sense for a console platform offline where you have to share a screen but its completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for online co-op. Any other online co-op game allows free roam. When inviting a friend to your co-op and he selects to sync to your level, his level matches but still has all his higher level equipment from single player mode. The co-op has a completely broken design.Personally I am content with just the single player mode but I dont recommend it because of some of the design flaws, very restrictive game option and controls.

												The price is fair for me, but others may feel differently, so I will go into details over my gripes with the game and 505.Business Model: An extra difficulty setting for and extra 1.99 USD. This is the definition of bad DLC, something that should most certainly be an update or should have been included in the main game. Right now at 2.24 USD the game is worth it. I would say 5 USD and you have a good deal. If 505 Games had released all of the DLC to date for free, then I would fully support them and their price. However it is rather annoying when small things find their way as purchasable DLC. Extra content is worth buying after you already paid for the game, only when it actually adds extra content. Not just slight coding adjustments for diffuculty, or character reskins with a few ability changes.About the Game: It is a linear ""post apoc"" story on an Island. You will revisit  some parts of the island several times, and when the story is so linear like it is, that's a bad thing. Sure you can chose to go left or right to get to your objective, but that is about all the choice you have in big decisions like ""what to do next"". Gameplay is smooth, and so are the controls with mouse or joypad.  You can hunt, scavenge, and craft. However with a crafting system that goes in tiers, it limits your need for hunting/scavenging once you have made the gear you want. For instance lets say rabbits make tier 1, once you finish crafting that tier there will no longer be any use for rabbits. I feel like this is a big failure for a game about survival, I don't feel like I am in a survival situation when I pass items and say ""nah I don't need that, already made my larger knapsack.""Closing thoughts: If you can get it on sale, or you aren't concerned about trading 15 USD to something you may only put an hour or two into, then it is worth picking up. A good one to save for one of those ""ISP failure"" days. Or get a friend to join you in the co op. In my opinion, 15 USD would be fair if they were doing a little free update here and there to make the game more replayable. I payed full price for it, and my only major complaint is the fact that they want me to pay 2 more USD to make the game more difficult. Open the game to modders, and a difficulty tweaking mod would be made within days.			"

In the Coop you are damned to watch your friend slaughter all of the zombies, because only he got the weapon from the NPC. The whole game works like this (we had to restart after it crashed) and we both decided to never play it again.

Developers put a lot of passion inside this game and you can clearly see that after the last patches. The game itself is not only improved but they have added some quite good stuff...from weapons to game modes to achievements...all stuff that will make this game more enjoyable day after day.The gameplay is quite simple and original. It is a mix between a crafting game a survival horror and a RPG.Crafting because all your weapons, armour, ammo and so on...needs to be crafted.Survival because you will need to eat, sleep, drink etc...RPG because you will have a series of skills that you will learn level after level (the stats are automatically leveled up)The graphic is quite good and there are some interesting effects (rain, fog where you will literally see nothing, lightings etc..).The main story itself it is quite short yes but all the side quests and the nice number of possibilities about how to deal with some situations will make the game going for a while. Even the new different game modes are a huge plus (survival mode, escape mode or barricade mode...and even a series of challenges with some objectives).There are even several types of zombies...some of those only appears during night....and so be advised...only predators live at night...Very nice thing is that you can make all this thing alone or co-op. And we all know that with a friend everything is better.What else can I say? Do you have few coins to spend for a game that is original and will give you several quite good hours of fun alone but even more hours of fun with friends? Buy this game.Are you looking for a zombie RPG where you will have to spend 10.000 hours only for the tutorial? Well this is not the game for you then.HTS is a simple but very fun and original game.

												Fun game, totally broken. Several bugs have ruined each playthrough I've attempted. The ""dissapearing dropped items"" bug is particularly frustrating, as there is no means of item storage in the game other than dropping them on the ground, and the game contains waaaaaay too many items to keep in your inventory. I almost always lose something critical to this bug.Too bad the devs don't seem interested in resolving these issues. This bug has been around for at least 2 years, and they just keep pumping out DLC on a broken frame. Avoid this one unless you want to howl in frustration.			"

												As for me, this game is very awesome for those, who want to feel ""How 2 Survive"". It's really balanced, and i don't feel a frustration when i see millions of zombies on 4 small islands. Nice and easy story line, well designed islands, sounds from counter-strike (no sheet, really!! xD), interesting inventory ideas and OFC new game modes makin this game really awesome. Perfect choice for achievement whoares like me xDNo joking, this game is really worth it :)			"

												For me, it was disappointing. I expected lots and lots of crafting and weird survival tactics in an oddball world where the rules were a bit different. What I got was another damn zombie shooter and really not much else. The crafting is very lackluster, which feels weird to say because I kind of got the impression that it was this game's major selling point. It's nothing that hundreds of games haven't done better.I won't rule out the possibility that it might get better later, when you get rid of that annoying♥♥♥♥♥Kovak and have to build your own base and such, but honestly, I was annoyed enough with the dull gameplay that I couldn't stay invested.If you like top-down shooters, you'll like this. If you come to it expecting a combination of Dead Island and The Long Dark (like I did), then you're in for a disappointment.			"

												Vertigo alert.  If you're like me and try to find games that don't induce motion sickness by keeping the camera steady, stay away from this one.  It looks like an isometric top down ARPG camera design, but the camera lurches up and down to keep your character in view.  Vertigo in 5 minutes play.  Also, has 'social' play enabled by default, which for a single player game entails displaying hundreds of player graves with their names sprawled all over the screen.  It can be disabled in options though.  The annoying parrot shouting 'hey!' and 'hahaha' offscreen cannot be disabled.  Not even recommended at 90% discount.  This goes into my junk folder.			"

												Oh boy how to put this... It's not exactly a ""bad game"" so to say. However the story line is extremely short and its quite repetitive after a while of long playing times. It's still a great game to play with your friends if you've never played before. But once you beat it, it kind of gets a little bland after a while. Unfortunatly unless it's on sale for at the very least less then 10 (maybe even more.) I just cannot reccomend this game at over 10 dollars. But like I said it's pretty fun for first beginning. Take a crack at it if you like. There's no such thing as a bad zombie game in my book!			"

												Ok, there are few games that i liked this much and ended up actually hating and throwing away the controller so much. Im gonna make this short, when you gotta HOLD the aim on them to do a headshot, you NEED TO add some kind of aim. Since they move around and you gotta keep the aim within 3% of their direction and they move. So you ended up making it so 50% of all zombies later on have bulletproof helm and vest. So  you throw 4 boomerangs for nothing, finicky, kiting.... And when you play it with someone, foget colorcoding YOUR aim. No on top of the absurd aim mechanics (You ""see"" where you aim based on what way your upper torso i aiming, which doesnt tell you anything). Never EVER have i seen anyone ♥♥♥♥ up such an easy game mechanic that adds flow to a game. FORGET the boomerang and bow for these reasons, you need headshots aaaaaall the time later on. And they ♥♥♥♥ed up the aim. The rest is good, few zombietypes though but. FIX THE AIM, ITS HORRIBLE. COLORCODE, MORE INDICATIONS ON WHERE IM AIMING. Its not realism... its FRUSTRATING. You rerelease this game on every platform and console and dont fix this, people like this?!Im AMAAAZED on that level of fail right there.			"

The ending leaves a lot to be desired but the story isn't really what you should be playing for in this one.The game needs even more chapters for the How To Survive handbook because the videos were truly the best part.Play with a friend, and if you do, play for the crafting and not for the story.

												""YOU WERE WARNED""...is what i'm saying to myself as I approach my 20th hour of playing this game. Because I read reviews explaining some of the game's many shortcomings and thought: ""It looks fun. How bad can it really be? I'll cope.""To be clear: it's not that I feel I didn't get a good value for my money. On the contrary, for my ~$5, I got more ""gameplay"" than I can stand.Lordy, this game drags on!In most indidvidual aspects, it's of good quality. But, to the extent that ""overall design"" is an important aspect of a game's overall ""quality"", I am starting to feel that ""overall"" it's actually not great.------------------------FWIW I played ""Iron Man"" skill, (level 2 of 3, i.e. ""Hard""), and played as Jack. (What follows may be spoilery, depending on your definition.)First ~5 hours:-- intriguing and captivating. ""Yeah, this is going to be fun!""-- Game teaches you its basic mechanics, you find/earn some basic weapons.-- Don't have enough inventory space to pick up all the ""cool"" stuff I'm sure will come in handy, later.5-10 hours:-- ""Phase II"", the fun mid-game stretch where you are starting to feel more hunter than hunted, learning the maps/environments, getting good weapons, advancing the quests.-- Exposure to new mechanics is starting to drop off but you don't care cuz you're ""doing good"".-- Way more pick-ups than can be kept in inventory, so I resort to having gigantic stashes on the ground at a couple memorable locations. Game is starting to turn into ""inventory administrator simulation"". :|10+ hours:-- Urge to even play is already waning, mainly because I know the first thing I have to do next session is go round up the stuff I (think* I) need, from various locations, to advance my gear and quests. (In due fairness, it's not like I don't have a ton of other, better games to play -- and I have been! -- but... I was definitely fired up about this game when it was fresh, and I'm sad that the freshness wore off so fast.)  *but yeah, as it turns out, I may not have needed any of that stuff after all, as I explain below. But additionally there is one specific weapon they hint at which I have been expecting to craft for my last 3-4 play sessions, which .... I must have missed a lynchpin component somewhere along the line because no matter how many items I find along this certain ""theme"" and optimistically combine together hoping for a breakthrough that will let me build the weapon, nothing works. as I now near the end of the game, it's starting to look like I don't even need it anyway. :|-- Sadly realize that the overall level of ""depth"" implied in the early stages of the game is not going to be borne out in the endgame.-- Began one play session with the obligatory ""character sheet check"" to see how far I have to level up. (At least /that's/ something to be fired up about, right?) Bummed and surprised to find out I was at the level cap already, when plot-wise it felt like I was barely 1/2-way through. And the game is still throwing me more and ""better"" XP. I'd probably be 4-5 levels over the cap at this point. (Which coincidentally is right about what I'd need to max the skill tree. Not that I really care about the 80% of the skills anyway. No time for anything but passives. Early on, the game sets up this mentality of ""scarcity"" of materials, as well as scarcity of inventory. As such, I find the crafting-heavy skills in my character's skill tree totally unappealing. Not that I wouldn't relent and use them anyway, if the game required it of me, but it doesn't. I kill almost every single thing with my one wicked gun. I've thrown 2-3 molotovs out of boredom. And one explosive molotov I threw at a big pack cuz I thought it was going to kill everything and launch chunks everywhere. It didn't.)-- No incentive to use or try new weapons or mechanics. The hardest boss enemies in the game are pretty easy to kill w/ my min/maxed build, and can also be glitched and killed harmlessly at least 25% of the time ... probably more if I really chose to refine my technique. (Are they really glitched or just stun-locked due, again, to my min/maxed build? IDK... IDRC.) Everything else is cake except the annoying electrical guys which can basically just be ignored if it comes down to it. Zero desire to carry around -- much less carry around the mats for, and actually craft -- any of the ""advanced"" items such as buff potions, quality food items, advanced ammunition, alternative weapons, etc. And for what it's worth, I can't see how, mechanically, playing on the hardest skill could really change things within the game's established framework in such a way to make me change my mind about the preceding choices ... at least not in a fun way. If the hardest skill means ""you must use all this stuff constantly"", well, that would just be nightmarish from a QoL standpoint. Pass.-- Oh but wait! On the final 2 (extremely tedious) maps of the game, the designers decide to actually require you to pay attention to the basic biological survival-type needs that have been little more than a trivial annoyance through the whole game until now. But then they also throw you a couple bones to keep you from /being/ boned -- in a real ""oops ruined my one-and-only checkpoint savegame"" sense. (P.S., unrelated: sure glad I crafted this hazmat helm which says it's supposed to protect you in toxic gas environments, but doesn't actually seem to do so.)--Start looking at the achievement list for spoilery indications on how to ""best"" proceed, cuz I surely don't want to have to play through this again if I miss anything. There appear to be two possible endings, and I'm also definitely going to look up if this is real or illusion, and if real, which one is preferable. Kinda sad. Again, if I could save/load on demand, I wouldn't have to worry about this.-- At the moment, I'm more entertained by writing this review than by continuing to play. What more really needs to be said?------------------------A couple ""positives"":-- After reviewing the achievements I see most of the ones I haven't earned yet concern other play modes/environments. Thankfully there is no ""beat the story mode with all four characters"" or whatever, cuz I couldn't deal with that. As it is, I'm hoping that beating the story on ""Iron Man"" will qualify me for the ""Normal"" achievement -- which is how any game designer who isn't a criminal against humanity does things.-- The overall whole ""fetch quest"" design of the game doesn't really bother me. I mean .. what else is there? When you distill almost any game down to its raw elements, ""fetch quests"" are basically the way 99% of games add a strategic layer to whatever their core gameplay is. I mean .. I guess some ""morality"" quests with some actual RP would be OK, but ... probably not a big deal. Let's face it: most of the time those types of quests are trivial anyway, usually due to uninspired concepts/writing. Additionally, having a branching storyline would make it that much more often that I have to worry about ""am I going to regret going through with this and be stuck with a f'ed up game because all I have is one stupid checkpoint save?!"" So yeah, NTY I think.------------------------Finally, I have to explain that, with the caveats and cautionary anecdotes expressed above, I still *do* recommend this game. However, with Steam's messed-up review system, I feel compelled to choose ""not recommended"" because it is the only response that has a chance of moving the game's overall review score in the direction of ""average"" (or, actually ""mostly positive"") which is what it truly deserves. ""Very positive"" is going a bit overboard and anything above that is a pipe dream. Final score: ""Worth $5 I guess, but could have been a masterpiece with more playtesting and dev love."" (And on that note, I have to say: all the industry reviews are, as usual, totally suspect. They sound way too excited about a game that is, in actuality, pretty basic.)			"

Sooooo you can't even play 2 campaings at the same time... I was very interested in this game and wanted to play this with my 4 friends, but it really dissapointed me, too bad for the devs :(			"

												I'm posting this because my brother bought the game after seeing that I had it, and I want to ensure that no one else makes the same mistake. How to Survive is terrible. You can kind of see that the idea had potential, but the execution is awful. The humor and quests are ripped off from borderlands and the top-down gameplay doesn't lend itself to a zombie game at all.			"

												Not saying this game is ""bad"" per se, in fact I can very much see the appeal and intend on coming back to it at some point but I won't engage it much further at the moment.  I only got about ten minutes into the game and could tell it wasn't for me almost immediately. The game I'd most easily compare this to is Don't Starve.  While Don't Starve had a definite difficulty curve, ranging from docile to insane, the game felt a lot more ""within my control"".  I could enjoy the Gothic art style at a leisurely pace when I wanted to and if I wanted frenetic action in the next I was able to find it.  While there is a lot more downtime and planning in Don't Starve you feel more enthralled to be playing.  The pay off of crafting in this game just didn't feel like it was going anywhere when my best chance of survival was to just chop away at everything with my machete which I received very early game and seemed to have quite a bit of durability (especially compared to the burning 2x4 that I stumbled across which seemed a lot better than even the bow I had to learn to craft).  I never even got into the multiplayer so if any of my friends pick this game up at any point I may re-install it and give it another go (it does seem like it may be a little more fun online). Other than that: 5/10			"

I finnaly found out that you can make a bow by combining. Then the camera pov is absolutly horrible. Now you also have somtimes that you get stuck against a splash of water. Also if your friend runs away then you both can't move farther get stuck and get killed. You have two screens online two computers so please let us get away form each other. Everytime its the same thing and you gotta kill loads of zombies you kill them all in a 100 meter loan with one way you walk back and there like the double amount of zombies. Friendly fire does more damage then you do on zombies. Also we cleared hole camp open a door then boom 500 zombies around you. If you get a gun at that moment you have 1500 bullets and you kill 5 zombies and you already find 50 bullets again.There are also way to many fat guys.So I rather buy some food then this game			"

												I have seen this game from around it's release date and all i heard about was how bad it was so i didn't even want to see that game let alone buy it.When the game was in Summer Sale 2015 for 0.96 euro i was pretty sceptical on buying or not and i said well i have nothing to lose for 0.96 euro with all the DLCs so i bought and thank god that i did it.When i launched the game i was sure that i won't like it but as i started playing the game got interesting.And finally after 3 hours of gameplay i can say that i love this game!!!!This game has good story,good combat,reasonable survival (food,water and sleep) and a good crafting system.For me i can't ask for something more.This game was a big refreshmed because i was really bored of all the meanstream zombie survival games!!!!Finally if you are thinking of buying this game and your are hesitating about it i say BUY it you won't regret it because it's a great game!!!!

												Don't waste your money.  If you're looking for a decent zombie apocalypse game, look elsewhere.  Between the generic environments, characters, and story it plays like what it is, a low-rent indie game.  I had issues with my saves not being saved, despite travelling between islands and completing main story missions.  I've also had problems with input being stuck and no, it wasn't a dirty keyboard.  I don't have time to troubleshoot such a simple thing as a working save system.  Boring, generic, and buggy.  At least I didn't spend a lot to find out.			"

Yes its cool to create and modify your own guns, but its also very hard and tedious to find the parts. Plus when it goes night time its like living hell on earth with these stupid zombies that kill you and the only way to stop them is to shine your tiny flashlight on them even when their coming from all directions.

												There are a lot of things I liked about this, and as many of the reviews indicated, it does play well as a couch co-op game.  The problem is, the survival scheme meant we were spending all our time scavenging for the far too rare food, and very little time progressing in the missions, which ultimately made the game feel more tedious than enjoyable as a cooperative game; I honestly feel the food availability is balanced more for a single-player game, and while that mode may be more enjoyable, that's not why I decided to purchase this game.  Ultimately, I would say this is a co-op balance tweak away from being a recommended game, but as is, not recommended.			"

												I have to say my initial attraction to play this game to completion was the variety of finishing moves you can employ to decapitate, disembowel and generally inconvenience the zombie horde. I then fashioned a boomerang that enabled me to do it safely from a distance and that clinched it. The sole negative of consequence is the tedious inventory management aspect, especially when you later realise you've discarded something you now REALLY need and have to remember behind what bush you stashed it. The crafting element means there are plenty of weapons available to choose from (seriously, why would you not just use a boomerang though?) and the story provides plenty of content. When you take into consideration this is frequently available at a severe discount, it's easy to recommend. Just avoid the stags. And the crabs. At least Kovac is always there to help you...			"

												First, My PC: i7-6700 4.0 GHz, GTX1060 (6GB), 32GB RAM, HDD 7200 RPM, Windows 10 64bitTechnical:- H2S runs smoothly on my PC. No crash. No bug. - Quite steady frame rate. It dropped just a few frames below 60 when entering an area with a lot of items on the floor. Gameplay:- It's an ARPG with crafting and dark humor. Ranged weapons are fun to use. (I haven't played melee).- Enemy variety isn't great but it's enough to keep the combat interesting. - It can get repetitive and a little grindy. Some say it's boring but I don't mind that.- No storage. You just drop items and remember the place. (I read that if you drop more than 25 items on one island, some items disappear. If the issue still persists, you might need to split your items between islands and travel back and forth.)- Replay value depends on whether you want to replay Story with different characters or play other game modes. All in all, it's much more fun than I thought it would be. Plus, it's very cheap on sale.Recommend.			"

												Played this once... tried to play it again. I couldn't and I just can't pick it back up now.The crafting takes a while, you have to discover the recipes and if your not a dirty lil cheater with a browser containing a wiki recipes list, you often waste more materials discovering recipes, rather than actually crafting anything useful.The quests didn't get my attention at all.I saw tons of tombstones (other dead players apparently), but the game isn't 'that' challanging, one of my friends claimed to see a tombstone with my name on it - no idea whats going on there.The UI is fairly weak and clunky (is this ported from an app store/console?).Couldn't get anyone into co-op successfully, even with ports wide open.The ""Kill"" function seems a bit tempermental, whether you caught it popup or not.The maps aren't really that big to justify exploration.Not like the graphics are bad or there were any crashes, but the game kinda ""drones on"", there's no sparkle or anythingMaybe I've been gaming too long, or maybe not. This game puts me to sleep, I'm glad I bought it on a mega-sale, it's really not worth £10.99.			"

It does not support co-op well. - since I was the host whenever a cut-scene gave a weapon I was the only one to recieve it leaving my friend hanging dry.The game play is more than repetitive.-Run in a circle and hit them randomly, or get a firestick and never die again.Our fun dried up soon when the poor design choices and boring terrain/enemies stopped being funny and starting wearing our patience then.Do not buy this game, the only reasons I did were:1. it was on sale2. a friend bought it with me "

												Mediocre gameplay cripples this top down zombie island survival story. Story is intriguing enough to put 5 or so hours into and the crafting is satisfying in a small way. However, the fetch quests which propel the story make you feel like you are not getting anywhere and there is no real reward for completing them. You craft everything, there is no loot, no rewards for quests. The leveling is pointless and time spent killing things seems meaningless.I never finished the game, the final fetch quest of looking for 20 items spread across the islands I have already been with no new weapons in sight left me no longer wanting to play. Fine for the 3 bucks I payed for it. But nothing stellar in this game.			"

												You'd be better of surviving in Lost In Blue on the Nintendo DS. You can walk around for months on end during the first part until you talk to an NPC which curses you with a ""water meter"" and ""hunger meter"" and so forth. As well as walking into a horde of zombies and mashing an instakill button. That's how you survive.Not sure why the hunger/thirst meter wasn't there at the beginning prompting some sense of urgency but that completely killed the mood for any kind of survival so much that talking to an NPC grants you these ""bonuses"".After wandering around for 3.8 hours of just grinding off zombie monkeys and zombies I finally move forward and feels like I'm halfway through the game already once acquiring the ""water & hunger meter powerup""			"

I gave it a shot, but it's the equivalent of a zombie B-movie. There are a whole lot of things at the beginning that make no sense at all, like the random headstones with other players' names on them, or the fact that the rich Japanese guy is fat and dressed like a snowman/chef. Then, the controls are very strange to me, and the survival book tries to be funny in a game that is attempting to be serious. It really just falls on its face from the get go.			"

												I bought this game during the sumer sale for $1.49.    I still considered geting the refund, but for a buck and a half I'd just assume not go through a refund headache.  This game was ported from a console, and POORLY.  For a game that includes a book every 200ft that acts as a tutorial..  You would think they would take the time to update that tutorial for PC's once they uploaded it onto steam, but NOPE.. They are still instructing you on how to use your non-existant double joysticks and when to press A, even though the mouse and F button work (just not too good at attacking in 1 direction while moving another).  The poor porting job is only the beginning though.The gameplay is BORING.  Really Boring.  Hitch your leash to the auto bus and follow the path of the game.. learn the lame crafting you can only do where they want you to do it and kill the same zombies over and over with boring weapons.  I made myself play it for a couple hours hoping it would get better.  Honestly I can't see myself getting bored enough to give it a second chance.. with 60 games in my library, something will always sound more fun than this..  Heck I think I would have more fun reading a good book.The cheesy voice acting Of Kovak was the only part I kind of found enjoyable, and when you hear that overdone thick Russian accent trying to be funny, you will know how sad it is that the poorly ported tutorial that teaches you incorrect info is the ""best part"".

												Well, nice survival game, good crafting system.Got one BIG minus: without DLC this GAME is too short and sucessfully ending through 7 hrs playing or even less.Poor RPG-part. Bad supporting of a mouse. No antialiasing - is the bigger graphics minus. Good made lights, not much atmospheric effects.I like survival-themed games, but this game don't cost her money.edited: And, how can i miss the worstest camera i ever saw, evwn you play co-op via internet cam think that you are on one PC, madness.

												Mediocre gameplay cripples this top down zombie island survival story. Story is intriguing enough to put 5 or so hours into and the crafting is satisfying in a small way. However, the fetch quests which propel the story make you feel like you are not getting anywhere and there is no real reward for completing them. You craft everything, there is no loot, no rewards for quests. The leveling is pointless and time spent killing things seems meaningless.I never finished the game, the final fetch quest of looking for 20 items spread across the islands I have already been with no new weapons in sight left me no longer wanting to play. Fine for the 3 bucks I payed for it. But nothing stellar in this game.			"

												Honestly speaking, each and every mother should give this game to their son. This game doesn't only brings out the basic joy of ""pretenting"" to survive in front of your keyboards, it teaches some very fundamental yet essential skills for surviving at home, especially when you are the type who likes to lock yourself up and game 48 hours each day,First of all, this game equips you with the skill of item organization. Look around you. No, I don't mean look around your monitor, but around the place you are currently sitting in. Do you see piles of clothes, files, items stacked all around you? If no, then good for you. But if you do, and when you do, this games can teach you the skill to organize these ""Mount Fabrics"" and ""Mount Rubble"" around you. If you have ventured around for a couple of hours in this game, you would have known that there is no item chest. That's okay, because whenever you dump an item onto the ground, it will stay there, forever. So, when you've collected, let say, a hundred different items (you can easily acheive this number after somewhat 5 hours of gaming), you will find yourself staring at piles and piles of save-it-for-later items, which the later usually mean never. Therefore, when you decide to craft an item (item crafting is one of the selling points of this game), you will need to dig these piles of save-it-for-later to find what you want. You will soon learn to locate burried items, as well as organizing items so that things looks asthetically pleasant and they can be easily located.Item location is not the only skill you learn, as you will be learning the basic functions of the human body. One thing you will notice is that you sleep when you need, and not at night. Well, to be honest, your biological clock doesn't exactly run on a 24 hour scale, at least not in ""How to Survive"". You will be sleeping during the day, at night, whenever you need, period. Another thing about your body is that, although you need to eat, you never poop. Yes, your body is amazing, because it is all input and there will be no physical residues for output. Everything will be transformed into energy. Think of it like poop is your fuel. So, the keyboard warriors reading this, you felt ashamed that your level is not high enough to unlock this ability of poop-fuel? Me neither. The last thing about your body you should know is that, although you need to cook whatever you eat, you don't have to boil your water. Why? Because you are immune to those zombie infections, dummy! You are the chosen one!There are many more bedroom survival skills for you to figure out, so when you are done slacking around, jump right in and start learning how to survive in your own darn room!

												For the story:-If you want to grind early: stay on the first island, you won't need to worry about food, water or sleeping. Plus you can grab healing components and venison.-If you want to grind midgame: pick up a torch from the fire in front of the downed plane, and then just run around the beach. There's plenty of zombie spawns nearby, and the torch works really well against the night zombies.			"

I never felt scared or in an real danger. I'm glad I got it on sale so didn't waste too much money. I read a lot of the reviews, someone said the game is better with the DLC's. I don't have them, and don't belive you should have to pay more to make the orignal game better. The Ad look great the game is not.			"

No video settings even though menu states otherwise. hovering mouse over help and options is where it has video but none to be found after clicking on it. Dev's? How bout a fix?I tried what lower posted said about changing the video to be able to see desktop yet can not use it, the mouse cursor stays in the game window. Steam pig picture mode needed for this. Wish more games would allow use of desktop while game runs.I do like the top down view for a zed game but the controls make it a challenge. Have yet to get multiplayer working none are there to join when i tried it.The sale price is nice with all the dlc however some have stated that it can cause trouble running things with it. I didn't notice dlc sale when I bought only the base game some time ago			"

												Surprisingly fun little game.At this point, I practically detest zombie games.  Too much Killing Floor/Left 4 Dead, I suppose. (YES I KNOW THE ZEDS TECHNICALLY AREN'T ZOMBIES, SHUTUP.)  If H2S had been a simple isometric zombie shooter, I might have said ""pass"" and not given it a second glance.  But what makes the game fun is the survival elements, and the fact that you have a simple crafting system.The game has a lot of small-time developer charm.  It feels like a game created by a small studio with limited budget, and it's full of ideas that sound great on paper but which didn't quite work together in the finished product.  For example, as part of the survival mechanic you must eat, drink, and sleep.  And this is a real concern when you first start the game.  Finding fresh water or something to eat isn't easy.  But once you've gained your first set of weapons and gathered a bit of food, then survival will just boil down to you versus the zombies.  Only sleeping becomes a factor, and that's just because you can't sleep whenever you want to.The build mechanic is fun, but it lacks refinement.  In particular, you will find way more individual crafting components than you need, and so inventory management becomes a signficant problem later in the game.  So you will spend a lot of time juggling items between islands (in story mode) in order to satisfy requirements to build rare items.However, I stopped doing crafting once I realized that one weapon in the game is vastly over-powered, and does not require ammo.  So, like the survival mechanic, the usefulness of crafting wanes later in the game.Yet, despite this, I still recommend the game.  I think it's well worth the price.  Even if they didn't change the tutorial videos from the Xbox 360 version.  (""Press (A) to kill a zombie!"")It has a multiplayer mode, though as of yet you cannot do online co-op for the story mode;  You have to play pre-defined challenges, which are fun but only give you small slices of things to accomplish.  The only real complaint I have about co-op is that the game forces you to ""share"" a camera.  So it is impossible for you to run ahead of your friend or explore different areas at the same time.  That's rather stifling, and in story mode this is going to be REAL annoying since you must travel between different islands.			"

												Controls: Horrible (Gamepad? Maybe)Graphics: Path of Exile has better graphics, and it's free.Game mechanics: My Girlfriend and I couldn't get past the first mission, due to the fact that A: I never got any cutscenes, B: My girlfriend had to go into the options at least twice to reset the keybind to attack because it would outright CLEAR itself mid-game, and C: The Melee mechanics are so clunky that it makes fighting virtually undoable at close range.The fact that this game has a sequel in Early Access right now disgusts me. This game is likely used to torture prisoners in Guantanamo Bay.Would not recommend.			"

												it is a great game i suggest getting it it might just be me but i am completly addicted to this game i think it could be improved by being able to create your own chracter and and build a base (settlement as i think it kinda suits the game) i think if there where more npcs, quests and a choce feature (being able to change the main story just a bit) i think that it would be a bit better but all these suggestions are what i would like to be implemented to the game but over all i think its a fun game in which you could have alot of fun with friends or on your own (forever alone) in my opinion it is a realy good game but that is my opinion it wasnt as hardcore survivail that i would like it to be there is water food items every where its good if you just want to play it casual but not the best game if you want to play hardcore (chuck norris style) over all i play alot of zombie games like dayZ, deadrising, dead island, state of decay and left 4 dead but also a lot of survival games like rust, dont starve and neather and overall i give it    7/10 freedom   8/10 survival    8/10 graphics    7/10 story    9/10 awesomeness			"

												A good mix of action-RPG and top-down shooter where you have to kill hordes of mindless zombies. Being essentially an indie game it lacks content, and you have to run back and forth on the same several islands while the zombies constantly respawn. Also the interface is horrible (you have to press 5 buttons to continue your game, for instance, and there no hotkeys for switching between melee and ranged weapons so you have to open the inventory each time).Other than these two things the game is quiet enjoyable, but normal difficulty is very easy. So play on the hard difficulty (which is misguidedly called Iron Man leading you to belive the death of your character is permanent - in fact it's not, only the zombies are stronger).			"

												this game is a well made heart pumping survival game. It offers a lot of adventure and fun but is far too gory and creepy. This is not even a horror game and yet the main menu gives me the chills. Yes I know it is a zombie game but it won't be fun if it is creepy. Also there should be an option too turn off the gore because it is sickening watching gangs of undead devouring corpses. Overall it is a good game that you should buy on a sale. It also has an online co-op mode.			"

												Forget that Metacritic score, 'cause this game is a no-brainerif you like slashing & smashing     zombie heads with all kinds of improvised weapons. The game offers a variety of enemies (to some extent), few variations of weapons (but all re-craftable so they gain some other advantage OR upgrade their speed, damage, precision, spread etc.) and constant scavenging for food (some eaten raw, other must be cooked and can be mixed for added benefit with other food), water (you can fill it up in a plastic gasoline can or empty bottles which you can also use to prepare a lemonade or an energy drink!) and a place to crash (there are zombie-infested bunkers on the island that you need to clear out in order to get some beauty sleep behind solid blast doors). You really can't get more quality fun from a game at this price range, so get out there and purchase a copy (or two, since devs have announced an online co-op story mode for two players coming in November!)The game may not sweat you too much (unless you go Ironman style) but it will sure give you a few tips on ""How to Survive"" in zombie-populated archipelago. Highly recommended!			"

												Price purchased to recommend: $4.00Lowest price as of this review: $1.49 (Full collectors with all DLC) Worth it: Yes, for around/under $4.00Pros: Lots of ""stuff"", IE: items are all over the game world leading to the end of the world, with zombies feel. Plays like an ARPG of old, Titan Quest comes to mind, gritty feel, good game foundation, fun and wild crafting system. Cons: Story, so meh we'll move on already. The crafting is what you DO NOT do to survive. The game ramps up quickly; ran into a few uber mini-bosses for no real reason, other than the game wanted to make it harder? Talking huge beast men a solid 15 feet tallk, um okay? It also gets repetitive, FAST: you'll see barriers that you will be able to blow up after 5-8 hours of adventures, going back to within 100 feet of where you first start. Overall: If you can get this for under $4.00, enjoy the old school / indie feel of games like Titan Quest, Crusader and PoE in regards to ARPG with a wild island/zombie feel; go for it!!			"
