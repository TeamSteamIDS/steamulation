												It’s not easy to even start talking about Cave Story without starting to throw out such adjectives like “modern classic” or “cult underground hit”. But there, you have it, I just wrote it and I won’t take it back. This game preceded the current state of indie scene by a few years, back when it was released as freeware title in 2004. In a few years it was improved and expanded to various platforms with more content and refined graphics. It even was remade in 3D and published for 3DS, though that particular version lacks to provide definitive Cave Story experience. But in the beginning it was made by a single developer on his free time. His name was Daisuke Amaya. The fact that this guy is japanese (not that you couldn’t tell it by his name) explains a lot. Like, for starters, game’s setting and plot.Taking place inside giant floating island inhabited by giant sentient rabbit-like creatures called Mimigas this story is both absurd and complex. Starting out very light-hearted game is filled with tremendous amount of jokes. While the story develops, it tends to grow deeper and more brutal than you might think it’ll turn out. Like many metroidvanias do, game prefers not to present you with the world details and backstory, but rather let you explore it by yourself. A vague prologue, which will leave player clueless transits to waking up in a cave. A silent protagonist suffering from memory loss, as cliché as it is, works as perfect instrument here. You wake up, you find a gun, you begin your journey. Your mission, your ultimate goal is covered with the mystery. And discovering it can’t be done separately with finding an answer to an even more important question “What the hell is going on here?” But searching it won’t be similar to aimless wandering around. Cave Story keeps a very good pace, presenting you with new goals and providing directions to them on the go. It isn’t large glowing marker on the map though, but rather clevel organization of levels and progression of the story. Exploring and finding hidden secrets is present in the game, but size of the areas isn’t overwhelming and new levels are introduced one by one. There is though few very unobvious decisions that change the outcome of the game drastically. So if you want to achieve the best ending prepare to keep a keen eye for details or rather even look for some guides.From the perspective of game mechanics it’s the usual run-jump-shoot trio, but with a few twists. One of them is leveling system. Killed enemies drop yellow triangles, which fill the progression bar of currently equipped weapon. Fully filled bar increases weapon level, up to maximum third, but taking damage drops the bar back down, so prepare for some micromanagement. Weapons have different shooting patterns. There is Polar Star which fires plain bullets, then there’s Fireball which produces bouncing deadly balls of fire. Then there’s Spur which has chargeable beam; the longer you charge it, the more powerful the resulting shot will be. Plenty of choices results in very different strategies player can use. Though you’ll tend to have favourites among your arsenal, keeping them all leveled up and ready will be invaluable. To make things even more complex some of the weapons can be traded off in exchange providing you with other guns which have different qualities. This changes are sometimes mutually exclusive and not always reversible, so don’t answer yes every time some friendly NPC offers you something, that’s my advice here. Unlike your main interaction tools your character doesn’t really level up, with the exception of few valuable health upgrades. Not very hard if you keep the default path game is horribly ruthless when it comes to that last levels of the “best ending” branch. How does it sound for you: beating a few sequential levels swarming with enemies and two bosses? If you fail, you start again from the very beginning. That’s very different from the main path, where you’ll find save points after every major event. But then again, it’s for those who want to fully beat the game. For those who are trained and prepared there are even special timer for that last sequence, beating last boss before time runs out will unlock one of the few special music tracks in main menu. The themes depend on how fast you complete it, a new one for each minute saved. And that happens only if you found special secret item, but I guess that won’t be a problem for those who are that deep in the game.Cave Story stands on the shoulders of giants, combining elements from both Metroid and Mega Man. But it goes further than just simple copying of old classics. It is polished and compelling and its influence knows no merits; nearly every modern 2D-metroidvania has taken some lessons from here. A must-have experience if you call yourself a lover of modern indie-games.			"

												So; a game released initially for free years ago is now avaliable for almost 20 dollars. Is it worth it...?...depends!Cave Story+ is the most definitive version of the game ever released in my own opinion, trumping other releases on consoles, and the original in terms of raw content. Cave Story+ boasts extra gameplay modes, stages, the ability to switch between the original and new graphics and music (And the WiiWare exclusive music too!), difficulty modes, little easter eggs, and a few things I probably don't have memorized sprinkled on top of an already amazing game. The problem I have recommending it to most people is that the original Cave Story is still out for no money whatsoever and includes the entire length of the main game. If you're not comfortable whatsoever about paying money for Cave Story+, you can still get the original for exactly 0 dollars and decide whether or not the extra content will be worth your time based on how much you enjoyed it. I'll be honest in saying that paying that amount of money for Cave Story+ feels like a bit of a rip once you've played the original and know its plot inside and out, but if you're like me and you really enjoy playing the game whenever you can, you won't really mind it. In reality, I own about six different copies of Cave Story between Nintendo systems and my computer, so you can tell I'm a bit of a nut about this game. There's something about the atmosphere, characters, and gameplay that just make it beyond awesome and a blast to play every single time.In any case, I will always recommend you play the original first. It's free, and it's a timeless classic made by one man. You will enjoy it. If you come to love it just as much as I do and you need more, definitely grab Cave Story+ when you can (though maybe on a sale!)			"

												Honestly have to say that this is probably the best action/platformer I've ever played!The story leaves very little to be desired with a trio of different endings and quite a bit of dialogue.Plenty of different weapons to choose from which gives you lots of room for developing your own playstyle.Plenty of boss fights!This is a ""new, updated"" version. While I really enjoyed the higher quality graphics and SFX I did prefer the original dialogue a bit better. The story is the same but disscussions seem to be oversimplified.Bottom line: Get this game. It will give you hours of button mashing enjoyment and is worth several playthroughs to see all the endings. It also has a few easter eggs which is a nice bonus :D(Edit: 3/19/14)			"

												You wanna know what makes this game awesome? Allow me to explain.Pros• Easy controls, quick pickup and play and convenience.• Metroid-like gameplay style with Kirby-esque pudding mix.• Simple, elegant storyline that gives just enough purpose to wreck shtuff.• Catchy music.• Awesome controller support.Cons:• Not enough people know about this game.• Not enough people still like pixel-art style platformers.• You don't own this game yet (unless you like reading reviews after purchase).Notes:• I played from beginning to end as part of my Indie adventure. It's very fun and worth at least the first playthrough.• Don't use the Life Pot. You'll know when you actually need it, trust me.			"

												About a year ago, I actually recommended Cave Story+ to my friends. It was probably the longest recommendation I ever made. What I basically said was that it was the best version of Cave Story that you can get, with everything being perfect aside from one issue, which I will get to later. The reason why I've deleted the recommendation and made a new review is because I really don't think I did the game justice. I would go as far as to say that Cave Story is in my top 3 favourite games of all time, and considering my other two favourite games are exclusive to consoles, and that I believe this is the best version of Cave Story there is, I might go as far as to say this is my favourite Steam game of all time.If you want an explanation of what Cave Story is, I’ll tell you as much as I can without either spoiling your or me getting bored. You begin playing as a mute… “boy” that is suffering from amnesia, and just woken up in a cave. From there, you find a variety of different characters, amongst them is a race of rabbit-puppy creatures called Mimiga’s. They are suffering because there is a man known as “the doctor” who has come to their Mimiga Village to kidnap them individually. I won’t go into any more detail because, as the title implies, the “Story” in Cave Story, and finding out who this “Mysterious amnesia boy” actually is, is a huge strongpoint of the game.This game isn’t just full with amazing storytelling either, the gameplay is amazingly fun too. It’s a Metroidvania that doesn’t focus on backtracking… most of the time (IM LOOKING AT YOU, GRASSTOWN!). Your main weapons are the guns you find along your journey, and how they work is actually really interesting and fun. The way that I would explain it is that it’s kinda like an RPG, as your guns can gain experience to make them more powerful. This may sound broken, but your guns can’t actually go any higher then level 3, and if you get hit while your gun has high experience, you will actually start to lose some of those points. It may sound annoying and tedious, but it’s actually extremely fun, and it’s a great punishment for getting hit a couple of times.Now that we got how everything in Cave Story works, I want to go into comparing Cave Story+ to the original Cave Story. Most of Cave Story’s fame not only comes from that it’s an amazing game, but the whole of the original was made by one person, and he actually released the game for FREE (This may not sound like much now, but remember this game originally came out in 2004). Now you may be thinking “But if the original version is free, why should I bother with this one?” That’s an easy answer, BECAUSE IT’S BETTER IN EVERY WAY. The original game was very 8-bit inspired, something that’s usually looked down on indie developers nowadays, but back then people would say that it’s a great call-back to old NES games. Cave Story+ turns the original 8-bit game into more of a 16-bit feel, and it actually makes the game better for it. Of course, you can change the options so that it’s like the original, but the new version is so much better. That’s not the only thing they added either, there are new gameplay modes that add new levels that you can play, or a boss rush mode, and many, many more.The only complaint I have for this game is its controls. Believe it or not, even though the game originally came out for PC, the CONSOLE CONTROLS are actually better! If you don’t like using the arrow keys to move, or pressing “up” to jump (which sickens me to think about), you’ll have to change the controls for a bit so that they match up with how you play.So please, PLEASE buy Cave Story+. If you’re really not sure, you can download the free version on the Cave Story website (you will have to add the English attachment to play it in English though), but buying the one on steam is so much better. I’ve spent way too long making this review, but trust me, it’s worth it. This game is amazing.(Also excuse me for my horrible grammar in this review)			"

												I love cave story. I love the story, I love the art style, I love that you can save curly, I love that you can play as curly, I love the dogs, I love the weapons, I love the enemies, I love the challenge of hard mode, I love the endings, I love the characters, I love the level design, I LOVE IT ALL.Why do I love it all? because it's well paced, the game feels as though its a 100% done project, probably because it is. All the kinks are out, the story isn't flawed nothing is broken about the game, and it gives me a good reminder of hard games, and platformers being fun in general. I'm not a huge fan of platformers right now because they all seem so short and incomplete. Cave Story, is NOT that.So buy the game, play it yourself or if you don't have money, the old flash of the game is out there somewhere, go find it. you'll just have 8bit graphics. it's not a real downgrade.As for Cave Story + though, and why you should get it: Uhh... graphics... challenges... stuff..... sounds.... music?It's just what it sounds like... cave story +, it's just a refreshed version of the older game, so yeah I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.Not much else to say.... the game is worth it all though.Standard Game RatingStory: 10/10 (Complete, involves a few places where the player can choose a better path than the standard story)Gameplay: 10/10 (You can re-bind the controls now, and use a controller if thats your thing... and the whole game has solid gameplay, and it's as balanced as a singleplayer RPG platformer gets. Ultimate weapons arent way too OP, and rockets aren't even a thing in hard mode. so get good.)Presentation: 10/10 (Just... look at it, like take a few seconds, scroll up to the pictures and video, and look. THE GAME LOOKS GREAT!)Soundtrack: 10/10 (The original soundtrack is still an option in the + version and the redone soundtrack is good also. Just... wow, it's on target the soundtrack is great, it's one of the few that I will listen to while playing other games.)Replayability: 10/10 (I enjoyed speedrunning the game, and playing it on hard. you can't get bored of this thing quic, I can promise that. Also the game is 100% modable, with the right tools. Currently however there is not much of a modding community, either that r I just think we're allowed to change the files when in fact we aren't... if not... sorry.) "

It's the game that has it all, from the awesome story, caring characters, hard bosses, different endings, one of the most amazing chiptune scores, perfect gameplay and it's all made by just one guy. It's a game trying to pay homage to the nintendo games that were so difficult and kept you playing for hours and hours. If you think you've played a very difficult game, just play Cave Story's best ending on easy. And the hard mode ... a nightmarish joy. I can't recomend enough this game.			"

												When it comes to a straight honest opinion of Cave Story, I would consider this game the pinnacle of indie games; everything that makes them fantastic and sticks out from the crowd. I go as far to say how easily they can surpass major blockbuster games both in sales, ratings and of course, the fans that cherish it so.I will not spoil much about this game, other than the fact it plays out as a retro sidescrolling, platform-adventure game; very reminiscent of the early-mid 90's and the plethora of game titles of that time, such as Mega Man and Super Metroid for the SNES. To top this all off the graphics, programming, story and overall direction was made by one man.To the newcomers of Cave Story, take my advice and play this game slowly at a steady pace and try not to ask for any outside help, as you may experience the intriguing creativity of this game for yourself and the other first timers who have stumbled upon this game for the first time also. I've only played a couple of hours of this, and countless hours on the freeware version so trust me when I say this wonderful indie, platform-adventure game is far beyond perfection.			"

												It's a nifty metroidvania. You'll probably dig it if you like the genre. Go play the freeware version if you really need to give it a spin before buying. Game used to be dirt cheap back in the day. A quarter of my friendlist has it. They got good taste or like buying their humble bundles. I wager its both. I ramble but it's alright. Not much to add to a game that has overwhelmingly positive recommendation rate. If you like shooting and jumping on a 2D plane, this one is worth playing.Enjoy.Oh yeah has a quirky quality to it.

												Many devs claim to have created a metroid inspired game, but not many have actually captured the feel of a metroid game. This game is a cult classic, officially in my eyes. I love metroidvania games, since the creation of Metroid II: Return of Samus, which is one of those games thats dear to my heart. Cave story copies this format and build its on its own, to create a experience that's unique in its own right. The game has very memorable NPCs and a great story to boot. A very obscured story that throws most players back to the weird and wild 16 bit era of gaming. There's nothing too complex here with the story, but its very charming. Gameplay has the learn the pattern of the boss or die most old school games are all too familiar with. The satisfaction of defeating a boss after dying a bit is there. This game is very much approachable for the average gamer, but for those who want to experience the true cave story experience then he or she will go for the true ending, which will test your platforming and shooting skills you've learned while traversing through the game. I hope you are ready, because i wasn't. Daisuke Amaya aka pixel, you are a genius.			"

												The original ""indie"" title of PC. Made in 2004, it was released as freeware and was only in Japanese. It got translated by fans of the game and became one of the cult-classics for PC Indie gaming. All of this was during a time when Steam was barely a thing, and most indie games were free.This game has aged, and with its age has become more amazing. I have only been dragged back into this game more and more over the years, and about a year ago I was craving the gameplay and story from this game. I downloaded the freeware title; however, I soon came to realize the updated, upgraded version was out, so I bought it. I don't regret a thing.The game sports a classic 2D style of shooter. You can get more health by collecting capsules, some are hidden, others aren't. Each weapon you obtain can gain levels, each level unlocking increased attack or fighting styles for the weapon. You get experience from killing enemies, and enemies will take the experience back if they hit you. Speaking of enemies: this game has a lot. I think there are close to 100 different fightable enemies over the course of the entire game.On to the story. The story is very well designed and I cannot remember a game before this one that was able to keep me engaged long enough to care to remember the names of characters or their personalities. This game made me want to look after the lives of the characters, and will often torture you with suspense. It's a very linear sort of story, but the world is like that of Metroid. You can go around and complete smaller side-quests or just continue the main story. Some side-quests or small actions have more influence on the story than one would originally think.On a scale of one to ten, I'd have to rate this a 9/10. It's a very well polished adventure through the denizens that live in the world of Cave Story.			"

												Cave Story is a great game, there's no doubt about that. It is worth playing all the way through and working towards the ending of your choice. There is great depth in the story and the player has control over the length of exploration to some extent. The characters are somewhat memorable and the story is compelling enough to keep you engaged through a playthrough.While the story was great, what kept me fully engaged in the experience was the gameplay and the way it functions. The health system and its link to the weapon system was very satisfying and rewarding. The character movement via jumping and the jetpack was refreshing and very satisfyingly fluent.That being said, I found it to be a little short for my liking and I struggled with certain areas while I found others far too easy, but there was nothing that overshadowed the positives of the strong narrative and the satisfying gameplay mechanics.Overall it is a must-own title (though I would wait for a sale as it is a bit overpriced imo).

												Cave Story is my all-time favourite game. I played it for my first time back in 2006, and it's charming story and enjoyably difficult gameplay have stuck with me to this day.However, I cannot in good conscience recommend you spend money on Cave Story+. Cave Story was and still is a freeware game developed solely by a fellow named Pixel. A quick Google search will lead to the official tribute site where you can freely download the original Cave Story. The additions which the publisher Nicalis included in Cave Story+ are not noteworthy, and in some aspects actually detract from the original game. For example, the new visual style is quite ugly in comparison to the original, and Nicalis' altered dialogue negatively affects the impact that certain characters will have on youI would recommend you avoid this Steam release and play the original freeware version instead. As I said, this game is fantastic, but you should enjoy it as its creator Pixel intended it to be enjoyed: as a freeware game.			"

												I had played the original Cave Story back in 2010, when I read an article about it on 'Hak5'. I liked it 10 minutes into the game, and loved it by the end; when I had had experienced two different endings. ""Multiple endings! Wow!"", I thought; and when I read more about it, I found out that there was one another ""best"" ending, and some more hidden secrets that I was yet to discover. So I went back to the game, and I did. That was awesome, discovering something new about something that you are already in awe of. A couple of years forward, I'm playing Cave Story+, with polished graphics, remastered and new music, new game modes, and what not; and I'm totally in love, all over again. Take my word for it, this game is awesome, you will enjoy it to the core. But, if you do like to read more on why I think so, here goes:  Your decisions, and there by your actions will have a bearing on the sort of a game end that you will experience. You will still discover secrets when playing it for the 'n'th time, there by hugely increasing the game's replay value (provided you don't refer to something similar to 'Cave_Story_Secrets.txt' after the first time, or worse, before you have even completed the game; you will be very very tempted though, and hey, there's no shame in addressing a few guilty pleasures; I always do).  You will love getting lost in a fantastic 2-D world, with beautiful sprites and background art; an awesome score that sets the mood of the area and the situation you are in. And at last, you will relish, and be in awe of the fact that all of this, from programming; to all the graphics, music; to the big fantastic story in its entirety (which gets revealed in bits, a lot of it through a lot of the characters who are beautifully woven into its strands) was originally conceived by a single guy (who aptly calls himself 'Pixel'). A SINGLE GUY! Pixel's spirit is that of Hermit Gunsmith, (the drowsy creator of Polar Star; ""What's 'Polar Star'?"", you ask! I say, ""Play the game and you shall know."") for he says a few words of wisdom, late into the game, that very much reflect the guy that Pixel is.""There remains a very delicate balance in this world, between those who create and those who will experience the creations of others. I can't say that I wasn't aware of this. However, I had never experienced it. Now, thanks to you, I finally have. As long as the there is someone who will appreciate the work involved in creation, the effort is time well spent. To this end, I will continue to create for as long as I can."" - Hermit Gunsmith; Creator, Polar Star & Spur.


Time well spent...

Say what you will, I will always be of the opinion that creating something like this (referring to the core of the game here / original version), with everything that it has, is extremely complex, even for a couple of people. A SINGLE GUY! EVERYTHING! Having played Cave Story(+) a good number of times; I deem this game, a creation born out of utmost love; and just for that single fact, it has inspired me.If you can't afford this now, you can still play the free version[www.cavestory.org]. Apart from some bells and jingles, the core of the game is all there in the original version, you won't miss anything major.			"

												Straight up a masterclass in an individual’s performance to make such a ground-breaking game in the sense of incorporating such a heavy use of pixel art in a game that has no doubt been an inspiration for many an indie game in recent days.Bear in mind that the man who created this had to do it all by himself in every department such as programming the frustrating AI enemies, composing each of the great pieces of music and even doing the design and implementation of his graphical art style.When you look at it in a sense, Cave Story is a game that deserves more praise than it gets. Far more praise than a game such as Undertale received as it was indeed made by one man as well but the gap in technology to do so between a game made in 2004 and the latter 2015 is truly an achievement.

												This game is the Dark Horse of it's kind. If you have enough money in your wallet, you should totally buy it- if you like a challenge, or just want something to play in your spare time. I was expecting some short, sweet puzzle... and that's not what you get. This game is frustrating, The enemies are unforgiving. You're on your toes all the time. Your actions have consequences, and the ending can change varying on your actions, and I like that, it gives you some form of personal objective throughout the experience. I'm on the verge of completing this game after restarting a couple times just to get the best ending (I know that's a bit tedious but I know I'd regret it if I didn't). The plot just grows thicker after every task you complete, you could insert a pretty neat pop culture reference here but I can't seem to pin point one that fits it to a T. There's so much more to this game than I can find the words to explain correctly, In fact, I think 'Game' is a pretty undermining word for this masterpiece. Pixel has injected gold into this. Even the tracks are GOAT, they never get boring. This game has triumphed my heart.			"

												One of the best games ever made... No questions asked. This is more than a game: it is the reason why we have games such as Super Meat Boy, To The Moon, The Binding of Isaac and many more great indie games. This game alone created the indie gaming market. If this game didn't exist: the industry would be so much different.The first thing that you will notice about Cave Story is the retro-like style with the fantastic 8 bit like visuals and music (it is more refined than that as the game looks better than an NES game). Speaking of which, the soundtrack in this game is simply beautiful. So many tracks are flowing with emotion such as Moonsong and Geothermal, to name two. These are some of the best songs I have ever heard: I am not even joking. And most importantly, the gameplay is very good and refined. In its heart, Cave Story is an amazing platformer shooter action game with a great story. And, the story is just fantastic. You play as a robot who wakes up in a cave. He cannot remember anything, so he finds a pistol and discovers a place called Mimiga Village. In here, he discovers the war that the cute rabbit-dog like creatures are going through currently; and you have to help. I don't want to spoil anything, but let's just say the story gets REALLY good as it hits the narrative hook. The story, the visuals, the gameplay and the music is the reason why you will come back for more Cave Story. In fact, I am on my third playthrough at the moment! With multiple endings, difficulties and another mode, Cave Story is worth all of the money in the world. What is even better than a cheap $10 price point? The original game is free... That is right: the game is actually freeware and can be downloaded from cavestory.org. Cave Story+ brings more things to the table, but the game is worth paying for.Trust me and all of the other die-hard Cave Story fans.... Get the game now. It is just unethical to not try the original freeware game that has changed the gaming industry forever.			"

												So after years of occupying a place in my Backlog, I finally decided to give Cave Story a shot.And I can definitely see why people adore this game so much. Playing the game, you can't help but feel the love and hard work put into it, and sometimes its hard to believe this game was made just by one guy.You could easily  place this game alongside indie darlings like Fez, Braid or Super Meat Boy, with its great pixel art and catchy soundtrack, and it's even more incredible to think this came out in 2004, before the indie craze even started. Every corner of the game is polished and well thought out, so you never get the feeling you are indeed playing a freeware game ( Yes, you can play this game for free, this edition simply includes remastered graphics and soundtrack and some other extras).As for gameplay, I would call this a ""2D Ratchet and Clank"", where you have an arsenal of versatile weapons to quickly swap inbetween enemy encounters and platforming segments.The game has a wonderful weapon leveling up system where you can get a stronger version of the weapon you are using if you manage to collect enough power up items dropped by enemies, yet getting hit enough times downgrades it back to regular form.This gives you a sense of feedback, where you feel you are getting rewarded for playing better.Different kinds of enemies will have you constantly switching weapons in real time to deal with each situation as they come, and the bosses will always have you on the edge of your seat, dodging all kind of attacks and projectiles.You might get the sense at first that this game is a Metroidvania, but you soon realize that levels are very much linear, but there is a ton of secrets and easter eggs to uncover if you like that sort of stuffThe game is fairly accessible while still being very challenging as you go along, and for the hardcore crowd out there, you can try going for the True Ending where you are tasked with beating an incredibly hard level and a Final Boss all in one go without checkpoints, that alone will take you 2-3 hours minimum to beat, unless you are some sort of gaming machine.As for the story, its a very simple tale that grabs with you with it's charming characters and setting, with a few emotional punches along the way. Nothing complex about it, but its enough to get you invested, and it fits perfectly with the genre and artstyle, and there is depth in it if you are willing to search for itIt's very easy to see why Undertale was inspired by this game, taking into account the many parallels between both games.I'd say definitely play it, you have nothing to lose( literally, it's free if you don't care for extra content).One of the best indie game ever made, and one of the best free games ever made.

												Overall, Cave Story was a really great game. I would defenitely reccommend this to anyone who wants a fun and challenging game to play.Pros:* Fluid controls* Multiple weapons to use from a swords to bubble guns* Weapons can level up as you kill enemies* A pretty good story* Multiple Endings* Difficulty options* Amazing soundtrack* Great retro graphics* Can choose between original freeware graphics and updated 16bit graphics* Can also change between the original's 8bit music and a remastered soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky (There's also the Wiiware soundtrack if you want to torture yourself)While the game has quite a few pros, there were a few issues I had with Cave Story.Cons:* Characters felt a little bland* Getting hit can cause weapons to level down which becomes very frustrating in the later half of the game* There are quite a few cheap deaths and injuries throughout the game* The game tries to have sad moments, but since the characters are a bit flat and the game is quite short, I felt as though I couldn't get invested enough to feel sad for the most part* The requirements for getting the true ending are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and there is a huge difficulty spike in order to achieve itOverall though, I still reccommend this game to anyone who is looking for a good metroidvania styled game.

												Once, a while ago, a friend told me to check out this game known as Cave Story. At the time, I didn't really have a PC, so I had to buy it on the 3DS eShop. It was some of the most fun I'd had in a while, and I would occasionally check in with him on how I was doing, and he would chuckle a bit and tell me to keep going. I miss talking to him, because he introduced me with one of my favorite games of all time. Then, another friend told me about Cave Story+. I had owned a Steam account for a couple of years at that point, but I was what you may call a ""free-to-play."" This was my first game that I bought. This was how I spent my time for a while, replaying the game with all the new stuff I knew how to do. I still haven't beaten Heavy Press, but I want to spend some time on it. I gave this game to my girlfriend for Christmas, and she absolutely loves it. We both have a lot of fun playing it together, and it makes me so happy that this game has signified friendships with so many people, and I hope that it brings a bit of joy to your life too. That's Pixel's goal. To make the world a little bit better.			"

												Cave Story+ at first turned me off because of the graphics, but I still decided to give it a shot and the gameplay and storyline took over and made the rest irrelevant.  This is not a short game by any means, and it's a very fun game with a smooth and fluid action.  The gameplay adds new powers and new guns are you progress through it.  The bosses become harder and harder and by the end you are very satisfied.  I loved the ending, but unfortunately, I did not get the good ending.  I'm not playing through it a second time on the hardest difficulty and trying to get to the good ending.			"

												Jesus, what can I say about cave story.It is a one man powerhouse. ONE MAN in japan made this game in its original form, over the course of five years or so.  Music, graphics, story,  The one man army known as  Studio Pixle made this masterpiece. every aspect in this game, as far as I am concerned, is wonderful, nostalgic, and oh so new despite it looks like a dusty NES cartridge you may find at the pawn shop. I am still blown away. The story is amazing, very dark and misleading since all of the cute characters can and will die in horrible ways if you take a wrong turn, and you will usually be the one bregrudginly pulling the trigger. If you are part of the NES generation like me, you will feel so at home in cave story, you may just never stop playing. (Interesting fact, the guy who remade the soundtrack for the Nippon Ichi Remake of Cave story 3D on Nintendo 3DS, Daniel Baranowski, was a guy I went to school with from elementary through high school in Arizona. You may know him from his past and recent projects of making the soundtrack for Crypt of the necro dancer, and super meat boy. Just an inside word, the guy is a total tool, and it pains me to know he was chosen by Nipon Ichi to touch this masterpiece and remake the soudtrack for 3DS. BOOOOOO!)			"

												Don't misunderstand my review. I recommend the ORIGINAL game, which you can find on the internet downloadable for free. Hopefully people will vote up my review as helpful because I provided the link to where you can do so: http://www.cavestory.org/download/cave-story.phpCS+ is not worth its unnecessarily expensive price of $15, and the only reason I bought the game was because of Halloween sales. I'm not sure whether or not the pros outweigh the cons, (crappy translation and ""updated"" graphics versus new game modes and stats/achievements visible on Steam) but this is actually a good game. In fact, it's one of the best indie games I've ever played, hands-down. Seriously, download the original version right now, and buy CS+ when it's on sale.			"

												Cave Story+ is an overall good metroidvania experience with some memorable tunes and a bit of humor. It provides around 6 hours of fun for a single playthrough and some light frustration. I tried using a guide to access the best ending, but uh… more on that later. I should also note that this version of Cave Story looks much better than the original, but you can choose to play with the classic graphics and music should you want to check those out.GameplayYou will do plenty of jumping, shooting, and exploring. Every weapon you have at your disposal will have 3 levels with each one acting or performing differently. The Machine Gun, for example, will plink away rapidly at enemies at level 1, but at level 3, you can fire downwards to hover or gain height. The Missile Launcher will fire a single missile at level 1 and 3 missiles at level 3. Be aware that weapons can lose their experience whenever you take damage. This encourages learning how to avoid or destroy enemies effectively while collecting the valuable experience to keep you powerful. I definitely did everything I could to make sure my weapons would stay at max level in preparation for the many boss fights that the game has to offer.The platforming aspect remains fairly simple until you acquire either the Machine Gun or a booster which opens up directional air dashing (up down left right). Before acquiring those kind of items, you’ll mostly be using your basic jump to navigate the levels and the obstacles within. Some areas of the game can require very precise jumps and movement. Failing to play well can result in instant death depending on the area. Some areas have instant death spikes, instant death crushing, or falling to your death. It’s very unpleasant to run into one of those deaths and having to go through the section again from the last save point used. Keep in mind, there are no checkpoints.Exploration yields different benefits as you can collect health power-ups, missile launcher max ammo upgrades, find side-quests, and locate hidden items. The map is fully revealed with only hidden areas not being completely obvious. Now I’ll bring up my issue with the best ending route. It results in one of the last areas of the normal game having a huge difficulty spike, especially for someone like me that hates instant death. It changes the area to have more spikes/obstacles and all weapons will be reset to level 1. I was able to get through eventually, but that did require more than a handful of attempts. Then you’ll need to take on an additional and very difficult dungeon that resets your weapon levels again which was completely beyond me. So if you’re around my skill level, you’d better be content with getting the good/bad endings and watching the best ending on Youtube. Story and Other StuffThe story is simple, sad, and peppered with some odd, funny moments. The game starts you off with amnesia. From that point on, you’ll meet weird people, find weird items, discover what the heck is going on with all the bunny people (Mimigas), and unlock achievements that like to make the jokes. To know the full story, the best ending route needs to be pursued/watched since there are some important plot points and some surprises.There are two additional modes. ?????’s Story lets you play as another character through the same game, but with additional dialog (the default protagonist is silent). You do have to find a hidden item to unlock that mode. The second one provides different challenges with different weapons. They are timed and feel like obstacle courses. I only did one. I didn’t care much for it.-That’s it. I’ve nothing more to say. Don’t touch the big spikes. Don’t ever touch them.			"

												Cave Story is a two-dimensional platformer developed originally by a single person and released for Windows as a freeware title in late 2004. It has since gained incredible popularity on the internet for its stellar gameplay and excellent story, as it rightfully should have. This release of the game, Cave Story+, has quite a few extra features compared to the 2004 original. Among these are selectable difficulties, an option to play with remastered graphics and sound, and many challenges and extra game modes. I consider this the definitive version of the game due to the aforementioned additions. There are some known issues, however. Users have reported this came to not run properly on the Mac operating system (OS X). Some are also dissatisfied with the new localization this version received. I disagree with this notion, though if you wish, you may download and apply the original the original fan-translation to Cave Story+.The gameplay consists of you running and shooting enemies, in a simplistic sense. This is what you would expect from this sort of game. It does not end there, however. The world that you are presented is extensive and will leave you playing and exploring for hours. The weapon system is quite unique. Your weapons are charged with experience points collected from fallen enemies and they can be upgraded from level one to level three, each level making the weapon more powerful than the last(or the opposite in one particular case). This being said, you can also lose weapon experience by taking damage. This presents a unique challenge that is not present in other games. There are many different weapons that the player may use, some being much more powerful than others. There is also a dialogue system that serves as your means of communicating with other characters and to understand the story and the environment you are in. All of this is backed by well-implemented controls that feel natural and responsive while being customizable.The music is, for lack of a better word, awe-inspiring. The music, both the original and the remastered soundtrack, compliment and fit perfectly with the story and the world itself. Each character has their own memorable theme that you surely will not soon forget. The game gives you the option of choosing the original, remastered, or ""new"" soundtrack. I personally prefer the remastered soundtrack, but the original is quite excellent too. This is the kind of music that I have found myself listening to both in and out of the game. The narrative is very well-written and interesting. You awaken in a cave on the floating Mimiga Island with no recollection of who you are or why you are here. As your traverse the caves, you eventually find Mimiga Village, home of the Mimiga, a race of adorable rabbit-like creatures. In their initial forms, they are harmless. But if they eat the infamous red flower, they turn rabid and become incredibly strong. Though, they eventually consumed by the strength and are killed. The initial antagonist of the game, simply referred to as ""The Doctor"", has seized ownership of the Demon Crown, a relic that allows him control over some powerful beings. He plans to use the red flowers to make an army of rabid Mimiga and send them to the surface and conquer the world. You and a small group of allies have the task of defeating the Doctor and to restore peace to Mimiga Island. The rest of the story is slowly revealed to the player throughout the course of the game. Some plot points require some thought to fully understand. You meet many interesting characters throughout your journey that aid you throughout the game and become your friends. There are many shocking moments and revelations in the story where you perhaps would not expect. The story is not what you would call ""predictable"". There is also a choice system. Some are minor, such as those involved in having a conversation with a character. Others are more meaningful, for example, the life of a certain character depends on your previous choices. By the end of the game, I found myself attached to the characters(particularly Curly Brace). This motivated me to achieve the greatest ending.While we are on the topic of endings, some things must be addressed. There are three main endings to Cave Story, though there are variations to some endings. First is the ""bad"" ending, which is the easiest to achieve, but the worst, and saddest, to achieve story-wise. Next is the normal or neutral ending, which is the ending that most players achieve. It involves you completing your mission, but at the cost of the lives of some of your friends. Lastly, we have the ""good"" ending, or the greatest ending. This is by far, the hardest of the three to achieve, and rightfully so. The narrative concludes with all of your friends alive and well, thanks to your actions, along with defeating the Doctor and restoring peace to Mimiga Island. When I say achieving this ending is difficult, I truly mean it. You must carry out a specific set of events to save the lives of your friends and gain access to the true final stage and boss of the game. Cave Story is a fairly difficult game, especially if you are playing on the higher difficulties. It is however, very possible and forgiving. There are many save points strategically placed throughout the game for the purpose of making the game fun. This being said, the final mission necessary to achieve the best ending will show no mercy. While this stage is by far the most difficult, it only makes the ending you worked for that much better.In conclusion, Cave Story is the greatest platformer, and perhaps the greatest indie game, I have ever played due to its unique weapons system, great gameplay, and impressive soundtrack. It presents a fantastic story that can bring someone to tears and has many different endings to maximize replayability. Because of all of this, I am sure I will find myself replaying Cave Story many times in the future. I recommend that you do too.			"

												It's hard to believe this game is now over 10 years old, but it's still one of my favorite games of all time. Cave Story simple expressive pixel style has quietly been influencing indie games abroad ever since, from Fez to Momodora and countless others. It's simple, but you spend some time with it you'll see it's not at all coming from a lack of artistic talent or effort. Sprites have just enough detail to give a sence of action and imagination to their movements and there is no lack of personality. Large boss battles really show off the fluid action and animations best, and are never boring to look at.The story is no small part of this gem's appeal, with multiple endings, characters you won't forget, well-hidden secrets and alot of love behind these seemingly simple low-rez characters. This is the kind of game you'll want to play through again and experience the endings and see the things you've missed. And it definitely stands up to the test of time a decade later in humor and heart.Lastly I feel like this games soundtrack is just something unforgettable. The remastered music in this package is optional, and in personal opinion I feel the original music is much better, so I'd recommend anyone's first playthrough consider switching to the 'old' music. I'm so adament about that because it's just -that- good, it feels wrong for people to miss it as it originally was.(imho)Everyone comes away from this game with something about it they love personally, whether it's the music, memorable boss battles or a specific character they connect with. All created by just one man, do yourself a favor and play this labor of love.			"

												I haven't gotten very far in the Steam version, but like so many others I played the fan translation eons ago and had a grand old time. I bought it on sale for $5 because that is what I can afford, but if I could have i would have spent the full purchase price because this is such a wonderful game and deserves every cent spent on it.It has everything an homage to the classics needs: a storyline typical of old NES rpgs, plenty of side-characters with their own personalities and goals, hidden spots for you to creep along if you so desire. The battle system is straight forward but challenging, the hazards in each area are well-placed and surmountable, though you might die a couple of times trying to figure it out at first.Haven't tried any of the new challenges or modes yet, but I look forward to giving them a go once I complete my replay of the main story. Despite my obvious nostalgia goggles firm in place, I urge anyone and everyone to play this absolute joy of a game.			"

												Played this before it hit Steam and it's one of my all time favorite games. The additions are really awesome. The GFX mode is good but I recommend using the original or remastered music because it's AMAZING. The new music..I don't know, it's hard to judge since i'm already such a fan of the original OST.10/10+Art/Music/Gameplay/Story♥♥♥♥ing classic. One of the greatest games of all time.			"

												Cave Story......(aka Doukutsu Monogatari) was released on the 20th December of 2004 as a freeware game in japan, got translated by Aeon Genesis and got popular on the internet. Cave Story+ is the remake of it. It's a 8bit styled vertical platformer-shooter with nice graphics, a well done soundtrack and a great, creative story. You, a robot called Quote, awoke in a dark cave without any memories. So the only thing you can do for now is to go to the Mimiga Vilage and see whats happening there. You will find out that a evil doctor is planning to kidnap all of those rabit-like creatures and your new mission is to save those creatures and save the world.Positive:- Well written story- Solid and responsible controlls- Nice creative gameplay elements inspired from the 8bit NES classics- New Graphics and Soundtracks- 5 Challenges added- New dungeon ""Wind Fortres"" added- Archivmentsystem addedNegative:- Broken archivementsystem: ""Curse Broken"", the archivement after getting the best ending won't unlock so it is not possible to get that game 100% + Archivements won't unlock on japanese.- Broken Replay Function in challenges: Sometimes replays won't play correctly. It happend several times to me and i'm upset about that because i've beaten Wind Fortress within 2 minutes and Sanctuary within 6 minutes and guess what? I cant see what i've done there. That sucks.- Game closes after finishing a challenge. Thats minor but annoying. The Wii version haven't done something like that.- English Nicalis translation. The Aeon Genesis translation looks and sounds way better than that one by Nicalis. Fortunite, someone ported the AG translation to Cave Story+ in the Comunity guides but be aware that most of the archivements won't unlock with that translation.Since there is a freeware version of this game here are a few things that aren't present in the freeware version:- Difficulties:   - Easy: Player takes half damage.  (- Original: The name it self says that allready)   - Hard: Brutally challenging. You only have 3HP most of the game.- Curly Mode (The same as the original story but you play as Curly Brace instead of Quote)- 5 Challenges (3 of them with brutal timebased Rankings from C to S):- New (awesome) Graphics- New Soundtrack (some kind of softer 8bit soundtrack. Original sounds better in my opinion)- Remastred Soundtrack (sounds like a techno mix. pretty awesome)- New dungeon ""Wind Fortres"" (avaiable via challanges)- ArchivementsystemConclusion: It is a great remake of the original game with some things added and a high replay value. The story is binding, the characters rememberble and the gameplay nearly flawless. I can highly recomend this game for those 8bit and retro fans. For those hwo are sceptical about the game: try freeware version first. But i wouldn't buy it for 15€ (USD whatever) because it is a little bit overpriced for these addons. i would buy it for 10€, also if this game is on sale.			"

												This game is upgraded Steam edition of the game Cave Story originally released in 2004, created singlehandedly by Daisuke ""Pixel"" Amaya. On the first glance, I was immediately repelled by outdated, 8-bit style graphics, but I played on for about 5 minutes, and I was compelled to finish the whole game in a single sitting because of how well-made the game was. Storyline is creative, controls are very responsive, action looks very nice, soundtracks are really catchy, and level designs are amazing. Only thing I feel that this game lack is an easier difficulty because it may be a bit challenging for many novice gamers. This game has multiple endings so replay value is great. This game is one of the best action sidescroller out there, and I give this game full recommendation.			"

A masterpiece of classic platformingImpecably precise gameplay, a magnificent OST, a plethora of alternate options for replay value, an immersive story and setting with beautifully varied environments that never grates on me, passionately constructed sprites, characters I really care about (take note every other game ever, this is how to make me give a damn about NPCs) but what really makes this game stand out as a 10/10 is my emotional response.An errant entry in my randomized music playlist and a song from this game plays--suddenly a wave of emotions consume me in an embalming torrent. Joy, inspiration, zeal, hatred, regret, anxiety, shock, hopelessness, awe, admiration, valor, this game overwhelms me with passion. I will never give more ♥♥♥♥s than the day after I beat this game and learned that there was an alternate ending. Suddenly, ♥♥♥♥s poured out of me from every pore, bursting in flame to fuel my journey through hell.			"

Product received for free
												Let's be upfront, I love this game. I do, it's fun and energetic and really just a short and sweet experience that is no longer than it needs to be. Most of the game just works, and I do recommend this game just on the principle of how good it is. The soundtrack is wonderful, the gameplay is fun, and it's just really good storytelling. There are other reviews here that will sing all the praises of this game to the high heavens.However, in the interest of my own sanity, I'm going to vent a little. I'm going to talk about the design of the last level for the best ending of the game, and I don't think I'm spoiling anything, but if you are worried about that, feel free to make your own judgement call.With that out of the wayBlood Stained Sanctuary sucks. A lot. A lot of monkey nuts is what it sucks. It sucks so hard that I will do the proper abreviation of BS, remoiving the Sanctuary S because there is no sanctity in hell.It would make a lot of sense as a challenge mode meant for people who wanted to put their ""MLG 720 Pro"" skills to a test, There's even a timer to tell you how long it takes for you to die. It's certainly difficult to get through, and it offers a big ol' challenge.However, there is a difference between playing a game to be good and playing a game to have fun. Pro LoL players play a game to be good, almost every Rocket League player is trying to have fun. A pro Smash player is playing to be good, a family is playing Smash to have fun.The challenges are meant for someone who derives fun out of being amazing, out of working and working and working to get the shortest time possible, and then rubbingn it in the face of everyone else.BS does not quite understand this. It starts off with a fairly consistent challenge of flying over instant death spikes, and then the next two rooms are actively trying to destroy my will to live.After one bossfight, you will be rewarded with a slight breather, and then sent into a second bossfight, And at no point, in this entire sequence, are you given the option to save. Hell, you don't even have the option to refill your health between the two bosses. And you can kiss any health you lost on the way to BS goodbye. First of all, no one should ever, EVER, be able to summarize any significant portion of a game with the word ""cluster♥♥♥♥"". Two rooms and at least one bossfight in BS, however, are described perfectly in that way. It's annoying and it's unfair. Not difficult, unfair. Dark Souls is difficult, but Dark Souls is also great because it gives players a way to beat the game. Dark Souls, for all of its deaths, is surprisingly forgiveable and always makes sure the player thinks ""I can do this"", even when it drops the ball during certain fights (Bed of Chaos anyone?). BS is a random cluster♥♥♥♥ of falling blocks followed by a fight with a million tiny sprites that shoot arrows that deal far too much damage.Secondly, BS just shouldn't be the path to the ""best ending"" of the game. While I agree that a challenge is expected for the end of a game, I also feel that the challenge should be fair and it should be generally conceivable that a player of middling to decent skill should be able to overcome that challenge, at least on normal mode. If you are playing a game for fun, then you want to have fun all the way through. Bloodstained Sanctuary is like going on a couple of roller coasters, and then having your face beaten reapetedly into the asphalt because the park owner was offended out how you tried to have ""fun"" on what he thought was an extreme obstacle course meant for HerculesThirdly, and this is more tangential, BS brings up a comparison to the old Metroid games, which is bad because I can so clearly see where Metroid did it better. The entire levels is falling apart, evidenced by the massive rumblings and the faling bloocks of doom that knock out a fifth of your health. Metroid, too, always ended on the entire gameworld collapsing around you. Except you had seen all these portions fo the game world before, and going back was more a trip down memory lane. While road workers were trying to fill all of the potholes. And you were being chased by Jason Voorhees. See, we hadn't even been given a real hint that that BS existed, you were just supposed to know that. And then you were supposed to dodge all of the falling blocks. And the little winged people, While using a jetpack. That always manages to fall into the path of a block because all blocks fall fast and the entire level is a cluster♥♥♥♥.Okay, I've had my breather, I've voiced my complaints. I'm good. I'm doing fine. Now I'm going to sit around for a while, and pick up Cave Story later. When BS is not going to immediatly give me an aneurysm.Scratch that, just looked it up, says if I do sub-6 minutes BS run I get a Curly Brace themed title screen. If I pick up this game again, I'm going to lose my life.			"

												I love Cave Story.No, I mean, you have no idea. I LOVE this game. Top five favorite games ever, seriously.""But Jim, I've never played it before. What's so amazing about it?""  Well, ya dingus, do you enjoy tight controls? Do you enjoy replay value thanks to multiple endings and ten vastly different weapons? Do you enjoy runney-jumpey-shootey gameplay that progresses into precision platforming over instant death traps while dodging swarms of enemies? Do you enjoy awesome, catchy music? Do you enjoy a nice serving of cute aesthetic with a side of surprisingly dark story? Then here, go download the freeware version (http://www.cavestory.org/downloads_game.php) and marvel in the fact that this game was made by ONE PERSON.""But now I already have the freeware version. What's so great about this version? Is it worth the ten dollars?"" Damn straight it's worth the ten dollars.- Three difficulty settings: Easy for the Easy Mode folks, and Hard Mode for true masochists. No Life Capsules, no Missile Launcher, Fox only, Final Destination.- Updated graphics and music in addition to the original styles, allowing you to mix and match to your liking. (The Remastered music is pretty sweet, but the New is...eh.)- Three save slots, as opposed to the freeware version's one (six if you count the Curly Story setting).- The Curly Story setting.- Sweet post-game content.- And so on and frigging so forth.The best part? A portion of your money will go right to Pixel. The guy spent five years making this game. He deserves your money. Give him your money.Also, use a damn controller if you have one.			"

-Quick Review-Cave Story is a 2D platformer which takes you back to the 16-bit days, the game was released on steam in 2011, but the game was released in Japan in 2004 by Studio Pixel. Cave Story is not only a great platformer, it tells an interesting and far deeper story then you may realize on your first play through, if that wasn't enough, there are various decisions you can make throughout the game to obtain different items and even different story endings. -Detailed breakdown review- Story:  Maybe I heard Brentalfloss on Spotify singing the catchy theme song before playing the first 10 minutes of the game at a friend's house... and immediately knew I wanted this game. (Seriously, look up his song, it's sooooo good.)Cave story starts out... DUN DUN DUN, in a cave! You're a boy who wakes up with no memory, but you soon learn of a mad scientist who intends to use these adorable bunny creatures (known as "" Mimigas"") in a sinister experiment to gain power.As you progress through the story you pick up different items, accessories, weapons, and even a few aesthetics. There are also four different endings to the game, meaning if you didn't like the ending you got... guess what you get to do? mwahaha. While this feature is normally annoying, there's so much to discover I easily enjoyed playing the game again. Game Play: The controls are as simple as they get; up, down, left, right, shoot, and switch weapon. The game quickly changes the way you play with the addition of different weapons/accessories that may have a different impact on your character... I'm trying to be cryptic, shush.There's really not much else that can be said about the Game Play, without giving away fun items that you discover from playing the game. I should mention that this game is one of those ""probably more fun to play with a controller"", but I'm dead set in my keyboard and mouse ways, so I've spent all my time playing this game with a keyboard; still an excellent, fun game. Achievements: There are 75 achievements for Cave Story, I have 57 of them (as of 04/20/15), I also have no shame in admitting I probably won't be getting any more of them, because this game is pretty tough in general... and I'm not even remotely close to a platforming-deity... Ask Super Meat Boy. *muffled crying* (It's a running gag, my friends get it... pops up in my reviews often.) There are different categories for achievements: Story achievements, Item/weapon Collection Achievements, a few hidden achievements, Get a high letter rank on Bonus mission's, and End-Game Achievements. The most difficult achievements being: Hidden, Letter Rank, and End-Game Achievements. Price: For just one payment of $14.99 you can enjoy the story inside a cave too! Seriously, that's a very fair asking price for a game I spent nearly 30 hours playing in the first two weeks of owning it. But if you're tight on money, just wait for a sale. Conclusion: Cave Story is often times difficult (even on easy mode); the music is catchy, the game play is addictive, the controls are straight forward, and pretty much everything about the game is fun. The only real negative thing anyone can say about the game is that they might have mechanical problems (but those are few and far between).I absolutely recommend this game!			"

												Cave Story is a great game, but I can't recommend Cave Story+. Cave Story+ adds slightly higher-resolution (but still low-resolution) graphics, new music (that's inferior to the original music in my opinion), slightly better input device support, Steam integration, and some corny holiday-specific themes. But they significantly changed the game dialog, making it less charming and emotionally impactful, and to me that outweighs the new graphics. You can still download the original Cave Story for free, and if you want to support Daisuke Amaya (the creator of Cave Story), you can donate to him directly. I wish Cave Story+ included an option to use the original English text, like it does for the original graphics and music.However, if you want to play with a gamepad and don't want to spend any time getting it to work, Cave Story+ is probably the better choice. (It's possible to use a gamepad with the original Cave Story, but it requires some fiddling if I remember correctly.)			"

												This game is known as the grandaddy of Indie games for a reason. If you are a fan of metroidvania style games then you will likely enjoy this game. Cave Story, despite freeware, is completely worth paying for the ""+"" version which includes a variety of additional content including remastered graphics (which are essentially a higher resolution alternative to the orignal's) and soundtrack. There is plenty of replay value esspecially if achievement hunting is your type of thing. On the matter of achievements, this game boasts some of the most rare and difficult achievements available. If the game strikes your fancy then these achievements feel really good to achieve. Be warned though, one of the achievements is currently broken and will not unlock so if you intend of completing it then keep that in mind. With that said, there is a lot to this game and I highly recommend it.			"

												The game is a re-release of Cave Story (Dōkutsu Monogatari), which was introduced 2004 in Japan by Studio Pixel. Later on it got translations into different languages, among them the english version by Aeon Genesis. The english translation in Cave Story+ is done by Nicalis. Now to the differences of these games:Cave Story+ has more content, these would be:- Variety of the difficulty level (Easy, Original, Hard)- Curly Story (main story with Curly Brace as the heroine)- Challenges (5 in total)- Two new dungeons (only to find in challenge mode)- Remastered soundtrack- Improved graphicsTo the game itself:  The game is a 2D-platformer, which has rpg, action and adventure elements in it. The 8 bit graphics and sound are very well done and give you the feeling like it was back then in the NES 8 bit era. The gameplay is pretty good and the story makes the game enjoyable every second you play it. You are playing a robot who wakes up in a dark cave with memory loss. Stumbling towards a door that robot finds himself in a village in which the inhabitants are rabbit-like creatures called Mimiga. After hearing the Story of an evil doctor who takes away all Mimiga, the robot decides to investigate the matter and finds out that there's a bigger problem than just a few missing Mimiga. Actually the whole world is in danger and the robot is supposed to stop all evil. We all know that system already, the protagonist has to fix it all. now my impressions of the game:positive:+ remastered and original sound are both available (in most cases the original is in my opinion the better choice)+ better graphics (which actually look pretty good, still the old graphics have their own charme)+ curly story (even if it is the same story, it's fun to play with her)+ hard mode and easy mode (hard mode for those who are searching for a real challenge, easy for those who play the game the first time - you need some time to get used to it after all)+ challenge mode (for those who are searching for more challenges)negative:- achievement-system is a bit broken (in most cases you'll get a major part but some are not to get due to this fact)- replay-function is buggy (broken replays are not what you want in a game after all)- you can only shut down the game via the main menu (the original game gave you this option as soon as you pressed ESC, i think they could have kept it this way)- after a completed challenge in challenge-mode the game will be closed (a bit annoying to start the game all over again)- the game will be closed as soon as you want to see ranks in challenge mode (that's what isn't acceptable, if i buy the game, then i want that it won't kick me out once i choose something in the menu)- in my opinion the english translation by Aeon Genesis was matching the game way better than the one by nicalisBut all in all the negative points aren't that dramatic, the game is worth a recommendation for all people who love classic styled games, a good and very interesting story and for those who enjoy challenges.

												Now, I'd say I have trouble recommending this edition of Cave Story. It is quite polished, yes, and does work across platforms - but then again, the original freeware version runs perfectly under Wine. This edition does have alternate challenges, double-res graphics, new and remastered music options, multiple save files, and multiple difficulty modes, but I'm not sure if those really add value over what the original edition provides. I'm also partial to the Aeon Genesis translation - this official translation seems more rote. I would probably not recommend this particular edition of the game.With that said, I'm going to proceed to review Cave Story in and of itself.This game honestly changed my life.I was first introduced to it way back in 2006 by a friend of my older brother's. It was immediately intriguing - the old-style pixel graphics worked well, and I found myself jumping from platform to platform with ease. Without a single tutorial message, I was able to understand very quickly what it meant to die, how to get health upgrades, how to get weapons, how to interact with things. And then I met the characters - King, Tokoro, Balrog, Misery, Sue, Kazuma, Professor Booster - in levels that were simple enough, but whose music and entertaining design kept me going. When the plot took a twist, throwing me into the mysterious Labyrinth from which the only escape was forward, I kept going. As people started dying, I recognized how serious things were getting, and kept on going from there. And then I finally reached an ending, and started again.It wasn't until a few years ago that I finally looked up the details on how to actually save Curly Brace, and I went through those instructions. And I would recommend finding them, because rather than being just another ending (even though the ending itself is fantastic and really draws closure to the rest of the game), it was an additional path with greater challenges, both an additional boss battle in the later half of the game and an entire sprawling bonus stage at the end with a stopwatch timing you if you managed to find it. That alone creates a beautiful amount of replay value - every decision, even those that are less consequential like weapon upgrades, make a huge difference because they now affect this final score. I still play Cave Story today even though I've already played through it many times.Make your own decision about Cave Story+, but you will find yourself enriched and enlivened by Cave Story. I know I did.			"

												Cave Story is such a great game!  Its strengths lie in the storytelling and art-style.Storywise, character development is achieved by slowly revealing new information about the characters.  The game has a level emotional depth to its characters, which is something not often found in this genre.  Multiple branches in the story will happen based on the players actions or inaction, which will have an impact on the outcomes of the characters you meet and befriend.  This branching is done in a way that it's not always apparent when you have made a 'choice'.This depth is why I enjoyed the game (I am not a particular platformer fan) and probably why it has a sort of cult-like status.  I find it similar to how Pixar finds success in Toy Story, which has complex emotional themes despite being a movie for children.			"

It's an extraordinary Metroidvania-styled game where you as a one of the surviving robots who explores throughout the caves in the floating island where the Mimigas, rabbit-like creature, are threatened with slavery and extinction by the evil Doctor who plans to create an army of savage beast by turning the Mimigas into monsters with the red flower. The weapons are awesome, there are four endings (unfortunately it was an April Fool's Joke, so there are three), and some other achievements that are complicated to achieve. Also, some of the bosses are ridiculously difficult to beat. And there's even a little surprise whem you beat the game!Pros:-Gameplay is excellent-Storyline is a hit-The music is incredible-Endings are great-High Definition characters and Backgrounds are beautifully doneCons:-Couldn't get the Bad and Good Ending achievements. Any reason why?-There is no fourth ending (CURSE YOU, APRIL FOOL'S!)-The new remastered music is just lame. I want the old remastered music back! DX			"

												Check it out ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s you can actually review games on steam now, so here's my book report miss, my dad helped me with the really long words, i even spell checked it andCave Story was a freeware game made by some japanese guy in his spare time over the course of 5 years as an homage to the classic vidya he'd played as a kid, like Metroid. After being released in 2004, the game recieved a cult following and was ported to the Wii and 3DS, and also to Steam with some new features, which is the version I'm reviewing right now. You play as a dude who wakes up in a cave, convieniently afflicted with amnesia, and well you run around figuring out what that you're doing on this cave which IS ACTUALLY A FLOATING ISLAND INHABITED BY CUTE RABBIT PEOPLE AND RULED OVER BY SOME CRAZY DOCTOR GUY WHO WANTS TO BRAINWASH THEM AND GET THEM TO FIGHT WARS FOR HIM SO HE CAN TAKE OVER THE WORLDIt's really fun, yeah. And the story is decent too, look, there's these cute anthropomorphic rabbits you can talk to and stuff, I don't care what you search on paheal after you're done with this game, it's all cool, man.But the thing that put me off the game when I tried to play it a couple of years ago is the fact that there's multiple endings. Yeah, that's okay, I do like it when you get some clear cut paragon/renegade options for a good/evil end or if there's some stupid decisions you can make that'll get other main characters killed (and, as such, you can avoid making them), that's fantastic. But in Cave Story, without spoiling too much, the 'good' ending is sort of a secret path that you can only take after you've either beaten the game once and wondered, 'huh, let's try that again but I'll do that differently and see if something else happens', or if you look up a strategy guide. There is one bit that really irked me in which the game shows you something kind of important and you have to make a DELIBERATE EFFORT to avoid investigating i-okay, I'll shut up now, but the key thing that you've got to expect with this game is that you're going to '♥♥♥♥ up' in a sense on the first playthrough, and the best ending is more of a...hidden ending. But it's great. Play through it more than once, definitely, so you can try out the different weapons and stuff.I say this in all of my recommendations but well I really ♥♥♥♥ing dig 8bit soundtracks and this game has one of the best. Pixel (the aforementioned one japanese guy) definitely did a spot-on job of capturing the feel of OLD SCHOOL VIDEO GAME BEATZ, and if THAT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU, then the Plus version comes with a couple more versions of the soundtrack; a 'New' one, which is made by Nicalis and is, honestly, ♥♥♥♥ing awful, and a 'Remastered' one which is composed by none other than Danny mother♥♥♥♥ing Baranowsky,  and if you don't know who that is then ♥♥♥♥ you, it's the Super Meat Boy, Canabalt and Binding of Isaac guy. So play through once with the classic soundtrack and get the decent ending, and then play through it again with the remastered one and get the 'true' or whatever ending and the super secret ultra gun and stuff. It's really, really fun. (I don't know if it showed up in the sale yet but if it does, you know what to do)			"

												This is an improvement of the original, which is one of my favorite games of all time. Options for more modern music and graphics, although I prefer the original music myself, unlockable challenges, three... pretty unique endings, one of which you have to do some stuff to unlock and finish a really hard level that even I haven't managed to finish, and a variety of challenges that vary in fun.  Compared to the free but unstable version with the fact that you have to figure out how to install a language patch to play it, it's worth it. 8.5/10, might want to check some gameplay vids to see if this is a game you'd like.

You get to sleep with a bunny-girl-thing and steal an android chick's panties. 10/10, would do it again.....besides that incredible feature, Cave Story is a real love letter to the classic metroidvania and megaman style games, it manages to mix fast paced combat and platforming action, with robust storytelling, and a surprisingly branching story depending on your actions and choices (With 3 distinct endings, as well as alternative game modes, such as playing as the protagonist's partner, with all the appropriate dialogues changes).The graphics is simple and a call back to older times but remains clean and stylised and doesn't feel like it's being lazy for the sake of calling itself ""retro"", it's small cast of characters are well fleshed out for a game of it's genre, and despite it's cute and happy exterior things can get pretty dark at times.With strong replayability and fun, fast paced combat I feel it's certainly worth the tiny price tag. In fact my only criticism is that Cave Story has only 5 dogs, compared to Undertale's 6Did I mention you can sleep with a mimi... yeah, so, what're you waitting for? "

												Very excelent game. This is the third version of the game I've purchased and played through to completion. The adition of achievements is super neat (though the achievement for beating the true final boss being bugged is a real shame).I didn't really care for the updated music and spritework, so I'm happy there was an option to use the originals. It's a surprisingly short game, which lends itself well to making it very replayable. Controls are tight, weapons are all fun to use, there is a  lot of secret goodies scattered around to find, and most of the bosses are a treat to fight.It looks fantastic, sounds fantastic (like wow, what a brilliant soundtrack), and the story is built up well and is fairly captivating while leaving a lot of the story up to your imagination. Overall: Wow. Play it if you haven't. Absolutely would recoomend. If you reeally don't feel like paying for updated graphics, music, achievements, and a few bonus modes, then the original game can be  downloaded for free if you know where to look.good fun time/10			"

												This is probably my favorite platformer of all time. Even though Steam will report that I've spent 65.8 hours on it as of now, but over the last 3 or 4 years across all versions, that number would be more accurately around 410 hours (350 on the 3DS eShop version alone). This game has- Amazing music, with 2 switchable soundtracks.- Amazing graphics, with an 8-bit and 16-bit style.- Amazing gameplay, about 8 hours long and with very tight controls and good level design.- Tons of speedrunning potential, since the game has very little RNG and the ""secret level"" even comes with an ingame timer.- Mod support, you can import mods for the original Cave Story using a third-party program and add them to the game's Challenges menu.- A decent story that doesn't get in the way of gameplay. Think SotN.If you're on the fence, try out the freeware version online. This and the 3DS eShop version add enough to the game to be worth the money.			"

												This is one of the grandaddies of modern indie PC gaming as we know it today. You'd be hard pressed to find someone that hasn't at least heard of it before, and for good reason. This game is simply a masterpiece.Everything about it is just right and where it needs to be. The gameplay is really fun and demands skill from the player, the characters are all memorable and lovable, the story and its moral message are suprisingly deep, the visuals are nice and crisp, and the music is fantastic. This is a game I can recommend to almost anyone.However, if you are thinking of buying this game, then you must know you will be in for a SERIOUS challenge if you want to get the best ending. Not only because of how difficult it is to figure out how to achieve the good ending by yourself (don't be ashamed if you need a guide for that), but also because one of gaming's most infamous challenges await you. So if you're a quitter, turn back now.			"

												Cave Story is an excellent Metrovania style game, so it pains me to have to leave it a negative review. However as a Mac user I have no choice, as Cave Story doesn't load on Macs running any new or even new-ish version of Mac OS X. There are hacky work arounds involving terminal commands and copying data all over the place, but that shouldn't be necessary. The dev should simply fix it, and it should just work, like every other Steam game does.			"

												The first greatly successful indie game and to a certain extent, the giant spartan kick the Indie genre needed in order to become what we have these days, Minecraft and such might be whoring the spotlight, but if you are into Indie games and Cave Story doesn't ring a bell, you've made a terrible mistake, either that or you are way too young to be on the Internet.StoryIn a word, Outlandish, the premise is very simple, entertaining but nonetheless, well-built and nicely detailed, for a twist, at times, the happenings that unfold in this relentless underground become a quite big and bitter pill to swallow.GameplayCastlevania Story shall intensify, if you have played Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, you will be right at home here, granted you are a little more restricted in both offense and exploration space, however, optional stuff is a plenty and at times, you shall need to use thy brain to earn the loot, be it the act of finding it or getting to it.Weapons are pretty well balanced and the Level-up system encourages the player to keep a delicate balance between balls-to-the-wall guns ablazing and tactical fire, keep your defense more relevant than wrecking everything, gravity is floaty and traction can be very icy at times, not hard to get used to though, and when you get a certain amazing item, you can be both a forced to be feared and be stylish at the same time.WritingThe ink that writes down all the events is quite elegant, i sincerely cannot recall any kind of typo and on top, everyone remains true to their individual personalities, everything is orchestated, pretty well at that, only hick-up would be some itty-bitty happenings when aiming for the Best Ending, mainly a sudden new area and a Final Boss out of nowhere with no build up.GraphicsPixel Art rarely does dissapoint, might be a bad sentence to start this, but my point is, do you remember what I wrote at the beginning?I can't say much for the original art, but as for the remastered art style, it overflows with detail.I think is not very stretchy to say this has managed to stand up to the cruel bast4rd that is time.SoundtrackOh god, the variety is way too much for a cave troll like me.What does float your boat? Retro or Modern-retro or Modern?Regardless of your answer, the Soundtrack option has you covered, even with different styles and approaches, they all manage to create great tunes for ambience and just ear-candy, my personal pick is the Remastered style, but be cautious, you might have some tracks burnt into the back of your mind for the next few weeks.DurationFor a Metroidvania style game, generally one can say is on the short side, if you are quick to getting the hang of it, you can get the Good Ending in about 5 hours, but be prepared to have your patience and staying power tested and tempered if you decide to find and get the Best Ending (Difficulty walls are a beautiful thing, let me tell you).However if you are like me (Don't do that, you're taking the wrong path) and decide to 100% this game's Achievements, oh boy, you are in a cup of lemon juice over a dry open cut.I think its accurate to say some of these are among things that only those very dedicated people do (Looking right at you, Unstoppable and Hell under 3 mins achievements!!), not to mention one of these Achievements is bugged and will not unlock unless you use a Program, Yeah yeah, call me cheater, but i did fulfill the requirement for the Achievement rightfully, so i just claimed what is mine!(Inb4 anyone asks, the program is here[gib.me], in case you ARE a Achievement Hunter like me and you want to get that Bugged Achievement (It's name is Curse Broken, by the way!~)(PD: I know some people will abuse it to get EZ Achievements, but mommy ain't gonna save ya from the Ban that awaits for U!) tl;drWhy are you still reading this? Wasn't the intro text clear enough? This is one of the finest Metroidvania Indie games in the scene out there, initially made by one guy, this game cannot be reccomended enough if you like Metroidvania and Platformer hybrids, even if you don't, who knows maybe Cave Story can change that!As such, i shall grant this game, the fabled...CURLY'S PANTIES/10 "

												I have to be completely honest with you: I didn't like Cave story when I first saw it. “Meh, some pixel platformer with a pistol… what's with all the hype? Boring!”Out of sheer curiosity, I had to give it another try and a little more time. And then it grew on me. It fascinated me. I couldn't stop. Suddenly I was totally in love with this game.What's its secret? Nice visuals and music, adorable characters, an interesting story, well-balanced gameplay (with some really challenging options for the fans), secrets and cool achievements… I guess none of these ingredients is 100% exceptionally one-of-a-kind original, but somehow together they mix into an almost perfect chef d'œuvre.


Why yes I do!

												Cave Story was (not technically, but in a way and with a story) my first PC game. I remember being on a budget and my consoles packed up 3,000 miles away. I remember hearing about this game, finding it with the aid of Google Translate and nabbing the excellent fan translation. And then I experienced the first game that made me think ""this is a console quality experience."" It was highly polished and didn't require any fiddling to make work. It had gorgeous pixel art graphics and fantastic chip tune music. The story was a tad hard to follow but very interesting and engaging. The game dripped with atmosphere. And ... it was all dreamed up and created by one man!Flash forward. In the meantime I beat this game on PC, I picked up the remake with optional slightly enhanced artwork and sound and beat it on Wii. And now I pick up that same game on Steam and start playing through it once again.And you know what? I plan on getting the 3D remake on 3DS next! There aren't many games I don't hesitate to play through again and again and even fewer I purchase again and again. Cave Story is up there in that elite list of mine. It is surely worthy of being called a classic and it is a game every gamer who grew up in the 8 and 16 bit eras will enjoy with an odd sense of nostalgia. Those growing up with gaming right now ought to take a chance and play through Cave Story.			"

												Of course the game is amazing and deserves a purchase. However, Cave Story has a huge glaring issue that you need to be warned about if you've never played. The game is cryptic as all hell. If you do not follow an extremely specific list of minute tasks (don't talk to this person, talk to this person a second time, examine an object that doesn't appear to be examinable, make this really long jump without falling, don't follow this person until you get this item, etc) then you cannot get the best ending. I am understandably upset, because even when using a guide, I missed one tiny little step (didn't talk to a person twice) and now the best ending is off limits on my current playthrough. I now have to start all over just because I missed one small step. This cryptic method of game development irritates me to no end and should be left as a relic of the NES era. Putting all that aside, Cave Story is still one of the best games on Steam and you should buy it rapidly. I just wanted to prepare you for one of the big problems of the game.			"

												I thought I had already recommended this one... guess not. Anyways, I already played this game a few years ago, but bought it again on Steam when it came out because, well, it's just that good. For fans of old-school 2D action-platformers, this game is for you. It has frantic shooting elements similar to action games like Contra and Gunstar Heroes, but it's done in the exploratory 'Metroidvania' style. The gameplay is spot-on fantastic, and it's full of cool characters, maps, puzzles and secrets. It's also a tough challenge, especially if you want to go for the secret ""true"" ending. For fans of the genre, this game is a must-have. Pick it up, especially on sale. Note: I highly recommend using a gamepad. Think twice if you don't have one.			"

A lot of the difficulty in this game comes from just cheap traps and I get that it's trying to be ""retro"" but that doesn't excuse bad design. Soundtrack is pretty good. It is very pretty but I'd like it if it were more open to exploration. This game is not in any way ""metroidvania"" It's much too linear. There's less freedom to just explore and it's more like a straight path with a couple branches here and there. All in all it's decent and worth playing. 6-7/10			"

Because of this, I would typically condemn this game right off the bat for being just another platformer to pass on..However, Cave Story has a very unique charm to it; no, I didn't play much through it, I was terrible and got frustrated. But even with the short time I gave it, I could tell it was above and beyond your typical ""indie puzzle platformer retro 2D pixel blah blah blah"". I think this would be a fantastic game for fans of the genre and the gameplay style and though it's not for me, I think Cave Story would be great for others. Definitely recommend.			"

												Cave Story is a fantastic game and Cave Story+ just builds onto what was already great about it.If you haven't tried the original just go to http://cavestory.org/ and get it already!For an list of differences between Cave Story (Original freeware version; 2004), Cave Story+ (Steam port; 2011), and other Cave Story versions check out http://cavestory.wikia.com/wiki/Version_differencesAlthough the steam version includes a fair bit of bells and whistles (like running at 60FPS instead of 50FPS), the drawbacks I see with it are:• No proper widescreen/16:9 support.• Curse Broken achievement has been bugged since release so good luck getting only 99% completion• Anytime you complete a challenge mode it crashes the game (it still saves your replay & time but it's annoying.)• ""View Rankings"" button they included in the challenges modes doesn't work/crashes the game, presumably there was going to be steam leaderboards that were never implemented.It's pretty much nit picking and they could possibly fix the issues with it but it's almost 5 years since it released on steam and nothing has changed.I'd still consider Cave Story+ an upgrade and worth it if you enjoyed the original.I got this during a sale a while back for $2.49 so it depends if you're willing to pay full price or not.

												I mean, it should be pretty apparent by now that this game is a masterpiece. Therefore, I highly recommend you buy it. However, I have heard that NiCALIS have slightly altered the dialogue of the original, and the original IS still freeware. If you want to honor this great game, get the steam version. However, if you're a bit low on cash, playing the original is a-okay.All things considered, 10/10			"

												This game is well-made and completely worth it to buy. It seems easy in the beginning, but once you get going it gets more challenging, but even more fun. The end is ridiculously hard, but that's only if you do a certain ending. Trying to get all the achievements is a very large challenge too. I could play it over and over, and I'd still love it!			"

												If I had to find a flaw in this game, the only thing I could point out is the location of some save points. Because it's just annoying to have to retrace your steps for a big chunk of road and watch the same cutscene over and over when you're trying to beat a boss, especially if you're trying to complete Hard Mode or to unlock the ""Untouchable"" and ""Unstoppable"" achievements. Everything else is just remarkable. It's the definition of Classic: a perfect Metroidvania platformer with great story and lots of secrets to be found. It's not a coincidence that Cave Story is considered by many the best indie game ever made. At least in its genre, it surely is.EDIT: I kinda hate Nicalis for introducing in the game achievements that are practically impossible to obtain. I mean, completing Blood Stained Sanctuary without ANY health upgrade, are they even serious? Have they at least TESTED if this thing was feasible AT ALL? I couldn't literally find ANYONE on the web that managed to do that. The very few people that unlocked the corrisponding achievement on their profile probably used cheats. This is no good. In the original version of the game there's no mention of such a challenge, for a reason.Oh, and the ""Curse Broken"" ach is -oh the irony - broken. And nobody will ever fix it. Great job guys. Really.			"

												Let me take you back to the days of the DSi, back when Nintendo used points instead of actual cash. Way back then I bought the original Cave Story, and I can safely say it was the BEST purchase I've ever made for my DSi. I still have yet to beat it.And yet my 3ds (where the game now resides) is on the fritz, and it was on sale on Steam, so I caved.It's every bit as good as I remember it, and just a bit more. Nostalgia aside, this game is still a fantastic action-platformer with a moving story and all the right music. Sadly it doesn't have the same graphics style as Cave Story 3D (for the 3ds),  but that's fine.I think there's no better candidate for the Test of Time award.			"

 Cave Story+	My favorite game ever.Not once did I find me bored playing this. Sure the freeware is available from the website, but I am glad I bought this version. I have gotten every Cave Story port so far and I have to say, this one is the best. It took the controls from the original, you know and just made it smoother. All the little details are nice and the new challenges are quite difficult, and only even more if you are trying to 100% complete this game.			"

We should all bow down to that guy because he created the music, art, and programming all by his ♥♥♥♥ing self.This game gets right what many other games fail at - the 'feeling' or 'atmosphere'.

												If you like a metroidvania platformer with a great soundtrack, then this is a game for you. It's a decently long game, 10 hours or more, maybe? But that's only the main game, there are so many other things that you can do in the game the will change the ending of Cave Story+. There are three ends, Bad, Neutral, and Best. Getting the Best ending will take you a very long time, it took me 28 hours to do, but it was very satisfying. Also, the story is deep and you can get attached to the characters *cough* *Curly Brace* *cough*. There are also some hard to find secrets hidden is some areas. Like Curly Brace's panties, and by getting them you unlock another game mode called Curly Story. Anyway, I recommend this game, it's one of my childhood favorites for sure.			"

												Cave Story offers a Metroidvania gameplay, and it does it very well. This game was made by 1 person, everything. The music, art, and programming was just one dude. The art style is okay in ""HD"" mode, but consider playing through the game with original music and non-HD first, I feel that it is more charming at it's original state. Basically, you're a guy who, you guessed it, fights his way through multiple caves (and other places too), and this dude also has to deal with a bunny rabbit soap opera. The story is goofy, but very compelling. The script is awesome, melding happy, sad, and funny all togther. You'll have many fun weapons to use through out the game, and they all can be leveled up by collecting fallen Doritos which are relinquished from enemies when you kill em. But the weapons can de-level if you get hit too many times, making a unique challenge factor. This Steam version offers a new hard mode if you are a masochist, since the original difficulty is nothing to scoff at. The music is very memorable, and so well done too, setting the appropriate tone for each ""cave"". There are multiple endings, easter eggs galore, and a hidden final area/boss, which is a blast to speed run though once you unlock it.Do yourself a favor, buy and complete this game.			"

												A beautiful remake of a fun and challenging game. If you aren't looking to spend the money, you can still find the original as freeware online. Pixel did such an amazing job with this game that I was happy to see it get a remake (though I would suggest waiting until you see it on sale either through Humble Bundle or Steam Sale.. the price tag is rather high for the length of the game).It's got tight side-scrolling action, wonderful pixel art and soundtrack (particularly the remake), challenging obstacles, multiple endings and unlocks, and a surprising amount of replayability.It's impressive to think that the original is a decade old and was developed by one man in his free time as freeware.

												This is arguably the best game I've ever played. Just the feel of it ever since I first played it was just too much fun! I've played it through on PC, 3DS, Wii and bought it again on the Nintendo Shop on my 3DS(Classic) and did a hard mode run with the Machine Gun and Bubbline(Pains me to not use king's blade). So I decided, why not buy CS+ as well since it was on sale?! And even though it's like my 3rd time buying it again, I don't think I will ever regret the purchase! Just the diversity and the play style which causes for a tad bit grinding and the punishment system of trying to teach you to not get hit and be tactical. It also has a kind of feel like the game itself is telling you to not give up and be a hero! I mean that is something you almost never see in video games these days.It also has these really nice transitions of bringing you from upbeat to depressing and it really just shows how a real villian is supposed to act instead of just a clash of ideals and opinions with the whole thing between Misery(Absoloutley <3 Misery she's so casual) and The Doctor(Just a downright jerk) going against Quote and Curly Brace. It just let you feel you were on a real cause instead of it just being a snuff game where the main character was mad the antagonist♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in his corn flakes. It even shows little things where the Villians start to step their game up and try harder instead of just refurbishing their same plan or just sitting back and watching you become OP. Made you feel like: ""Hey, I'm getting stronger, faster and much more cool! I can really do this! Just look at me from start to finish! I started with a dinky pistol, now I'm shooting laser beams while I have stars following me!			"

												this game would be much different if it was abuot a happy caveman named thog who lives in a cave but then one day he loses his favorite rock and then he gets torn up and sad about it but then says ""no. enough. me find rock"" and then he becomes serious and goes to the ends of the earth to find his rock, along the way he meets many friends including other cavemen named thag and thig and he makes sacrifices and there's sad moments and funny moments and good awe-inspiring fight scenes and maybe even a romantic subplot i don't know about that whatever and then once the player finishes the game they tell their friends about it and then the game about thog becomes popular online and shared on social media and more people buy the game and the game becomes successful and the devs get more money to make more merchandise and maybe even a sequel to the game, people and fans of the game play the sequel and maybe it's not as good as the first one but it's still good and the ign and meta critic reviews come in and then they give it an 83/100 because it's good but not perfect like games that have 96/100 like half life 2 speaking of half life 2 i've been playing that game and it's pretty good anyway not to get off topic there's a sequel to thogs adeventure but then after severel years a third game does not come out and the fans are like ""aww man where's that third game"" but then it comes out unexpectedly after years of waiting and the fans are like ""oh sh*t yes!!!!"" and then they play it and then it gets REALLY popular to the point where people start drawing erotic art of thog with his pee pee out and making fan fictions of him kissning people and that's somewhat disturbing but anyway the devs are like ""3 games are enough for thog"" and the fans are like ""awwwwww"" but thog still leaves a legendary legacy among video games itself alike. that period looks like it marks the end of this excessively long run on-sentence review but it doesn't anyway the devs first made thog game when a guy was in the bathtub and he was like ""oh f*ck what if i make a game and he brushes his teeth with mint toothpaste that makes orange juice taste weird and then he goes to bed but he has trouble sleeping since his bed is a bit hard so he orders a soft bed on amazon and then manages to push on and go to sleep anyway the next day he wake up and drinks his dark coffee (with some cream and sugar in it because he prefers it like that because he thinks that coffee is a tad too bitter and he uses the word ""tad"" because he's british) and then the chemicals in the coffee wake him up and he's like ""gotta go to work now"" and he goes to work and his coworkers say ""hi"" and he says ""hi"" back and then he works and then later when they go for a meeting and he says ""we gotta make a video game people"" and then one person says ""but we can't make a video game we're a law firm"" and then the guy who wants to make the video game quits the job and joins the video game job because he wants to make a video game so on his new job he develops the adventure of thog thog has beta designs where he looks different but those designs were not good enough so he makes new designs of thog, and then the devs agree on a final design he's put in the game and it is released on steam for the low price of $4.99 united states dollar and people try it out beta access and it's good and when it got suceessful it was released on things like the mac linux ps3 ps4 3ds wii u xbox and more people have access to it because some people don't afford computer so they make money to buy one to get thog's adventure the government has a lot of money so they can easily play thog's adventure if they wanted to maybe even the obama president plays it but we don't know for sure because he's busy a lot. thog is a nice man who works hard to pay off his rent for his apartment room and he knows how to tie his shoes""im look for rock"" -thog			"

												The spiffy music. I love it. This was one of my very first steam games.In fact, I think it was the first game I ever bought on steam. I really love this game. The story and the retro platformer gameplay just hold a special place in my tummy.I took me a while to beat the final boss. The first time, I got the ""bad ending""  lol. it was cuteThere should be more games like this. It wasnt too hard and it wasnt too easy. There were parts that fustrated me and parts that were easy.I think its a well balanced game. I played it through twice so I guess the replay value is good. "

												A beautiful remake of a fun and challenging game. If you aren't looking to spend the money, you can still find the original as freeware online. Pixel did such an amazing job with this game that I was happy to see it get a remake (though I would suggest waiting until you see it on sale either through Humble Bundle or Steam Sale.. the price tag is rather high for the length of the game).It's got tight side-scrolling action, wonderful pixel art and soundtrack (particularly the remake), challenging obstacles, multiple endings and unlocks, and a surprising amount of replayability.It's impressive to think that the original is a decade old and was developed by one man in his free time as freeware.

												This game. Hoo boy, where do I start. Well, it came out in the olden days of 2004, and it was entirely free, or a ""free-ware"" by definition. Now here we are, with a game that has lived up to its name and praise, with a complete overhaul of the textures to let new generations, including me, to enjoy. I never played it before, and I loved it so much when I first started. Beat it in a day, after restarting everything because, frankly, I screwed up. And now that I've beaten it...I feel lost. I want more like this. I want more games that actually evoke feelings like joy and sadness. Games that make you growl at your computer in ange rbecuase something was just that hard, but that after making it through you breathe for the first time in 50 minutes.Cave Story is that game. So please. Play it. Enjoy.			"

												This is probably the first modern indie game coming out in 2004, and is a great example of what just 1 single man can do. If you haven't played it before this is the best version of the game. and if you are like me and are a fan of the original, this is still great for it adds a lot of new modes and challenges, save files(you have no idea how happy i was) and much more. If you don't like the remixed soundtrack or the new graphics you can always use the original ones, and mix and match the graphics and music. but I must say you should try and get this game on sale especially if you are a fan of the original. It's the same great game with just a little extra			"

There are also a number of easter eggs and secret items in the game, I love when this is incorporated because it adds to the adventure. Also *Spoiler* The multiple endings were awesome, especially the ultimate secret ending! Definitely a game worth getting, plenty of replay value with the added features.Abazzilion/10			"

												This is one of the best games I have ever played. It gives less than subtle nods to like platformers such as Megaman and Metroid, but has a very deep story. Characters do die and many of their fates rest on you and your decisions. While this game has a cute art style and happy music, it can be a very dark game when a favorite character(s) die because of something you didn't do. This game has multiple endings that feel incredibly different ie. not Mass Effect 3. This game is a blast, but is somewhat difficult to get the best ending. If you aren't completely sold I reccomend playing a bit of the original version for free  at www.cavestory.org so you know that you will enjoy it. One of my top 10 favorite games for sure, quite possibly top 5. All in all give this game a try if you want your mind blown. Fans of old school and new school games can easily enjoy this game if they are decent at platformers. If not there is an easy mode exclusive to cave story+ which does prevent you from getting the best ending. Also, I reccomend a controller. Did I mention that this game was completed totally by one guy?			"

												7.5/10Cave Story will move you. The story is beautifully ominous and rich with immersion. It is a game that can be picked up time after time and still maintain it's replayability and fun. As someone who never played the original Cave Story, this game came as a great shock to me. It reminded me of oldschool platformer games like Metroid, where you could explore, find new items, get upgrades, discover secrets, whatever you so desired. A huge amount of games that try to do that can't pull it off. They do exactly the opposite of what Cave Story does. Cave Story gives the player a sense of exploration; something that can't be crafted in many games. The player IS the main character, and everything that happens will affect the player as it did the character. What detracts from this game is the same thing that detracts from every game of this genre; things like getting stuck on the same level over and over, getting stuck, and other things of the sort. I'm not going to lower this games rating because of that drastically, purely because that is sometimes what makes the game the game that it is. Example being in Zelda; you will remember the water temple more because it was a pain in the butt to beat. Things that like make Cave Story all the more memorable, and making it a game I will think about time and time again. Great indie game that everyone should play.			"

												Cave Story is a retro metroidvania: a retroidvania, if you will.  The game is played with simple moving, jumping, and shooting mechanics with an emphasis on fighting but the game also requires a fair bit of platforming.  The weapons all function very differently.  They are suited for different situations and really mix up the gameplay as do the area-specific enemies.  The boss fights in particular will always force you to deal with something new and they are great fun.The characters are suprisingly deep and they are what really made the game memorable for me.  Their personalities are communicated very well and it's easy to become attached to many of them.  The plot setup is fairly cliché but the characters and encounters keep it engaging and the story progresses at a very good pace.The game seems to have a pretty linear progression at first, but there are secrets to be found, several sidequests, optional weapons, and multiple endings which all make the game that much richer.Cave Story has great gameplay, a good story, memorable characters, and to top it off, an exceptional soundtrack.

 (Warning Minor spoilers)So now we have an understanding what this game is about let’s move to the next subjectAlso if you want my opinions on the story, it’s probably one of the best video game tales ever toldGameplay: -The only game I have ever play that has a similar control scheme to this game is Awesomenauts and even that it’s a bit farfetched.-Unlike in Awesomnauts (where you aim with your mouse) you control your directions via arrows keys with no diangular directionsWeapons:    -You have 6 weapons on yourself late game with 4 you can upgrade/ trade off if you want to on your journey.-Each weapon is extremely fun and unique with some being more than others but all weapons have their place in the world where it would be the most efficient   -Each weapon can be level up to 3 times by collecting triangle bits that fall out of each enemy (XP) In most cases higher levels mean more damage and more ability power for the weapon (I won't spoil the effects for you)-Some weapons level in different ways (mostly late game)    -When you get hit by the enemy your XP on your weapon goes down by a certain amount, different weapons level faster and different weapons lose more when you get hit (kinda like armor effect)Other:-The games life system is based on health and invincibility frames after getting hit, health is restored usually on enemy drops or in map pickups.  -Mid game the difficulty curve shoots up like a ♥♥♥♥ing rocket ship, it mellows out after that part but the very last level (The secret ending) is near impossible to do without hours-days of practice and knowledge. I would highly recommended to look up a speedrun and/or walkthrough of that part if you’re getting stuck on a certain section of it (especially with the very last 2 parts because you have 10 seconds to figure it out and to many ways to mess up). The 1st 3 parts of it is UNfairly challenging and can be learn given enough time.Soundtrack/OST: One of the best OSTs ever made IMO, be sure to have the game set to “Remaster”http://cavestory.wikia.com/wiki/Version_differences <-- If you want to know about the different versions of this game and their assets.Main Problem with the game:-The branching paths... The paths are few and far between but taking the wrong path will give you the lesser ending + weaker items (and nothing more)  -The paths are not obvious which mean you can end up making a mistake where you end up deeply regretting latter (which usually leads to messing with trainers to get back where you want to be)-So with this I have to regrettable say, it’s in your best interest to grab a guide that at least tells you about these branching paths and which ones to take.Conclusion: Overlooking the game problems, I think this is a game that EVERYONE should play/try.-IMO there’s something whimsical about this game that makes it special for me and also IMO it would be unfair to yourselves if you went on living without never touching this game.

												If you ask yourself, how many people did it take to make this awesome game, only 1 person made this game literally and its known as the best indie game as of now. Daisuke Amaya also known as Pixel made this game for 5 years during his free time which sounds great.You play the role of a unknown person who wakes up in the first cave, im not joking thats what the 1st level of the game is called. You lookaround the cave and 'steal' a gun from a guy who is sleeping. You soon find yourself in a village called Mimiga Village, a race of bunnies who are kidnapped from the doctor, not the one who helps you with your body i mean the one who kills you for no reason just to possess something.As you progress through the game you find a girl who was a human but got transformed into a mimiga ( dont worry only 2 people got turned like that, every mimiga is not a human) and asks your help to escape the island with her family. You realize you are on a giant island that was a piece of the surface (its not Earth). and that your a robot who was sent to the island to kill the mimiga but you got seperated from your partner and you forgot your name (its a stupid one but im not spoiling that much). Your job in the game is, find your partnet, save the mimiga, rescue the captured mimigas from the docter, kill the docters minions and himself and 1 more thing that affects the entire island.This game is actually harder than it looks as you find missle upgrades, health upgrades, new guns and most importantly, what you must and musnt do. There is 3 ending in the game, bad, ok and good ending. getting the good ending is hard as you must get certain items and not pick up items.I give this game 9 out of 10 because Daisuke Amaya really took his time to make an amazing game all by himself, the music,the gameplay and the graphics. The story gets more interesting as your progress through the game and the gameplay is equevalent to everyone well not the ending as it takes hardcore players to finish.I forgot to mention once you beat the game, you can play as your partner and everything is switch, now the partner is looking for you but its not worth sin e its the exact same thing but with diffrent dialologue.

												Great version of Cave Story. I'm not a big fan of the new graphics and soundtrack but luckily you can change them to the originals. There were a few localization changes from the freeware version like Grasstown being changed to Bushlands and Balrog's ""Oh yeah!"" instead of ""Huzzah!"" but these are extremely minor nitpicks. There are some really fun challenges added as well, and a few other extras here and there, like halloween and christmas reskins when you play on October 31st and December 25th.The game also has controller support that works well with fully rebindable controls.I'm glad one of my favorite games is on steam, I hope they add trading cards at some point, I'd love a Cave Story background.

												It's amazing what a single person can accomplish when they set their mind to a task, isn't it? Cave Story was made by one person, a Japanese developer with the handle ""Pixel"", and when it was originally released (for free) it set the indie gaming scene on fire. Not only did it look and sound wonderful, with a memorable soundtrack and gorgoues sprite artwork, but it was also huge, potentially taking upwards of 8 hours to finish. Heck, it even had a secret ending which sent determined players dodging and blasting their way through a ruin as it crumbled around you, to fight and defeat one last ultimate boss enemy. And one person was responsible for doing EVERYTHING.You play as a deceptively cute robot - who initially is not named - stranded on a vast and labyrinthine island suspended in the sky. As you explore, you meet the mimigas and learn of their plight: a crazed Doctor wishes to expose them to a certain flower, which causes the mimiga to fly into an uncontrollable rage and attack anything in sight. But to what end? To wage war on the planet below the island, and elevate him to the status of undisputed ruler. He's a villains villain, a real moustache-twirler, and to the credit of the game, both the baddies and the heroes in this game are really memorable. The story isn't so original, but the characterisation is really strong so you'll care, and want to help the mimiga, and want to learn about your own mysterious origins.Exploration is a big aspect of Cave Story. There is lots of ground to cover and lots of enemies to fight, so it's helpful that you'll get pretty well equipped over the course of the game. Quote, the robot you control, was built to use guns. Your first weaponry seems pretty pitiful, but when you kill enemies, they burst into glowing triangles which can be collected to power up the gun you're currently using. Hoover up a few of these gems and your polar star peashooter will become stronger! But, if you get hit, your weapons will lose that collected power and level down. It's important, then, to be aggressive and kill your enemies before you can get hit, but also to be careful and dodge attacks that are coming your way. You could even, if you're quick, swap to a weapon you won't use as much and let that one ""take the hit"", so to speak, keeping your most used weapons at max level. Bosses in this game are really memorable. There's a recurrent fight with one of the Doctor's cronies, a big lunkhead named Balrog. He's kinda cute, really - loyal to the wrong side, but probably with a good heart deep down. It's fun to beat him and hear him threaten to get you next time. There's a fight against an odd machine, stamped with glowing paw prints, and controlled by...something unexpected. The boss fights will tax you as a player, but Cave Story has generous checkpointing so if you are defeated, you won't have to travel far to try again. On that note, I have a criticism. Exploration is great, and there's lots in this game, but there's some areas - I'm looking at you Grasstown - which have far too much backtracking. Grasstown sees you collecting items to make a bomb, and one ingredient has to be collected no less than three times, requiring some serious repetition on the part of the player. This feels like padding, which really isn't necessary in a game which has so much varied content to see. It's a slight concern, really, nothing major, but it has frustrated me when I've tried to replay this game (""Ohhh, not this part again!"") Another problem I have is the hoops you have to jump through to access the optional and more difficult end-game content. It requires skipping certain items and doing certain things out of a logical sequence, and honestly you're extremely unlikely to figure it out without resorting to a guide. Even having done it before many times, I still get it wrong because there are lets of steps to it and it isn't signposted anywhere in the game.This version of the game is Cave Story+. It's the same game, so still brilliant, but with redone music and visuals, the obligatory Steam achievements and trading cards and whatnot. I'll be honest and say that I don't think the New or Remastered music is much cop compared to the original, but you can opt to have whichever one you want. Same with the visuals. Don't like them? Set it back to the original art, wonderful as it is.You may ask, why would I get this version over the free version which is still floating around online?Controller support is one reason. I know lots of us are using XBOX360 pads and they are supported instantly, with no faffing, although ideally you'd want to use a controller with a better d-pad. You can jury rig the freeware version to support controllers, but it'll take extra software and a bit more legwork on the part of the player.The second and most important reason is that, by buying it, you're putting money in Pixel's pocket. He worked on this game for many years out of sheer passion, and decided to give it away for free for many more years, and I think that we should reward such generosity. He deserves a few quid thrown his way, and this game is often on sale, so you've no excuse.Cave Story is unmissable. It handles well, is attractive and sounds great, and actually has a really good story, with some legitimately terrific dialogue and characters. There may be frustrating moments where you'll struggle with a certain boss, or feel fatigued because you're retreading paths that you've been down before, but these are tiny blemishes on the surface of a diamond.

												Everything about Cave Story hearkens back to the glory days of the SNES/Super Famicom. The lovingly hand-crafted graphics and catchy chiptune soundtrack create a vibrant ""16 bit"" environment. The storyline is interesting and quirky, with a distinctly Japanese flavor. Gameplay is somewhere between a ""metroidvania"" platformer and a ""bullet hell"" shoot-em-up: platforming challenges mix with a unique weapons upgrade system which rewards skillful dodging and punishes the slightest misstep with power-downs. There are certainly challenges to be had on higher difficulties, but those who just want to coast through the story will find options which suit them as well. Inconvenient save point locations can make difficult areas a bit of a grind, as you have to beat the same area over and over again to reach a boss fight or other difficult challenge, and the game does little other than drop hints to steer you towards your end goal. Perhaps the game's biggest flaw however is the length: a skilled gamer can breeze through easy difficulty in less than four hours. Certainly there is a lot of replayability, as one can increase the difficulty level or make different choices in storyline progression, but one must certainly have a strong appreciation for that type of repetition to endure.Overall Cave Story is a rewarding experience for gamers who yearn for secrets to discover, discrete clues, skill-based challenges, and the nostalgic thrill of it all being rendered in a faux 16-bit facade.

												This game is an extremely enjoyable Metroidvania that holds up as well as it did 12 years ago. Part of what makes this game a worthy investment of your time and money versus every other game on the market is that its not just good for an ""indie"" game, but that it is a professional quality game that merits comparison to games made by professional game developers. So many other indie games rely on visual gimmicks to sell their games that they sometimes forget that what really makes a good game is challenging and engaging gameplay. Cave Story has that in spades and its all the more amazing since it was made by one person.			"

												Cave Story is really one of those games that can be considered a masterpiece of game design. There are so many wonderful and classic gaming elements, that I cannot even begin to describe just one quality well enough to say ""It is for this one reason alone that Cave Story is a great game."" There is just so much effort, originality and ingenuity behind this game and it really shows more and more as you play through it.			"

												It's very rare for me to say I immedietely loved the game, But cave story is one of the few. The controls are tight, the gameplay is fast-paced and fun, and though it's a platformer it doesn't have any incredibly difficult jumpping bits. Hard ones yes, but infuriatingly impossible, no. The art is charming and it feels very much like an old side scrolling adventure. with multiple endings, difficulty settings, and two modes it has a pretty nice amount of replayability too.			"

												Yo this game is Cave Story. Don't know if you've heard of it but it's been around forever and it's a real good, cute little platforming shooter.It's not all smiles and roses though. This particular port is busted on OSX and scaling is kind of a mess in Windows. Controllers sometimes don't register too. I also think the controls are too slippery to be a great platformer and I'm not a fan of how obscure the ""good"" endings and secrets are, you'll never find them without a guide.And maybe I just suck but I absolutely hate the structure of the final boss and how it has you doing four fights in a row with no saves or health refills between them and no way to completely skip dialog. Boy that gets old real fast.Still it's Cave Story and it's pretty good!			"

												I can't decide if I love or hate this game, in all honesty. I love the story, music, characters, and the overall aesthetic of it. However, my beef with  Cave Story+  are the sudden,  highly  frustrating spikes in gameplay diifculty. I don't know, maybe it's just me, but there have been times in my playthrough where I have gotten stuck on a boss or area for--and I do not exaggerate--weeks or even  months  at a time. Either shooter-platformers aren't my thing, or there is something off about this. Don't let this stop you from buying it, though. Difficulty is not what kills a good game. The fact that I haven't thrown my computer off a cliff and cursed Studio Pixel's name to the four winds (though I have admittably gotten close) attests to this. I hear there's a free version somewhere, so maybe give that a try before spending money on this remastered version.Like my review? Check out my  Curator  page!			"

												The game is a classic, and nothing I can say will deter the millions in love since it came out in 2004. I had never played this game until 2015--I didn't get into the Metroidvania genre as a kid. The purpose of mentioning this information is that (1) I didn't grow up with this classic, and (2) so many great games have come out, especialy within its genre, that, perhaps, my issue with the game is a problem with time. More specifically, the problem of genre saturation. Think of games like LIMBO that were the new standard of the puzzle-platformer, then those games were done over and over, and now, going back to LIMBO, the problems with the game stand more out as it's not as special as it once was.NES-styled games (or even Metroidvania games) are not that uncommon, nor are one-man projects--for example, Dust: An Eylsian Tale, Axiom Verge, Undertale, LISA etc.--as rare today. (I'm not saying the work has become easier. The novelty of one-man projects has come and gone.)Cave Story will continue to be an inspiration to many indie devs, and it earns its acclaim as a great game. No mistake was made there.However... I think some aspects, both of its gameplay and of its narrative, will stand out as time continues. And this is a review to newcomers so that you don't set too high expectations for the game. (There will be no spoilers.)Exploring the StoryFirst off, this game's story is almost too serious for how stupid it sounds on paper. And so many disturbing things that happen in game are quite dark when you think about the things you don't see. I love how absurd this story gets at times, but it also never forgets when to keep a straight face.The problem I have with this story is not what it is. My problem is how it is told, namely through exposition upon exposition, sometimes rather abruptly without any dramatic weight.I'm not against having complex plots or reading in my games. I love CRPGs after all. But this game loses all its mystique it builds up after the first hour as the game's story becomes told through constant expositions. Motives are sometimes introduced before you can imagine your own conclusions, and sometimes characters are suddenly introduced with a full backstory and the impact has no meaning.Not every exchange is telling you information for the sake of lore. The exchanges between Quote and Curly Brace feel heartwarming, and because I am invested in both characters the exposition doesn't come off as forced. There are also messages or notes hidden that share insight on characters, which is a great way to tell stories that feel like you made a discovery.More often this idea is a roadblock. For example, you get a character that is suddenly vital to the game's story without any foreshadowing or even a early mention, and his backstory is told while pausing the game (randomly) on the most difficult level. So not only is the story pulled out of nowhere it also gets in the way of the gameplay.It makes me wonder why not tell the exposition by other storytelling means like environmental design. The game has one or two moments like these, and on top of the notes/messages it feels like a reward for exploration.But that's enough to say on the story; it's small fish compared to the gameplay problems.Exploring the CaveFor a Metroidvania game, the game feels a little barebones in its mechanics. You get seven weapons with different arcs and effects as you level them up from collecting triangles (and you lose the XP by being constantly hit), but manyfeel worthless except for specific cases (the Fireball especially). You also get a jetpack, but not until two-thirds of the game is finished--I don't think there's a way to collect it early because, for a Metroidvania game, it's very linear. And the only items to collect are health upgrades. The one gamplay feature that I do like is the hidden difficulty throughout most of the game. You can swap out weapons or items to make earlier sections easier, or you can bite the bullet and earn the reward later. These aren't really obvious, and you won't know you made a bad decision until much later, which some of them tie into the bonus endings of the game. (There are really only two endings with a third one being a mid-game end. You will need a guide to know how to get the final/good ending because the game asks you to do something illogical). I really do like this feature because it ties so well into the heroic story where you influence the ones you can save and the people you simply cannot. These choices mean something.The overall difficulty is not a fair game. Save spots are frequent through most of the game, which you will want to save often because cutscenes will be replayed upon death without a skip option. Only the boss-rush at the end, and the final level with five bosses have one save spot. There are no E-tank substitutes--only a one-time full-health drink--but, like Megaman, you can kill smaller enemies in the boss-fights for health, weapon XP and missles. It takes real effort to regain your health in boss-fights, which I think is fine for when you have scattered save places. I would like that to be a player option rather than mandatory with the end-game'ssudden difficulty spike. And then you have the the last level. Symbolizing only one thing: Hell. (You will need a guide to trigger this outcome--no joke.) Either you will break your controller or you will develop a sixth sense of a bullet-hell mess for the level. Then you have to fight five boss-forms in ONE life, and if you fail you have to start all the way from the bullet-hell level. It feels like an excuse for NES difficulty rather than an actual challenge (and it reminds me too much of Street Fighter 2010: The Final Fight).And then you have extra challenge modes and a hard mode for enthusiasts. I might do a Curley Brace mode playthrough just for dialogue changes and for the normal ending. So, thankfully, for a short game (4 to 5 hours on a normal playthrough) there is lots of replay value for sadists.There's Still A Great Game To Be FoundPlease don't let my nitpicks convince you that this game is not worth the effort. Despite the steep difficulty curve, the game is very enjoyable and I can easily recommend it. All I want to say is just know what to expect: Don't let nostalgia keep the faults unseen because without knowing where we err we cannot know where we need to grow.			"

												Это отличная игра за свои деньги и лучшая в этом жанре из тех, в которые я играл.Плюсы:Оригинальная идея с опытом. Это единственная игра, в которой я намного больше следил за уровнем, чем за здоровьем (за ним вообще не следил, если честно, так что было много глупых смертей ради опыта).Тонна секретов. Я не нашёл ни один серьёзный секрет, хоть и осмотрел все углы в большинстве уровней.3 концовки (сразу предупрежу, что хорошую без гайда почти невозможно получить, так что готовьтесь к очень грустным и неоправданным событиям).Отличный баланс между стрельбой и платформером (но стрельбы всё равно больше, особенно в конце игры). Обычно в подобных играх всё время надоедают однообразные прыжки по платформам, либо однообразное мочилово, тут же я всю игру прошёл, даже немного не теряя интереса.Разные уровни сложности, что редко встречается в платформерах.Хороший сандутрек.Выбор между новой и старой графикой и музыкой.Минусы:Чтобы получить хорошую концовку, нужно сделать не очень логичное действие, а после этого тщательно подумать в одном месте. Ну или воспользоваться гайдом.Некоторые задания заставляют ходить по одной и той же локации кругами. На лёгкой сложности это не было проблемой, но на средней это ад.Очень маленькое разрешение. Мне это совершенно не помешало, но я представляю, как это должно быть ужасно для людей с 4К.Эта игра на лёгком закончилась всего за 4 часа, но смогла вызвать лёгкую депрессию. Слишком впечатлительным лучше не играть.P.S. Оригинальная игра бесплатна. Здесь лишь новая музыка, новые текстурки и несколько бесполезных фич. Но в оригинале Мимиги не такие милые, так что советую купить.			"

												Cave Story is a game with an interesting history. Made by Daisuke ""Pixel"" Amaya this game was first released in 2004, later rereleased on Wii, DSi, Steam, and even 3DS. Cave Story takes heavy inspiration from games like Metroid and Castlevania. Only MUCH more fast and action-packed. This game has plenty to offer to casual and hardcore gamers alike. I think the most impressive thing about this game is that it's still so entertaining a decade later.             Like I said, this game is very fast and action-packed, with plenty of weapons designed for different situations. This game features a very simple leveling mechanic that (most of the time) makes your weapons stronger when the level up, sometimes changing how the weapon works in some way or another, while getting damaged can level down the weapon, making it fairly risky to rush the enemy.             There are plenty of unlockables in this game, from pointless items made as a joke (like finding one of the main character's panties) to new weapons that offer a whole new style of play. On top of that, there are bonus levels, time attack modes, boss rush modes, and even two very difficult secret areas, and a secret ending that was so satisfying to get.             If I could, I would go back to play this game for the first time again. With a very interesting, immersive story, great level design and pixel art, and one of the best soundtracks for an indie game, Cave Story+ gets a 10/10 from me.			"

Gameplay is really fluid, with not easy (and challenging), making it more of a challenge. Mutiple endings provide replayability. I will be playing this for a while now.(played the wii release, and just purchased on Steam)I highly reccomend this game.			"

It really motivates you to play the game over and over.This game has an incredible soundtrack, and I would say it's my favourite free to play game ever, as well as favourite indie game ever.Buy it for gods sake.

												This game is fantastic! Well worth the money at any price. For starters, many of you have probably played this game for free in the past. This was a freeware game long ago, and this is the best known indy game of all time. Now before you say anything, it is worth the money, and this version is so much better than the free version.The game has 3 different soundtracks, (original, remastered, new), modes of play, (story, challenge), and two art styles (original and new). This game comes with the original soundtrack and visuals that look like the NES days of 8-bit. There is also a newer art style that is ""HD"" polished look, cleaner lines etc. 3D characters etc. The soundtrack from the original is there in all its glory. There is also a remastered version of the original soundtrack, and a brand new soundtrack. There are 3 saves slots in story mode, so you can mix and match art styles and soundtracks. I love this game, is tough, has questing, platforming, amazing boss fights, retro visuals and great gameplay. This is the best Cave Story version in my opinion.			"

I will also let you know there is a freeware version available that is perfectly solid. Don't be afraid to play that version, because it's the original and it is of high quality. Previously I've beaten the freeware OS X version (the first time I beat it), then I beat the Windows version, then I beat the WiiWare version, and now I am on my fourth playthrough with CS+.CS + includes a variety of extras, new ""HD"" graphics, new OST, be sure to check between the new & old to see which you prefer.Buy it sometime.A+			"

												An adorable game at sugar-high inducing levels of cuteness, it also provides a shockingly (at least, shockingly next to all the cuteness) dark setting underneath. While the silent protagonist is quite overdone by Japanese style games, it's still interesting to see the exchanges between characters and whatnot. The gameplay itself is nice. In the midst of all the 3D games, it's nice to have a 2D sidescroller once in a while, and it's quite reminiscent of games such as Metroid or whatnot. It's unique in that you have different levels for the weapons that you can lose by being hit (so there's encouragement to avoid attacks beyond hp) and gained by eating doritos. The gameplay mainly speaks more for itself, in any case. Also, the gameplay strikes a nice balance with difficulty. It becomes extremely difficult at times, but not overwhelmingly so. Of course, if you want to go for best ending... heh. Good luck.So, it's worth a try at least. Hell, the original is free if you don't want to spend $ or £ or whatever, though + refines the cuteness.			"

												Cave Story+ was the game that was missing from my life for quite some time now. It's a 2D platforming masterpiece that is well worth all your precious time and hard earned money. When you finally glimpse the credits, you'll be itching to want to play it again, in order to unlock those missed secrets, beat your old time completion, and your score. I'll hazard a guess that you may even want to entertain a third or fourth play-through!Stop wasting your time arguing with your wallet and just put your money down on this brilliant game. Ensure that you will be able to tell the next generation about that one cave story about one of the most epic adventures of your lifetime. "

												Ah, Cave Story. I remeber getting the demo of this on my Wii some time ago, and i enjoyed it. When i saw this on Steam i bought it as soon as i could. And i love this game. The game is like a good old 2D shooter, but the music and the RPG elements makes it different. I highly recommend using a controller to play, for convinience that is. The game is funny at times and i have cracked a smile once in a while. The game is however difficult, so difficult at times that i just had to put my controller down. The game does have the ""What do i do and where do i go"" moments in it, which really irritated me. The game is cheap and it gives more than it costs. If you ever see this on sale or have some spare money in your steam wallet, buy it! It's worth it.			"

How?!)The backtracking can get annoying sometimes, but I can't recall bothering at all the first time I played the game.A little hint from my side: Change the option about the music to the original music, not the remastered music.

Some of the triggers for it are a little obscure, like leaping over a pit that you would normally be inclined to fall down and explore to progress the story.  And once you finish the Hell Run level you'll feel an odd sense of accomplishment.			"

The choice of using updated sprites and music (as well as the original music remastered on PC/Mac).Extra modes and secrets.I will be hard-pressed to offer another platformer that offers the same depth Cave Story does, and the easiest way to recommend this game is to simply play the original version and be inspired to purchase this game.[www.cavestory.org]Another wonderful game by Mr. Amaya, that is also free.[www.cavestory.org] "

It pretty much started the big indie game boom  and is a solid metroidvania game in its own right.Personally I'd say this version is the best/has the most content, but it's been ported to just about everything by now with varying differences in content, hell you can still get the original game for free if you want			"

												Cave Story never stops being a gem - you can argue this for many different reasons. I mean, sure the soundtrack is amazing and the gameplay is genius in its seemingly simplistic nature. If this game just had that going for it, it'd simply be a good game.Then you dig deeper into the game and start to find the minutae of it's genius. Its indie charm resonates even deeper when you realize that this game (arguably) began the indie craze. It's constructed, top-to-bottom, by a single individual over many years of hard work and dedication. How Pixel found the time to create a surprisingly deep, and shocking, narrative is another matter entirely.This game is impressive in every way a game can be. I'll never stop enjoying it no matter how many times I play it, and completely recommend you give it a whirl.			"

												This game is fantastic! Well worth the money at any price. For starters, many of you have probably played this game for free in the past. This was a freeware game long ago, and this is the best known indy game of all time. Now before you say anything, it is worth the money, and this version is so much better than the free version.The game has 3 different soundtracks, (original, remastered, new), modes of play, (story, challenge), and two art styles (original and new). This game comes with the original soundtrack and visuals that look like the NES days of 8-bit. There is also a newer art style that is ""HD"" polished look, cleaner lines etc. 3D characters etc. The soundtrack from the original is there in all its glory. There is also a remastered version of the original soundtrack, and a brand new soundtrack. There are 3 saves slots in story mode, so you can mix and match art styles and soundtracks. I love this game, is tough, has questing, platforming, amazing boss fights, retro visuals and great gameplay. This is the best Cave Story version in my opinion.			"

												Short version: Absolute masterpiece.When I first played CaveStory I expected nothing going into it and never gave it a chance, giving up within 5 minutes only a year later to pick it up again. If only I could go in a time machine and tell myself what a fool I was for putting down what would become one of my favorite games of all time. Heart touching story with multiple endings, a  brilliant soundtrack and a learning curve that never seems too steep. Very reminicent of games of old that were considered masterpieces of their time.

The remastered graphics and soundtrack are a very big improvment over the orignal cave story, and they sound and look beautiful and immersive. Just prepare to die a lot though. "

												Cave Story is probably one of the first PC games that I ever really played. I love the soundtrack, the graphics, the gameplay, and everything else. This makes the game good but when you realize that all of this was done by one man within a course of 5 years, that's when it gets set apart from the other titles like it. The game originally came out as freeware, but now they have improved upon everything that I listed above and made the game that much more enjoyable.

Some cool bosses to beat.Your character gets new weapons that change the way you defeat your enemies, and the weapon upgrade system is something different from usual, because it can downgrade if you suffer an attack.Well, this game deserves to be played.

												I'm sort of biased about this game.I say this because I played it before it was on Steam. As a freeware PC game, it was top notch. Hard to believe the original was made by just 1 guy. However, this isn't the original release I'm reviewing and they charge 14.99 for this version.The game itself is some sort of a strange hybrid of Run N' Gun platforming mixed with Metroidvania, as the whole game is just 1 huge level with some backtracking is required to obtain certain items.The controls themselves are excellent and there is a nice variety of different weapons you can use. Also, the minimalistic graphics and chiptune soundtrack give the game a unique retro vibe which is either hit-or-miss, depending on whether you like 8 bit games. The game does come with 2 graphic modes and 3 versions of the soundtrack though, so you can adjust the feel of the game somewhat if you feel inclined to.At about a third through the game, following a plot twist, the game starts gaining momentum. The plot becomes darker, the bactracking becomes a lot less common, your arsenal starts growing to a nice size, and the game becomes a joy to play, with more varied environments, more challenging enemies, and epic boss battles.My main issue with the game is it's first third. During your first few hours of the game, your arsenal is very limited, you backtrack through the same environments over and over on fetch quests, and fight the same enemies. This part of the game greatly highlights it's low budget and repeatedly recycled assets. However, if you endure enough to get over this frustrating part of the game, you're in for a treat as the following parts of the game are excellent.Another minor gripe I have with the game is how easy it is to miss the best ending. The game has 4 endings (same as the original), and getting the best one will probably require a guide, as reaching it is very unintuitive and much harder to do than any of the others.I have a problem recommending this one. As much as I love the later parts of the game, this Steam release doesn't really add much content, and the earlier segments of the game might make you lose interest before you get to the good parts. I recommend you try the original, free version, as it's basically the same game without some modern conveniences. If you enjoy that one, like I did, and a higher resolution, new soundtrack, and an additional level justify the 15$ for you, I say go for it.			"

												An indie game that structurally started said movement of the, ""too deep for you,"" nonsense that has plagued the majority of indie games alike, consider me surprised when I played it and found it to be amazing.Gameplay follows a metroidvania element, with environments stemming towards a free-flowing and fluid design that goes heavenly with the soft and twitchy movements that Quote can do. It contrasts a bit, further on, as you obtain the Jetpack, for it breaks the foundation that you maintained for so long, yet the game still makes it able to be introduced to where complications with it aren't lived for too long.The story follows a set example of amnesia-cased shenanigans, which develops, with the implications and the history provided, into a depressing set of acts that can be only described as brilliant, once acknowledged. The music fits to the criteria with every given situation, and gives an impact through the gameplay itself that makes it so that actions blend well with the mood of the environment, which gives the player a better understanding of the story without using cutscenes and text to remotely convey it whatsoever. The graphics themselves are sprites of olde time, but alongside the music, adds a vibrant flavor to them that seals the deal, throughout it all.Although a free version exists, the creator deserves the money for what he has accomplished with such a cute game. It is certainly quite the story, that's for sure.			"

												Game: Cave Story+Genre: AdventureDeveloper: Studio PixelSystem: PC (Steam)Total Score: 83/100Value Score: 8.3/10• Story: 8/10o You play as a robot called ""Quote"" who wakes up suddenly in a mysterious cave. You learn that a race of creatures called Mimiga exist in the island of the cave you are in. You have no memory of who or what you are but you explore through the mysterious cave and eventually find out that a mysterious group of people are planning to use the island as a basis to take over the outside world. As you go through the different locations of the island, learning the mysteries of the island and its denizens and traversing through monster infested caves you learn a dark hidden secret under the island.• Characters: 9/10o Cave Story+ has a colorful cast of characters of all sorts of kinds such as robots, mimigas (creatures in the game), humans, goblin like beings, talking roaches, dogs, little people and many other types of beings. You play as a robot named Quote who seems to have some sort of tie to the past of the island and you eventually meet or find of your kind. The enemy designs in the game is quite well done and are original for the most part. Very rarely do you see a similar sprite enemy with a alternate color and all the NPC type characters you come across are all noticeable different with each of them having a unique personality sometimes reflecting of the modern world.• GamePlay: 8/10o Cave Story+ is a platformer RPG like shooter. You have a health based system which you can increase if you find health capsules/containers, you also get a variety of different types of weapons all of which are projectile type weapons and has long range uses depending on what level they are. You can gain levels for your weapons after collecting little triangle bit looking pieces which count as EXP. Some weapons benefit from gaining a level while others get weaker. You also get a set of different items most of which are key items which is usable only through a storyline event and some are additional power ups which are optional. You'll be going through caves and all sorts of locations fighting off all sorts of different types of enemies whether they are in the water, air or land. Just like a platformer you have the ability to jump across platforms, enemies or to get to a certain area along with the fact that you can power up your jump through a upgrade. Cave Story+ is somewhat difficult and can get more difficult depending on what setting you used to start with or with what paths you take the game as you can get multiple endings and ending results depending on some of the decisions you make that will affect your overall gameplay experience as well. There's also a challenge option where you can go in and have time challenges which can also be recorded.• Graphics: 8/10o Cave Story+ uses a unique 2D style art design and gameplay visual which will shoot rays of nostalgia at the player especially if the player has been playing games since they were primarily 2D. The PC version looks far more refined than the other versions of the game. Each character, object, and environment area looks unique from each other so dont expect it to get repetitive to the point where you will be bored. However due to the fact of the way it was developed, your choice on resolution may be limited as it is possible that black borders may take up the left and right of the actual game screen.• Sound: 7/10o If you play a side scroll shooter or any of the old school games from the 1980s or the early 1990s you will understand how the sound effects are like. There are a lot of nostalgic like sound effects which sound similar to different aspects from different games of the old times. Although there isnt voiceovers the creators of the game did a nice notion of adding a sound effect when a character talks although all the NPCs you talk to sound the same in that instance.• Music: 10/10o Cave Story+'s OST is an amazingly well done soundtrack which has the 8-bit tone of what you would consider techno/metal/orchestral music of the old gaming eras. Each area of the game has a unique track and there are unique boss battle themes depending on what kind of boss you are fighting whether it is the final boss, a mini boss or a actual boss. You will surely enjoy the classical 8-bit like OST. You also have the option to change the OST to the classic original style.• Length: 7/10o Cave Story+ is consisted of mostly a linear path which takes you to around 5-6 general areas with some small areas between each other. You also have the choice of making a decision which can alter the length of the game. However the game should not take you more than 15 hours to complete unless you die a lot or get lost.• Replay Value: 8/10o Cave Story+ uses a multi-ending style for its storyline, depending on the decisions you make you can change the game's outcome. There are about three different endings, one of which you can get when you finish the game halfway across, the second one which is the general ending and a third ending which is considered the best ending providing you accomplish certain tasks or did certain events in a certain way. You also have challenges which allow you to play through speed like stages where you are timed and can be recorded. You can also play the game again with multiple difficulties. The gameplay experience also changes depending on what you chose in the game as your weapon or again what certain paths you have taken or avoided.• Player Value: 8/10o Cave Story+ is a pretty good 2D platformer which takes elements and aspects from different types of other genres such as shooters, RPG and action games. The game has a sarcastic eastern tone to it with a few internet meme references along with the fact that the game uses audio and a art style which was common in the 1980s and 1990s but is unique now. The game's storyline and characters will make you enjoy your experience along with the sheer difficulty some of the levels and areas of the game will bring to you. Get this game on Steam while it is hot with the price it will be depending if its summer or winter. You will not regret the purchase of this game at all.			"

These misconceptions all vanished 5 minutes into the game.It's charming, addictive, and incredibly fun. I definitely recommend purchasing Cave Story.Bonus: It has EPIC replay value. I don't see this game leaving my library anytime soon.			"

 Cave Story+: The Poem  by jacketsj The bunny village,Deep underground,On an island in the sky,Floating safe and sound.Along comes robots,To kill all the bunnies,But two of the robots,Feel rumbling in their tummies.Quote and CurlyAre robots intead of grammar,They defied the army,And the island is their slammer.They are seperated,But are fated to be one,Shooting all the doctor's minions,All while having fun.If they want to be together,They'll have to go through hell,But then they'll kill Ballos,And their lives will be swell.

												Cave Story never stops being a gem - you can argue this for many different reasons. I mean, sure the soundtrack is amazing and the gameplay is genius in its seemingly simplistic nature. If this game just had that going for it, it'd simply be a good game.Then you dig deeper into the game and start to find the minutae of it's genius. Its indie charm resonates even deeper when you realize that this game (arguably) began the indie craze. It's constructed, top-to-bottom, by a single individual over many years of hard work and dedication. How Pixel found the time to create a surprisingly deep, and shocking, narrative is another matter entirely.This game is impressive in every way a game can be. I'll never stop enjoying it no matter how many times I play it, and completely recommend you give it a whirl.			"

												This game is fantastic! Well worth the money at any price. For starters, many of you have probably played this game for free in the past. This was a freeware game long ago, and this is the best known indy game of all time. Now before you say anything, it is worth the money, and this version is so much better than the free version.The game has 3 different soundtracks, (original, remastered, new), modes of play, (story, challenge), and two art styles (original and new). This game comes with the original soundtrack and visuals that look like the NES days of 8-bit. There is also a newer art style that is ""HD"" polished look, cleaner lines etc. 3D characters etc. The soundtrack from the original is there in all its glory. There is also a remastered version of the original soundtrack, and a brand new soundtrack. There are 3 saves slots in story mode, so you can mix and match art styles and soundtracks. I love this game, is tough, has questing, platforming, amazing boss fights, retro visuals and great gameplay. This is the best Cave Story version in my opinion.			"

												Short version: Absolute masterpiece.When I first played CaveStory I expected nothing going into it and never gave it a chance, giving up within 5 minutes only a year later to pick it up again. If only I could go in a time machine and tell myself what a fool I was for putting down what would become one of my favorite games of all time. Heart touching story with multiple endings, a  brilliant soundtrack and a learning curve that never seems too steep. Very reminicent of games of old that were considered masterpieces of their time.

												Wowza, ok, first off I will let you know that Cave Story is simply put one of the best games of all time. In my top 25 games ever and it was made by just one dude, Daisuke Amaya. I will also let you know there is a freeware version available that is perfectly solid. Don't be afraid to play that version, because it's the original and it is of high quality. Previously I've beaten the freeware OS X version (the first time I beat it), then I beat the Windows version, then I beat the WiiWare version, and now I am on my fourth playthrough with CS+.CS + includes a variety of extras, new ""HD"" graphics, new OST, be sure to check between the new & old to see which you prefer.Buy it sometime.A+			"

												An adorable game at sugar-high inducing levels of cuteness, it also provides a shockingly (at least, shockingly next to all the cuteness) dark setting underneath. While the silent protagonist is quite overdone by Japanese style games, it's still interesting to see the exchanges between characters and whatnot. The gameplay itself is nice. In the midst of all the 3D games, it's nice to have a 2D sidescroller once in a while, and it's quite reminiscent of games such as Metroid or whatnot. It's unique in that you have different levels for the weapons that you can lose by being hit (so there's encouragement to avoid attacks beyond hp) and gained by eating doritos. The gameplay mainly speaks more for itself, in any case. Also, the gameplay strikes a nice balance with difficulty. It becomes extremely difficult at times, but not overwhelmingly so. Of course, if you want to go for best ending... heh. Good luck.So, it's worth a try at least. Hell, the original is free if you don't want to spend $ or £ or whatever, though + refines the cuteness.			"

												Game: Cave Story+Genre: AdventureDeveloper: Studio PixelSystem: PC (Steam)Total Score: 83/100Value Score: 8.3/10• Story: 8/10o You play as a robot called ""Quote"" who wakes up suddenly in a mysterious cave. You learn that a race of creatures called Mimiga exist in the island of the cave you are in. You have no memory of who or what you are but you explore through the mysterious cave and eventually find out that a mysterious group of people are planning to use the island as a basis to take over the outside world. As you go through the different locations of the island, learning the mysteries of the island and its denizens and traversing through monster infested caves you learn a dark hidden secret under the island.• Characters: 9/10o Cave Story+ has a colorful cast of characters of all sorts of kinds such as robots, mimigas (creatures in the game), humans, goblin like beings, talking roaches, dogs, little people and many other types of beings. You play as a robot named Quote who seems to have some sort of tie to the past of the island and you eventually meet or find of your kind. The enemy designs in the game is quite well done and are original for the most part. Very rarely do you see a similar sprite enemy with a alternate color and all the NPC type characters you come across are all noticeable different with each of them having a unique personality sometimes reflecting of the modern world.• GamePlay: 8/10o Cave Story+ is a platformer RPG like shooter. You have a health based system which you can increase if you find health capsules/containers, you also get a variety of different types of weapons all of which are projectile type weapons and has long range uses depending on what level they are. You can gain levels for your weapons after collecting little triangle bit looking pieces which count as EXP. Some weapons benefit from gaining a level while others get weaker. You also get a set of different items most of which are key items which is usable only through a storyline event and some are additional power ups which are optional. You'll be going through caves and all sorts of locations fighting off all sorts of different types of enemies whether they are in the water, air or land. Just like a platformer you have the ability to jump across platforms, enemies or to get to a certain area along with the fact that you can power up your jump through a upgrade. Cave Story+ is somewhat difficult and can get more difficult depending on what setting you used to start with or with what paths you take the game as you can get multiple endings and ending results depending on some of the decisions you make that will affect your overall gameplay experience as well. There's also a challenge option where you can go in and have time challenges which can also be recorded.• Graphics: 8/10o Cave Story+ uses a unique 2D style art design and gameplay visual which will shoot rays of nostalgia at the player especially if the player has been playing games since they were primarily 2D. The PC version looks far more refined than the other versions of the game. Each character, object, and environment area looks unique from each other so dont expect it to get repetitive to the point where you will be bored. However due to the fact of the way it was developed, your choice on resolution may be limited as it is possible that black borders may take up the left and right of the actual game screen.• Sound: 7/10o If you play a side scroll shooter or any of the old school games from the 1980s or the early 1990s you will understand how the sound effects are like. There are a lot of nostalgic like sound effects which sound similar to different aspects from different games of the old times. Although there isnt voiceovers the creators of the game did a nice notion of adding a sound effect when a character talks although all the NPCs you talk to sound the same in that instance.• Music: 10/10o Cave Story+'s OST is an amazingly well done soundtrack which has the 8-bit tone of what you would consider techno/metal/orchestral music of the old gaming eras. Each area of the game has a unique track and there are unique boss battle themes depending on what kind of boss you are fighting whether it is the final boss, a mini boss or a actual boss. You will surely enjoy the classical 8-bit like OST. You also have the option to change the OST to the classic original style.• Length: 7/10o Cave Story+ is consisted of mostly a linear path which takes you to around 5-6 general areas with some small areas between each other. You also have the choice of making a decision which can alter the length of the game. However the game should not take you more than 15 hours to complete unless you die a lot or get lost.• Replay Value: 8/10o Cave Story+ uses a multi-ending style for its storyline, depending on the decisions you make you can change the game's outcome. There are about three different endings, one of which you can get when you finish the game halfway across, the second one which is the general ending and a third ending which is considered the best ending providing you accomplish certain tasks or did certain events in a certain way. You also have challenges which allow you to play through speed like stages where you are timed and can be recorded. You can also play the game again with multiple difficulties. The gameplay experience also changes depending on what you chose in the game as your weapon or again what certain paths you have taken or avoided.• Player Value: 8/10o Cave Story+ is a pretty good 2D platformer which takes elements and aspects from different types of other genres such as shooters, RPG and action games. The game has a sarcastic eastern tone to it with a few internet meme references along with the fact that the game uses audio and a art style which was common in the 1980s and 1990s but is unique now. The game's storyline and characters will make you enjoy your experience along with the sheer difficulty some of the levels and areas of the game will bring to you. Get this game on Steam while it is hot with the price it will be depending if its summer or winter. You will not regret the purchase of this game at all.			"

												Reminiscent of old-school Metroid or Castlevania games, this is an extremely fun game and gets very challenging in the later stages without becoming too frustrating. The system that has your weapons leveling up as enemies fall and losing levels when damage is taken adds a nice strategic depth (as a boss might hit you one too many times and render your favorite weapon almost worthless). The story is also very well-written and does a good job of immersing you in the game world.			"

												Reminiscent of old-school Metroid or Castlevania games, this is an extremely fun game and gets very challenging in the later stages without becoming too frustrating. The system that has your weapons leveling up as enemies fall and losing levels when damage is taken adds a nice strategic depth (as a boss might hit you one too many times and render your favorite weapon almost worthless). The story is also very well-written and does a good job of immersing you in the game world.			"

												When the original Cave Story was released on the PC, it gained rave reviews. Harkening back to the era of the (N)th bit adventure games (where ""N"" is a number), it reminded us of those classic sidescrolling games of yester year: the Castlevanias and the Metroids, and so on.Now, it gets a proper PC release, and it is worth every penny. Cave Story is a side scrolling adventure game, in the same vein as the Metroidvania games I talked about. Yet now it's got upgraded graphics and remasterd music.Essentially, it's the Wii version, but in higher definition. Don't let that fact put you off though, it's still a great game that will make you yearn for more adventure once you're finished with this game.			"

												I first played Cave Story when it was a Japanese freeware game with a fan translation, probably around 2005 or so. It wss a great game then, and Cave Story+ is perhaps better.The game itself is a solid platformer, challenging, yet fair. The story is decent; by no means stellar, but not bad either. Cave Story+ adds graphical and musical improvements to the original, as well as additiona game modes, challenges, and difficulty settings. Additionally, there is the option to use the original graphics and music, so fans of the original can still play it as such. All in all, A solid game worth giving a playthrough or two.			"

												Did you know Cave Story was made by one man? To be honest, you probably did, but if not, you should be impressed.I enjoyed this game a LOT, my hours should pretty much be the evidence for that. The gameplay is pretty addicting, it isn't easy, but not too hard either (for the most part, atleast).However, the original version of the game - found at http://www.cavestory.org/ - is free and it's pretty much the same with the exception of challenges and runs at 50fps, while the Cave Story+ version runs at 60fps. As a player of both versions, I got to say, I enjoyed the CS+ version more.If you don't like the ""remastered"" graphics or soundtrack you can always change them to original (in the soundtrack, there's a ""New"" version, which is the Wii version's music, I believe).Beware, though, there IS one achievement that is bugged, and as having all other achievements, this is annoying and makes me wish Nicalis fixed it.For some reason, I didn't really enjoy it at the start (stopped at around the 2nd or 3rd area), but once I got around to play it again, I enjoyed it.Rating? It's a solid 9/10 for me, there were some annoying parts that otherwise would make this a 10/10.			"

												A lot of people says this is comparable to metroid, megaman, or whatever. Since I was never familiar with any of those games, I came into this one completely blind. All I have to say is that this game is absolutely great, and certainly a decent stepping stone for those who never impored the mentioned games.Most of my experience comes from the freeware version (since I had no idea I had a code for this in a old humble bundle I got some years ago) but I did dabble in this game for a good chunk and it's quite great. The gameplay is easy to understand, The control is responsive and smooth, a good amount of weapons to use and experiment with, different endings, and a good sense of challenge and difficulty within the main game. Let's not talk about the good ending doe...The extras this port provides is great too, such as the option to play as another protagonist and which version of graphics/sounds you'd like to use. It definitely adds to the value. I do suggest you try the freeware version at cavestory.org first, but this port is definitely worth a purchase (even at full price) if you liked what you played.  "

 Cave Story review I'm playing Cave Story since 2013 with more than 10 playthroughs and I have played the 3DS (including the remake that i'm not going to talk about in this review), Wii and Pc versions. All three versions are good, and have exclusive content like 3DS having 3DS, but my favorite version is the Cave Story+ for pc because you have sprites and music improvement, but you can still choose the original ones, some extra modes, playing with keyboard or controller and specially what makes this version the best it's the achievements. I conclusion I can recommend you to play the original cave story series.Do not play cave story 3D the original one is much better Cave Story+ review Just talking about the steam version, that I had played already 24.7hours and cleared already sometimes, I can recommend you to play this version if you are a pc gamer and like to play with keyboard.Differences between versions.Cave story + 3 save slots extra modes achievementsOriginal one 1 save slot you just can play on normal diff.  FREE (0$) Rating   Category rate   Graphics 9   music 8   story 9   Controlls 7.5   overall 8.5 I really like cave story. The graphics are old school but clean,beautiful and amazing for a 2004 game. I can't talk that much about the music and sound effects because I'm not too much into this kind of stuff : | but I can say that the story is really deep and good, prepare to cry (jk). The cons of the game are the controlls that aren't the best (but not bad too, but the controlls could be better) and some achievements are broken, the hell one I think. Final wordsIf you like 2D games, metroidvania and hard games then this game is for you! Just buy it or download the free version to try it!!			"

												Did you know Cave Story was made by one man? To be honest, you probably did, but if not, you should be impressed.I enjoyed this game a LOT, my hours should pretty much be the evidence for that. The gameplay is pretty addicting, it isn't easy, but not too hard either (for the most part, atleast).However, the original version of the game - found at http://www.cavestory.org/ - is free and it's pretty much the same with the exception of challenges and runs at 50fps, while the Cave Story+ version runs at 60fps. As a player of both versions, I got to say, I enjoyed the CS+ version more.If you don't like the ""remastered"" graphics or soundtrack you can always change them to original (in the soundtrack, there's a ""New"" version, which is the Wii version's music, I believe).Beware, though, there IS one achievement that is bugged, and as having all other achievements, this is annoying and makes me wish Nicalis fixed it.For some reason, I didn't really enjoy it at the start (stopped at around the 2nd or 3rd area), but once I got around to play it again, I enjoyed it.Rating? It's a solid 9/10 for me, there were some annoying parts that otherwise would make this a 10/10.			"

												Pros:- Great Story- Great Gameplay- Great Retro Graphics- Great Music- Difficultly Is Well Balanced- Feels Like an SNES Game- Is A Great Remaster- Best Version of the Game- Why Haven't You Bought This YetCons:- For Best Playthrough, I can't use a machinegun Jetpack- Forgot to Save Someone, Now I Have To Deal With The Regret of Doing So- Oh hey look a missle unit, wait, FUUUUUUUU- Seriously though, the only complaint I have is that checkpoints in some areas could have better placement, not cause of difficult, I just dont wanna platform the same jumps 50 times.Overall, you should already have this game, and is very cheap during steam sale season.

Don't let the simplicity of the mechanics and initial plot get to you- this game is an amazing example of the genre. If you're a fan of Metroid or Castlevania, you'll love this piece.Did I mention the original version of this game was done by only one person? Yeah. Everything. The game engine, graphics, story, music, everything. Even if the length of the game doesn't impress you compared to others of its genre, keep that factoid in mind. With that, I certainly don't regret buying this game on two different ports.			"

 Cave Story review I'm playing Cave Story since 2013 with more than 10 playthroughs and I have played the 3DS (including the remake that i'm not going to talk about in this review), Wii and Pc versions. All three versions are good, and have exclusive content like 3DS having 3DS, but my favorite version is the Cave Story+ for pc because you have sprites and music improvement, but you can still choose the original ones, some extra modes, playing with keyboard or controller and specially what makes this version the best it's the achievements. I conclusion I can recommend you to play the original cave story series.Do not play cave story 3D the original one is much better Cave Story+ review Just talking about the steam version, that I had played already 24.7hours and cleared already sometimes, I can recommend you to play this version if you are a pc gamer and like to play with keyboard.Differences between versions.Cave story + 3 save slots extra modes achievementsOriginal one 1 save slot you just can play on normal diff.  FREE (0$) Rating   Category rate   Graphics 9   music 8   story 9   Controlls 7.5   overall 8.5 I really like cave story. The graphics are old school but clean,beautiful and amazing for a 2004 game. I can't talk that much about the music and sound effects because I'm not too much into this kind of stuff : | but I can say that the story is really deep and good, prepare to cry (jk). The cons of the game are the controlls that aren't the best (but not bad too, but the controlls could be better) and some achievements are broken, the hell one I think. Final wordsIf you like 2D games, metroidvania and hard games then this game is for you! Just buy it or download the free version to try it!!			"

												A lot of people says this is comparable to metroid, megaman, or whatever. Since I was never familiar with any of those games, I came into this one completely blind. All I have to say is that this game is absolutely great, and certainly a decent stepping stone for those who never impored the mentioned games.Most of my experience comes from the freeware version (since I had no idea I had a code for this in a old humble bundle I got some years ago) but I did dabble in this game for a good chunk and it's quite great. The gameplay is easy to understand, The control is responsive and smooth, a good amount of weapons to use and experiment with, different endings, and a good sense of challenge and difficulty within the main game. Let's not talk about the good ending doe...The extras this port provides is great too, such as the option to play as another protagonist and which version of graphics/sounds you'd like to use. It definitely adds to the value. I do suggest you try the freeware version at cavestory.org first, but this port is definitely worth a purchase (even at full price) if you liked what you played.  "

												If you're interested, and you think the game is too expensive then you have got to download the free version! Cave Story was originally created by one guy, who spent over five years trying to make the game amazing and something that he himself would enjoy. The gameplay is a ton of fun, and the physics have a great feel if you like 2D plaformers. It's very satisfying to jump around and shoot things, especially since the weapons themselves are unique and creative. The music is some of the best I've heard in a video game. It makes you want to make your character dance around as it dodges bullets, and even inspires you to complete the hardest trial as you literally travel through hell. This version of Cave Story has three soundtracks to choose from, so make sure try them out in the options (my favourite is the original). The story is pretty good, but I think the writing in the fan translation was done better. The game's difficulty has a nice curve I think, it can get really quite challenging but still not unfair. Even if a boss is too hard causing you to take a break, or even if you beat the game; everyone I know who has enjoyed it, has come back to the game to beat the boss, or has replayed the game from the very start because it's simply just that fun. I played the original 7 or 8 years ago and still replay it today. As I've said before if you can't buy it, get the free version. Completely worth it. Did I mention there's a puppy saving quest where the puppies ride on your head? Yes!			"

												Cave Story+ is a game I first picked up on my Nintendo DSi a few years back. After playing through it once again, I had to see what was different between the DS version and PC/Console version. I got the game on sale for around $10, and the game is definately worth the $10 I spent and more. Pros+Decently lengthed Story(6-8 Hours in my experience) +Multiple difficulties that are actually different(Easy, Medium, and Hard AKA Pain in yoour A$$)+Many distict areas with differing enemies+Interesting (and sometimes funny) weapons+Interesting and in depth characters that have personallity+Nice extra challanges that can de difficult for old players+Multiple endings baised on items obtained and actions takenCons-The area for the True ending, Hell, is incredibly difficult and takes hours of practice unless you have done it defore-Boss difficulty is a bit all over the place, one boss being really hard, the next easy, then super hard again-Some weapons have really odd or illusive ways to obtain them-Mimiga Village is confusing for first time players on where to go, which may cause them to unnessisarily search the entire town, or stumble into the right place in the first few secondsCave Story+ is an amazing game. Especially considering that it was made by one guy and was originally released in 2003. I have this game up on my list of favorites and can't stop recommending people to get it.			"

												An absolute gem of a game.I was worried this would be one of those ""ultra-hard"" platformers like Super Meat Boy etc, which  are really not my thing.    Cave Story+ is not that.  What it is is a complete, fleshed out and polished platformer with a story, goals, the right amount of exploration and discovery.  Finished it on Easy (2 endings) which I found challenging enough, and although I know there is more content awaiting me on the harder difficulty modes, that is something better left to completionists and those with more free time and/or dexterity than I have.   A good 9 hours in to complete what I did and I'm very satisfied with the overall experience.The graphics are great in a polished, retro-way, and the music (remastered) was catchy and enjoyable.  Controls with a 360 controller were spot on.  I'm at a point where I prefer games to be on the shorter side (4-5 hours), but though I put double that into this it did not over-stay its welcome.    I was able to get through the harder areas after a few tries, and the generous amount of save points (with the possible exception of the 2nd ending sequences) kept me from repeating too much. Hint: save the life refill potion for that last bit!Those seeking more can try the other difficulty modes which add some content. There are also ""score attack""-type challenges although they would not run properly for me, but those are not something I would go back to regardless.Overall, highly recommended to anyone who enjoys platformers with a retro-feel (but modern controls). It is certainly one of the better titles in my library.			"

Depends on date you play on exp play on october 31st you get to view the Halloween character models."" ""ETC"" = SO MUCH MORE BONUSES PROBABLY MORE THEN OTHER GAMES PLUS CAVE STORY ""+"" GIVES YOU ALL THIS FOR FREE WHEN YOU PURCHASE THE GAME. *breathes* Is there anything else you need to hear? Oh The Gameplay Look at the models and backrounds 10000000000000000/10 Oh The Mechanics you ask? The jump mechanic can be a bit tricky but when I played in 2012 it was good plus you can use a controller if you want and change around the controlls on a keyboard. Excuse me if I typed too fast and mest up some spelling and yes I am NOT advertising the game I am just being a personal critic. Anything Else You Want to know about Cave Story +?

												One word of advice: Is this worth the time? Only if you're a really avid fan of Cave Story and you don't already have it for Nintendo Wii, Nintendo DS or Nintendo 3DS. Apart of the difficulty modes, the new graphics, the new music (Which can't compare to the original), the option to play as Curly and the new bonus dungeon, the game is EXACTLY the same as the one you can get as freeware and with a translation patch. If you are an avid fan and you're up to a few new challenges... Be my guest!			"

												Cave story is basically what every western dev wishes they made, which is why we have so many retro platformer 8bit hipster games coming out that no one cares about. This game's epeen will forever be the biggest and hardest. Simple story, simple play, simple dong expanding. If you play in anything but classic you are a bad man.			"

												Cave Story is one of the best designed games of all time. Every section of each level feels meticulously designed to guide the player and teach them. The game almost never explains anything with text boxes or standard tutorials, not even which buttons to press. But the game prefectly teaches you everything you have to know with subtle level design and graphics. There's a suprising amount of extra content for you to find and multiple endings, the hardest ending being one of the biggest challenges I've ever had playing a video game. There's a huge amount of boss battles and I never found myself being too annoyed by any enemies or bosses because of how fair they all were. A great example of being fair to the player is the fact that many enemies in the game won't deal damage when you touch them, they'll only deal damage to you during their attack animation. This is a great game with replay value, great art design, great level design, comfortable controls, and good music. There's not much I can think to critique about this game. Regardless of what kinds of games you like, you should play this game.			"

												The world's most popular doujin game. For good reason, too. This side-scrolling Metroidvania has you playing as Quote, an amnesiac robot who is trying to recover his memory while helping the island natives. The OST is wonderful, and in this version you can pick from remixes or the original chiptune songs, both of which are pretty damn good. Graphically, the updated visuals are nice, though being able to return to the original sprites and such was a very welcome addition. Cave Story lends itself well to replayability, with speed-running, time trials and various different endings and choices. I really can't recommend this game enough. This game's pretty damn fun. It's also oddly cozy, if you're into that.  "

												There's a plenty of reasons you should play this one, unless you are 100% into non-realtime or 3D games. First of all, this is the best re-release since the Doukutsu Monogatari was originally introduced in 2005 in Japanese only. Other ones lack some features or play differently.Being a ""doujin"" videogame, Cave Story predates all the indie mumbo jumbo that's so noisy nowadays. It was made by one person over the course of 5 years or so. The pixel art, the music, the engine, the audio subsystem with custom tracker-like format, all authored by ""Pixel"". But that's just the historical reason to get to know it.Gameplay-wise, Cave Story is a traditional platformer akin to Metroid, with role-playing elements. Unlike the old games of 90's, it is really long - I'd say 10 hours for a blindrun by an experienced player. More than that, you aren't going to have the Best Ending in the first run, and to get that one, you should either be very inquisitive, or know the story pivot point beforehand.Finally, I nominate this game for the ""Test Of Time"" Steam Award 2016.

Totally worth every penny for the Steam version.-Runs at 60FPS compared to the 50FPS original.-Can switch between the original graphics and new HD graphics.-Can switch between 3 soundtracks.-One of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in any video game.-Way better controller support.-Multiple difficulties.-Only version that has achievements.-Extra modes such as Machine Gun Challenge and Wind Fortress.-Multiple endings.-Great characters.I can go on and on about how this is such a well put together game, but you're better off just playing it and experiencing it yourself.

												Cave Story is a game I admit I overlooked for some years, until a friend, who had suggested many a time that I should play it, decide to buy me this updated version. Thus, I was out of excuses.If you are unfamiliar with the game, as I was, it's a Metroidvania originally made by one Japanese guy over the course of five years. You begin a cave, with no items, no idea where to go, and no idea even who or what you are, and in true genre fashion, are expected to blunder about until you get your bearings. Or you could just use a guide, like I did.The game's overall presentation is cutesy and at times endearing. It reminds me of classic NES platformers in this way, as well as games that make you feel good about yourself like Kingdom Hearts and Shantae, though personally I think it could have taken a few pointers from the latter. The visuals and music were competent as well, but something about the entire asthetic never really clicked with me. It does make the rather heavy plot more impactful, out of dissonance, I think. I had no idea going in how important the story was to the experience, or that it would make care for a character like Curly Brace. A shame it punishes you so hard for caring, as I will touch on a bit later.Mechanically speaking, I have few complaints. New weapons and upgrades feel great, and complement each other almost flawlessly: Each weapon is adept at a certain combat scenario that the others aren't, and you almost always have a way of hitting enemies without taking unnecessary damage, unlike, say, Mercenary Kings. However, the jumping is a tad unresponsive and flight control is sluggish, and in particular inertia is strangely powerful for a game of this type. It's fortunate that the game has a minimum of deathtraps, at least early on, or I would have found myself sliding into them much more often. The game is on the short side for it's genre. though I'd hardly call that a shortcoming. It's also on the easy side, though It recommended I play easy mode as a first-time player, so I can hardly complain. And then the game descides to shove a difficulty spike up my♥♥♥♥♥ almost souring the entire experience for me. In the span of a single zone, the creator attempted to pack all the old school NES death course ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t he didn't include earlier on, culminating in a whooping FOUR phase boss fight with minimal opportunities to heal, and no checkpoint prior to the boss or between any phases, forcing you to repeat the entire course again if you die, and only giving you a single full health restore, one of two in the game, to use. It was the kind of level that doesn't feel satisfying even when you win. I can only hope that the cast had a happy life thereafter.I can't honestly recommend Cave Story to everyone, based on the punishing difficulty of this last level. The only alternative is the very obviously bad ending where you flee in shame, and who would do that? Unless you really want that achievement, I suppose. But if you thoroughly enjoy a challenge, or at least a good story, It is likely worth trying. Just don't say I never warned you.			"

												I went into this game expecting a fun little pixelated platformer indie game, but got an absolute masterpiece. Everything about this game is done right. EVERYTHING. The intriguing story, the catchy music, the incredibly fluid combat... It also has a lot of replayability value, because of how many different choices you can make, and some you wouldn't even think of at first(you'll know what I mean by that when you play it). And to add to all this, it was made by one man in his free time.Its hard for me to say enough just how good this game is, so I'll end it here by saying this is about my favorite game of all time. 10/10, easy.

												Note: I've completed this game twice on the original PC version and twice on the DS version, now I'm going to attempt 100% on the Steam version.This game is my favourite game of all time, I've poured hours into it in the past, and I will be doing so again now and in the future. The soundtrack of this game remains my favourite, Pulse and Geothermal are my top two tracks, and I have the entire soundtrack on my phone to listen to sometimes. I play this game with the original music and visuals, because it feels nostalgic somehow, so I can't give much input into the remastered versions of the two. Curly is an awesome character, and genuinely pulls on your heart strings at times throughout the game, and all the other characters grow lovable too, even the villains. The gameplay is a mixture of megaman and castlevania, or better known as the genre 'metroidvania', which wouldn't usually appeal to me, but does somehow. There are a wide variety of weapons to find throughout the game, some requiring restarts of the game to get, since it's a pick-this-or-that type thing, which is fine because there's fairly good replayability, and plenty of achievements to get alongside your restarts.Probably 200+ hours of game time if you're dedicated to getting 100%, definitely worth the price, more so on sale. I more than recommend this game to anybody wanting a retro indie game with an amazing story, solid characters and a perfect soundtrack. 10/10 for sure, in my books.			"

If you've played it before, there's not much in terms of new content outside of the reworked soundtrack and new art, but $10 for a game this great is a steal. That being said, the game is meant to be played multiple times to see the three endings and complete the challenges that you unlock for beating it with the best ending. If you only plan on playing through it once, it can be finished in 2-3 hours unless you get really lost (which is hard to do anyway).			"

Superb for its time and still pretty good by today's standards.Cave Story+ excels in many of the major categories you'd rate it in. It's written with a lot of wit and charm. The gameplay is fun with a wide range of weapons that give you a lot of utility. Level design is varied and keeps things interesting and challenging. The soundtrack is a nostalgic trip into chiptune goodness.It does have some flaws though. Its challenge mode is broken for me and many other players by crashing as soon as I reach the finish of the first challenge. Don't expect this to be patched as it's been known for a long time and nothing has been done about it. I'm also not impressed with its graphics. They're not terrible, in fact some of the character designs might be called cute, but many of the environments are drab mixes of grays and browns. I generally found the soundtrack catchy but there were a few tunes that became annoying. Playing on ""original"" difficulty I thought that the combat had a satisfying level of challenge to it. However, the amount of damage you take from environmental dangers like spikes was too harsh in my view. There are numerous traps that will kill you in one shot no matter how much health you have. That is more unforgiving than I like, especially in a game with slightly floaty controls. Fortunately, the controls are consistent throughout the game so you can adapt to them and they become more manageable once you get the booster. Keeping with the old school  theme you are unable to shoot diagonally, only in the four cardinal directions.I'd like to close by bringing special attention to the rich world that is explored in Cave Story+. There's a fascinating backstory to discover as you play as well as fun characters to interact with. As with most ""Metroidvania"" games there are plenty of hidden and optional areas but here you won't just find power-ups. There are side quests, additional lore, optional weapons and gear, and even events that can lead to different endings for the game. This is a dream for players that love to dig into all the details of a game.			"

												Great game!But it's free if you know how to google.I stick to the stupid purist idea that you should play this game on at least original music, if you don't go wholly into original everything for cave story.The skill ramp is somewhat perfect with little deviation,And the game has a great story with multiple endings, (with the true ending being arguably impossible to naturally achieve on your first playthrough without a guide.)Don't be an idiot, don't pay 15 for it, but buy and play it nonetheless.Extra: This creator of this game created this in his spare time over 4 years. He also created a music-creating software for this game and another game called Ika-Chan. (Both of these can be found on the cave-story fan website, google is your friend.) He also released this game for free, along with all of the software previously described. I'm not sure what his intention was, but if I had to guess it probably had to do with altruism and entertainment.Phil Fish made Fez in the same timeframe but with crappy unoriginal internet funnies and other despicable internet culture gimmicks.He also charged money from the get-go.

												Cave Story is a fantastic throwback of nostalgia with a mix of combat and platforming that is well worth the $10.The story is simple, but that's fine. You're this little guy that wakes up with no memory of what happened and you find that a race of bunny people (Mimigas) are being abducted from a mad scientist for experiments. You must save them.And how you save them, is the main reason you should buy the game: Sega Genesis/SNES combat in a modern title. There is a variety of different weapons ranging from missile launchers, to pea shooters, to a mario styled fireball thing. The other mechanic in this is platforming, but ""true"" platforming that is reminiscent of Super Mario and Meat Boy is only present when you're trying to get to power ups, etc. It is more combat focused but that doesn't affect gameplay.Being a nostalgic throwback, Cave Story's graphics pop. If you can get over it being purposefully pixellated, you should enjoy the bright colors of the overworld and gloomy atmosphere of the caves. This does run in 1080p and the pixels are sharp - something that a game like this NEEDS. It runs fine on my rig, but that doesn't mean anything. It probably will run smoothly on a 5 year old Windows XP machine, since it is not a demanding game.If you've grown up with sidescrolling shooters like Metroid and Castlevania, then this is definitely something you should pick up.8.5/10			"

												This is the archetype of ""good indie game.""  Its standing is not up for question, nor does it need to be debated.  Its graphics are appealing; its music is catchy as all hell; the gameplay is so well-thought out and it's never frustrating because you're completely in control of your character (Dying is always your fault); the storyline is not hackneyed and it actually motivates the player to, I dunno, play the game.  There simply is no denying that Cave Story is a good game.  I could sing its praises for weeks, but to put it in a nutshell:  if this were released back in the SNES days with the likes of Super Mario World, it would be a long-standing franchise to rival that of Nintendo's greatest accomplishments today.  Everyone should play this game...that's it, that's the end of that statement.  Everyone should play this game.			"

												One of the best Indie games ever made. It doesn't try to be deep, or philosophical, it just tries to be fun, and exceeds expectations. The $10 Cave Story+ adds the Wiiware additions, like options for improved (But stilll 'retro') graphics, and redone (read: ruined) music. It also adds an option to play as the female robot, Curly, a sort of Boss rush, and a new dungeon area, the Wind Fortress. No matter what version you play, give Cave Story a shot.			"

												Looking back Cave Story would have to be one of the top 3 platformers I've ever played. The game is a great Japanese import and the style of the game is amazing. The story is detailed enough to give you a motive to play and the level up system and boss fights were always very fun. If you're looking for an Indie/RPG cave story is the game you want to try. 91/100			"

												The game I've loved since I was in my mid-teens...where do I begin?A platformer originally made in 2004 by one Japanese man named Daisuke Amaya. He has made several other games in this retro style, but this is one of his largest, and obviously most successful, projects.What I love: The retro theme, the silky-smooth gameplay, the music, the corny little story, the items, the endings, the characters, the secrets, and the fact that you can still pick up the original for free. Legally!What I hate: I can't have sex with it. ._.If you like platformers, I would give the free version a look. And if you love that, then consider throwing some money at this version :) There's extra little game modes, and the graphics are given a facelift. Besides, Pixel-san needs more recognition! HYPE THE PIXEL!			"

												This is possibly the best $10 you'll spend.If you were ever a fan of older adventure/platformer games like Metroid, you'll love this game. Everything about this game is absolutely perfect. The chiptune soundtrack is amazing, the graphics actually feel like appropriate (and not the ""HD retro"" style that you see in a lot of other games that try to emulate the retro visuals), and the controls are tight and responsive.You will NEED a controller to play this game, though. Because - like in many action platformers - you'll be doing a lot of actions all at the same time (jumping, running, dashing, shooting, etc), your fingers are going to be busy, and it only feels right when using a controller.That said, everything about this game is pure nostalgia, without ever feeling like it's pandering to retro gamers at all. While playing Cave Story, it honestly feels like somebody went back in time, stole the source code to a SNES game that was in production, and then brought it back and compiled it all over again for PC.I honestly could think of no problems with this game. It's got great dialogue, the animations are amazing, the gameplay is spectacular, and THE MUSIC. It's a great game that is well worth the pricetag.			"

												Great game, would have been one of the best NES games of all time if it had come out in the early 90ies.  Instead its a modern day throwback to all that was great about NES platformers/action games, from gameplay (tight on a gamepad), to sound (fun music), to story (interesting and somewhat deep story for a act/platformer), to really cute 8 bit pixelated graphics.  The game does require fairly good reflexes and skill, however I was able to get through it with a decent but not overwhelming challenge on easy, bump up the difficulty if you have the skill.			"

AUDIOGreat OSTVISUALRetroDIFFICULTYDifficulty LevelVIBEMelancholyCRAVINGPlatformerON SALESometimesPROS: Classically-driven Japanese style story that is a touch melancholy, but not nauseatingly-so. Excellent controls and interesting characters. Several soundtrack choices as well as an option for the original graphics. Multiple outcomes for decisions made, as well as weapon options. CONS: Steep difficulty curve near the end is extremely frustrating. Similar to Eversion, you're mainly paying for graphical update and soundtrack options; the entire original game is free. Many will also tell you that this version of the game has unlikeable dialogue changes. Mac players have been having trouble with it as well.WORTH: This developer is a strong but humble contributor to the indie scene. I would highly recommend buying games like this or Kero Blaster at full price to support him.OVERALL: Charming fantasy sci-fi that shows that 2D platformers with pixel art and limited palettes don't have be outcast to the realm of ""dated"" or ""niche."" Cave Story was made with a lot of love which has turned it into an outstanding addition to any library. If you feel that supporting this version of the game is wrong for one reason or the other, you may find your money better spent on ""Kero Blaster,"" to support its original creator.SCORE: 10/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

												Cave Story + is quirky and weird. At first, I thought it was a little too quirky and weird (the first 'boss fight' is against a giant talking handbag), but it quickly grows on you.There's a varied cast of characters that you grow attached to, a degree of freedom in exploration (although your choices narrow off significantly a number of times), and the story is strangely compelling. The retro aesthetic worked well, and I found I enjoyed the game more when I switched back to the old style sprites (you can choose between old and new graphic elements, and old and new music in the menu), likely due to nostalgia. The game just feels like a forgotten gem from the 8 bit / 16 bit era.I started out mildly amused but by the end the story was pulling me through (I stopped studying to come and finish the last 2 hours of the game!), the combat mechanics were fun and engaging and I really enjoyed it. Quirky, charming and nostalgic.			"

												Cave Story+ is a very well-created revision of the charming ""Cave Story."" Cave Story+ is a very fun game. Although this game can be very difficult at times, and I have yet to complete the best ending, as I'm quite stuck, I think Cave Story+ is a very well-made remaster of the original Cave Story, and it preserves all of the great things about the game, and makes them even better.The combat, though difficult at times, is quite satisfying, and the bosses are fun to fight, and they each have different strategies. The environments in the game are also quite cool, and pretty interesting.The only complaints that I have about the game are that, firstly, it's quite difficult at times, but also, in order for you to get the best ending, there are things you can very easily miss unless informed, so choices and actions can matter quite a lot in this game.Overall, I think Cave Story+ is pretty cool! I would certainly recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed ""Cave Story"" and everyone who enjoys platforms. The soundtrack was really well-remastered, and has some really catchy tunes!			"

												Rating 7.5/10OVerview: 2d Side Scrolling Action/PlatformerThe Good:+ On the surface this game may seem like a standard 2d action game, however once you dig deeper you realize there is more to this little game than you originally thought. As you play you are given choices throughout the game that not only impact the story but even what weapons you can use. All of this leads to some good replaybility and is probably the games' biggest asset+The game has somewhat of a unique upgrade system for the weapons you use. As you kill enemies they drop experience that will increase your weapons level. Each weapon has 3 levels each one getting progressively better. However if you get hit by an enemy your weapon level decreases adding an extra level of complexity to the game.  + A variety of different weapons that fit your play style or situation.  + The game controls are fantastic and feel very responsive+ The game has some really great boss battles, the further you progress in the game the more diverse and unique they become +The game provides a lot of different modes after you beat the game. Each mode requires you to beat it in a certain amount of time, the better you do, the more achievements you get. This further adds to the reaplayability to the game.The Average:Level design and objectives are not that good. Most of the levels have you running to one end of the map only to run back to the beginning again to complete certain objectives and advance the story.  This adds nothing to the gameplay and seems only to be used to pad out the game length. It gets tiring after a while.The Bad:- I really disliked the story and characters. Nothing seems to make sense and about half way through the game I couldn't care what happens to anybody. ConclusionI  had a lot of fun with the game, I just wish the levels were better designed. The extra modes provided are also fun. "

												Cave Story was the first game I played way back when I first started playing pc games (when I was 5 or 6, so about 11 years ago) when it frist came out as a free downloadable title directly from the site. I loved that game to death. About 2-3 years ago i found out that Cave Story was also on DSiWare and WiiWare, so I quickly bought it on both systems. It was then I realized that the game I played and loved so long ago had a deeper, darker story than what I though it had. Soon after that I lost my DSi, and when I tried to redownload it on my Wii, Nintendo already shut down wifi service for it. I then entered a depressed state, longing to play Cave Story once again...Then one day, while I was browsing Steam on my Grandma's laptop, I saw it. Cave Story+. I had to look twice, for at first I did not believe the wonderous sight before me. I quickly asked my Grandma if I could buy it, and she said yes. From then on out, I was happy. I never felt depressed since. My life was complete.			"

												I think it's really one of the best game I've ever played. It was my biggest inspiration source to make The AZERT Paradox. The Story is rich with 3 unique endings. The graphics remind me of the old SNES style with pixel nostalgia. The characters have their own story which sometimes could be a bit complicated or hard to understand but I love them all. In one word, if you've not already bought this game, buy it now. If you've bought the game and you've stopped before the ending, finish it. If you've got one of the 3 endings, look for the others. If you've the three endings, try the challenge mode. And if you have already done everything said previously, reset the game and do it again. "

												This game is one of the best adventure games I have ever played!It's an old game in retro style, which just got updated with High Definition graphic, that's why it's called 'Cave Story+'. (The original Cave Story isn't available on Steam btw)Cave Story is a great 2D game, where you play a robot named 'Quote', who just lost his memories and gets to know what happened the farther you play the game.So, where to start?First off, the Story is quite nice... not the best but it's nice. I don't want to spoil to much but as mentioned, you wake up somewhere and you don't know how you landed there nor what your past is. You have to fight your way through the levels to find out who you are and what you actually did. To reach your goal you'll have to use many different weapons... There's a big arsenal of weapons, but not all of these are obtainable in one single playthrough. The different enemies differ from each other so there's always another strategy how to beat them, the same applies to bosses. The levels are awesome made and the retro graphic style makes this game in it's look beautiful.And if this game was too easy for you, there are a lot of items you can collect and many challenges to complete. In case you aim for all achievements, you'll have to beat this game multiple times because - as mentioned before - you can't get all items in one single playthrough.Anyone who has never played it yet, has something missed in his life. This game is just awesome!You won't regret your buy and you'll love this game!In my opinion maybe the BEST adventure game, which was ever made! :D			"

												I think it's really one of the best game I've ever played. It was my biggest inspiration source to make The AZERT Paradox. The Story is rich with 3 unique endings. The graphics remind me of the old SNES style with pixel nostalgia. The characters have their own story which sometimes could be a bit complicated or hard to understand but I love them all. In one word, if you've not already bought this game, buy it now. If you've bought the game and you've stopped before the ending, finish it. If you've got one of the 3 endings, look for the others. If you've the three endings, try the challenge mode. And if you have already done everything said previously, reset the game and do it again. "

												I recently reviewed this game for my game review blog, Five Penny Review. If you enjoy this review, please visit my page:http://fivepennyreview.blogspot.com/2012/10/cave-story.htmlWhat sets this game apart?Independent developer Pixel spent five years working on this game in his free time, by himself, and produced a game with a compelling story and great retro platforming.  The popularity Cave Story achieved as a freeware title went a long way in proving to the gaming market that you can get a quality product without shelling out $50 to the big production companies.  Surely, this title paved the way for a variety of Xbox Live Arcade, Steam, and even Humble Indy Bundle titles.What is the difficulty factor?Cave Story plays like you would expect most games of its type to play, so there is no tutorial level.  The creator designed the first area in a way to “lets players feel like they've solved problems on their own.”  While it may seem frustrating to learn the hard way that those red spikes will in fact kill you instantly, or that you went the wrong way and have to double back before you can progress, it isn’t like you lose anything for dying, and there are only two ways to go anyway.  Using this sort of tough love tutorial might leave you feeling challenged, but ultimately more accomplished from the very beginning of the game, which sets the tone for the rest of the game.There is certainly no shortage of challenge, here, and even veteran players will experience a few moments where they may feel like pulling their hair out.  Collecting all of the hidden items and choosing the strongest weapons will go a long way in making you successful, but gathering them is a challenging endeavor in itself.  If you are feeling complacent with the difficulty, aim for the secret “good” ending, which features an impossibly difficult series of platforming feats.  In later ports, “hard” mode and a boss run time trial were added for the truly masochistic.Does it use media effectively?While the graphics and music have an enjoyable retro feel to them, and were produced by a single creator, I have to admit that they are not up to par with the technology available.  Later versions, notably Cave Story+ on Steam, cleaned up the graphics and sound while still keeping the retro feel that made it so enjoyable.  The most recent version, a port to the 3DS, was built from the ground up with rendered graphics, stereoscopic 3D, and additional content.  All of the versions are still enjoyable and feature the same level design and gameplay, so just pick the one that fits your visual preference and the limitations of your wallet.Best moment in the game?There are a lot of good moments in this game, but I’m going to have to say that the best moment to me is the boss fight at the end of Sand Zone.  To me, this is the point when the story proves how serious it is going to be.  The dialogue with King and Toroko at this point really hits home, and as the first act comes to a close, you are pumped up and ready to take down the Doctor.Who needs to play this game?This is a modern classic that almost any gamer will enjoy.  Take an NES classic like Metroid, add a compelling story and a bit more linear exploration pattern.  If you have a computer, you have no excuse not to play it, since the original game with a fan translated patch is still available for free (http://www.cavestory.org/downloads_game.php)!  If you are willing to spend a few bucks, I would personally suggest getting your hands on the DSi or Steam release, as they have some additional features that extend the replayability of the game.

												Well, after 100 hours on this game, I think I can write a review about it. So is it a game that you will enjoy and get addicted to or a game that you will dislike? The only one who could reply is you, but here is my personal opinion about it. You should enjoy it, unless you don't like platformer games. There are plenty of things that I liked, which I am going to analyse now.   First of all, the story is quite interesting and most importantly, the ending can be changed depending on your actions in the game. You can choose the bad ending, which is the quick solution, the normal ending that you will get 99.99% on your first try and the best ending, the most difficult one. Nevertheless, the story is as follows: You are a robot, who was sent among hundreds of others, a lot of years ago for one purpose: to defeat the Doctor, the villain in the story. In this ""universe"", there are bunnies in the shape of humans called Mimigas who are being kidnapped by him in order to eat the red flowers. If they consume them, they become enraged and uncontrollable. Yes, I know, it's a little weird, but you get used to it as the time goes by. Anyway, you start from a cave, get your first weapon and continue with the story as a guide. I liked the fact that it was balanced, the jokes, the weird moments, everything.   Secondly, I bet that you will be surprised if you hear that it was made by a man. Exactly, only one man, named Daisuke Amaya. He has made a lot of other games in the same style that I haven't personally tried, but I am willing to. He is the one who made the sprites, the music and the story. Speaking of music, the soundtrack is really catchy. It's so good that you will actually repeat it to yourself alone at least 15 times ( If you like 8 bit music ) . The art is neither bad nor good, it's exactly as I expected it to be.   On the other hand, the only real disadvantage that I found regarding this game is its cost. I might be a little too strict about these kinds of things, but 15 euros for this seems too much, don't you think? I could get a cool CS:GO skin with this or something even better. In my opinion, it would be better if it had costed 10 euros or so.   All in all, from my point of view, Cave Story+ deserves a 8,5/10. It's a great game that everyone who loves pixel games should try out. I wanted to give it a higher mark, but its cost made me to think about it twice.			"

												It has been a while since I played Cave Story. It is easily a great game for a metroidvania lover. I had not experienced such difficulty ever in a 2D platformer before. It is one of the  few games where I have come to terms with myself to give up on it, right on the final boss. I won't explain why due to spoilers, but those who have beaten it and I praise them for their patience, will deeply understand. It has a great soundtrack and it might look adorable, but do not be fooled. One of the toughest experiences I have had. I recently started playing Rogue Legacy and the fact that this game was hard, I remembered Cave Story and decided to review it. If you enjoy challenging games, this is definitely one of the top ones in my opinion.			"

												[Note: I have not played the original freeware Cave Story or any of its other versions, so this review will be for the Cave Story+ Steam version only.]I absolutely love Cave Story.  It is truly a great callback to SNES-era games such as Super Metroid, managing to incorporate all the best aspects of the period's game design while also finding room for some cool modern features (difficulty settings, skins, graphics/music options, achievements, and extended modes).  I'll break up this review  into sections, with each one focusing on a core aspect of the game:[Gameplay]This cannot be praised enough.  Like that of Super Metroid, Cave Story's gameplay combines the 2-D platformer, shooter, and RPG genres to create a wonderful but difficult experience.  There are nine weapons (mostly guns) in the game, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  A levelling system is applied to each gun you possess- your guns get EXP when you defeat enemies and acquire energy triangles, but lose EXP when you take damage.  As expected, guns become more powerful when you level up (with one exception).  This is an interesting and dynamic system, but can be very punishing for a careless player.  The game has a lot of secrets, and considerable backtracking is required to find everything.  Levels and bosses start off easy, but quickly become very difficult, especially when you're trying to get the true ending.  To give you an idea, I spent around 20 hours on Normal difficulty beating the last level + final boss alone.  The lack of save points before boss battles can be very annoying... just so you know what you're getting into.[Graphics]The graphics would look right at home on the SNES, featuring nice sprites and beautiful pixel-art environments.  The ""remastered"" graphics basically quadruple the number of pixels per sprite, and I greatly prefer them.  The original graphics are a bit barebones for my taste, although of course there's nothing really wrong with them.[Music]Music is another area in which this game shines.  The remastered music features a combination of chiptune and lower-quality (MIDI?) instruments, while the original is all chiptune.  Once again, I preferred the remastered versions here, as the original sometimes hurt my ears.  The tunes themselves are very catchy, and always fit the environment/context in which they are played.  Despite being somewhat minimalistic, the music manages to evoke many different feelings: comfort, exhiliration, dread, misery, you name it.  Definitely going in my playlist.[Story/Characters]The story is fairly simple but very solid.  I'm not going to give anything away as I think it's best experienced completely blind; and apparently, the game thinks so as well, as it just drops you in the middle of the first level with no explanation!  You have to figure out the story and the setting as you go along, and it's a ride.  Your story-related choices in this game aren't as varied as in other indie RPGs (e.g. Undertale), but there are a lot of sad moments.  When I played this game for the first time, I always felt like I was doomed until the very end.  My only real complaint is that the final boss isn't mentioned until LATE in the game- I felt like he could've been introduced a little better than he was.[Replayability]Basically endless!  There are three endings, three difficulty modes, and a lot of optional challenges (a new level, Boss Attack, time trials, etc.).  This is an incredibly tough game to 100% as it has speedrun achievements.  We'll see how close I get...Overall: 93/100			"

												This is going to be in the list of memorable games.If you're searching for something new, or at least with some variaty, you have to play this. It's unique story makes it really intesting to continue (Even though I'm not a story guy, I still admired it). It's technically one of those games that says: ""Screw reality! Let's go for imagination!"", which 95% of all games doesn't do nowadays. Throughout you play the game, you'll confront different entities that you haven't seen before. The first ones are the Mimigas. They also play an important role in the game, so don't forget about them. Later on, you'll confront other types of entities. But remember this: You have never seen them before in your life.It also have the feel of the old games. It's not really difficult like the old games but it has some of the thinking from the time. For example, there is bosses (Loads of them), no health recharge (All new games has that, and I think games are too easy with it), manual saving (Using save points) and so forth.But there's one negative side with this game, though. And it's that the story is very involving. And if you know games: The more story it is, the less gameplay. That leaves the player with dialogs and cutscenes where the player doesn't do much other than watching things happen. And what I think about games are that gameplay is the most important thing. Because when I play a game I want to stay in control throughout the whole game. That's what I like with games like Snayke or Doom.Still, an amazing game. Even though of the negative side, the positive sides overwhelmes that side of the game. I also made a playthrough on this game on YouTube.Here's the link to my montage of my playthrough (If you're still unsure about buying it):

												Cave Story+ is a famous Japanese independent game that was originally released as freeware with a fan translation. This re-release offers a choice of playing with the original graphics and music, or the remastered graphics and music. Whatever your choice may be, the game is a well done fanfare reminiscent of the classic platform games on the NES and SNES. The keyboard controls takes some getting used to even though they are simple to learn, but you do have the option of rebinding the keys and using a gamepad. The plot is comparable the well established lore of yesteryear by being invited to save people and rid a world of evil. The enemies are stereotypically Japanese in design, as well as the overall game mechanics and boss battles. Some of the dialog can be slightly amusing and sometimes charming, but this once again, does not steer too much away from what we have grown accustomed to enjoy from the 80s and 90s console eras. The difficulty settings can be adjusted to your liking, and they each provide an adequate challenge depending on what option you have decided to go for. The power-up system rewards the players who go out of their way to collect dropped items from downed foes. Switching between each weapon rapidly can be tricky, but this does not hinder the player from enjoying the changes, as adapting comes somewhat quickly through your progress. The different weapons acquired throughout the game are all quite useful and play very different from each other. As you change between them, there is much satisfaction shooting down your enemies and conquering bosses. While the storyline is reminiscent of past decades, it is surprisingly unique, in addition to flowing and developing well. This appealing plot provides the player with plenty of entertainment for many hours as you progress through the story. After tougher areas or tougher boss battles, your weapons' levels go down quite a bit as you take damage, and gathering the necessary drops in order to get them back to full power can be a chore. Cave Story+ is full of retro charm, from its game play style to its artistic inventions. There is very little to complain about, as I cannot think of any serious flaws. The resolution settings do not allow for true full screen, as black borders will be placed at the sides. The platforming elements in conjunction with the shooting can sometimes take some skill and getting used to, especially in high action sections. Some portions of the game (namely some bosses) become quite frustrating, no matter what difficulty setting you are playing on. This forces the player to redo a part of the game again in order to face the same boss (or bosses). Each repetition is about five minutes or longer, which constitutes of a problem to me, as dying with certain bosses occurs often. It is a game that may not be for everyone if the genre is not to their liking, but overall, it is quite the accomplishment, especially if you keep in mind that it was designed entirely by one single person, and achieves such positive results. The music is nothing short of superb. It embodies all that was great from the 8-bit and 16-bit eras and makes it exceptional and complementing to the game's presentation and plot. There is also a considerable amount of replay ability, as there are unlockable game modes and four different endings. If you love platform games with shooter elements, this is a must play. If you are unsure about the genre, you owe it to yourself to give this indie classic a try.Cave Story+ is great.			"

												An undeniable 'Modern Classic', and an astounding one-man project that is finally appearing in a digital storefront after 5 years as freeware.This story-driven, side-scrolling platformer-shooter opens with no details on where you are, what the goal is or who your character is (although I can tell you that he's called Quote; it's never mentioned anywhere in the game). The plot is linear in a MetroidVania way, but the decisions you make will alter the dialogue, the weapons you can get, and unlock alternative endings; for example, if you come across the item with ""0.8"" in the name, it's recommended that you skip it instead of taking it.The ""+"" signifies the conversion job done by a studio called Nicalis, who re-translated the text and added new sound, graphics and game modes to ports for the Wii and DSiWare, finally adding these options to the PC version. I play with New Graphics and Old Sound enabled, but would definitely go ""HUZZAH!"" if the original English script was available.			"

												What started as a freeware platform-adventure game has ended up on Steam in 2011, an enhanced version of the original game Cave Story. This is a great platformer with engaging storyline, unique set of characters, funny and well-written dialogue, an arsenal of inventive weapons, secret chambers, chests and upgrades, humongous range of bosses to fight agains. The game features three different endings and two graphical settings to choose from: original or remastered; as well as three types of soundtrack: original, remastered and brand new one written especially for Wii release of the game. It's worth checking out this game if you have some free time and want to take a break from all the Call of Duties, Medal of Honors and Battlefields.			"

												It has been a while since I played Cave Story. It is easily a great game for a metroidvania lover. I had not experienced such difficulty ever in a 2D platformer before. It is one of the  few games where I have come to terms with myself to give up on it, right on the final boss. I won't explain why due to spoilers, but those who have beaten it and I praise them for their patience, will deeply understand. It has a great soundtrack and it might look adorable, but do not be fooled. One of the toughest experiences I have had. I recently started playing Rogue Legacy and the fact that this game was hard, I remembered Cave Story and decided to review it. If you enjoy challenging games, this is definitely one of the top ones in my opinion.			"

												Cave Story+ is a metroidvania type game with fun game play. Its look and feel are reminiscent of the old NES titles. I found the platforming took some adjusting to, but perhaps that was just me. Be warned that the game can be challenging at times (and potentially punishing for those willing to push through for the best ending). Overall, I'd recommend this for anyone looking for a fun, polished side shooter.			"

												Cave Story is a fantastic game. It honors the SNES generation is so beautifully recreates for the player. The story (while abit cheesy) is pretty good, and very deep if you pay enough attention to what is going on. The Music (oh my Goodness the Music) Is just riviting, the tunes will indeed stay in your head for the longest time, just from the title screen you can tell the music is fantastic. Anyone looking for a good game, or loves inde games, this game is for you.			"

												Great platformer that is definitely one of the best games I've ever played. Wonderful controls, interesting weapons, exciting enemies, a pleasant visual style and an exceptional soundtrack make it a great indie game. My only real gripe is that certain endings can only be achieved by doing very specific things. "

												This game is really not for me. I missed the NES era in general, mostly because I was so obsessed with the Sega, and I could only pick one. So all of the nostalgia and a few of the jokes are lost on me. It's basically just a game catering to an audience I'm not a  part of. That said, it's a solid old-school NES platformer with RPG elements. There are a slew of higher-priced indie games that attempt and fail this aesthetic. While it's not really my style, the polish and difficulty should please anyone looking for an NES experience.			"

												One of the greatest and most influential games of all time, with one of the most unnecessary remakes of all time. At best the additions are novel. Most of the songs in the ""remastered"" soundtrack are fine, but not better than the original. There are added difficulty modes that just change the amount of health you have, and while the easy mode is good for inexperienced players the game's difficulty curve was already very well crafted in the first place. Hard mode just forces you to not pick up any health upgrades, something simple to do if you wanted to impose it on yourself in the original. The other extra game modes are not substantial.At worst the ""additions"" actually detract from the experience. One of the 3 optional soundtrack options is an abomination. The extra fidelity on the sprites is often a step backward: you can see a more of some characters' facial features but their expressions never change so it looks soulless. Their official translation often feels like it was trying too hard not to be the original fan translation, adding some cheap jokes and removing classic lines. The only circumstance where I would reccomend you get this version of the game is if you want to support the developer who spent 5 years making the original and released it for free. Even then, I don't know how much money actually goes to him and not the company who took a free game and made a bunch of unwanted changes just so they could charge people for it.If you do end up playing this version of the game first, play it with the included options for original soundtrack and art. You can try the updated visuals and music on your inevitable repeat playthrough, because you will love this game.It's sad when the best way to play a premium version of the game is to emulate the free version as closely as possible.

												While cave story is one of the greatest indie games ever made, Cave Story+ is a terrible port. Cave Story+ is terrible because it it runs in 4:3, the problem with that is even the freeware version runs in 16:9. You can't even stretch the game to 16:9, black borders were physcially added to the game to make it dispay in ""16:9"".  I would suggest to play the free game first instead, here are some comparisons. Free: http://i.imgur.com/1pA2Zc1.png Paid: http://imgur.com/LsDIJ1q The improvements in  the paid are double resolution textures, challenges and Curly story. These improvements are not worth it though. If you want the improvements but you don't want 4:3 then you should really buy the wiiware version. You can play the wiiware version on pc with Dolphin. To do this you need a hombrewed wii. You need to buy the wiiware version. You then need to dump the NAND through Bootmii. You then need to decrypt it and copy it into Dolphin. This it worth is though: http://imgur.com/IqaVZrV As a bonus you get full controller support, upscaling and antianalising.			"

												It's Cave Story- play it.EDIT:  Some people have not heard about this still, I suppose, so... it is a one man project from 2005 that inspired the makers of Super Meat Boy and is credited with a rise in indie developers trying to accomplish larger tasks outside of their niche group.  After it's freeware release it was remade to all late 21st century Nintendo consoles, and fans made it portable to the original Xbox and some graphing calculators (along with Mac and Linux).After all these years critics have called it the ""King of the Indies"", commending it for its masterful game design and storytelling.Even if you do not like semi-open/branching world story-driven 2D sidecrolling shoot'em-ups, then this game is worth a purchase, because being a PC gamer in this golden age of indie development and not looking into Cave Story means missing out on how our culture has developed, and what values started it all.  It is the same thing as being a huge fan of Naruto and One Piece but never taking a look at Dragon-Ball (even if the show REALLY repels you), or reading great modern fantasy like Game of Thrones or Tad Williams without reading The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings.Chances are you will love it anyway.

												Overall a good game and nothing was enough to make me hate it, but there are still several design choices that keep in from being a 100% must-have in my book. Most of it is fine, but once we get to the end of the Sand Zone and get to Rabid Toroko we start to hit some problems.For one, Toroko is a pretty disorienting curveball in herself; depending on what she decides to do the fight can either be quick and painless or teeth-grindingly annoying. And to top it off, after beating her you don't have the opportunity to heal for a lengthy period of time afterward (likely trying to see if they can force you to use the Life Pot item that fully recovers your health just once in mid-game; which by the way is a HUGE mistake).However, that isn't close to being the worst part. That comes immediately after: the Labyrinth. I hate the whole level in its entirety (and no, not for Monster X. He was actually the good thing to come out of it in my opinion). Its actual design is a bit jarring at points with several stunts that require almost perfect timing to pull off, but the biggest reason I hate it is that it can screw you over from 100% completion in several ways, all of which can occur VERY easily. The first example is when someone falls into one of the rooms as you enter; you can either talk to him and pick up something now or ignore him and move on for something else later. To even have a chance at 100%, you have to be a jerk and ignore the guy, going into the next room (which, by the way, has a boss fight almost immediately). And what makes this an even bigger problem is that the jump required to make it past him is very easy to miss, with no chance whatsoever to climb back up without talking to the guy who fell or resetting and trying the jump again (and even when you do eventually make it, the remainder of the Labyrinth will be an even bigger burden on you.The boss following that jerkishly designed jump isn't too bad; in fact it's a cakewalk with the right weapon choices, but what follows soon after is my least favorite segment of the entire game at the very end of the level, which is flooded with water that continually rises and falls as you go, and this is where that one bit I mentioned earlier starts to come further into play. If you went down to meet the guy who fell, the item you need to have any chance at completion will somehow magically vanish from this room (how does that make any sense?). If you didn't, you won't have better air movement to arm you against the Island Core, where the designer apparently didn't realize that having to deal with constant water physics that make no sense paired with the endless attacks and getting pulled and pushed around at will doesn't point toward a very good boss fight.Following that (by the way, also with no healing opportunities after an annoying fight) is the final stretch of the area, the Waterway, which introduces water currents that pulls you along. The area itself isn't too bad minus the huge abundance of spikes, but another very likely chance to miss 100% AND a reasonable save point is right around the corner, requiring about a split second's notice to jump off a single block out into a shack before the currents catch you again, and following that is the labyrinth's fifth and last boss (which I hate for the opposite reason of the Core; being too easy and coming right the heck out of nowhere anyways).Thankfully, the game stops being jerkish after that point until the very end if you happen to discover the hidden level you were working toward to get the best ending, and long story short to first-timers... This area WILL be the bane of your sanity. You have been warned.			"

The more to the right, the higher the volume.There is a Sound Volume button bar. The more to the right, the higher the volume.You can play this game with a controller or keyboard. You are able to change the controls of the controller or keyboard.There is a difficulty settings.Main Menu is pretty good and you can change the music style into ""retro/remastered or new""About the game.You are playing with a girl that is lost in a cave. During your adventure you will encounter enemies and weird rabbits. You will also find a gun and by killing enemies. They will have a chance to drop a Experience shard. Once the meter bar is full, your level of the gun will increase and you will do more damage. Taking damage by enemies/obstacles will decrease the experience meter. There are save stations and health stations all over the place. You can only save at the stations and not manually.The music that you have chosen at the main menu will also affect ingame.There is no options/settings ingame.The game has a decent story.Music is okay.Graphics are oldschool.Game has some funny things.Save stations are the only place to save your game.You can't skip dialogues or chat conversations.Other things.-------------------I Give this game a 6/10			"

												Overall a good game and nothing was enough to make me hate it, but there are still several design choices that keep in from being a 100% must-have in my book. Most of it is fine, but once we get to the end of the Sand Zone and get to Rabid Toroko we start to hit some problems.For one, Toroko is a pretty disorienting curveball in herself; depending on what she decides to do the fight can either be quick and painless or teeth-grindingly annoying. And to top it off, after beating her you don't have the opportunity to heal for a lengthy period of time afterward (likely trying to see if they can force you to use the Life Pot item that fully recovers your health just once in mid-game; which by the way is a HUGE mistake).However, that isn't close to being the worst part. That comes immediately after: the Labyrinth. I hate the whole level in its entirety (and no, not for Monster X. He was actually the good thing to come out of it in my opinion). Its actual design is a bit jarring at points with several stunts that require almost perfect timing to pull off, but the biggest reason I hate it is that it can screw you over from 100% completion in several ways, all of which can occur VERY easily. The first example is when someone falls into one of the rooms as you enter; you can either talk to him and pick up something now or ignore him and move on for something else later. To even have a chance at 100%, you have to be a jerk and ignore the guy, going into the next room (which, by the way, has a boss fight almost immediately). And what makes this an even bigger problem is that the jump required to make it past him is very easy to miss, with no chance whatsoever to climb back up without talking to the guy who fell or resetting and trying the jump again (and even when you do eventually make it, the remainder of the Labyrinth will be an even bigger burden on you.The boss following that jerkishly designed jump isn't too bad; in fact it's a cakewalk with the right weapon choices, but what follows soon after is my least favorite segment of the entire game at the very end of the level, which is flooded with water that continually rises and falls as you go, and this is where that one bit I mentioned earlier starts to come further into play. If you went down to meet the guy who fell, the item you need to have any chance at completion will somehow magically vanish from this room (how does that make any sense?). If you didn't, you won't have better air movement to arm you against the Island Core, where the designer apparently didn't realize that having to deal with constant water physics that make no sense paired with the endless attacks and getting pulled and pushed around at will doesn't point toward a very good boss fight.Following that (by the way, also with no healing opportunities after an annoying fight) is the final stretch of the area, the Waterway, which introduces water currents that pulls you along. The area itself isn't too bad minus the huge abundance of spikes, but another very likely chance to miss 100% AND a reasonable save point is right around the corner, requiring about a split second's notice to jump off a single block out into a shack before the currents catch you again, and following that is the labyrinth's fifth and last boss (which I hate for the opposite reason of the Core; being too easy and coming right the heck out of nowhere anyways).Thankfully, the game stops being jerkish after that point until the very end if you happen to discover the hidden level you were working toward to get the best ending, and long story short to first-timers... This area WILL be the bane of your sanity. You have been warned.			"

During your adventure you will encounter enemies and weird rabbits. You will also find a gun and by killing enemies. They will have a chance to drop a Experience shard. Once the meter bar is full, your level of the gun will increase and you will do more damage. Taking damage by enemies/obstacles will decrease the experience meter. There are save stations and health stations all over the place. You can only save at the stations and not manually.The music that you have chosen at the main menu will also affect ingame.There is no options/settings ingame.The game has a decent story.Music is okay.Graphics are oldschool.Game has some funny things.Save stations are the only place to save your game.You can't skip dialogues or chat conversations.Other things.-------------------I Give this game a 6/10			"

												Cave Story+ is a 16-bit ""Metroidvania"" platformer created by Nicalis. You play as Quote, a robot soldier discharged from an old war in which you use your array of weapons to stop the Doctor. Cave Story features an amazing story which also contains alternate endings based on your actions throughout the game. This game has been released on multiple platforms such as the Nintendo Wii, 3DS and of course, Steam. This version features an enhanced versioin of Cave Story, with cleaner graphics and remastered soundtrack, as well as challenges and achievements. The achievements are simple to get, most of them can be achieved during your first run of the game. Others require to complete certain objectives and replaying the game. The challenges can be challenging, but it does give the player some elements aside from the main game.Highly recommended for people who love an amazing story and a general fanatic of platformers. High replayability, alternate endings and challenges. Best version of Cave Story. Rating: 9.0/10			"

Cave Story+I absoloutely love this game, but I absoloutely hate how impossible it is to get the ending you want the first time without using guides.Do I recommend it? Yes!I also recommend playing it on easy difficulty the first time! Otherwise, you could spend hours being stuck due to some boss battle. Tons of achievements that are fun to get, plenty of secrets/""easter eggs""Gorgeous soundtrack and graphics, and the story is amazing. Now go buy it. Why are you still reading? Go buy it!If you're still reading, you hopefully already own the game, and you've beaten it.Major spoilers are coming up, so stop reading now if you don't want spoilers.Here's a story of a kid who decided to buy Cave Story for Wii. He started playing the game, and honestly, he loved it. He played it for hours every day, and eventually he met a girl named Curly. Curly was a robot, just like the player this kid was controlling. He grew very emotionally attached to Curly quite quickly, and he got to a point where he had to fight a boss. Due to Cave Story's weird ending system that this kid had no idea about, he couldn't save Curly, and she drowned. This made the kid cry for hours. This kept him awake at night years later. (No joke, and I'm not exaggerating here.) And he beat the game. For a long time, he didn't return to Cave Story. He was too sad. Years later, he got on Steam one day, and saw something in the store called Cave Story+. He decided to buy it, because he really liked Cave Story. He played it, and he beat the game and got the best ending. He saved Curly. He was so happy, and he slept better at night. If you haven't guessed yet, this kid was me. Thanks for putting this on Steam. "

												Cave Story is an indie adventure game in the tradition of Metroid, Kid Icarus and Simon's Quest. It combines classic pixel platforming with exploration, a large open world and an assortment of collectible weapons and upgrades. While it visually looks like a much more polished verison of a game from that age, Cave Story also includes some enhanced features like a storyline reminiscent of Japanese RPGs and an in-game map like later ""metroidvania"" games. Cave Story does not do much by way of innovating; it is very much, at its core, an adventure platformer. However it is a very good action platformer that appeals to my sense of nostalgia and fills the need quick action platformer type games. It is definitely worth some time if you are looking for a metroidvania game or get the itch to play Super Metroid or Symphony Of The Night but want a game you have not already played.			"

												EDIT: They rose the price instead of having a sale this Christmas. The developers are as bad as you may have heard.So I'm going to start off by saying that I have the free-ware version of the game that was released in 2004. And the 3D version released in 2012. And the 3DS-Ware version that was released in 2013. What I'm trying to say is, I spent another $20 on this game (a copy for myself and my brother) because I knew exactly what I was buying, and I wanted to support this game even further. Cave Story is a side-scrolling shooter where you play as robot soldier, who wakes up in a small cave with no idea who he is or what's happening on the island around him. Cave Story+ has several more features then the original Cave Story, including several time trial challenges, an unlockable mode where you play the game as another chracter, enhanced graphics, a remastered sound track, a ""new"" soundtrack, and over 70 achievements to reward you on doing anything from killing a boss wihout taking damage to... not killing a fish. Seriously. There's an achevement for not killing a fish. So, Mr. Traveler, grab your Polar Star and save the island!			"

												A very enjoyable little retro game with a quite interesting story. You start as this person who has no memory of what happened and you soon find out you are on a floating island and a evil mad Doctor is plotting to take over the world and become ruler of all. You meet many interesting characters along the way as well as some memorable villains and there are different endings depending on how you play the game and what routes you take.A surprising amount of fun and controller use recommended for this title. Hell of a lot of fun and well worth the price :)			"

												Cave Story is my favorite game to ever come out of the indie scene. It has a lot of charm, a great soundtrack, and fantastic gameplay. It's kinda like a MetroidVania but really doesn't feel like Metroid or Castlevania. I think that's what it does right the best out of all the indie games I've played, it takes a lot of old ideas but makes something really fresh and new out of them. It doesn't depend on nostalgia to be a good game; it just uses good gameplay mechanics and makes them unique. If you like games like Metroid or MegaMan and want something fresh to remind you why you liked those games in the first place, check this game out.			"

												I played the freeware version way back when and this is basically that +1. The new sprites look really smooth and the addition of several save files and some different modes increase the already initially large amount of replayability. I stil prefer the classic music, however.As for the game itself, it's a Metroid/Castlevania style of game where you collect power ups and weapons in an open style of world. It also has quite an interesting plot if you get into it.Tl;dr if you don't want to buy what I consider to be the greatest indie game ever, at least google up the old freeware version and play that. This is not a game to miss out on.			"

												hOI! =^_^= Well it's one of the most endearing thrillrides I've played through. Can't recall how many times I've played this and replayed it again and again, by now. Even though it's not 100% feature complete, if you don't want to spend money, play the free version! I did play through this on the Raspberry Pi via NXENGINE as well and it was just as much fun. It's still a very heartbreaking and heartwarming experience all throughout, much like Undertale has been. Some scenes aren't easy to take for me. This game is special. I didn't have this on Steam yet, so ... (MRROW! *Pounce*), GOT IT! <3 <3 <3 Oh, it's a sweet and playful platformer-""metroid-vania""-style sidescrolling shooter strong on secrets and story and characters. You better experiment and explore. And get a happy ending for everyone. Also .. those cheerful toasty melodic tracks are just amazing! It's not an easy game, but you know you can do it! =^_^=			"

												I do recommend this one.The game start you really helpless, but soon you get your first weapon.Addictive. In one word, that's what it is.Pixel art is great and polished, music scores are incredible,scenario flow like master storytellers directed it,the game creates a lot of great emotions, it has surprisingly epic moments of sentimental creesentos,i have no words!This game is an outstanding experience,old svhool platform lovers will love it,new age gamers will appreciate elements other than graphics and gameplay, that are really forgotten and undermined nowadays in most of the releases.Gameplay is great, it gets enhanced with new features as it goes on, arrow keys, z,x,s,q are the keys you will need, easy peasy to get used to it.Difficulty is great measured. Not so easy not so hard.Add one more feature! You make choices. From minor to major, this keeps replayability at high rates.Cave Story + is an excelleng game in all aspects.			"

												A very enjoyable little retro game with a quite interesting story. You start as this person who has no memory of what happened and you soon find out you are on a floating island and a evil mad Doctor is plotting to take over the world and become ruler of all. You meet many interesting characters along the way as well as some memorable villains and there are different endings depending on how you play the game and what routes you take.A surprising amount of fun and controller use recommended for this title. Hell of a lot of fun and well worth the price :)			"

												Recommended with some remarks.Old School plataform game. Cute characters, simplist scenarios but, attracting, at the end.Hard. You are dead really fast and, the saving spots are spread in each level so, you will repeat the same several times, which can be annoying and frustrating for most of people (including myself).But, I don't know what, the game invites you to continue playing; it has some magic...Only negative I can say is that the game should be automatically saved before starting to fight against any boss, otherwise you have to re-do the path to the boss and follow the bunch of dialogues before the fight, what can be really boring. Another thing that I hate is that every time you enter in any room, the complete scenario resets and the already killed enemies respawn.It would be a perfect game if it allowed to save the progress at any time.To repeat several times same thing is boring and kills the overall charming of the game.

												Great indie game about exploring a large underground world and picking up items that allow you to continue progressing, sort of like Metroid before it went 3D and terrible (exception: Prime 1). Shoot monsters, jump platforms, rock out to the great sound track, and best the bosses. This is a remake of a cult classic, originally fan-translated from a Japanese PC game.I don't want to give away the plot, so I'll just say buy it if you're looking for a fun single player romp with cute graphics and good run and gun platforming action.

												Interesting and nice game. However grab yourself a walkthrough if you want 100% completion, otherwise you might miss some story worthy stuff. Now probably the answer to the biggest question, is it worth paying for the new stuff? Well, if you find it on a decent sale why not? The visual and audio upgrade are sweet enough and the a new level sure make it a bit longer. Don't get this on full price if you never played the original FREE ONE.Don't rush into buying it if you never played or at least checked the FREE ONE.			"

												Cave Story is an indie adventure game in the tradition of Metroid, Kid Icarus and Simon's Quest. It combines classic pixel platforming with exploration, a large open world and an assortment of collectible weapons and upgrades. While it visually looks like a much more polished verison of a game from that age, Cave Story also includes some enhanced features like a storyline reminiscent of Japanese RPGs and an in-game map like later ""metroidvania"" games. Cave Story does not do much by way of innovating; it is very much, at its core, an adventure platformer. However it is a very good action platformer that appeals to my sense of nostalgia and fills the need quick action platformer type games. It is definitely worth some time if you are looking for a metroidvania game or get the itch to play Super Metroid or Symphony Of The Night but want a game you have not already played.			"

												Okay, so it's already freely available for PC, but this version includes better music (while still maintaining the retro sound), sharper graphics from the original designer, extra challenges and bonus stuff. A game worth playing is a game worth buying!			"

												Now, you might pass this off as another sidescroller shooter, but cave story is mutch more then that. Its nothing like that. Its a fun game that will give you hours of gameplay fun, achivments, other modes, and a game worth your time and money 100/10			"

												I cry, everytime. The game stands the test of age - the work of only one programmer, suddenly having to be ""Remastered"" by a team of dozens of people is nothing short of a prodigy.The game has tons of replay value, and secrets that have you second guessing and save-stating the loving hell of out the game to make sure you don't mess up.The game is challenging, but not impossible. I only had to cheat in it because I, like most young people, got tired of dying more often then my member as I go through my Dark Souls ecchi collection.The point is, the Japanese don't only make good anime, food, and women; they make good video games as well. 10/10, would try before I buy again.

												I can't possibly recommend this game more to more people. It's not very long and the graphics aren't amazing, but the gameplay is positively top-notch and the story is very intriguing. Both will drive you through to the end and leave you wanting more, and when that time comes you'll find that there's a lot more to the experience when you dig deeper and make different choices.The added offerings from the freeware version make this game more than worth the price, even to veterans of the original. Hard mode will test your skill and patience and the added modes will give players a lot more to do even after they've beaten every story path and difficulty level. The graphics and music switches are also much appreciated. There are 3 versions of the soundtrack and old and new graphics to play with, so you're sure to find a mode you like.Really, if you haven't played this indie masterpiece, you owe it to yourself as a gamer to drop whatever you're playing and hop into Cave Story.

It also doesn't help that  every time you go to beat the final, final boss you have to completely get through the hardest level and a mid-boss before you even face him. And to add insult to injury there's no save point or life refill station between the level/mid-boss and the final true boss. </rant>TL;DR: F*ck that last level for the good ending9/10 - Do the neutral ending			"

This game is just a really fun platformer shooter, good story, great music, and fun and addicting gameplay.			"

												Cave story, not a story about portals (get it? cave, cave jonson? eh me neither >_<)Where do i start besides the very fitting title? I must say this was a very surprising find for me. I mean, this game has so many reincarnations that theres no surprise that its one of the best games ive played. I honestly think this is how the indie platform began, and they did a damn good job doing it.-Exellent controlls and well responsive platforming make for a tight and enjoyable experience-Fantastic and exquisite soundtrack that makes you want to get the soundtrack and spam the hell out of grasslands-Memorable characters despite not much screentime, like king for example. Where did he get that scar from anyways?-The story is the most epic and cliffhanging experiences ive ever had. The swift and wonderful experience makes for the perfect game for a indie nerd such as myselfFinal rating for the game? well 5/5. i know its kinda generic to go with the croud but i cant bash a game so great.

												This is tied for my favorite game of all time. I've bought it on all sorts of systems, but never finished it on Steam, so mind the relative lack of hours and achievements. Cave Story was originally released free in 2004, and was made by just one man over the course of five years. Since the initial release, the game has undergone many remakes and ports. The Steam version of Cave Story is the definitive version, in my opinion. (Although the 3DS version *does* have a jukebox feature.) You can get the original version of this game from a quick Google search, and it was actually released for free. If you're not sure if this game is for you, I suggest trying out the original version of the game, playing it for an hour or two and if you like it, buy this version to play instead.			"

												Don't be fooled by my low play time. I've been a Cave Story enthusiast since before CS+ existed. I bought this game because I want money to go to Pixel, because he's a boss.What is Cave Story?Well, once upon a time a really smart guy looked at emerging computer technology and said, ""What if we use this to have fun?"" For a while things were great, but then the dreaded 'Video Games Industry' came and took all the fun away, replacing it with things like 'features' and 'innovation' and blah blah blah. Everyone was sad.Then Pixel rode in on a white horse, weilding a 20 string electric guitar and a legendary sword that shoots awesomeness and bacon. Our mighty hero dropped trou and took a fat dump on the stale industry's stupid hi-res face. Then he made the GREATEST GAME OF ALL TIME and gave it away for free. (You can get the original CS with bonus materials for free on the CS website.)And the moral of the story is: NOW YOU CAN BE A HAPPY PERSON.Cave Story recaptures the soul of classic NES and SNES era games. It does everything right that those games did, and then it does everything right that those games didn't. Every inch of the game radiates pure fun and excellent design, and you don't have to play long before you realize that this is something that someone made for the love of the game rather than to try and squeeze another nickel out of you with the latest lame gimmick. Cave Story seems like a simple metroidvania platformer, but don't be fooled. There are cool secrets hidden all over the place. The game just plays so smoothly that you don't even realize that you're making plot decisions and weapons selections as you go along. If you like to have fun then go grab the Ultimate CS pack from the website and play the game. When you've finished crying ecstatic tears of reverent joy, you'll want to buy CS+. Not for the new bonus modes, not for the remastered graphics and music, not even for the steam acheivements. You'll want to buy CS+ out of sheer gratitude.Now go forth! Be happy!			"

In fact, I bought this simply to show support for Pixel, who is amazing; the amount of time and effort that went into the original is actually rather inspiring for a one man project. That said, what I paid money for was the original content, not what came with +.I hate the new graphics and music, they're ugly to both senses. The translation, the most subjective part, to me is inferior to the original fan translation way back when. The only positive I can claim is that Curly Mode is a cute little different take on the whole game, but it's not something that can carry such a large price tag.If you love the original Cave Story and want to toss some money at Pixel, then hey, buy it like me. If you've never played Cave Story, do so with the original freeware version, because there is nothing really here for any first time players.			"

												I really enjoyed playing this game. From the beautiful pixel art and the 16-bit music, to the Metroidvania style, and the lovely characters. There are lots of moments that make you love the characters. Bad things appeared very soon into the game, as I got a map, but didn't know how to use it. Controls aren't well explained; I had to look for them in a website.There's a high amount of achievements that make the game longer, experience points, levels, powers, lots of items, cool boss fights and other things that are common in Metroidvanias.So, my conclusion is: this game is awesome. It was in the last Humble Bundle, so there are lots of people who have it but haven't tried it yet (like me some hours ago). Give it a try; you've got nothing to lose.			"

												Considering that the original game if free, if you're not going to play it for the challenge modes there is no real reason for spending $15 on this version.My time with Cave Story has not been the greatest. I found most ‘puzzles’ to be tedious and largely consisting of backtracking through levels that felt relatively lifeless.Saving constantly was required as sometimes, out of nowhere, you’d drop into a small bit of spikes that would instantly kill you, whereas the enemies in that region could barely scratch you. Either that or there wouldn’t be a save point for 15 minutes.Cave Story’s infamous weapon level system acted to me as, ""You’re doing poorly? Now you’re doing worse!”, rather than something that rewards mashing the fire button occasionally.The story was slow and rather random and something I ended up not really caring about.While advancing, apparently I explored too much before moving on and now don't have the booster shoes and killed everyone, forcing me to have to google where I was supposed to go next. I also switched out for the machine gun early on, having no idea that I'd be missing out on the best weapon in the game later.Basically, I had seen this game around for years and expected it to be a masterpiece but ended up never really having any moments of enjoyment while playing through Cave Story.

												Game won't launch on OS X 10.9, have emailed support several times without even so much as an automated courtesy response. I downloaded the original free version from cavestory dot org and at this point I highly regret having shelled out 10 bucks for this version. If you are playing on a Mac, either don't upgrade to 10.9 or DON'T BUY.P.S. You need at least 5 minutes on record to write a review, but since the game won't launch I restarted about 50 times just to post this. THAT'S how♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off I am.			"

												This game is just awesome.Cave Story+ is a great game, it has decent gameplay, and the graphics aren't too shabby either.  (Although it is not very common to find a game in a more pixelated style these days.)  One thing I like about the control scheme is that you can, well, modify which button corresponds to which control in the game.  As expected, the controls in-game are responsive, like movement and shooting.  Additionally, the game gives off a very retro style due to its pixel style.  (You can even set the graphics to ""Original"" for an even more retro experience, although I'd recommend ""New"" because they look more refined.)There is one downside to this game, though.  This game only has a Story Mode and Curly Story mode with three saves each, and a few special challenge levels.  There isn't much else to do in the game, however the difficulty modes and options to trade weapons within the game (aquiring special weapons from NPCs, there is no actual trading in the Cave Story games) do add some replay value.  There are three endings in total, and if you're trying to get a specific ending (I won't tell which one) you'll have to go through a secret stage after the ""canon"" events of the game.  The secret level has a surprise at the end..  You'll have to find out yourself if you want to know what it is.I initially was not knowledgeable that you could shoot upwards and downwards, and so I only shot left and right.  When I actually figured out about the full firing capabilities, I face-palmed and said to myself, ""This isn't Megaman, I can shoot up and down!"" (So you can shoot upwards and downwards, now you know.)If you buy this game on Steam or the other ports on 3DS and Wii, or even if you download the original version from the Internet, hopefully this review will be useful to you.9.5/10, very good game!

												In my opinion, Cave Story is the pinnacle of metroidvania platformers.Fantastic, retro inspired, graphical style.Tight, frame precise, controls.Excellent soundtrack that doesn't pund your eardrums.Plenty of replayability, multiple endings and several player choices affecting gameplay.Endearing story and cute characters.One of the few ""true"" indie games. It's made by one guy, Pixel.The original is freeware, the Cave Story+ version available on steam has multiple soundtrack and graphics options for either a retro or more modern HD feel (mix and match if you want), new game modes (speed trials and rush, etc), and controller compatibility. ~Nominated for the Steam Awards 2016 - The ""Test of Time"" Award~			"

												Cave Story is kinda supposed to be a modern classic metroidvania action platformer, but I can't really say that I found it any more than average in it's gameplay mechanics and design.  The action itself is ok, but somewhat repetitive however there are a couple mechanics that are REALLY annoying.  The weapon leveling sounds good at first but the ease with which you lose the weapon levels causes lots of trouble mid-battle, and more importantly wastes a ton of time with grinding, checkpointing and then getting going again;  which slows down the pacing considerably if you want your weapons fully leveled ... and you do, because the fights can be quite challenging.  A good deal of the challenge though comes just from the widely spaced checkpoints which are quite annoying, especially if you have to go back through the same grindy level bits and unskippable cut scenes to get back to a failed boss battle which is a shame because they would be very good battles if you weren't already in a bad mood from having to grind and cut scene your way back to them ... So that's the bad side on the better side the sound track is EXCELLENT chip tune inspired work, probably the best element of the game, and there are a lot of tracks which are well placed and distributed.  I suppose the story itself is pretty interesting and unique but leaves quite a bit unanswered, which is fine.  Conclusion: I'm not sorry that I played Cave Story+, but the amount of time that it wastes in between the good bits is sufficient to keep me from recommending it.			"

												Cave Story is lauded by many players and reviewers as a grand masterpiece of an indie game. I disagree, I think it's popularity as a novel, well constructed freeware experience inflated the reputation of this little game to the point that years later it simply doesn't hold up to the hype.Before diving in, I'll make the simple statement that $15 is severly overpriced for 3-4 hours of a sub-par experience.The story was perhaps what dissapointed me most. The story for this game is said by some (including its own store page) to be rich and original. Unfortunately, this just isn't the case. The story is an extremely straight forward ""mad scientist trying to take over the world"" narrative, with the miguided (if persistent) drive to constantly be extremely cute that a lot of Japanese media today shares. Some of the characters seem interesting, but an overall lack of meaningful characterisation makes them more like simple cartoon characters the player can immediately understand rather than authenitc people and animals. The closest game narrative to Cave Story's that I can think of is Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and that's a pretty low bar.While maybe I can excuse what I view to be an extremely typical, lackluster story, I can't forgive the dissapointing gameplay. Any allusions to the Metriodvania genre when reffering to Cave Story are misleading at best. The game does not permit, require, or encourage exploration or mystery in a major way, let alone use it as a core engagment. The fairly fast paced action-platforming does provide some challenge, but it doesn't hold up over time.The jumping and shooting simply doesn't create a large number of interesting challenges or situations during the game. After the first hour the mechanics of the game have basically played themselves out, and nothing experientially different really comes out of the gameplay, largely due to the repetitive design of enemy encounters. The weapon leveling system is novel and seems like a good idea; for the first hour or so I played very deliberately so I could get my weapons to maximum power and keep them there. However, this quickly becomes old hat and the interesting idea of this system just becomes tedious when the game gets tougher, and taking a single hit can force you to switch from attacking to recovering lost power ups over and over again.I was dissapointed by Cave Story, but I would still recommend people to try it out. The original version is available for download on the internet for free, and at that price it's worth it to play through and form your own opinions. If nothing else, the free version of Cave Story is worth playing in order to see a piece of foundational indie-gaming history.TL,DR: Doesn't live up to the hype, uninspired story and unengaging gameplay. Not worth $15 but the free version is online so I recommend trying it for yourself.			"

TL;DR: For a first-time player Cave Story is a solid title that has some nice surprises and that I would highly recommend, but as someone that played the original I'm extremely disappointed with this port not improving the flow of the game after all these years.I played the freeware version awhile back and this one is slightly more polished, and with a few things added in. When I played Cave Story the first time it was a cool little free indie title, so it's amount of depth and ideas surprised me and I was pretty forgiving with it. That being said, the issues I had with it seem to remain unchanged. The game has 3 different endings and even some secrets. Solid replayability, right? It would be, if the pacing was better.- Fetch quests...Every time, without fail, the fetch quests discourage me from wanting to play through Cave Story again. Even the first time I played, they seemed overly-convoluted just for the sake of artifically lengethening the game. The rocket portion isn't nearly as offensive as the bomb and dog-catching parts, but still annoying.- Unskippable dialogue. This is unexcusable for a re-release. At least allow me to hold down a button to speed through text. Technically you can, but you have to press a button at the end of every single chunk of text, so it really defeats the point. What's worse, there's tons of dialogue in the beginning portions of the game, so it further hinders the desire to replay Cave Story.- In typical RPG fashion, you have to interact with specific NPCs or items in a specific order to progress through the story. It feels very unintuitive and could have been handled better. Particularly with the bomb part, combined with unskippable dialogue, it really kills the pacing.- The things you have to do to get to the real final level. The amount of unintuitive BS you have to do to access the true final area is dumb. Just the whole situation with Dr. Booster falling is infuriating. Your natural instinct is to go down and save him. Ok so he dies and gives you the booster, alright. But wait how do you actually save him? By not trying to save him....no explanation given. Even worse, it's VERY difficult to not fall down, and once you do fall down, you cannot get back up without the booster, so you'd better hope you saved just beforehand or you're screwed. Nevermind all the very specfic steps involved with saving Curly Brace...- 1-hit KO spikes. I get it, it's a 2D game and they need ways to up the challenge, but this has always felt like lazy game design to me. Particularly here where I'm a robot designed for battle and yet somehow the slighest touch of a spike kills me evem after having all upgrades.- Not being able to customize the weapon quick-swap rotary is extremely inconvenient. In the middle of battle I want to change my weapon without cycling through the weapons I hardly use. If I ever want to use them again, then let me just equip them.Cave Story has a lot of cool things about it, but this mostly feels like a paid Steam port (of a free game) with slightly nicer graphics and sound, that did nothing to address some of its issues.

												A fun little indie game. Does it ""invoke classic Metroid""? No. Is it as good as Metroid? No. The only thing it has in common with Metroid is the sound when you grab a health powerup. But for what it is, it is done very well. Indeed the NES could have used more games like this rather than having roughly 90% of its games be complete garbage that I found out through many wasted weekends renting ♥♥♥♥ing trash games when I was younger. This game has great retro graphics and good sound and music, good weapons and enemies, and solid level design. Retro platformers should always be welcome to any gamer with a brain.The only thing that killed this game dead in the water for me was the last battle. You have to fight 4 bosses with 1 life bar and a life full up jar, and it's not that it is hard that gets me, just pure frustration at it's worst. Trust me, beat the first 3 bosses with 1 life bar then use the jar for the final battle. That is your only hope. If you die, you have to do it all over again and go through all the dialogue. It will test even the most dedicated persons patience. There are no words to describe the frustration it causes. Don't get me wrong, I beat it after many tries, but the infinite frustration level still remained. Besides the last battles completely ruining it for me, I liked it.			"

												This is my absolutely hands down favorite game of all time, now before you start saying ohh lannnndun u only got 2 hrs u scrub. I will say that I have spent countless hours playing this on my 3ds and cough* on my pc from the free download from a fan website. This game has a wonderful story with multiple endings, great art style and soundtrack. Imagine Mario + undertale with guns. Overall I would recommend this game to anyone who is alive, but sadly I can't recommend this game on steam because you can get it for free and legally(hopefully) from a fan website, just google cave story. But cave story+ does allow for remastered graphics and sound. but the price is a bit much for not much extra i would still recoment downloading it from the fan website and if you really like it, buy it here...... (p.s. im only 14 and not exactly a master critique, so judge accordingly)			"

Learning curve for the hell run for the beginners to this series.pros: Just like the original, it's fun as ever. the story is still the same. graphics are updated but you can change it back to ""classic"". New version of the music (not remaster version) is awesome, also the normal soundtrack is select able. New modes like boss rush and Curly Story.In short, it's a buy. if you have the original, it's still a buy with these new feature. For the those entering in this world of cave story, you will be spending money well spent on this game. also check Cave story for the wii and 3DS.			"

												EDIT/UPDATE: It has very recently come to my attention that Nicalis has decided to raise the price of the game from $9.99 to $14.99. In addition to this, it seems that Nicalis has also decided to not put the game on anymore sales, and from what I have heard, there hasn't been anything done to the game content-wise that could justify this. In other words, Nicalis has decided to raise the price just to gain more money. I can no longer see any reason to purchase this version of Cave Story, as I mentioned in my original review (which will still be posted below this paragraph) that there isn't enough content to justify a full price purchase of this particular version. Instead of purchasing this version of the game, I advise that you just go and download the freeware version of the game, as you will be saving a whole lot of money just downloading the freeware version than by buying an overpriced version of a game that, while good, isn't worth $14.00. $9.99 was already steep, but increasing the price without even adding any content to justify it is pathetic. Don't give Nicalis your money.  ORIGINAL POST: Despite starting one of the worst trends in gaming (indie gaming, to be more exact), Cave Story is actually a pretty damn good game made by just a single person. Of course, with that being said, I suggest that you play the original freeware version of the game first before using your money to buy Cave Story +, as this particular version of the game isn't much different from the original freeware game, save for some bonus content and some minor improvements. If you do decide that you want to purchase this version of the game, do wait a little to see if it goes on sale, as I don't think that there is enough content to justify a full-price purchase of this version of the game.

												This game is hugely popular, but I was disappointed. Maybe you'll like it, though, and I hope my review can help you decide.My biggest issue was that it's often called a Metroidvania, but the first 80% of the game was missing any exploration: the gameplay is very linear, even if you're doing some backtracking. The bosses and minibosses are a bit repetitive. There's very little in the way of puzzle bosses or even puzzles in general, unless you count talking to everyone until you find the right dialogue trigger.Thematically it's a bit of a mess: a hodgepodge of sci-fi and fantasy. (These two genres certainly can be combined well, but it needs to be done coherently.) The story is not that epic or original, and the dialogue could use some serious editing. The description calls the game ""massive"", and that's a definite exaggeration.The action gameplay itself is pretty good. The controls felt a bit floaty to begin with, but this gets much better when you gain the ability to hover. The leveling system for weapons is a nice touch. There's a good variety of weapons, but 95% of the time I just went with the machine gun.So if you want an action platforming game with charming retro graphics, cute soundtrack, and straightforward gameplay that you can finish in a few hours, this could easily be the game for you. If you've heard it's a massive Metroidvania or that the story is amazing, I would temper my expectations.			"

												When I say I don't recommend Cave Story+, what I really mean is, I recommend the original (and free) Cave Story instead.It's not that Cave Story+ is bad, really. There's some interesting extra stuff to try out. It's just really not worth paying for it. Updated graphics and music is nice, but the originals were fine and undeniably had a certain charm to them. The new English translation, while in some regards technically better, lacks many of the quirks that Aeon Genesis' original translation made beloved by English-speaking fans (""huzzah!""). And things like difficulty modes are essentially redundant, since there already exist established challenges that simulate harder difficulties.What would really have made for a nice Cave Story+ would be the inclusion of more flexible tools, like a level editor. That, I think, would've been well worth the money.			"

												55/10One of the best Indie games. If not THE best.It's a great mix of Metroid, Castlevania and (a little bit of) Zelda.The story, the characters, the combat system, the music, everything is just awesome.And to top it all, certain decisions grant other items or lead to different endings which provides a high replay value.Warning: Extremely addictive. I've finished it 6 times and it still isn't boring.Great extra: You can choose if you want to play the game in the original art style (as Pixel, the creator of the original game, made it) or in an enhanced style with smoother, hand-drawn-like graphics.The same goes for the soundtrack (original chiptune-like, remastered and new).

												The game is good, once you can actually play it. If you're playing on a Mac with 10.9 then you'll have to do some work in terminal to make it run - http://steamcommunity.com/app/200900/discussions/0/540732347192969561/Read the instructions carefully since you're working in terminal. If you don't want to be bothered to fix the issue yourself then don't purchase the game. Nicalis has shown to be a deadbeat when it comes to fixing the issue (six months later and 10.9 incompatiblity still persists).			"

												I dunno man. I just don't get it. There's so much postitivity for this game everywhere but its just a very simple platformer that could have been played on the NES. There are alot of great platformers on NES that were and still are alot of fun that I would rather play than this.There's no offering as far as new gameplay mechanics and the story is just too cutesy for my tastes. I do not hate this game but its just not for everyone and not for me.5/10 Its really a very simple retro retread of old gameplay mechanics. If that's what your looking for I would say give it a shot but if your on the fence at all (as I was) I'd say give it a pass. "

												As much as I want to love this game, I can't.The controls are clunky and slippery (think ""ice level"") and the difficulty isn't tuned to match that. While the story is intriguing, I can't bring myself to push through the downright frustrating and tedious gameplay.However, take this with a grain of salt. The game has a lot of character and there are plenty of valid reasons to love it, it's just not for me in the slightest.Oh and the music is super good. tl;dr Watch a let's play and listen to the OST in your spare time.

												OSX version has been broken for 3 years. It's not hard to get it working, but I shouldn't have to do ANYTHING. I got this during the winter sale and didn't bother to look in to whether it would work until it was too late to get a refund, or I would have done so. Shame on you, Nicalis. You're a crap development farm that managed to stumble on some of the most excellent indie properties out there. Don't buy this game, just download the original legal freeware version from Pixel and donate directly to him. This version adds very little to the original game and in some instances makes it worse. Nicalis does not deserve your money.			"

												I heard great things about this game so, I went in with high expectations. My first mistake was using the keyboard to play, don't do that, use a ♥♥♥♥ing controller. I didn't get very far in this and unfortunately I don't ever want to.Cavestory poorly starts players off in a setting where they dont know what they are doing. Now i'm ok with being thrown into the action but, cavestory did it in a way without any guidence what so ever.This goes for controls (partly my bad), the level design and the plot. You can't attack right off when you have enemies in front of you implying that ther'es some way to defeat them and there was no clue, no hint that I had to dodge these ♥♥♥♥ers for 5 good minutes until I found my gun.It left me feeling like I was doing something wrong and that's not a good feeling for the player to have at the start of game.The music is well done and has many variations (original, remastered and new) but, i felt it was a little generic if not cookie cut, same goes for the graphics. Maybe that's the point but, meh.Controls for the game I felt were akward and clunky, the keys were not even rebindable. Again my bad for not using a controller but, hey, you released it for pc, do your ♥♥♥♥ing job. Even with a  controller i'm like 90% sure the clunkiness wouldn't have improved.The story (as little as I got in the first...village?) thus far was uninvolving as if the character didn't have any connection to anything around him at all. (Is that the point? If so...why?)The difficulty isn't what makes you die in this game, it's the fact that you have to die, memorize certain traps or suprise enemy locations and redo it, very frustrating. The enemy designs just seemed so half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I never want this to be the kind of standard for any indie developer, ever, sorry.3 out of 10 peashooters "

												This is not a good PC port...of a free game that's already on PC. The original game, a grand freeware game by Pixel, was light, functional and compatible. This, one of many ports responsible mainly by Nicalis, is none of those.Faulty gamepad support, crash prone, lack of resolution options (including any widescreen support, which the Wii version was able to [poorly] do), tacked on extra modes (the difficulty modes are self-imposable), and the, ""so-bland-it's-meh,"" soundtracks and script of the oher rehash ports. On the plus side, this is Cave Story: a wonderful action platformer. On the case for this specific version, at least the graphics are decent and it does include a cut area, but, ultimately, it's not worth spending money over.This all happened in a manner of minutes. A terrible job on behalf of Nicalis.Stick with the original version (it's FREE, nothing to lose), or, if you really wanted to buy Cave Story, the 3DS version would be the only one I'd reccomend purchasing (all features from CS+, portability, optional 3D, supports proper 16:9, stable, $10). If you want to support Pixel (you should), go buy 10 copies of Azarashi instead.			"

												Everything that made the freeware publish of this game what it was is not improved or expaned upon in this Steam port. You can argue and debate about how you can toggle off the extra things like the (awful) remixed music but that's avoiding the point. The point is that the very worthwhile experience of this game is available for free and this port does nothing to expand upon the (rather high) benchmark that it's predecessor set.A quick google search will show you how you can install the freeware publish of this game and a english patch (if needed). I would strongly recommend doing that, it is a very well-made gem of a game.			"

												listen, before you let your fanboyism lash out at me, just listen.this game is a love letter to difficult games yes, but objectively it clings to video game tropes that really need to die. I really don't mind difficulty in a game, if you even briefly browse my profile you can see that, however there is a major difference between fun difficulty and frustrating difficulty. let me explain in detail...i really don't appreciate seperate endings that depend on arbatrary actions, IE having to make a jump that most would deem impossible with permenant reprocautions.i really don't appreciate being given choices that downgrade my character for 40% of the game with absolutely no idea before-hand IE being given the choice of choosing a different gun with no option of going back.I really don't appreciate having to replay huge sections of the game, because the creator refuses to put an extra checkpoint in because he insists on clinging to archaic game design. ghosts and goblins may be your childhood, but let's face the facts, that game would not have suffered, nor your experience, if it had the option to save.but lastly, i really don't appreciate jumping through many arbitrary loops, so that i can get a non-♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending, only to come to a nigh-impossible set of obstacles and 4 bosses. listen, i know you think you feel much more satisfied knowing you beat hell, and 4 bosses, but I challenge you to think about something... would your experience REALLY have suffered if there was a checkpoint after hell? or after the first boss? or the second? or the third? would you really have thrown down the controller and been ""AHH ♥♥♥♥! AND I WAS HAVING SO MUCH FUN BEING CHALLENGED""i really doubt it. but for those of us who memorized patterns for hell, and for the three of the four bosses, and still die, it's frustrating, its assinine and it. is. not. fun.i would love to reccomend this game for the first half, which is fun and challenging and almost worth the price of admission, but once you hit the wall of rediculous challenge, only to be let down by a sub-par ending, and then finding out that a much shinier ending lies behind 7 impregnable doors... i just can't ask anyone else to go through it.this game is not horrible, but it is not the glorified masterpiece that everyone insists it is. do yourself a favor and stick to super meat boy.

												I was enjoying this game until I hit a difficult boss fight that was preceded by a long cut-scene. If you fail this fight, you have to hit the skip button more than fifty times to continue. This easily fixable problem is unacceptable and unforgiveable. I rarely give up on a game, but this was too obnoxious. Even if I were to persevere, it sucked any enjoyment I could have had out of the experience and made me dread what other mind numbing tedium the game might subject me to.			"

Not because I didn't enjoy it but because they place items and objects in such hard to find places near impossible. I quit because they placed me after the Warehouse boss (T)  and I had four hearts left in the Labarinth i was extremely difficult to get to the point where the stones moved but died then just decided to give up it has a severe lack of save points making dying frustrating I have never saved so many times in my gaming life than i this game. When you die the enemies respawn back again making progress impossible.Wish it was easier because the story had so much good going for it.Again this game is near impossible and a waste of time because you will just get nowhere and keep on repeating yourself time and time again.

												Running this on a $5000+ custom built pc that'll be adequate for many years and yet the game stutters during cutscenes. Skyrim and many other late 2012 games can run at 120+ FPS consistently on max settings but this game doesn't. Not to mention there's tons of lag whilst playing normally. Horrible port. Nicalis is full of terrible programmers. It's a shame I can't experience this gem on steam. I'll have to resort to the inferior non pc versions. ♥♥♥♥ Nicalis, ♥♥♥♥ them up their stupid asses.

												Cave Story is a 2D platformer/shooter that's sort of like Mega Man or Metroid at a glance, but feels very different. This is one of my favorite games, and the Steam version is the best version I know of. It has a lot of different options, including which graphics style it uses and which version of the sound track (both of which are great, by the way).     This is a simple game, but simple doesn't mean easy; it can be a challenge, or it can be a brutally hard pain in the thumb if you want it to be. There's an easy mode, but even that doesn't hold your hand. This game is made for people who can put up with losing, because it will win sometimes. You get several weapons, so there are different ways to play, and you can shoot in more than one direction, which you will be glad for very often. Also, you CAN play with a keyboard, but I REALLY recommend a controller. I need it for my playstyle to work at all, and I assume other people will, too.     Graphics are subjective, but they're not bad in this game. You can even choose which one of two totally different art styles you like more, so only the extremely picky should have a problem there.     There's replay value in the form of different ""paths"" to take in the game, a few choices with massive consequences, three endings and three difficulty modes. There's also extra content in the Steam version. There's an extra level, ""Curly Story"" where you play as a different character and some other stuff I can't remember right now. Finally, this game has its share of secrets.     There are parts of the game that might seem unfairly hard, which is always a flaw. There aren't many, but there are a few. There's also the fact that this game is relatively hard in general. If you want something hard, play this on hard mode, but there isn't really a perfect easy mode. The easy mode is still challenging, especially at the end. I can't think of many other flaws, but there are ways it could have been better, too. Cave Story FEELS kind of short, for example. I think that's partly because of unusal pacing. There's a boss you have to fight near the end that feels a bit more like a mid-game boss. Maybe that's just me, but I didn't expect it to end when it did.PROS:-Customizable difficulty-Choice of graphics-Choice of music-Interesting and enjoyable story that I can't find a way to talk about without ruining the experience-Extra content and LOTS of replay value-Fast paced platforming and shooting :D-Sort of an adventure game on the side-All around hard game, which isn't even completely lost in easy mode (pro for some)CONS:-Some difficulty that comes from the wrong reasons-All around hard game, which isn't even completely lost in easy mode (con for some)-Dated graphics, which can be changed, but maybe not saved for everyone     I would recommend Cave Story to anyone unless they completely hated either platformers or challenges. If you don't hate them, then I'd say this is a great choice.			"

												Cave Story+ is a wonderful game you can play over and over again; each time you can choose to challenge yourself with harder difficulty or get that secret ending. A game I would recommend for those who looks for a never endning challenge.			"

The most annoying thing however is the stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that can lock you out of parts of the game.

												Very fun adventure / platformer in the same vein as Metroid. Advance your weapons and stats as you go through the story, and there are plenty of hidden powerups and bonuses along the way.Definitely worth at least two playthroughs of the story to see everything there is to offer. The game is also decently challenging - actually pretty tough in some parts - without being unfair, and the storyline has some very well written characters.Besides a few minor nitpicks (one boss character in particular is re-used a lot, and so it's just tedious by the end), this is arguably the best ""indie"" game on the market.10/10 would buy			"

												Cave Story is a game created by one man that goes by ""Pixel."" Words can't even begin to describe his work.It's amazing to think that one man created such an in depth game. This game has to be one of the single greatest games I've played. The game has a strange and mysterious story, one that will make you think. Not only is there so many different achievements, but there are three different endings! Some of these achievements require you to do a certain ending or even just replay the game. Which gives it a good replay value. There's also challenges to race against other players for the best time. If you are a completionist, or a just looking for a good 2D shooter, then this game is for you.			"

												Cave Story is addicting; that is the only way to describe it. The story is extremely good, and it has several decisions and sidequests that would ultimately determine the kinds of tools and weapons you use. The enemies are always fun to battle, the level designs are well thought out, and the level-up mechanics are like nothing I've ever seen before. The side characters: memorable. The bosses: incredible. The dialouge: great. I only wish that there were more games like this. The game was so good, I was only disappointed that it had to end. I'll definitely be replaying it some time soon, so I definitely recommend this game.			"

												Prepare yourself for a game that harkens back to metroid, castlevania, and megaman.  This game was incredible. I got it as part of an indie bundle a while back and played it on my laptop whenever I was away from the house and felt like gaming.  Not only is the presentation great, gameplay solid, balanced, progressive, and fun, but it's a challenge. Most of the bosses you'll figure out the first or second time, but later on the difficulty ramps up and really tests your skills.  There are also bonus levels unlocked by preforming specific tasks or playing on Hell difficulty.  I adore this game and cannot give it enough praise.  I wish more games were like this one.  Somebody somewhere, or a few people, did their job very very well and it shows. This is a shining example of proper and well implemented game design. You will enjoy this game, without a doubt, so go buy it.			"

												I have to say, going into this game, I didn't know what to think. I thought it would be another run of the mill indie platformer. I was wrong, when I realized what it was, I was amazed to find some of the things hidden below the skin of this game. It is mean yeah, as in if you make one wrong move in the story and save, you have to replay the entire game to try to get the best ending..but I like that. It gives a true challenge and sets a goal for the player to follow.  It makes you have feelings for some of the characters you meet in the game, and makes you want to help them.The music:The music is amazing. I could listen to it all day, and I have before, its a well made soundtrack that just always has a better song waiting right behind the one before.The controls:The platforming is a little difficult, because you gain momentum, and when you jump and land on a one block platform, you could easily slide off and fall to your death in a pit of bloody spikes. But other than that, you have pretty tight controls that makes it feel like a challenge to dodge whatever is thrown at you.The bosses: The bosses in this game all have this certain quirk to them that just has to make you smile. The earlier bosses have a pattern that is easy to follow, but after that, the real challenge sets in, and its all skill to beat bosses. I love them, and personally I think they are what makes a huge part of this game fun.Cave story+ is a must buy. It starts slow, but makes it all worth it in the end.Spoliers ahead:Some extra stuff I found:If you find curly's panties in her room it unlocks her story, making her a playable character, and adding another story!If you go for the best ending you will reach hell, which is the hardest part in the game. Its nearly impossible unless you train endlessly, because its a 40 minute segment with 1 life and a ""Friend"" at the end..   "

												An amazing experience, Cave Story plays its cards perfectly. The story is told in a minimalistic fashion but manages to convey a darker and rather deep plot with relatively little text and quite a bit of visual storytelling. Gameplay is also simple and is definitely based off of metroid. The weapon leveling concept is an interesting little way of making players want to avoid tanking hits and seeing each weapon's various levels was something that I looked forward to each time. The music is simple, catchy, and just fits perfectly. Being a platformer, control is important and cave story excels in this providing simple controls with satisfying precision. The look of the game is charming and the simple sprite-based style works extremely well for a simple game with simple charm			"

												It's quite an adventure if you have the determination to beat a few of the later bosses.  The game can be pretty fast paced at times but that's what makes it fun.  While I was playing this one of my friends described it as somewhat ""Bullet hell"" and at certain moments it feels like it.  While you move through the levels you are always trying to upgrade your weapons to level 3 by collecting those golden triangles.  My own adventure was cut short when I left the island on the dragon.  Cave Story is a seemingly simple game but a casual player will want to restart once they learn that simple decisions like taking a gun or talking to certain people at certain times will change their ending.  This will sound crazy but I haven't even finished my second playthrough and I'm already planning on restarting so I can save a character and get the best ending.  I really love this game, it fosters a sense of adventure in such a simple way.			"

												It's Cave Story with updated graphics and sound. It has translation errors, but that doesn't detract much from the story that you probably already know. To the uninitiated, cave story is a sidescrolling, high difficulty shooter with a whimsical style that makes it hard to get mad at the game for filling you up with bullets. It has a bit of replay value with three endings that, for the most part, are determined through the second half of the game.Dying would be punishing by today's standards, with no lives system and only the ability to reload. It's a small thing to overlook considering how spoiled we are by quick loads.			"

												Did you like Metroid? Or Castlevania? Cave Story+ is a fantastic Metroidvania-style 2D plattformer, with a wonderful and mysterious story, fun charakters and easy to learn, not very hard to master shooting gameplay. The game itself is short enough, 4 hours, if this isn't the first game you have ever played. But then there's an alternative ending plus a lot of side quests, you may not have done the first time playing Cave Story+. Its' charming 8Bit graphics as well as the 8Bit sounds and music will definitely get you, even if you're only 1% the kind of nostalgic videogamer type. I sure am and I strongly recommend Cave Story+. The additional challenge levels may be fun, but after the main game, it's just not entertaining enough. Rather replay the game!			"

												I say I recommend this game, but I say so with a warning.Don't get me wrong, the gameplay is smooth, the weapons are fun to use, the platforming is challenging but not too frustrating, and the story is original, creative and enjoyable. There are many different enemies, all with different attack patterns, and all the bosses are fun to beat.9 times out of 10 I would recommend this game to friends.However, there's one issue - the endings.I'm the type of person that doesn't really want to look things up while I play a game. I want to play the game, try my best to find all the secrets/powerups/etc., and if I miss a few, I'm fine with it.However, if Cave Story, there are certain points in the game where if you do one thing over another, or pick up one item over another, etc. it will change the entire course of the game.I, not using the internet and not knowing this, played the game as it seemed I should play it, and got to the ""normal"" ending.And frankly, the ""normal"" ending is depressing and disappointing.Upon looking it up after beating the game, I discovered there were two more satisfying, exciting endings to the game, that I had missed by doing X during the story, and I wasn't about to go play the entire story again.Cave Story's mechanics are good and the regular story is great until you get to the end.If you're fine with looking up walkthroughs and secrets as you play a game, I highly recommend this game.If not, I might think twice about getting Cave Story, as the ending will disappoint you.

There are also two graphical modes, retro and new, but they still feature the pixel art style. This game introduces a new twist on an old mechanic, levels. In Cave Story, every weapon has three levels, each getting more powerful as you progress. However, the plot has been done before in other formats, and isn't particularly interesting. The entire game is basically a shoot-'em-up, musically intense, unique game that will keep you playing until the very end. 11/10 must play classic.			"

												The 'remastered' graphics are okay. The 'remastered' music loses a good deal of the impact of the original. What really won me over was the top-to-bottom reskin they did for the Steam Christmas sale - it was totally unexpected and absolutely adorable. Other noteworthy additions: Difficulty levels (Easy/Classic/Hard), the option to switch between the remastered version and the original, a re-tuned translation, achievements.Is that worth $10? Probably not, it's the same game you downloaded for free years ago. If it's on sale, might as well grab it, though.			"

This game feels like an old NES masterpiece that you somehow forgot. The game-play is tight and fun, and there's a lot of content here for something so retro. For anyone who loved the 80s gaming era, this belongs in your collection.			"

												You're a boy who finds himself in a network of caves, armed only with a ""pea shooter."" Your mission is to save a race called the ""Mimigas"" from being used as weapons of mass destruction by a deranged and psychotic doctor, whose power runs wild courtesy of a powerful cursed crown. Run, shoot, and jump your way through the 2-D adventure of a lifetime as you explore and experiment with a simple yet deep campaign.For those who already have this game down to a science, there is additional content in the form of new levels and remastered graphics and music, as well as a retranslated script courtesy of NiCOLAS. This is, without a doubt, the greatest, most influential, inspirational, and most fully realized indie game in recent history. If your yourself are an indie developer, or are a fan of good retro video games, you owe it to yourself to experience this game to its fullest.			"

												Cave Story+ has to be one of the best indie games here on steam, boasting new and classic graphics as well as the Classic (Original), New (Wii), and Remastered (3DS) soundtracks AND challenges.It also includes Curly Story, where you play as Quote's partner, Curly.Though this game is rather good, it really IS just the original, free version, of the game with just new graphics and soundtracks, you won't really find yourself switching from the original one.Also most of the challenges are just mods that you can install on the original version.That being said I PERSONALLY give Cave Story+ an 8/10.It's a great remake of the original version that lets you relive the old days of gaming.One of the best games that wasn't on the SNES.

The weapon system is amazing, the upgraded graphics of this verson are good, The bosses are challenging, and the music is amazing. You can even play a verson of this game legally for free, just google ""Cave Story"". If you don't have a problem with 2D games or platformers, there is no reason why you shouldn't at least check this game out. Also, it's almost certain that you will love this game if you like 2D Metroid games or retro games in general.			"

												Pay money for a freeware game. Sounds odd? Yes, but you don't just get the (otherwise free) game, you also get an updated soundtrack and high resolution graphics that look really nice. If you value the old translation (this one got an official English one that doesn't match the classic/third party one), then it's able to fix that too (hints can be found on the Steam forums). If you're not sure, look at YouTube or download the freeware version to give it a try. It's really nice and feels a lot like a mix of Metroid and classic Kirby games.			"

												I say I recommend this game, but I say so with a warning.Don't get me wrong, the gameplay is smooth, the weapons are fun to use, the platforming is challenging but not too frustrating, and the story is original, creative and enjoyable. There are many different enemies, all with different attack patterns, and all the bosses are fun to beat.9 times out of 10 I would recommend this game to friends.However, there's one issue - the endings.I'm the type of person that doesn't really want to look things up while I play a game. I want to play the game, try my best to find all the secrets/powerups/etc., and if I miss a few, I'm fine with it.However, if Cave Story, there are certain points in the game where if you do one thing over another, or pick up one item over another, etc. it will change the entire course of the game.I, not using the internet and not knowing this, played the game as it seemed I should play it, and got to the ""normal"" ending.And frankly, the ""normal"" ending is depressing and disappointing.Upon looking it up after beating the game, I discovered there were two more satisfying, exciting endings to the game, that I had missed by doing X during the story, and I wasn't about to go play the entire story again.Cave Story's mechanics are good and the regular story is great until you get to the end.If you're fine with looking up walkthroughs and secrets as you play a game, I highly recommend this game.If not, I might think twice about getting Cave Story, as the ending will disappoint you.

												The music is phenominal, with three different styles to choose from. Original, remastered, or new, all with their own respective charms. There are also two graphical modes, retro and new, but they still feature the pixel art style. This game introduces a new twist on an old mechanic, levels. In Cave Story, every weapon has three levels, each getting more powerful as you progress. However, the plot has been done before in other formats, and isn't particularly interesting. The entire game is basically a shoot-'em-up, musically intense, unique game that will keep you playing until the very end. 11/10 must play classic.			"

The story is pretty interesting as well. I'd recommend picking this one up. If you don't have cash to spare, you can find the original for free on the net. But, it's worth buying Cave Story Plus for the remixed music, improved graphics, and compatibility with Steam.			"

The gameplay is solid and a story seems to be present. Overall, it really just feels like a classic metroidvania. Simply put: I like it.			"

												I found this game to be very fun. Remniscent of Metroid, the game has you exploring a vast, charming world that grows more interesting as you progress through the game. The gameplay is also pretty addictive, so pick this up if you're craving an action platformer. Note that hard mode means that most everything kills you in one hit, if you're lucky maybe two, so try it if you want a challenge.			"

Its been only a couple of days now, and I already have 7 hours logged on it.  The story line is super fantastical and at least a little heart-warming. Plus this game will kick your♥♥♥♥♥with some tricky platforming, difficult bosses, and many terrible one-hit K-O's that will leave you facepalming or rage quitting, but you will certainly come back. Not for the faint of heart gamers, it's hard (even on easy) but it is so much fun. I definitely love this game.Easily 10/10			"

												Quite possibly one of the best indie games to be ever released on the PC, later on the Nintendo 3DS as well.You play as a young man who wakes up in a mysterious cave without any memory of who he is or why he is there.Soon he meets a group of rabbit-like creatures called Mimigas who are being tormented by a mad doctor.This mad doctor is kidnapping the Mimigas and are using them for horrific experiments and he is planning something big and horrible.It is up to the young man to help the Mimigas fight back and save them, as well as several other characters, from the evil mad doctor while also discovering more and more about the cave itself.A must buy for anyone who just love retro-style games like this.

												I found Cave Story to be one of the better games I've played. With retro graphics and sound, it does feel more like the nostalgic games that inspired the creator to make this game. The action sequences scale at a somewhat good pace and the storyline is easy to follow, even if it raises more questions than answers. However, the Steam release does not have enough features to warrent the $10.00 price tag. Furthermore, the Steam release inhibits the ability to mod the game, although it is still possible. Graphics: 8/10 -Although many of the tile sets and enemy graphics are varied, in a few areas, the bleed together a little bit, making it harder to see.Sound: 9/10 -One of the better soundtracks I've heard, though not perfect.Gameplay: 7/10 -The controls are a little clunky. This extends to a jet-pack item late in the game. The challenge spikes a bit later in the game, too.Storyline: 9/10 -Despite a lack of proper foreshadowing at times (possibly due to being lost in translation), the storyline is flawless otherwise.Replay Value: 6/10 -You could run through the game with varying loadouts by the end, but there is no replay value beyond that. Mods add a variety of challenges, though the majority of them have much higer difficulty than the end of the game.Overall, this game recieves 8/10.			"

												Cave Story is a wonderfull game. The story is empowering yet heartrending at times, the difficulty curve is smooth (if you play with no guides), both versions of the graphics are spot on, and I can't stop listening to the music. The game handles like an epic cross between metroid and mega-man. The controlls are customisable and you can even plug in a USB controler. With all the chalenges and achevements there is no reason to get this game, even If you already have another version. I only have one problem: the ""new"" music is just awfull. Stick with origonal for an 8-bit feel and remastered for 16-bit. Casual or hardcore, if you wan't to see just how good an Indie game can be, play this now. For what I got out of this I would pay at least twice as much.			"

												Cave Story is a classic call back to NES and SNES era gaming. With elements from the exciting Metroid series in it's early days. With Cave Story+ you get new content, updated sprite work, and the remix of all of the original songs. Traverse treacherous terrain and combat strange little beasts to power up your weapons as you uncover the secrets behind your character, the Island, and the mysterious Doctor.			"

												Yes, it's Cave Story. Yes, you can get the original free from the cave story website. Yes, this one costs money.And yes, this game is worth it.Just like the original, you follow the story playing as an unnamed (until later) hero. This game features one of the most iconic stories in any indie games, and it is no doubt that this game is arguably one of the most recognised adventure games ever. Shooting enemies and levelling up your weapons feel rewarding, and the boss battles can be fun yet challenging. Honestly, I really liked the graphics too. It felt so clean and easy to look at, and in my opinion it was a big improvement from the original. Of course, this game allows you to play the game just as if it's the old version - music and the graphics can be changed to suit the experience you want.Unfortunately, like the old game, this game can be a tad bit taxing if you want to get the best results possible - if you don't play it the 'correct' way, it won't allow you to do certain tasks. However, you can always experiment with various branches of story by making new saves. Backtracking is also not ideal for people who want a variety of gameplay, because there are some amounts of them.TL;DR: Get this game. I guarantee you will enjoy it.			"

												There is a lot to recommend about Cave Story, and some issues. I loved the original, thought it was great and picked Cave Story+ up. Having replayed it quite a few sore spots stick out.1. Unskippable scenes before boss fights. There is no excuse for this anymore. There's a lot of dialogue and it doesn't move very fast.2. Not many checkpoints. There are definitely some areas where you'll die and have to replay quite a bit. This is especially bad near the end of the game.3. Grindy sections. Near the end of the game all your weapons are returned to level 1. Additionally the platforming is pretty brutal. Fortunately (or unfortunately) there are unlimited bats. This means all too often you will end up killing bats to replenish your health and recharge your weapons 1 tick at a time (and those bats are sloooow). It's also a section where you end up fighting a mini-boss with no save point. So if you don't beat him you have to do it all over again.It's a classic. No question, and there are a lot of secrets and branching story paths that make it re-playable, along with some super hard sections if your after the ""true"" ending. This is not a run-and-gun platformer, it's a precision platformer with shooting involved.			"

												A masterfully-crafted game by only one person, Cave Story features an enriched story line, plenty of action, and charming graphics. I would've liked to see a little bit more challenging sections off the beaten path in the main adventure for extra goodies, but as it is this game is an excellent mark on the Metroidvania genre.

												I love the music in this game!  The arrangement from Cave Story + is just so good, I want to play this soundtrack all the time now.  Originally this game came out in 2004 as Doukutsu Monogatari and was a little freeware job created by Daisuke Amaya, also know as Pixel.  He developed, designed and programmed the whole beast by himself and it took five years to boot. The game grew in popularity and has since been ported to everything under the sun, even calculators.  (They apparently do a lot more since my Ti-86 back in college.)  If you're going to play this,  do it with a controller because I could never see beating those last four bosses with just the keyboard....unless you're a Jedi...			"

While the graphics quality was not what it is in Cave Story + and Cave Story 3D, or something like Megaman X or Call of Duty: Black Ops, it was all amazing and fun. Now with Cave Story +, the graphics have increased in quality, have more modes like Curly Mode and Challenge Mode,  Options settings,  is more portable compared to the in-browser version, now has a difficulty setting, and is all around amazing. An improvement on something already great, that's what this is. I recommend this game for all audiences, but this game can get difficult if you want to get the best ending.			"

												Ah, Cave Story. Our tale is sad but beautiful. I never honestly got past the part with the dogs but if anyone has a strategy let me know! Anyway, this has got to be the most creative, yet intriguing games I've ever played what with it's embrassive story, it's quaint art and very catchy music. This indie game was all made by one man so props to him. If you want the full review go to youtube.com and type in the search bar: somecallmejohnny Cave Story, it's by some call me johnny titled: Johnny vs. Cave Story, he does great reviews as well by the way. I truly haven't dived balls deep into this yet. If there's anything wrong with it is that it's very difficult to me so it's not a casual gamer's delight, but it's not so ♥♥♥♥ing hard it will haunt you for the rest of your dreams like Ghosts n' Goblins. So with that said all in all I give this game 4/5 stars, I wish that the controls on teh PC weren't as wonky and that steam would put this up for free as it's free on the publisher of this game's official website. If you get this great game, good luck and have fun!P.S. Be very careful about the choices you make in the game, it WILL AFFECT YOUR GAMEPLAY ON A IGNORMOUS LEVEL. Be very smart with what you do.			"

This game has to be one of the single greatest games I've played. The game has a strange and mysterious story, one that will make you think. Not only is there so many different achievements, but there are three different endings! Some of these achievements require you to do a certain ending or even just replay the game. Which gives it a good replay value. There's also challenges to race against other players for the best time. If you are a completionist, or a just looking for a good 2D shooter, then this game is for you.			"

												I never really understood the hype for the game, so I gave it a shot. I downloaded the free version of it ages ago but never really had any impetus to finish it, until I traded in a duplicate copy of Super Meat Boy on Steam for CS+. I played it on the original graphics and sound mode and thought it was all right, but not spectacular. I remember hearing how it was supposed to be an amazing or worthwhile metroidvania, but it felt too linear, too talky and I didn't feel the items were utilized to their fullest extent. The final boss gauntlet felt like a needless waste of my time and I didn't really get a feel for the art style or the Japanesque-ness of the game either.I don't feel this game warrants a ""no"" recommendation, though. I'm not too crazy about it and think it is totally overhyped, but it's not a *bad* game.			"

												A very nice and fun Metroidvainia. There's no real permanent weapon upgrades. Killing enemies will give you experience with that weapon, which will level it up and make it stronger. But If you get hit, you lose experience. The game encourages skill, but is not cruel if you're having a bad day. Cave Story also has some lite humor. It wont win any comedic awards, but will get a decent chuckle out of ya.While I haven't made it too far, the story is interesting enough to keep your attention, but again, it won't win any awards(from what little I've seen).Definately worth picking up. Keep in mind that there is a free version on the internet, and that the ""Plus"" version on steam is merely a very nice HD texture pack, plus some bonus content. Also ""Plus"" has the ""Official"" translation, while the free version is done by fans. Don't let that fool you though, the Free translation is top notch.			"

The gameplay is spot on, especially when you map it to a controller. The only downside to the game would be its intense difficulty ramp near the end and the fact that gamepad support isn't native. Cave Story is a game you MIGHT beat, and for that I highly recommend it.			"

												Oh Cave Story, you make me so mad but I love you so. Retro indie platformers are as numerous and iffy as Zombie Survival Strategies among nerds, but this is not only the one that probably inspired them all, it's still the best of the bunch that I've played. The shooting and platforming is fun and challenging, especially once you get the machine gun, which shoots bullets so hard it rockets your little body into the air, giving you a nice form of psuedo-flying. On top of all that, it has an involving, well written story. That said, t's challenging to the point where it often feels unfair, though not undoable. Unfortunately, the toughest parts are almost always preceeded by a lengthy, unskippable cutscene, a problem that the + edition apparently never fixed. The plus edition only adds some challenge modes as far as I can tell, so I don't think it's worth ten dollars since the freeware is still out there and easily, legally available. But if you see it on sale for a buck or two, buy it			"

												Cave story is one of these games everyone should have played at least once.Intuitive shooter mechanics, great story, suberb art, polished to the max and filled with cuteness.This game is what definied indies, and how they should look!The revised version has a lot of good stuff, new graphics (you can still choose the old though), remastered soundtrack, and challenges and a revised menu.Also the christmas update adds additional cuteness and you can see that love was put into it.One of the best if not the best indie game in the world!What are you waiting?

												If you're a fan of the old school 2d classic side scrollers such as Metriod or Castlevania, then is this the game for you. This amazing little indie game starts off a little confusing with the player being thrown into some sort of hostage situation but the moment the game begins to pick up the pace you can tell the game is going to be good. The game can be frustrating at parts, similar to the frustration one might have had with the old 2d side scrollers mentioned before, but the overall gaming experience is quite refined and well worth a play through. My gameplay time was seven hours but each hour was filled with great gaming goodness. The retro 8-bit score of the game must also be mentioned, as it definitely set the mood for many scenes and battles in the game perfectly.8.5/10.0			"

												Practically an Indie masterpiece. Well, it's not Indie anymore, technically, but that hardly matters now. Everything about this game is superb: the gameplay, the music, the graphics/artstyle, the story, etc. etc. Liked Mega Man? Enjoyed Metroid? Thought Castlevania was bomb? Do you enjoy robots and bunny people? THEN PICK UP THIS GAME! It's just so great!The only con is that the game is a little short, but considering that it was all originally made by one person, the length is actually not that bad, not to mention there is a ton of replayability in it in story choices, multiple endings, achievements, and challenges, plus it never really feels short - you'll see what I mean when you play it.All this awesomeness, this piece of gaming gold, in a nice $10 package?

												I’m pretty burnt out on the whole indie retro fad but I enjoyed this game. Where I think a lot of these retro games go wrong is when they implplement shoddy controls like the NES games of yore. That makes it not fun to play. I’m pleased to say that Cave Story has excellent controls, though, and is a lot of fun to play.This reminded me of old NES games such as Metroid but felt like an improvement because it controls so well. The final boss fight was a challenge to beat, but not because it was cheap or frustrating. It was merely difficult and required some skill to get through.I wish more retro games would stick to Cave Story’s formula and go with fun over frustration as a game mechanic.			"

And by cryptic I mean cryptic to the level you might rage over it, because you missed something and need to start the game over again from the beginning.Well, maybe it's not the worst thing, because the level of difficulty on final stages of this game (before the good ending) is just crazy.Other than that, the only downside is that there's no sequel.

												Proof that a great game isn't about fancy graphics or complex missions, Cave Story is a spit-polished Metroidvania with gripping platforming and power-ups. Despite the cutesy characters, the storyline is darker than expected, which is welcomed. Yes, the graphics are retro, but that's part of the charm - it's not just for those looking for nostalgia.

												I had played this game prior to it being released on Steam.  I must say that I really enjoyed it.  Basically this is a Metroid-vania 2D explore, fight, and solve puzzles in a simi-open world.  It has small and large boss battles and a decent story for a 2D action/adventure.  I did find myself lost a couple of times because I missed some tiny hole in the wall, but beyond that it does a good job of pacing and teaching you.The bad part is that at times the controls felt slow for movement and othertimes fast::  This may have been an issue with the version I played, but jet packs are scary fast and walk is super slow.I would totally recomend this to anyone who loved action/adventure games on the Nintendo/Genisis era of games.  I had a blast and really want more after I beat it.... then I found out there is a secret lair and super secret last boss after you beat it if you find all the secrets.			"

												Cave Story is a wonderful little game. The graphics and audio are charming, and compliment each other well. The characters and dialogue are pleasant and fun. The platforming  is very good, but not quite perfect. Variety of fun weapons that ""level up"" individually when you pick up XP from enemies, which is a very fun mechanic. However, when you take damage, your current weapon loses XP... in later areas this happens quickly, and can cripple your player by instantly downgrading your level 3 weapon to a level 1, rendering it mostly ineffective. Some metroid style elements that require you to get an ability, and go back to previous areas to get to new areas. Boss encounters are repetitive, and save spots can be poorly placed, requiring you to go through long areas again, or watch long cutscenes repeatedly if you die. Overall a great game, very fun, highly recommended. Looking forward to a sequel.			"

												Cave Story, by this time an era, while not the best, remains an ejonyable platforming game, with small Metroidvania motifs. It remains an important game due to the fact that it demonstrated the high quality production values a (back then) freeware game could achieve. It slowly introduced a fair amount of people to the indie game community, which further grew with games like Aquaria, Braid, Darwinia, among others. It was the foundation of the modern indie game.Aso for the game itself, it totally bears some merits on its 16-bit era styled graphics, its great weapon diversity, a solid-if-simple storyline, entertaining characters, relatively big world, and catchy chiptune music. While I can't say it is necesarily a must play in this time and age anymore, it remains an important piece of history on indie games, and an entertaning and solid small game.			"

												The original indie platformer, designed to prove that you don't need a huge budget to make a real good game. It succeeded. Cavestory is a beautifully simple platformer about an android who wants to save a floating island of rabbit people. He does so w/ the help of fun characters like Balrog, Professor Booster & Curly Brace. It's a cartoonish & colorful adventure w/ a real heart & soul. Tons of hidden content & several different endings.If you're unsure if you want to buy this game or not, the original freeware version is still available for download @ http://www.cavestory.org/  It doesn't have some of the other modes & features that this version does of course, but pretty much everything in the normal game is there.Edit 1/17/16:The game crashes when completing the challenges due to it trying to access non-existent leaderboards. That makes my recommendation a bit shakey.			"

												I think that Cave Story is a great game with a wonderful, and deep, story that adds heavily to the amazing gameplay. It’s a fun retro-style platformer game with a stunning soundtrack and loveable characters. I’ve spent a long time playing Cave Story from different points in the game on my Wii, on the free version of Cave Story, and a little on Cave Story+, however I don’t really like Cave Story+ all that much because I prefer the older look and sound of the game. I also don’t like how Quote’s outfit changes color based on the different difficult settings, however I do like that there are different difficulty settings. If you download the free version of Cave Story there are many different tools that you can download to mess around with Cave Story. You can also edit all the sprites which is something I enjoyed doing with the free version of Cave Story. You can also find the music for the game on the Cave Story website, along with some game art, and game saves to download. If you aren’t sure if you want to buy Cave Story+ or not, I would download the free version first and see if you like it. If you do, why not buy Cave Story+ to support the developer? $15 may seem like a lot but if you really want to support the developer then go ahead! I fell in love with this game and I’m sure you will too.			"

												This game hits every mark it ought to. Controls are reasonably tight. The weapons aren't terribly complicated or varied, but give just enough variation to stay out of your way. The leveling system of the weapons keeps you rotating and gives you a reason to kill trash mobs as you move.Save points are placed in clever locations. Not so frequent as to feel that they are guaranteed. Not so spread out that you feel that you're backtracking constantly.The bosses scale in difficulty smoothly and get fairly difficult by the end.All around great adventure.			"

												Cavestory is a game that you should play are you either an oldschool gamer or a new one.ofc you should consider the fact that if you only play firstpersonshooters and new games you will not enjoy this piece of art. cave story defines the term of classic indie game with first being made by only a single person.While cavestory+ is a rework of this masterpiece it can also be taken as a rebirth of the game with a new look and a couple of music styles.Lastly the only changes to the original are the chalenges, a new unlockable story mode and the notoriusly hard achivements espescialy UNSTOPPABLE10+/10			"

												Cave Story was one of the first mega-hit indie games.  First released as freeware in 2004 (still available here!) it took the world by storm with its deep story, nostalgic graphics, and beautiful chiptune music.  Remastered for modern systems by NiCaLiS, the Plus version adds HD graphics, remastered music, and new secrets to find.  Also Steam Achievements.You wake up not knowing your past, alone in a dark cave.  The events that follow as you explore the vast cave system will change the world.  I’m not going to tell you much about the story, as it really is one of the strong points of this Metroidvania-style adventure game.There are about a dozen weapons to collect and upgrade, numerous secret items to collect, and three different endings to see, depending on your choices throughout the story.  All told the game only lasts a few hours on easy mode but it gets much more difficult on Normal and Hard modes.The music stands out among chiptune soundtracks as one of the best ever made.  Upbeat and peppy, it will bring a smile to your face every time you hear it.  This game would feel right at home among the classics on NES, both in style and substance.  The graphics are gorgeous.  The art might be simple, but its so enjoyable, warm, and inviting.  You instantly get attached to the cute Mimiga who inhabit the cave, even without knowing anything about them.  Just based on the cuteness of their sprites, you know they’re THE BEST.Enemies are numerous and varied, the caves are vast and full of side tunnels and secrets to find.  You can’t collect and see everything on one playthrough (that would take at least three) but the main story beats are always there.  This is a game that begs to be dived into and savored.Cave Story is the brainchild of one man, Daisuke “Pixel” Amaya, who developed it from scratch in his spare time.  It remains one of the pinnacles of independent gaming, even today.  A quirky, engaging tale told through some of the best gameplay and art the world has ever seen.  Everyone should play this game.Cave Story is available on (deep breath) Steam, Humble, Linux, Mac, Amiga, PSP, Xbox, GBA, Nintendo DS, and Nintendo 3DS (port by NIS America).			"

												Cave Story + may very well be the best way to experiance Cave Story.  A charming platformer made by Studio Pixel, Cave Story has great controls, fun gameplay, loveable characters, spactacular music, multiple endings, and so much more.  Challenging boss battles, and intersting level desing adds to the game's charm, and the hints of Metroid/Castelvania with hidden goodies being avalible with ceretain weapons only adds to the experiance.  The Multiple endings, and possible weapon trades add replayability, while extra modes and challenges makes the game greater.  If you are a fan of Cave Story, Retro games, Indie games, platformers, or great games, then you will enjoy Cave Story +.			"

												Cave Story is a wonderfull game. The story is empowering yet heartrending at times, the difficulty curve is smooth (if you play with no guides), both versions of the graphics are spot on, and I can't stop listening to the music. The game handles like an epic cross between metroid and mega-man. The controlls are customisable and you can even plug in a USB controler. With all the chalenges and achevements there is no reason to get this game, even If you already have another version. I only have one problem: the ""new"" music is just awfull. Stick with origonal for an 8-bit feel and remastered for 16-bit. Casual or hardcore, if you wan't to see just how good an Indie game can be, play this now. For what I got out of this I would pay at least twice as much.			"

												A fun story about killer robots, killer rabbits and a killer scientist who wants to take over the world. Features great music, pleasant aesthetics and great platformer action, with a dose of RPG. Has THREE different endings - bad, normal and good. Really, it's a masterpiece, and it's all the work of one guy!I have only ONE complaint: the good ending. Not the ending in itself, but achieving it. To even ENABLE this ending, you have to perform one action everyone, including myself, thought it unintuitive and unfair. It also requires quite a sequence of actions afterwards, with one other being almost equally unintuitive, in the middle of a hazardous area.But, really, other than that, this game is great in every aspect. Recommend.			"

												Honestly, for what hasn't been said already, this game is great. I am a fan of games that can make a 2D combat system fun and interesting but not overly complex.-Like a bullethell, you rely on dodging objects with position and timing.-Weapon levels go up and down based on how well you're doing (being hit or not).-Later upgrades further how you move.The story itself is grand. Exploring the grim remains of the island is a wonderful effort. While it could have done with a bit more on the actual exploration side, you can completely sidestep it unless you want to finish it in the many alternate ways. It's a fun game to complete once or twice, and I would give it a try if you haven't.			"

With controls made for 2D platforming and shooting.Also, with the weapons and that leveling system shining for the game, gives complexity and challenge.Retakes the essence for classic games of this genre like Metroid.Another good point of this remake is the challenge mode, working on the use of different weapons and time trials.Include all of this and the new achievements to get a real good and challenging game.Let your story begin, but death will be with you in some moments. Prepare to die a couple of times.Covered with a lot of secrets, endings and funny moments, makes this remake one must-buy game. "

												I've heard so much about this game before but never at all gave it a try. In fact I bought it about 4 years ago and never installed it until just last week. This game is so much fun and so frustrating that even after you die to a boss the first, second, third time you just want to keep going. And the music.....omg the music is so amazing. I personally like the remastered music but honestly they're all good no matter what.There's a lot of secrets in this game too so I suggest you go through it, exploring everywhere first before you look at a walkthrough and use a controller if you have one. Feels awkward using a keyboard.You should definitely buy this game. It's thus far the only thing that has actually stopped me from constantly playing an MMORPG 24/7.Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna resume to shooting myself in the face trying to beat hard mode.

												First things first. This game falls under a catagory known as 'Nintendo Hard'. As in, it harkens back to the days where men were tasty snacks, monsters were overpowered, and the princess was guarded by a REAL dragon. This game has three endings, from Worst to Best. I won't spoil anything, of course... But the ending you recieve depends on your gameplay... And who you manage to save.Plotwise, Cave Story is rather dark, surrounded by fluffy humor. The floating island you are in (You'll find out why you are there later, if you do well.), is the natural home for a race of innocent bunnies, that survive on flowers. Mimiga. How can that be the set-up for a dark, sometimes depressing story? You'll just have to find out.If you enjoy a challenging platformer, and you love a story that grows more immersive as you go along... Cave Story is for you. All ye wimps, go play something a tad easier and lighter.			"

												If you're a fan of the old school 2d classic side scrollers such as Metriod or Castlevania, then is this the game for you. This amazing little indie game starts off a little confusing with the player being thrown into some sort of hostage situation but the moment the game begins to pick up the pace you can tell the game is going to be good. The game can be frustrating at parts, similar to the frustration one might have had with the old 2d side scrollers mentioned before, but the overall gaming experience is quite refined and well worth a play through. My gameplay time was seven hours but each hour was filled with great gaming goodness. The retro 8-bit score of the game must also be mentioned, as it definitely set the mood for many scenes and battles in the game perfectly.8.5/10.0			"

Cave Story certainly will always stick out in my mind as such a game because of it's cute characters, engaging story, and challenging gameplay. Did I mention that this was all made by one guy!?			"

												I played the free version of this game, which you can just find at cavestory.org, but then I ended up getting it again from Humble Indie Bundle 7 and started playing it. It's essentially the same game but with a slightly updated soundtrack and graphics, and I believe you can play as Curly if you obtain a certain item. Still something worth playing as it's a fun (and VERY challenging) short game. Think of it as a shooter/platformer kind of thing. The story itself is pretty neat, and the secrets you can find are as well. If you don't want to buy it, then I'd suggest at least playing the free version since it's exactly the same thing minus Curly mode and the graphical/soundtrack upgrades (which the original soundtrack is good anyway and the graphics aren't even THAT updated) and it won't take much of your time, yet you'll most likely enjoy the experience and probably cry at how hard the later levels/bosses are. It has multiple endings too depending on certain choices you make, with the ""true"" ending being the hardest to get (I haven't even gotten it yet, that last boss is ugh).			"

												9/10 First time I ever loved a platformer.Cave Story is the brilliant child of Studio Pixel, a one-man company. Pixel spent five years developing Cave Story in his free time. There's a lot of TLC put into the design, and it really does show. Now I sucked at platforming going into this game. I just did not have the skillset. This game gave me the necessary skills to succeed in a platformer, and really ramped it up as I neared the True Ending. The music was awesome, and in Cave Story+, You get three choices of soundtrack:Original: From the freeware version of the PC gameNew: From the EU patch of the Nintendo WiiWare port of the gameRemastered: From the fully-3D Nintendo 3DS remake of the game.The graphics can also be in their lesser Original quality, or their newly refined Remastered quality. This game has a lot of wonderful elements, and you'll likely log HOURS of gameplay in this game. The Soundtrack, in whichever form, is catchy, and you'll definitely jam out to it. With all said, I give this game a 9/10, docking points nly for the sudden intensity spike for activating the true ending's route, granted it was to be expected			"

												What is there to say? Cave Story (or in this case, Cave Story+) is a fun and challenging game with a lot of indie developer heart put into it. You can tell why this game took four years to make, because everything is filled with polish. The enemies are varried in size, shape, behavior, and personality, and the backstory is never shoved in your face, instead slowly being revealed to your amnesia suffering protaginist. The only issues I have are that the platforming is pretty floaty, which can be annoying, and the fact that there is pretty much ZERO chance of anyone figuring out how to get the best ending without an internet guide.

												I really love this game. I didn't play it until it was on steam, but the characters are really charming and I like that I'm just a 3rd party person in the story and not a silly little emo anime guy. I like the plot. I like the characters. I like the aesthetic, the music, it's all good! The 'starter controls' are a bit unituitive at first, but rebinding them made things work fine. Using a keyboard was kind of a hassle, but I couldn't get my controller to work.Anyway the game is like a platformer RPG...uhm..adventure...game? It works kinda like a standard platformer, but you have a gun to shoot things and after shooting things you get stuff that makes your gun more powerful. I mean the combat isn't amazing or anything, but it works for what it is. The story is really nice though that's probably the thing I would praise the most. I like that it has branching paths too and that things can be different depending on how you play. I couldn't help myself and had to get the best ending so yeah.Def recom.			"

												It's the same as the original, but with enhanced music and graphics.There's some new game modes, but you have to unlock them and that's hard as hell.  If you've played the original, which you can still do and for FREE as well, you'll love this.  Even if you've completed the original, you'll still love this and it's worth the price, EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN GET IT FOR FREE.  I recommend it to anyone who hasn't played it before, like seriously I recommend it A LOT.  Get the original for free, or buy this enhanced version.  Either way, it's a great experience that you'll probably never forget.			"

												An thrilling adventure you'll ever experience! I recomend this game to people that love classic 16-bit games and the platforming genre, Cave Story is a challenging game and has exploration similar to the 2D metroid and 2D castlevania games, the term people use as metroidvania. The characters are interesting especially the silent protagonist named Quote who is trying to regain his memory, even the villains are interesting, the game also has three multiple ending depending on what you do can effect the outcome, this game gets a 9/10			"

												The game is nice and all, but I have no idea where all these ratings and popularity come from.The amount of text is relatively small, so while the story is there, there isn't enough content to warrant calling it touching.The graphics could be called great if the game was released 30 years ago. Nowadays it's just another well done imitation of ancient 8-bit graphics.The gameplay is good I guess, though I'm not the biggest fan of 2D shooters. However, the amount of backtracking the game expects is CRAZY. The player is expected to go back and forth multiple times, and if he misses discussing something with some character, there's even more backtracking.Having multiple endings is nice, but no way in hell most players could understand what is necessary for the perfect ending without reading online manuals. Talking to a character makes a random item disappear from the map later in game, with zero explanations — really?With ratings of the game being so high, I expected much more than an average game.

												One of the best platformers ever made. Originally made by one dude all on his own! Metroid-style upgrade and weapons systems, with some of the cutest art ever, and a really great soundtrack. Charming characters and story, SUPER satisfying gameplay.  I read a review praising the physics of everything, and it's spot on. Everything just feels really good, from the movement, to shooting, to the drop and bounce of powerup items. You could get it for free with the original art and music (this version offers them as an option), which I prefer, but you should support the developer for this great, great game.			"

Behind Cave Story's cute and adorable cover is a dark and sad story that you can choose how it goes, how it ends. Its YOUR adventure!

Without a walkthrough you will NOT get the best ending first time, and the variety in weapons and/or items makes another go worthwhile.			"

												Cave Story is a very classic game, mixing platforms, action and adventure, with several levels of difficulty (Easy / Normal / Hard).We control Quote, a boy without particular capacity, except for jumping. During the game, the player is going to collect objects and especially weapons, with which he's going to equip himself. Weapons have generally 3 power levels, their power increasing thanks to jewels collected by killing monsters. Several weapons will be usable during the adventure, whether it is the pistol, the rocket launcher or the sword, all having a different power and range.Quote finds himself in a flying island, divided into several sectors, accessible thanks to teleport, as the village Mimiga, the center of this universe, the sand zone or the plantation. Quote has a memory loss and nobody knows what he is doing here. Nevertheless, he's going to begin helping Mimigas, a sort of rabbits forming the local population, fighting the Doctor, the villain of Cave Story+ which wants to destroy everything. The game is punctuated by the appearance of boss and recurring characters, such as Balrog and Misery, the funny minions of the Doctor. Several purposes are possible, depending on acts and choices of the player, what will ask to redo at least twice the game to have an overview of all the possible purposes.Graphically it is very simple, but it is also beautiful and harmonious. Musics are good and addictive. Bestiary is rather wide and varied. So, every world has its own identity, and it is pleasant to cross them. Finally, the length is more than correct for the one who takes time to make all the secondary quests (about 10 hours). Furthermore, additional contents are unlocked thanks to side quests during the session, such as a game version with Curly, the feminine character of Cave Story, or challenges such as Boss Attack or Time Attack.Conclusion: a good game, classic, with a good level of difficulty.

												Honestly, for what hasn't been said already, this game is great. I am a fan of games that can make a 2D combat system fun and interesting but not overly complex.-Like a bullethell, you rely on dodging objects with position and timing.-Weapon levels go up and down based on how well you're doing (being hit or not).-Later upgrades further how you move.The story itself is grand. Exploring the grim remains of the island is a wonderful effort. While it could have done with a bit more on the actual exploration side, you can completely sidestep it unless you want to finish it in the many alternate ways. It's a fun game to complete once or twice, and I would give it a try if you haven't.			"

												This 2D shooter is impressive as a one-man project.Nearly stopped playing from the tedious, unskippable dialogue every time you have to face certain bosses, especially the difficult ending(s). This wouldn't be so much of an issue if the story was more interesting than a formulaic evil wants a McGuffin to be more evil trope.It's not quite the open world it wants to be - it's a circularly linear game and it suffers for it. The individual enemy and level designs are well done, despite being on the verge of incoherence. The good parts barely overcome the contrivances.			"

												This game is a masterpiece in my opinion. As you know, pixelated indie games are really hard to come by these days {Obvious sarcasm is obvious} It's a 2D Platformer that draws inspiration from older Megaman games along with Metroid. PROS~-Has awesome story that actually drives you to continue, unlike some games where it's just obligatory-3 different endings-TONS and TONS of secrets to make replaying a joy-Interesting, challenging, and unique boss fights-Environments with depth and a suprising amount of exploration for 2D Platformers-Lots of weapons to collect-Depending on your skill and difficulty, this game can last 5 hours in story-Difficult but fair-Incredible soundtrack (Best I've ever heard)CONS~-Platforming can be frustrating due to floaty jumps-Some bosses have unfair difficulty-Hard mode is, well hard (Beyond belief)-Some secrets require you to look them up, which beginner players wouldn't know to do-Difficulty spike at the end of the game-Save points that become scarcer and scarcer, requiring you to stay alive or be punishedAll around this game's pros heavily outweigh the cons. I highly suggest this game to anyone who appreciates video games in general. If you just like video games like Call of Duty, and don't have an open mind, I would say stay away from this game (Or anything on steam really). But to everyone else, this will be money very well spent. "

												I played this game when it ws free and I bought it here to support it. This is a great example of what a game ""Remaster"" should look like. The entire game and soundtrack has been revamped which I personally enjoyed but there are people who like the original Pixel look and can choose to make the game look that way again. Same for the soundtrack. This doesn't make or break a game but they are nice touches.The story is nice and engaging as you try to figure out where your place is in the history of this floating island. Also there are multiple endings depending on some choices you make, how brave you are and how observant. So good luck with that. The controls (Not gameplay) remind me of Super Meat Boy in terms of the precision you need for some platforming, but the game is mostly a sidescroling shooter. The weapon system is level based that you have to maintain with kills while damage not only hurts you but delevels your weapons as well. This isn't as rough as it sounds as each weapon has 3 levels the changes how it shoots so regaining those levels never feels like a chore. This version also adds a couple new modes of gameplay so veteran players can enjoy some new content. It's not more story mind you, but there is a time attack mode where you rush to beat levels within a time limit which brings its own achievements to unlock if your into that. Also, there is a Boss Rush mode where you navigate a hub world and fight each boss of the game in order and consecutively. Both were very enjoyable though it does have a big learning curve if you hope to achieve the top rankings in these modes. Also there is a NewGame+ mode where you can play through as another main character which was a nice touch. She isn't a silent protagonist either so it does change the game slightly, but not much. It's nice for a second playthough.I really enjoyed this game, hopefully I did it justice in this review. This game is not easy even when you tone down the difficulty but it's very rewarding as you move through the story. This game has a big personality and it shines through its chracters and how you feel as you see them come and go. Pick it up.TL;DRIt's good bruh, you gonna like it bruh. Story and modes, story and modes!			"

												I put a 100+ hours into the FreeWare version of the gamePros:-Fun-Awesome Score (Music for those who don't know what I mean by score)-Mostly tight gameplay (the con will touch on this)-Difficulty is mostly fair (same as ^)-Multiple endings and items-Has a semi-Metroid semi-Mega Man feel-Suprisingly well compensated after game content that can only be unlocked in this version and Nintendo verisons of the game (hint you unlock new character and if you got far enough in the game you know who it is) Cons:-""Mr.Traveller""(his name is Quote trust me I aint spoiling much) can be a little floaty and makes accurate platforming a pain-The difficulty spike is all over the place in some areas close to the end game-The alt Final Cave for the secret ending no matter the difficulty has an unreal difficulty spike making it annoyingly hard to get to the Final bossesother than that this game is a must buy unless you are broke and if you are here is the original FreeWare versions tribute site (http://www.cavestory.org/download/cave-story.php)9/10 -Bought every verison of this game (Wii,DSi,3DS Remake,3DS Remaster, and PC)			"

												Highly recommended platformer, though I would get it on sale.  with an amazing soundtrack and precise gameplay, this title hails back to the classics.  I do think the game is a bit short, but one can only expect so much from a game developed by a single person.  It's got a good story with memorable characters, and had me laugh out loud several times.  As with pretty much any platformer, you will be at a disadvantage if you don't already have a controller.  It's very playable with a k/b but I don't recommend it.			"

												A polished retro platformer with a neat story with very charming characters. Art/graphics wise it is quite retro, but with great detail. Soundtrack I can not say much nothing particularly that sticks out. The story revolves around a silent protagonist helping a village while trying to figure out who he is due to having lost his memories. Overall the cute monsters are neat, and so are the friendly characters. The game itself is pretty short there isn't much end game stuff but the game gameplay and story are neat to breeze through I do recommend the game.			"

												This 2D shooter is impressive as a one-man project.Nearly stopped playing from the tedious, unskippable dialogue every time you have to face certain bosses, especially the difficult ending(s). This wouldn't be so much of an issue if the story was more interesting than a formulaic evil wants a McGuffin to be more evil trope.It's not quite the open world it wants to be - it's a circularly linear game and it suffers for it. The individual enemy and level designs are well done, despite being on the verge of incoherence. The good parts barely overcome the contrivances.			"

												Cave Story is a fantastic 2D platformer/adventure game released as freeware in 2004. Cave Story+ is a fantastic remake of Cave Story that isn't freeware, and is absolutely worth the modest price. The multiple endings, difficulty levels, and weapons available give it excellent replay value.			"

												It hearkens back to an older era of gaming, specifically the SNES era, when games started developing storylines proper, and creating characters you could truly identify with. The music is pleasant and fitting, particularly ""Moonsong"", and the storyline is engaging and leaves you wanting more as you progress through the game. The fact that a single individual made this game, in his spare time, over the course of five years, is truly marvelous. Granted this is an ""updated"" version, but it's still as enjoyable as ever! Go destroy The Doctor's plans, and save the Mimigas!			"

The GoodFantastic story (multiple endings with challenging bosses and secrets to find!)Amazing soundtrack (three versions available; the original chiptune, remastered along with a new take on the themes)Aesthetically pleasing art style (includes the original art style as well as a new (less pixley) rendition)Gameplay is great. A good variety of weapons and items each doing something unique, enemies and bosses are very diverse and the world throws something new and challenging at each turnNew Time-trials/challenges (which were not available in free version)The BadNothing of noteOpinionFor those who played the original free version of Cave Story, Cave Story+ adds a variety of new features without sacrificing what made the original so great. First of all there are options to how the game looks and feels. There are three versions of the soundtrack (original, new and remastered) each standing on their own merits against the orginal as well as a redone art style (less pixley), though the option to play the game as the original was presented is there. Additionally there are achievements and time trials/competitive challenges that are included with the game as bonus content. Well worth it for the story alone!			"

												""Enchanting!""That's the one word I can use to describe this beautiful game.Though I'm not someone that has always been overly fascinated with indie games, but if I had to choose my favourite indie game ever made, this game right here would without a doubt be on my Top List somewhere!The music is delightful and will get stuck in your head for hours.I feel tender towards the characters, and sometimes even the villains too.The enemies, obstacles are weapons are perfectly constructed to fit in with the gameplay.And with such an awesome secret ending to unlock that actually adds more challenge to the game that you already know, I can do nothing but applaud the person who made this.I can see that a lot of heart went into developing this game.And in some ways I find this game to also be very inspirational in terms of creativity!You may not love this game as much as I do, but at least give this game a try.At least once. I highly recommend it.			"
