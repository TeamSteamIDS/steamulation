												I wish I could recommend this game, since it does have a certain beauty. But in the end too many negative bits sucked the fun out of it for me. It just felt tedious towards the end. Here is what is good and bad.The good: Beautiful Landscapes: You basically “run” (more on that later) through a series of truly well-drawn landscapes. The graphic textures are not always the greatest, but overall you get some stunning visuals. Especially the vertical elements can be quite remarkable. Atmospheric Sound/Music: Minimalistic, but appropriately used. Simply good. The not-so good: So… much… walking… : Unfortunately your movement speed is not very high. Which means that you transverse above mentioned landscapes step by step by step for what simply feels way too long. It certainly contributes to the atmosphere of solitude/lifelessness (because very little is happening while you walk). Just, that is not a very neat atmosphere to build up. The whole thing is compounded by the fact that: The story does not move forward: Most of the time you are running somewhere you are doing so without much motivation, but simply because you are following the only viable way through this world. Not everything has to be open world, but at least give me a reason why I should now be traversing the lava level. God, I felt with my character when he character said “I demand answers! Now!” some hours in. Neither of us would get any for many more hours.  Unmotivated Discontinuity: Sometimes a new level begins without any discernible transitions from the last. Example: Last minute it was daylight and you were standing on a cliff. Next second you are in a canyon and its night. Eh, what? Puzzles are way too easy: Most of the game you are following a giant “follow me” trail of glowing green, the only challenge being to keep your motivation for these long minutes. Puzzles are sparse (which in itself is a bit of a problem for a puzzle platformer), and never pose the slightest challenge. Like one-moveable-object-besides-one-landmark-easy: move object to landmark, done. When you get stuck, this it is very likely because you overlooked a required booster pack that is hidden a few hundred meters back. And who explores slightly off track at this walking speed? Abilities are arbitrarily removed: At some points you get a cool booster pack. Not only does it allow you to solve some platform puzzles, it also allows you to move quicker (yay!). Now you can spend an hour flying around with this thing in one level without a problem. But as soon as you cross a line the game declares it has run out of fuel (regardless of how long you have been using it). This is feels completely arbitrary. Similarly, sometimes the plot will decide you need more oxygen, regardless of when you refilled last or what you have been doing in the meantime. Overall, a tedious experience with some visisal perks. Did not go into the story becuase it might be subjective, but personally I am not blown away.			"

												Lifeless Planet is a game well worth playing, surely one of the best Indie games I have played this year. It had a successful Kickstarter and passed through Greenlight to go to Early Access and to be released as completed game.Its made by Stage 2 Studios which consists mainly of David Board, and the game is the outcome of years of passionate hard work, while it utilized all the stages an Indie project can pass through, till its released on Steam.This game is a unique work of art that inspires and entertains with its beautiful visuals and its story, unlike anything you can find in big budget titles. Words hardly can express the accomplishments this game reached. Its a Sci-Fi Story Adventure comparable to the books of Isaac Asimov or Games like The Dig.The atmosphere is carrying this game. It makes you feel lost, helpless and afraid, even sad and isolated, but then again it evokes curiosity, hope and amazement. It has very little action but a lot of exploring and platforming and a bit of quite easy puzzling. Its pretty linear, but that's to be expected from a game that tries to tell a story I guess. There could be a bit more to do in some parts of the game. I will not reveal anything of the story, its yours to discover for yourself, because that's what the game is about. But I can assure you that it is very much worth it, if you have an open mind and search for something meaningful that you can enjoy without feeling pressured. It will take you around 5 hours for a playthrough. This is not a game for the impatient or simpleminded tough, those players will get bored or fail to grasp the storyline.If there's one thought that I had while playing it, it was that the more you think you know about the world and the universe, the more you discover what you actually don’t know. The Storyline and ending is partly open to interpretation. Its not very strictly explained, which gives room for your own imagination. A freedom very few games ever trust the player with, and therefore it has to be complimented on such bravery.The technical aspects of the game are robust for such a small team, reasonable performance, hardly any bugs, no crashes for me. I had to restart a level because something to advance the story didn't trigger first time, but that wasn't really a problem. Controls where fine for me with KB & Mouse, jumping around with the jetpack is a lot of fun. Gamepads are supported.The graphical style is fitting for the game, although the way its done, also means that its looking pretty simple at times. Its definitely not a Crysis, but the aesthetics and level design make up a lot for it and make the game nonetheless a pleasure to explore and screenshot. It also has nice particle effects like dust, and the levels have a great variety of environments.The musical score and sound is very good also, it really works well in combination with the storyline to emphasize important moments and add tension to the game. The voice acting is great, there are native Russian speakers who did the voiceovers and this makes this aspect really shine.In conclusion I can say this game is well worth its price. The game has to be played and developers like these have to be supported. Buy and play this game, so we hopefully see more of this studio!			"

												>> can somebody tell me why I can't make paragraphs(?) for every point (pro/con)<<EARLY ACCESS REVIEW:___________________________________________________________________________________Wow! The atmosphere in this game is simply amazing. I have to say this is one of the most atmospheric games I've ever played.You feel pretty helpless all by yourself on this vast abandoned planet as you slowly uncover the story of this planet and it's inhabitants.The music and voice acting is really good, nothing to complain here! There are still some things annoying me. For example:I've got some FPS-drops sometimes and i run a GTX 680 and a i5 3570k + 12gb RAM... But the FPS drops won't make it unplayable but still it's a little bit annoying.All in all this game is worth it's money (12.99€ for me [that was early access now it's 19.99€). I don't know how long it will take until you'll finish the game but for now it looks like you will spend a couple of hours with the game :)(Now I know :D it took me around 5 hours I think)___________________________________________________________________________________EDIT AFTER FINISHING THE WHOLE GAME:___________________________________________________________________________________After finishing the game my opinion about this game did not change :)I will add some pro's and con's about this game:PRO:- breathtaking atmosphere (in my opinion)- really interesting story which makes you wanna play more and more :)  (finished the game in one day because i couldn't stop playing)- easy controls (it's a simple jump n' run)- pretty graphics (not the best but they're okay)- many different terrains/locations (desert/ice/vulcanic/etc...)- AWESOME music, this is a huge plus- good voice acting- huge areas which have a beautiful viewCON:  - the gameplay itself can be a little bit boring, the puzzles aren't that hard and the rest is  simple jump n' run gameplay- it's rather short (finished it in one day in ~5h)- the graphics are okay but some textures are really ""wishy-washy"" :)- a few times i did not know what i need to do, so i needed to check out some youtube videos  (but that could also be my own stupidity)- not very good optimized i had some fps drops while playing (~15FPS) even though i have  pretty good specsBut still I can recommend this game A LOT. Especially because of the awesome music, the great atmosphere and the really thrilling story which won't let you stop playing the game :)			"

												Bottom LIne:Would I recommend it?No.At least, not at this price. It isn't worth $19.99I wouldn't pay more that $5 for itAbstract:The best way to describe why this game doesn't work would be to call it a ""sightseeing"" game. Large enviroments provide beautiful vistas, but traversing them, slowly, without any purpose other than to get from A to B makes poor gameplay. Synopsis:Lifeless Planet's striking visuals, score, and intruiging plot are frustrated by ineffective controls, puzzles of arbitrary difficult, and at times, a lack of any direction whatsoever. Problems that wouldn't be terrible on their own, or in an actual exploration game.Unfortunetly, this game isn't an exploration game. In fact, it isn't anything it wants to be. The player onto the rails with lethal force. It wants to be story driven, but the story is could fit on a single page of paper. It wants to be a mystery, but the biggest mystery, (that of why the planet is lifeless, and where the Russian town came from,) are both answered early on. It doesn't want to be a platformer, but at times, that is the central feature.Ultimately, once the player gets the hang of the controls, the story, and the repetative puzzles, the game simply seems ot drag on toward its conclusion... forever. This is the major weakness of this game: Length. There are other problems to be sure, bad controls, unforgiving puzzles and challenges. But the length its most agregious offence. There is less story here than Portal, but the game takes about twice as long to complete. Even at only 6 hours it's too long. If the enviroments had been shrunk to a less scenic size, the gameplay might have been rewarding.Instead, The controls are unforgiving. Walking around feels more like drving a small vehicle. At least onc death was caused by an inability of the main character to turn around in place. Nailing jumps can be difficult when distances become difficult to gauge.Conclusion:The story is, surprisingly compelling, if lacking in depth. The puzzles simple. The controls are frustrating in that they seem more often like death is caused by the game being unforgiving than player error.Its best comparison would be a classic Sci-Fi short story. Like an episode of the Twilight Zone. If the game had fit into a 1-hour television block, it would have been great. On the other hand, strictly speaking, I'm not disapointed I played it. I like those old episodes of the Twilight Zone.			"

												Lifeless Planet is a nice, little puzzle-exploration game.An astronaut crew crash-lands on a distant planet, you awake alone and try to find your crew and quickly start realizing, that this planet isn't what you thought it would be.Promised to contain life or at least good living conditions, you find yourself in a desert-like wasteland and soon discover, that you weren't the first to be on this planet.The game is mostly about exploring the different locations, some platform jumping, solving some rather easy puzzles and collect log-entries, which will unveil the story to you.The mysterious atmosphere of the planet is pretty well done and the story itself is presented in a way, which kept me interested and wanting to know what was going on.Be aware that the game itself is rather slow and pretty linear, although the areas are sometimes quite big (but mostly empty).The last third of the game feels a bit stretched and although you had some highlights, it could have been a bit shorter at the end, which would also be another point to watch out for: the game itself is rather short. If you like slower paced exploration games, mysterious sci-fi/fantasy stories then this might be a nice little game for you.Personally i would wait for a sale to buy.			"

												I hate to give a poor review for a game as I'm sure many people put a lot of time and energy into making it, but I'm just not sure that's it's worth $20. The story is pretty interesting, and really this should've maybe been a book instead of a game, because the gameplay just doesn't hold my interest. It's a lot of really slow running through environments solving extremely basic puzzles like ""put the X in the X"" and jumping from platform to platform. The music is nice, but I didn't find it to be deeply immersive like many reviewers seem to. The player character responds to the controls in a very jerky way and interesting moments are always going into cutscenes and doing other jarring things that really take you out of the experience. If you're super bored or super high this might still be a worthwhile play for you, but if you're like me you'll find yourself just running through a lot of ""this path only"" monotony hoping to find another shred of plot .

												I wanted to like this...it just did too many things wrong.Lots of REALLY empty areas and dead ends (that make most of the exploration feel unrewarding,), outdated graphics, awkward transitions between levels, a few really tedious areas/puzzles, too many times that invisible walls prevented alternative solutions, not enough pay off for completing the long journey. Also, several times I had to reload the game because a critical item became literally impossible to get.Sometimes the atmosphere and pacing was good. Music and voice acting is decent. That's about it.Overall, too ambitious.If you love ""walking simulators,"" go ahead. Otherwise move along.			"

												This is one of those games where I wish there was a 'Maybe' button for do you recommend.  I'd have to err on the side of 'no' on this one, though.The premise is cool and the story is interesting, which are pretty key points in a game like this.  However, to make a game interesting, it has to be more tha a series of bright spots on the screen that you walk to in order to advance the story.  That's where things start to fall down.I'm the kind of guy, that presented with an open environment, will try to seek out the nooks and crannies.  I quickly found that with this game, there was no real reward for doing so ... Exploring just seemed really unsatisfying and it turned into me marching from journal entry to journal entry, largely ignoring everyhing else.  There's a lot of big, open expanses of nothing.The structures (houses, buildings, etc.) are weird lifeless props.  I would have liked to have gotten to see a little bit more, gotten a feel of an abandoned place.  Instead, it felt like a low budget movie set.  The main character's early reaction that this is all fake rings way more true than anything else.Some people say this game is beautiful, some say its beautiful in places and ugly in others.  I'd say its pretty bland all the way through.  The color palette changes, that's about it.I will say I actually liked that the puzzles were relatively simple ... I didn't really get stuck on anything, which I liked.  What I didn't like is the jumping mechanic.  There's one part in particular where I failed so many times I was starting to question if it was the right path ... it was the right path, just a pain in the butt jump.Despite all this, I plan on finishing the game.  I think I'm near the end as it is ... interesting story, and I want to see how it ends.  And that's worth a lot.  So, consider that when you're considering the game ... want a neat sci fi story?  Well, maybe it's worth giving this one a try.			"

												EDIT: There is a Premium Edition FREE upgrade for current owners in 2015 so buy now!TL;DR at the bottom.Lifeless Planet is an incredible game filled with atmospheric joy and a story that only gives you just enough to figure out what is going on. You play as an American astronaut that is sent to explore a planet that your readings suggest is brimming with life. Upon arrival you find that this planet is nothing like you expected. It houses strange secrets of past explorers and a nation trying to find the perfect life away from Earth only to find that meddling with things they don't understand almost never ends happily. An interesting mix of casual exploration and platforming, it keeps things relatively fresh most of the time. You should feel the want to get to the end to see how everything pans out and what the mysteries of this Lifeless Planet are, but at the same time your feeling of eerie isolation and the ambient sounds of the world make you want to take your time looking at the planet and chilling out as well. I became lost in the isolationist atmosphere and didn't want it to end. If you peer at the store page for this game and look at the user tags you would think that this is a game in the same genre as Dear Esther and the other ""walking simulator"" sorts of games. In some instances this is accurate, but in Lifeless Planet you have more than just your feet to work with. You are in a space suit with a jetpack! So while this game is semi-casual most of the time, there are a fair amount of platforming situations in which you must use the jetpack to make some pretty intense jumps now and then. I wouldn't say that this is extremely difficult to do, but you don't just walk from point to point here like a ""walking simulator"" would suggest. Not only that, but there are puzzles that you will come into contact with that force you to ponder the environment a bit as well as some technology to help you solve these puzzles. So it definitely delves into much more gameplay than just walking from story point to story point. Besides the tags being somewhat misleading, that META Score is completely off base in my opinion. Lifeless Planet is a fantastic game with a fantastic atmosphere, a cornucopia of map changes that will give you an explosion of color in some areas that is intensified by the more “Lifeless” areas you will find. The game has about 20 different areas with about 15 of them feeling like something completely different from the rest. Each area can be blown through in 10-15 minutes if you want to unless there are puzzles to get through, but anyone that enjoys looking at scenery and taking their time to explore game worlds should find more joy. (While discussing the want for even more little discoveries outside collectibles like random gravestones and such to add to the flavor of the world on the forums the developer said that they will be adding in more of this in a future patch.) It is not open world, but the areas feel wide and spacious enough that you will be able to wander a bit. Not to mention that there are some collectible items such as minerals and documents found in the game to give you a reason to check some of the back corners. Documents, which add a great deal of the story aspects to the game tend to be on the main path, however so you shouldn't miss any of these. The soundtrack is used sparingly, but feels like when the music comes into play it is escalating the situation and your feeling of isolation and the importance of where you are. It creeps into the feeling of the game and gives you the impression that it is pushing you towards an important moment when it begins to quietly chime in as you move forward. Most of the time, however the isolation you feel is intensified by the ambient sounds of a barren world. Winds and other strange sounds like rocks falling while looking into a great chasm add to the effects of your play. The story is mysterious, creepy, and interesting. While the main protagonist is your view into Lifeless Planet, you can hear the echos of others throughout your exploration in documents. Some documents contain a sound file in which you can read along as a Russian speaker transcribes it in their own language. It is a Russian speaking voice from someone native to the language as well so it feels authentic. Based solely on the game's title graphic, it is obvious that there is a Russian aspect to the game, but a Russian aspect from the Soviet Union of old. While you are an astronaut from the United States, and there is a Soviet Union background within the game, it does not delve into politics of any sort, nor does it make any statements about either of these nations, or any conflict they had other than maybe a passing note here, or there if necessary to understand the story within the game. The story is one of DISCOVERY, and what it would be like for someone to travel many light years away from Earth and to explore a new world. Their excitement with seeing new forms of life, as well as their struggles with dealing with the unknown. The best part of the story to me, however is your own discovery of something else being there, and your interactions with it throughout the game. Very little communication is had as you feel it out and it brings an aspect of humanity to the game that is wonderfully done I feel. Without talking, or actively communicating you do feel a sense of closeness to something while making your way to the end. It is too spoilerish to discuss it really, but it is something I feel should be mentioned because the impression you will get mostly looking at this game is that you are fighting the planet and the story is just one of looking at the past more than anything else. This is a major part, but there is the sci-aspect that all good sci-fi stories have in which humanity and human experience comes into play. Graphically the game is solid and gives you a great many screenshot opportunities. The game uses a bit of a filter on it that you would see if you were on such a place to blur it up some, but it is clear for the most part. On the outside of the FOV you will see blurring on the edges, however. Even on fantastic the game looks very good, but it is definitely not a AAA title quality level of HD graphics. For an Indie title they are great though and they fit the game perfectly. Gamepad support is good and is preferable to me while playing the game. I used a PS3 gamepad with Xbox 360 plugins and it worked fine the entire game. The game is predominantly bug free from my playthrough except there seems to be a bug with an Achievement that the developer has said will be addressed in a patch coming soon. There is an Achievement in which you must collect all documents in game, but as of now it seems the few of us that have looked for this final document to unlock the achievement cannot find it. The document is known to exist from the game files, but does not appear to be in the game anywhere. The developer is quite active on the forums and said they will fix this soon so there should be no worries here. TL;DR/BOTTOM LINE: Lifeless Planet is a great game that will appeal more to a casual gamer from a gameplay standpoint, but to a wider audience of gamers who like sci-fi mysteries, exploring new worlds, and feeling the isolation of a lost planet. The developer, David Board and his team should be proud of their work and congratulate themselves on an epic and unique game. I loved it all the way through and plan to play it again. There is an Achievement to beat the game in under 4 hours, so it could be completed in under that time, however it would be a complete waste to blow through it that quickly. It took me close to 10 hours to finish the game taking my sweet time. There is an Achievement for playing 10+ hours in one game as well too, and I got that without actually having to just idle the game so it is possible to spend over 10 hours in it easily. 9/10 Space Suits			"

												Lifeless Planet - lifeless gameplayOh dear,should I have looked more closely at the game before buying it? Seriously, the game did not make the impression to be a platformer. How could the players of the early access version be satisfied with what they got? Even as a platformer, this game is underwhelming and I payed 20 euro for this. Aaargh. I thought I would get my personal game of the year but I got my personal embarassment of the year.This game seemed to have so much potential, but when I arrived at the soviet village at the beginning it started to dawn on me that something went wrong. The village was deserted, ok. But there was nothing else to do than finding one of my crewmen and searching for oxygen (last of which occured now and then later on). And of course the ""puzzle"" here consisted of jumping around to find parts of a code... really, how boring with 10 'o's.In general, all puzzles are not challenging as well as most of the jumping parts. There is a barrier on my way? Oh, how nice that someone forgot some dynamite some meters away... that's one example how dull the puzzles are and they did not become more complex which I hoped.The story and the atmosphere are both good. But even story and atmosphere are destroyed many times. Again, in the soviet village, there was nothing really to explore. Sometimes there are personal logs or that of the villagers, but they don't transport the story really well. There are some occurences that give the hero a deeper character (remembering his wife's disappearence on earth). Still, it's not enough. The hero's character keeps to be very shallow. If the gameplay is so dull and linear at least the atmosphere should suck me in. But f.e. I could not enter any of the soviet village's houses to find out the personal tragedies of the persons that lived there. Imagine what could have been done: - photos and other personal belongings of the former inhabitants- f.e. finding the soviet book at the beginning of the village, reading in it, finding hints about how to activate a scientific machine to examine probes of the plant life- the game is not so linear, the world gives more space for exploration with the danger to get lost in the desert. By carefully examining an reading logs of the people you find out how to locate the next colony or the power plant structures...So many possibilities. I hoped this game would at least partially follow the spirit of Arthur C. Clarkes ""Rama"" novels or those of the Strugatzki brothers. But no... insteadthis...dumb...platformer "

												This is one game i went into wanting to like and trust me when i say i did,i ""REALLY DID"".The graphics really suit this game and do a good job of portraying the lifeless nature of a barren planet devoid of all life and the vistas and sites you will see in game would not look out of place in a full blown sci-fi film (hope someone takes note as this would make one of the best sci-fi films ever),the sound does a really good job of putting you in the position of being the astronaut stuck on the lifeless planet with the weird sound effects and music that you hear at times doing all they can to portray that lifeless feeling of loneliness the game is aiming for.The story is really entertaining and very mysterious (and pure sci-fi gold) and at times lost me a little (but in the best of ways),lets just say you are on a mission from which there is no return to a planet that could sustain life,you have lost all contact with the other crew members you came down to the planet with,so alone you then discover that you dont have enough oxygen in your tank and so you wander of to find some (and the other crew members) as your tank only holds so much and it has run out (right at the start of the game-HELL thats considerate) and this game play mechanic comes into play a few times through the game and some of these times it can be quite nerve wracking as you wonder if you will find that next oxygen tank to get your levels back upto normal (they are usually somewhere near but can be a pain to find as you run out of that life sustaining O2).As you play you come across various puzzles that need solving for you to progress and most of the time these are quite easy to solve (some of them stumped me quite a bit though i must admit),and this is where the robotic arm comes into its own.This device offers you the chance to reach out of place switches and also reach those heavy out of place item's you just wouldent get to without it,which in turn then leads to the robotic arm then helping to solve that puzzle that has been getting on your nerves for the last 30 minutes.Your booster pack also plays a huge part in the game and without it you just wouldent get past those really hard platforming areas to get access to the next area and therefore uncover more of the mystery that this planet holds.Your booster only has a limited boost capability (normally just one charge) and can only boost you once so in some of the situations you find yourself in you need to go and find the special tank that provides you with those extra charge's you need,so instead of one boost charge you can have upto between 4 or 6 which really helps out with those hard to do areas that without these extra charges you just would not over come.Lets get back to the story (dont worry wont give anything away),the script that accompanies the game as you play is one that kept me fully hooked and i must admit that i havent come across such good writing in a game in a long time,as it turns and twists its way right up until one of the best and most satisfying endings it has been my privalige to play through to get to in what seems like a life time of playing games.In summing up this game would you enjoy it well answer the following questions and make your own mind up--1 - Would you like to play a game unlike anything you have played before and which also has one of the best and most engrossing storylines any game has had in quite some time ??2 - Are you a huge SCI-FI game fan who is looking for that something different and unlike any other SCI-FI game you have ever played ????If you answer yes to both of the above what are you waiting for buy this game now,and if not then you will be missing out on not just one of the best sci-fi games ever made,but in this reveiwers humble opinion one of the best games that the medium has seen in quite some time.

												This game is a lot of fun at first, but then it becomes tedious.  It's mostly a platformer, with a couple puzzles, and a lot of walking as you explore.  It's pretty linear--you cannot get off the track too far.  What made me quit playing is the awful ""save"" function.  The game does not actually save when you want it to.  If you are in the middle of a level and fall to your death, you spawn petty close to where you fell, and this is great!  But if you save and quit before finishing the level, you have to start the level over again from the start of the level (not where you ""saved"").  You cannot leave the game until you finish the level you are on, or you have to replay 10 or 20 minutes of the game as you restart the level  (I'm slow, I guess).  There was one level I found a bit tough, and I became discouraged because I could not leave the game until I succeeded with this level.  I  got to the LAST jump, failed over and over and set the game aside.  But next time, I start the level over from the beginning.  After I did this five or six times, I put the game aside and never finished it.  If you like platformers, this game may be for you...Edit:  I gave this game a ""thumbs down"", do not recommend.  But I think I should MAYBE give it half a ""thumbs up"" because if you buy it cheap, and have a high frustration level, you may like it.  The story was interesting, but I never got to the end.			"

												It's cute, not worth more than 5 dollars though. There are moments where movement and level design become a problem. Story is meh, could've been better. Seems rushed near the end. Could've used more story, content, survivors. If this were an FPS/RPG it would be a good scifi/horror theme,definately a good blueprint for one anyways. Jumping from rock to rock and walking for hours gets real annoying after a while. The only thing that will keep you playing is the story, which could've used a lot more content seeing as it's text base mostly when you find logs. Also, some ideas were thrown in this game, exploited a bit, and abandonned. Waste of game assets if it doesn't culminate to anything. "

												This is not an ""Open World"" game as it might seem in the video, it's a linear platformer. All you have to do is follow the guidelines ""green puke"" and solve a ""very"" few puzzles. villain and minions are non existant. The idea is great, but the gameplay killed it. If you find the 6 hours I spent worth the $10 for you, then go for it. I personally played it because I was bored. "

												A damn fine adventure game with platforming galore and some basic problem solving (well really basic). Well worth taking for anyone that enjoys undergoing a journey into the unknown and doesn't mind getting right up after failing their jumps time and time again.Though underscored a bit the game is not just an adventure to understand what's going on with this strange planet but also to understand why our astronaut took his one way journey into an alien world in the first place. All is revealed to the determined, fear not.			"

												It's hard to pin down the genre of Lifeless Planet. It's part walking simulator, part platformer, part puzzle game, with an overarching strong story focus. You're an astronaut sent on a mission to explore a lush planet but end up on a deserted wasteland. Questions like ""What happened to the planet?"" soon meld into questions like ""Did something happen to me?"" when all kinds of weirdness starts popping up.Elaborating further would steer the review into spoiler territory, so I won't go there. But unfortunately I have to report that while I make the game sound very mysterious (and it certainly is that, up to a point), the final answers provided do not end up being nearly as satisfying as I would've initially hoped they'd be. There is some neat psychological ambiguity lightly sprinked around, but most of the story is rather standard sci-fi fare.While you wait for the game to reveal its next story nugget, you'll traverse through some pretty arid environments and do a lot of jumping. And I do really mean a LOT of jumping. Most of the actual gameplay in Endless Planet consists of jumping and platforming, and it ends up being more of a nuisance than interesting or rewarding in any way. I feel like majority of the bouncing around could be replaced with just bog-standard walking sections, and the game would work a lot better. A few simple puzzles also felt a bit hastily thrown together.Lifeless Planet is heavily banking on the player finding its story worthwhile, but at least for me, it just didn't hit home at all. The most interesting facets of the story are hardly explored at all, and the least interesting ones are shoved into the limelight and paraded around. I just can't root for this one.			"

												Despite of its rather mediocre graphics, Lifeless Planet is an atmospheric and immersive game that has an intriguing, touching story backed up with some excellent soundtracks.It’s one of those games that grabs you right from the beginning and doesn’t let go till the end. On the technical side, Lifeless Planet is bug, glitch free, and it runs pretty smoothly even at 4K resolution which makes the visuals look much better. I can recommend this game to those who appreciate unique sci-fi stories and enjoy exploring extraterrestrial worlds.			"

												I kind of feel bad giving Lifeless Planet a negative review since I really wanted to like this game. I did like the original concept, the atmosphere background design of scenery was incredible and the storyline was mildly interesting. However, I can’t find the redeeming qualities to give the game a positive review for the price tag of $20. Game gets very repetitive, the puzzles are ridiculous and just plain simple. After a couple hours of jumping from one rock to another I started getting bored and losing interest.   Most frustrating was the pause screen with the New Game option I accidently hit once or twice, having to start levels from the beginning.  Overall, buy the game if it’s on sale, you might get a couple hours of fun out of it.  "

												First of all, the bad sides: the graphics are not that good, the control mechanics are sometimes frustratring (it's closer to driving than walking, sometimes) and some parts of the story are not so well connected (developers? that would be a nice thing to improve, no more ""i finish this stage, black screen and then I'm in a place that looks different from the one a second before).Why am I giving a positive review, then? Because the game is good! The story is fascinating and uncovered step by step. The conclusion may be a little ""simple"", but as it's mixed with the thoughts and the feelings of the protagonist, you won't notice it that much.It's more than four hours of discoveries and adventure, with a good background music that helps you keep playing and playing and getting a little anxious in some key moments and so on.It's a good game.If you're scared by the (few) negative reviews, just wait for a sale, but if you like adventure games, you really should consider picking this one.

												First off I would like to say the thumbs up is very much conditional upon the asking price. The appropriate price needs to be in the five to six dollar range, and this is very much a run and done affair. There is not much in the way of replay on offer in this particular title. You will probably finish it in four to five hours, and after that you will probably never touch the title ever again. Those four or five hours however are pretty decent gaming hours. The developer has gone to some lengths to keep the experience fresh throughout, and while the game is not gorgeous by any stetch of the imagination. It certainly has its moments. The same holds true of the sountrack and sound effects. The controls are somewhat floaty, but I am sure that is by design, and the interface is actually pretty bad, but like I said this is a four to five hour long game. So compound that with no inventory management, and what you get is something you cannot possibly get frustrated with. The game is over before you even get a chance to get frustrated. That said this game falls terribly short in one respect. The story is just good enough to get you intrigued, but after just a couple hours of playing. You will see the intrigue has degenerated into pure drivel. No character development, almost no plot to speak of, and the storytelling itself is atrocious. Everything is disjointed from beginning to end. Which can be an asset at the beginning of a story, but becomes a serious liability if it is allowed to persist. The games story will leave you feeling ambivalent or terribly unsatisfied. This is merely a good enough game. It is more good then bad. Its greatest asset is its novelty. Its greatest liability is that it is underdone. It will however hold together for the four to five hours you will play. That said it could have been so much more. There is the seed of a great game here. Had the developer been given the resources and the time. This could have been a great game rather then an okay game. Buy it as an okay game at the right price, and you will most likely not be disappointed.  "

												Slow Pacing, uninspired platforming and a serious lack of any kind of challenge. I watched a let’s play of the early access version of this game (kurtjmac) and decided to jump right in to the full version as I love sci fi mystery games.  I wish I had just waited and watched the full let’s play to satisfy my curiosity. The trailer is a fantastic teaser for a game that drops dead as soon as first early access chapter is finished.This game is DULL. It peaks early with the abandoned town and then it slowly drains all the wonder and drive out of the story with predictable platforming, boring action and empty character interactions. Oxygen is a joke, you are told that you have 8 hours oxygen upon filling up at a tank but I’m certain that you could leave the game running for days and it would not run out. But it just so happens that It immediately *runs out* as soon as you are within sight of a refuel point. This along with the temporary jetpack fuel powerups, that also immediately run out once you have completed the soul sucking large jumping sections only add to the predictability of this game. The puzzle sections are just as coincidental too. Need a way to climb up on that ledge? Don’t worry I’m sure there is a perfectly rounded rock nearby that will be happy to help.After 2 hours I didn’t care about finding out what fantastic twist awaited me at the end as from what I could make out it was just going to be a disappointing as the journey.This game will suck a lot of people in with a great trailer and an even better early access teaser, I recommend you give it a miss and satisfy your curiosity by just watching a let’s play instead.Edit* I've just realized how ironic the name of this game truly is Edit* Ha had a total brainfart with the use of ironic above			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed Lifeless Planet. It was a fairly long game considering the price. What stood out the most for me was the sharp controls and mysterious storyline that kept me wanting to see more. The environments vary greatly and really did a good job at making me feel isolated in a “foreigner” sort of way. I felt like an explorer and each new level I encountered showed me something new. Lifeless Planet was a nice break from the typical game genres out there and I’m sure that most people can appreciate it the same way I did.    "

												I didn't regret the purchase as much as I regretted the time I lost to this game.It's not that it's awful. It's not. It just mediocre in the extreme.The platforming is bad. You handle like a vehicle, not a man in a spacesuit. Jumping feels ridicuously rigid for a platformer, as you have no control over where you land once in the air. You move SO SLOW and have to walk SO MUCH. There's no real challenge beyond holding down 'w' and pressing 'space' at the right time. The visuals look worse than most indie games. Environments are bland (with a few exceptions). Character models are ROUGH in the extreme, with matching animations.The story was the most disappointing aspect for me. I can handle all of the above, but in return I was expecting a well-told, complex, engaging story. What I got was awkward cutscenes, silly almost-scifi, and a few good atmospheric hints at a greater narrative (that we're never really told). By the time I realized the game would never reach its potential, I was two hours in. I figured it was almost over and I might as well beat it. It lasted two more gruelling hours. Every time I would approach a goal I begged the game to be over, but no, it had more poor scripting to forcefeed me. The reviews praising the story and atmosphere are shocking, and I have no idea what those reviewers were playing, but it wasn't this.If you must get it, don't pay more than $5. Less is better.			"

												Lifeless Planet is the sort of game that is the reason why I don't start writing recommendations for games until I've completed them. If I had written my review after only playing the first hour of the game it would've certainly been a positive, but after playing the rest I just can't bring myself to do it.Before I get into why this is the case, I feel it's important to actually tell what the gameplay is like, because the store page doesn't really do it justice. It sort of vaguely makes it out to be an adventure or exploration game, but what Lifeless Planet really is is a fairly linear platformer. That isn't inherently a bad thing, and at the beginning of the game it works fine, only occasionally marred by poorly placed jumps where you have to choose between jumping without using the jetboost and not jumping far enough or jumping with the jetboost and soaring past the platform because of the awkward placement in relation to the planet's gravity. But later on in the game they seem to decide that exploring a Mars-like planet with desolated Soviet architecture with audiologs explaining the history isn't interesting enough, and so for about the last 1/3 of the game it spirals into a nightmare of pitch black darkness where you just fumble around until something impales you and you start over turned around facing the wrong direction at the checkpoint to make you even more lost, or randomly guessing which direction you can move in that won't instantly incinerate you. There's a very good reason why these levels are only shown once in the store page's screenshots.The story suffers the same fate, unfortunately. What begins as an interesting story of a doomed planet and a failed Soviet experiment suddenly devolves into a mess of nothing, with ideas like the protagonist's wife or a woman potentially being the planet's cure being tossed around and randomly introduced at moments that seem important enough that you think they might actually drive the plot along only to be immediately forgotten about a few seconds later. It feels like they had a bundle of ideas for stories from multiple people on the development team but none of them could decide which to include, so it just starts five stories and doesn't adequately end any of them. Ultimately, it's just hard to recommend this game. Even though it's only six hours on Earth, on the Lifeless Planet it feels like at least double that because of how tedious the platforming gets in the darker levels. The graphics have improved enough in the Premier Edition that the game looks nice when you can actually see it, but there are still some noticeably bad models even in extremely prominent places like the model of Aelita, the only other character in the game. The game occasionally toys with the idea of being a survival game, with multiple points in the game featuring the player running low on oxygen at scripted points and having to traverse to an oxygen refill station, but it never really does anything with it. The whole game left me feeling like I would've been having a lot more fun if they had just dropped me off back at the opening Soviet station and let me explore and try to find a way to survive on the planet while exploring and reading the backstory logs, instead of actually slogging through the mess of a campaign that's there instead. You could maybe have a good time just replaying the first few hours over and over and restarting when you reach the first night segment, but otherwise Lifeless Planet is just a hollow disappointment.

												Lifeless Planet is a beautifully atomspheric adventure game, throwing you in the space suit of an astronaut who, after a long journey through space, reaches a mysterious planet in search of life & potentially a new home for humanity. On arrival, you discover you are alone, isolated on a planet seemingly devoid of life, yet strangely there is a Soviet town abandoned long ago. How can this be & what has happened here? As the story unfolds, & you explore more of this intriguing alien world, you soon realise there is a much more going on than meets the eye. The planet is not as lifeless as it seems...The sense of exploration, uniqueness in the alien world along with the snippets of story that you unlock through your progression was most enjoyable & kept me wanting to progress to reveal more.Sound effects & musical score were also strong, & graphically there is also a cool film grain effect & blurring of the edges of the screen that add greatly to the experience. Would have been epic in first-person view to really enhance the claustrophobic feel of being stuck in the space suit on an alien world.For those who love their Sci-fi movies, you will also come across many scenes throughout that feel somewhat familar (in a good way), yet meld together well. Futuristic yet retro, reminding you of old classic 50-60s B-Grade Sci-Fi, cold war era themes & some modern storytelling elements. When looking past these positives there are some parts of the game that I found lacking from making this a really excellent game. The controls for one, although basic & suitable for the layback style of gameplay are awkward. It is easy to mis-jump, your jetpack is limited in function (essentially only providing a double-jump type mechanic to traverse larger areas) & the puzzle elements feel somewhat clunky & difficult to complete. Even though the puzzles themselves are rather simple. It also didn't help things when you respawn (this will happen a lot!) facing the wrong direction all the time is very disorienting.Dark, creepy sections that occur in several stages are way too dark, with only a tickbox option to lighten the scene in menus. You have a flashlight, but does little which is most frustrating at times. It really needs a gamma or brightness slider.There are also the 'emersion breaking' elements, such as there always being an oxygen tank just when you need it, or dynamite just near where you need to blow your way through a blocked path or a nice round rock (unlike anything else in the surrounding enviroment) just at the right spot to jump to a higher platform. It seemed to lack some creativity in level design in this regards when elements like this are introduced essentially just for the sake of it.Most cut-scenes are limited being less than 30secs with most of the story elements experienced through translated logs found. This felt like a bit of a missed opportunity to really expand on the adventure; still good overall (& I am being picky to a degree) but could have been exceptional if the story continued as strongly as it began!Some later sections of the game feel padded out, with no real content or interesting things to see, just more running & jumping. Other parts are really awe-inspiring so it quite a mix. Some of the final levels just seem to go on & on without any purpose other than to lengthen the game. The experience would have more impact if the overall length was reduced by maybe 30% or so in my view. While shortening some areas, some larger cut-scenes & more back story to your character (only touched on for most of the game) would have been great!Although not quite as good as my expectations coming into Lifeless Planet, I still thoroughly enjoyed the story, the implications of the story (not to give anything away) & the final reveal. It was an interesting conclusion. Overall a fun & occasionally disturbing experience!If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations! "

												The game looked very interesting at first. However, the biggest issue is that the puzzles are very easy. The content was just ehh due to the fact that it is all spoon fed to you. Honestly, the game isn't worth 20$. ** Spoiler:When you get to the end of the game its just a city and the game ends. You literally go through only 6-10 different stages and its mostly just running. Nothing more.The game would be worth it if it was a 10$ game, but 20$ is just bleh. Mainly due to the fact that once you beat the game, there is no purpose to it anymore.			"

												In Lifeless Planet players hop into the moon boots of an astronaut on a mission to a far away planet in search of the abundant life their preliminary scans have shown should be there. Unfortunately, as they almost always do in games, something goes wrong. The ship crash lands. The themes brought up throughout the game, some subtle, some not so much, are widespread and generally effective. Our space-faring scientist has to deal with loss, loneliness, self doubt, the prime directive, and more.Something immediately noticeable about Lifeless Planet is that it has fantastically rich and convincing atmosphere. While the graphics leave something to be desired from a purely technical standpoint, the visual and aural direction really sell the whole thing. Some of the alien vistas are truly beautiful, and walking around the seemingly endless barren deserts feels as isolated and alone as being on the other side of space should.Unfortunately Lifeless Planet doesn't make exploring as rewarding as it should be. The game offers a lot of nooks and crannies for the player to poke into, but very few actually offer anything interesting. They tend to be empty corners, without any remarkable features at all. The game also has very few collectibles; just a handful of geological samples and scientific notes.With no combat to control the game's pulse, Board opts for a mixture of ambient storytelling, platforming and physics puzzles.Most of the platforming isn’t difficult because of complex timing or dangerous obstacles, it’s difficult because the controls were meant to act like a guy in space. Lifeless Planet is a really fun experience, but not a very good game. I’d still recommend it based on the entertainment I got from exploring the mysteries of the game’s world, but I wish I didn’t have to deal with questionable puzzles and mechanics to do so. I think it is unique enough to be worth its asking price for those that are fans of the genre though. Overall 7/10.			"

												One of the tags on the store page for Lifeless Planet is ""Walking Simulator"".  Now I don't enjoy walking simulators and I'm unsure if this is one or not.  It does involve quite a bit of walking, but also a generous amount of jumping, jet-packing and puzzle-solving.  I'd say it is as much a 3D platformer as a walking simulator.


YouTube™ Video: Lifeless Planet 

			Views: 81		

			Two minute of Inferno Level		

I found the jet-packing segments to be the most fun.  Our hero doesn't always have access to the full abilities of his jet-pack due to a lack of fuel.  The fuel is storyboarded to run out at certain sections of the game, it's not some resource that you can carefully manage to make other parts of the game easier.  It's designed so you can jump higher and further on the platform-type parts of the game and afterwards it becomes depleted.The puzzle difficulty isn't too perplexing.  The couple of puzzles that had me stuck meant that I just needed to explore the area a bit further until I found an item or a switch that created part of the solution.  Due to the game not having a great difficulty level it's a fairly relaxing affair, I found myself playing the game last thing at night to unwind a little.  There's a great atmosphere in the game backed up with some really nice ambient sound effects that demand the volume be dialled up a notch or two.The graphics are pretty nice looking with the exception that a lot of the textures for the surroundings are fairly low-res.  This becomes apparent when the camera is close up to them, from afar the world looks quite impressive.  The hero is really nicely detailed, especially the reflection from the visor on his space helmet.It took me about seven hours to complete the game at a leisurely pace.  I found myself picking it up and playing it for about an hour at a time.  The game holds a couple of achievements that increase the replayabity somewhat.  One is to complete the game under four hours and the other is to complete the game without dying.  I'll probably attempt these soon.  I'm not sure how I will fair!			"

												Lifeless Planet isn't what I'd call a ""bad"" game, but it's just one that's solidly mediocre.  I suppose that's why I don't recommend it.  The pacing is poor, the graphics look extremely dated with repeated textures, repetitive terrain, and very poor human models and animations.  The story isn't particularly engaging and ended up predictable, with some early-on mysteries which quickly were answered in a sadly rather un-interesting way.Be prepared to hold down your walk button continuously with awkward jumping intermixed for about 5 hours without much of a payoff.  Again, it's not a terrible game, but your time will be much better spent elsewhere.			"

												Let's be clear here: I didn't dislike this game, but I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone, either. The love and care of a single man is shown in beautiful atmospheric music and, occasionally, the environments. However, this isn't enough to carry the whole game.PROS:- As I mentioned, GREAT music and occasionally magnificent environments- Draws you in- Interesting story- Enemies are awesomeCONS:- The jump and the fact that the game is built around it- Put the rock in the hole puzzles- Very noticeable changes in quality- Poor pacingLifeless Planet's first hour drew me in; I wanted to find out more about the mystery. I was genuinely curious. But as the game continued, bits of story were more and more sparse and rapidly decreasing in cohesiveness. By the end, I found the story component of the game intriguing but not quite satisfying.My first impression of the graphics were that they were pretty mediocre; in fact, I even thought the game looked pretty ugly in one of the first few environments, approximately an hour in. Then, suddenly, the next level was gorgeous, colour-rich, and stunning to look at. Unfortunately, the game kept going back and forth between beautiful and meh scenery. While the music really helped me enjoy the game, the change in quality sometimes broke the immersion.But man, were the enemies cool. I loved them. I won't give anything away, but if you're into interesting enemy design, you'd probably like this game.My least favourite part of this game was the jump (as well as the mechanical arm, but that part felt rushed and rather dumb). The jump was SO annoying that I became increasingly frustated with the mechanics of crossing a simple path. Some environments paired with the jump simply did not work, and it was infuriating just how simple the platforming I was screwing up was. Even the extended jet-pack time mechanic, by far the most fun thing in the game, kept being taken away at convenient times after I'd stopped needing it; same with the threat of running out of air. It doesn't seem real, but like it's an in-game scenario. The puzzles were occasionally interesting, but were basically never challenging, which saddened me. Some moments in this game were really cool, but it feels like a mixed bag.In the end, I liked this game somewhat. The story definitely had some interesting parts, and I was invested enough to want to battle the jump out to the end. I'm not completely satisfied, but I am hopeful for what the creator could make with more money and resources.			"

												If you'd like an interesting sci-fi mystery, I don't recommend this game because there is a lot of running and jumping.If you're interested in a platformer, I don't recommend this game because the running and jumping are bad.Don't let the screenshots fool you, they are pretty much everything you'll see in the game, the rest is just runnig for a long time.

4/10- An interesting story... for the first hour or so.As you play the game, at first it feels kinda interesting, a space-themed mystery game, but as you play along it becomes pretty clear that it's a direct path. There's literally nothing of any importance except the main game and a few secrets. That's it. There's nothing that makes you think ""Oh, that's cool, let's check it out, there might be something in there"", it's either ""I need to go in there if I want to progress"" or it's ""Oh, more nothing"". Take the soviet town; You can enter only one house, and that's because you need to enter it to progress. There's a windmill, because it's part of the story. It's a highly linear game. I can't recommend it, but I can't say it was exactly bad either. I will however caution against buying it.It's good to know what you're stepping into when you buy something.Pros: -Interesting for a while.-Cool atmosphere.Cons:-Super linear-No side content-Blender-made rendering is kind of underwhelming and while I usually don't judge a game by it's graphics, they kind of became almost unbearably simple.

Early Access Review
								Last week i got my wisdom teeth removed and wasnt able to go to school for 1,5weeks. So I buyed a bunch of early access games, because I had a really boring time. From all the games I played through I liked Lifeless Planet the most. This game has sooo much potential to become a really, really good game. The following list is a pro/con list that refelcts my opinion about the game so far:Pros:-On highest graphics the game looks so awesome, its like watching a movie at some parts. For example, there is a part where you walk across a waterfall and 2 rainbows. looks fantastic! another detail I like about the graphics is that your helmet refelcts your surroundings, it looks really real at some points.-The game is a nearly perfect mix of adventure, puzzle and jumping, sometimes it feels like an open world game, too. Because of all the mixed genres the game never became boring when playing.-I really, really love the music. Its awesome! normally I listen to my own music while playing videogames, but as I heard the first music in the game I shut my own off.-Features Game Pad-The story is not clear, so the whole game I was thinking about the things that happend in the game, how the story will go on and stuff like this( I dont want to spoiler content so examples are kinda hard).Cons:-A bit buggy, but its the beta and the early access, so I cant really complain about this I think.-The beta is way to short ;o)-The checkpoints and respawn points are a bit annoying since the game doesnt feature steam cloud yetBugs I found:-At the power station mission I sometimes bugged through the ground and died when I jumped and attemted to land-Got stuck in a rock one timeSuggestion for improvement:-Add achievements-Could be a bit more open world with some easter eggs or hidden things to find-Add a multiplayer/Coop-Add a H2O indicator maybeConclusion:Really awesome game, if the full version is going to be like the beta (but with a bit improvement, achievements, bug fixes, maybe Steam trading cards and a longer story) I would buy the game for 50€, too.Please keep up the great work, i cant wait to play the whole game!!!If some parts are grammatical incorrect or if some parts are hard to understand then im sorry, Im german and my english is only on an average level.

												I did not enjoy this game nearly as much as I expected I would.Lifeless Planet is exactly that: a barren, lifeless planet; basically the least interesting envrionment you could possibly think of. Of course it's not really lifeless, because there's the whole soviet village thing. The first several areas are really pretty dull (baren, lifeless planet), but things do start to get more mysterious. Unfortunatly, my interest in the plot died about as quickly as the Russian colonists. Lifeless Planet quickly becomes Follow-the-Radioactive-Soviet-Pixie-Dust Simulator as you track the trail across a seemingly enless expanse. The voiced plot-points are predicible and the collectable documents read like a bad 70's alien invasion/Cold War crossover movie.I probably would not have noticed/cared about the weak story if the other parts of the game were better than they are. Aside from a noticible smattering of death-related glitches, there are a number of game mechanics that don't work well of don't make sense. Calling them out may seem nit-picky, but by their powers combined, they really detract from the quality of the game:-When transitioning into a new scene that should be geographically adjacent to the previous scene, the scenary changes as if you traveled a distance between scenes with no apparent explaination-A burst from your jetpack at the right time can save you from hitting the ground too hard... unless of course you're falling into the valley that isn't part of the trail you're supposed to follow, in which case you die before you hit the ground to prevent you from going out of bounds-The character is capable of pushing around boulders that are as tall as he is, but requires three sticks of dynamite to clear a blockade consisting of a couple of packing pallets and a barrel-You can only deply the robotic arm in very specific situations (i.e. puzzles)The only thing that I actually like about Lifelss Planet is the robotic arm. The specialized GUI is the envy of my inner Kerbal cargo engineer.In conclusion: if you're looking for graphically appealing exploration/mysterious story walking simulator, I strongly reccomend Dear Ester. If you're looking for a retro sci-fi mystery/adventure, read Space Cadet by Robot Heinlien. If you need an example of a game that was good in theory but was poorly executed, add Lifeless Planet to your list of references. Fun: 4/10Challenge: 6/10Bang for your buck: 4/10Overall: 3/10			"

It's mostly just jumping and avoiding deadly root-bushes, but what matters is the story. I can't tell much more not to spoil it though. As an american astronaut, you travel onto a foreign planet, that could serve as the next Earth. But you discover so many strange things that you might wish to have stayed home.

												In this game you control an astronaut who appear to have been lost. You think it must be the case of a landing mission going awry but soon you discover the planet you have found is not only full of barren wastelands but human-made buildings pop-up here and there. While the story is simple it is delivered well and introducing man-made structures only adds to the mystery you need to uncover.The good:graphics & music - rather simple with some ugly textures here and there but I always appreciate when the creators utilise everything they have at their disposal and manage to create diverse environments. The lava-filled valley, the area called ""hot springs"" with its deadly geysers and the alien structures with their green beams all look stunning. The accompanying music has a minimalist, ambient-like approach that fits the atmosphere perfectly.The bad:puzzle solving & difficulty - this is mainly a platformer which means you'll jump a lot. Later sequences introduce more difficult areas where you have to carefully time your jumps. Once your jetpack fuel is extended you can jump at greater distances. However, the game removes this function occasionally to make certain areas more difficult. This feels like an easy way to make the game more challenging as the puzzles are simply way too easy to solve. Perhaps this new ability should have been introduced at a later stage in the story.Also, you walk a lot. And sometimes this is what makes you stop and unable to proceed. You just don't know what you need to activate or where that item you need to pick up is. Then you go searching and walk almost endlessly. Yes, you can look at the gorgeous scenery but it gets boring after a while. The game takes several hours to complete but a great part of it consists of walking and while running is set default it is not very fast.The conclusion:I do not often play platformers so Lifeless Planet was a refreshing experience for me. It has its mediocrity and some people surely expect more so you may be disappointed in it especially if you're fond of the genre. If, however, you like sci-fi games with a mysterious story and great atmospheric music Lifeless Planet is a great addition to your library.			"

Early Access Review
								This game has been on my radar for over a year now, and was waiting in anticipation for it to be released, and i was definitely not disappointed.You play as an American astronaut that is on a mission to find out if there is life on this distant planet. The game starts you off in the middle of nowhere, right next to your space pot. it's your job to explorer this world and find out what is going on. The areas and sound effect really make this game stand out for me. while you are alone.. at first. you always have this feeling that something is about to happen. It is not a scary game, but has definitely got that suspension of something might happen to me at any time in this game. i don't want to spoil anything at this point about the game in terms of story and events. But if you like a game where you explorer and solve puzzles. while also having a story told to you. Then this would definitely be something you should pick up.			"

												I had high hopes for this game because of what it was compared to, Gone Home and Dear Esther, but it was really underwhelming. The “gameplay” consisted of simple puzzles and jumping awkwardly with a jetpack. I really wish they just forgoed gameplay instead of trying to shoehorn in bad puzzles. But my least favorite part of the game was how lifeless all the environments were. I mean it’s called Lifeless Planet but come on, make it somewhat interesting. The environments were so bare they felt more like rooms to hold ♥♥♥♥♥♥ puzzles than places to explore. And each level felt like the last just with a different color filter. I also felt like the story was poorly tied together. I got the gist of it but it felt like the narration was so few and far between it left the story feeling segmented and fractured, in a bad way, despite the fact that I played it all in one sitting.

												It was a nice and short experience. However the journey itself was quiet a fickle one thanks to the controls or rather how the character moves around. I played this game solely with a gamepad, so I don't know how playing with the keyboard feels like. But even with an analog stick, the character you play, moves rather stiff and that becomes most certainly noticeable during platforming from point A to B on narrow space without safe drop distance or walls to catch your momentum from jumps.Yes, the protagonist is an astronaut and wears a space suit, so him moving around like this is arguably a logical assumption. But I say, logic gets thrown out the window once certain elements get introduced into the plot. So...Overall, the game is okay. The graphics are decent but nothing outstanding. Certainly nothing you have play or that leaves a long lasting impression on you after finishing it. At least you feel statisfied after playing it.A thumbs up, but only recommended to those who are fine with spending money for no ryhme or reason			"

												Dont buy this if you want a game that challenges your skills, i even have doubts calling it a ""game"".This is something different, you are not actually buying a game, you are buying a story or a experience.The graphics are honestly very dated, the music is good, the controls are strange, they are responsive but sometimes is hard to make precise movements.However, the enviroment is great, you are alone in a strange maybe hostile planet, and it feels like it, the graphics are not very good, but they manage to fulfill their purpouse, there are some beautiful landscapes, and you always feel you are in a very big desolated place.You get very few lines of story, you almost dont get information for anything, but these few lines they feed you every now and then, manage to keep you thinking and wondering, there is suspense, mistery and there is always a feeling of despair.I bough this game believing there was going to be in a soviet enviroment, with  lots of communist emblems or ruins, but there are very few of those, i dont want to spoil anything, but if you want to see communist style towns or cities, you will be dissapointed, i bough it because of the communist premise, but you get very few of that, however, the story was good enough to make me forget about it.I do recommend it, because i was really hooked up into the story, i wanted to keep going to see the ending of it, so even with all the complains, if it manage to keep me entertained, i believe is goodThere is some plataforming, a few easy puzzles, and a great atmosphere, if you like sci fi, this may be for you.

												The first 30 minutes are brilliant.The next 3 hours are painful. I was ready for this game to be over about half-way through, when instead of being an intriguing story about an abandoned soviet settlement where there shouldn't be one, the game became a hackney-ed story about some random woman. The plot development and writing thereof is cringe-worthy. To the developer I would say, follow the first rule of writing: don't tell it. Show it.The game mechanics themselves are boring. I enjoyed jumping and running when that wasn't the whole thing that the game was about. 30 minutes in, the story has shot itself in the head and jumping and running is all that is left.Would not recommend.

												I wasn't impressed, and I'm glad I bought the game on sale. It is not worth the $20 price tag.It's a paltry 4 hours to complete the main story, if that. It certainly doesn't merit a second playthrough to get all of the achievements. The story itself is trite, boring, and predictable.The trailer implies it is an exploration heavy game, and while the world is technically open, there isn't a lot to see. In reality, it's extremely linear, with little to no point to deviating from the path that's obviously laid before you. There are minerals to find and story background, but neither are interesting enough to bother with. The graphics are jarringly bad. Somewhere in the era of Dreamcast/original Playstation. This creates two issues. One, it made platforming difficult in some areas, as it was difficult to see where I was supposed to go or what exactly I should be trying to land on. Two, in an exploration, ambience heavy game the graphics were a huge roadblock to immersion.			"

												I liked the premise - being alone in an unknown world. Sounded good, so I bought it..Not much game here though.Gameplay involves walking from A to B. The ""challenge"" is jumping chasms here and there, and there are a few ""electrical puzzles"", that anyone should have no trouble figuring out... There are a few enemies, but they are rooted and you walk around them.There is a story, but it's pretty basic. If you aren't new to gaming and media in general, you've heard it told before.Graphics are super basic, controls are unresponsive and don't feel great, and the level design is dull - without polish. You can't explore anything, and there are invisible walls everywhere.I only completed it beause I paid too much money for it, and it was a chore doing so. Apparently it took me 4.7 hours. No replayability.TLDR; A walking simulator that boxes you into dull areas, with a boring story (thankfully it's short).20€ for this is just insane. 5€ might also be too much, in my opinion at least.

												Dated graphics, awkward level transitions that make no sense, uninteresting landscape, linear world and solutions, and some frustrating platforming. This game is all about platforming, and only platforming. Even at 50% off it was too expensive. Maybe for $5 it would be worth it.It tries to combine platforming with story, and fails in both. By the time you hit the dead forest the story's been told and there is no point in continuing. it should have ended there instead of dragging on without purpose. Overall, I felt no sense of reward with any accomplishment. Just disappointment.Controls are awkward and movement clumsy and difficult to control. platforming on giant  dead dandilions felt like playing hopscotch with an elephant.

In this game we'll travel through a seemingly empty planet, only to realize that something happened and it's not as dead as we imagined.SpaceWalking Simulator?    We'll have to walk a lot, yes, we'll really have to walk long distances completely alone with a relaxing soundtrack in background, which reminded me a lot of Shadow of the Colossus, making long journeys from an objective to the next.

This characteristic could be interpreted as something dull and boring, but it's the complete package we have to judge: environment, music and story. Those three aspects form a symbiosis which amazes the player.    About the gameplay: it's simple, with the low gravity of the planet as an ally and jumping to each goal. Other than a few puzzles, we won't find any big problems; this game is more focused in ""appreciating"" than ""thinking"".  Prepare for amusing chasms    The game features beautifully crafted environments in which we'll be able to appreciate the inmensity of the place and realize that many times the lack of life doesn't mean lack of beauty. As I said before and I'm not getting tired of repeating, the scenery which we'll stumble upon are impressive, really a piece of art.    Going through all kind of environments, from big deserts, old craters, to abandoned towns, lava-filled volcanoes and patrified forests, to mention a few.    The lighting gives a special touch which we won't be able to forget, it's sky is almost always clouded where only some rays of sunlight can go through, which makes you feel the end is nigh and your time is accounted for, which is no doubt a decisive factor to involve us in the story.Take it easy dude…    Tranquil, and really quiet, with only a few abrupt changes to accelerate the game. If you're looking for a game with lots of action, violence or something alike, this is not the game for you; you'll probably quit after a few minutes.    It has a rich soundtrack which perfectly accompanies the gameplay, and the ambiance sounds really make you feel like you're in the game. This was all made by Rich Douglas, who also worked in the sountracks for Insurgency and Takedown. Douglas manages to jump from total calm to frenzy without any complications, moments where he conveys happiness and other moments where we'll be invaded with a feeling of adrenaline which makes us be alert.    Lifeless Planet is that game you need when you come home tired and need to relax, taking your time to play it and taking it to your own pace, appreciating every little thing in it.In the last episode…    David Board, its developer, originally planned the game as an action game, but as development progressed and the story expanded, Board decided to change the game's focus to center on the story. We'll be able to notice how it's inspired in classic adventure games like LucasArts' The Dig, as well as platformer game Another World, and science-fiction movies based upon the Cold War. Board said he wanted to convey a combined feeling of optimism and horror about what science is capable of in the hands of mankind.Victim of a great story and false advertisement (spoilers ahead!)    We're part of a team of astronauts whose mission is to explore a seemingly empty planet. Something goes wrong with the expedition and we wake up from a cryogenic sleep fifteen years after we boarded the ship to this adventure into the unknown.    When we wake up we can't find the rest of the crew and that's where the loneliness starts to take part in our journey. Did the Americans get to the Moon first? Maybe so, but the Soviets managed much more... in a planet! When we arrive we can't find anybody, only the remains of what seems to have been a big enterprise by the Russian. We'll soon realize that this planet is not as lifeless as it seemed in the title, so I'm sorry to have to break the news for you but you've been victim of false advertisement! Irony aside, the place becomes more and more confused as we move forward, with hallucinations about our life on Earth, alien remains and the print of the Russians everywhere. This is where the story truly starts, for we'll soon discover what happened as we search for a way to go back home.    Exploration, which seemed like a big part of the game, regrettably doesn't exist... the game is completely lineal and most of the times the way is forced to make us move forward. Maybe it's because Survival and Sandbox games are increasing in popularity lately, but this game is neither; Lifeless Planet intends to tell us a story, show as a world which is dying little by little. And it achieves it so perfectly.			"

Positives:+ Well done atmospheric graphics - it actually feels like you're out there alone+ Sound effects and music for the most part also contribute to the atmosphere.  There were one or two times I could have done without a particular effect, but for the most part, this was a plus+ Platforming aspects were fun without being incredibly hard+ Puzzles were also fairly simple but enjoyable+ Fairly interesting storyNegatives:- Story is somewhat sparse and disjointed.  There are aspects that could have been expanded on.- Strange/missing transitions.  Having it go from day to night, or a cave to the surface with no transition or cutscene and just a blank loading screen in between felt odd.  - A couple of the jumping puzzles seemed a bit off.  I had to watch a walkthrough on one after getting stuck, only to discover that I was doing exactly what the walkthrough showed, but was dying anyway.  Trying several more times in the exact same manner eventually got me through, but I have no idea why it didn't work the first several tries.-  There's too much straight walking at times, with few if any obstacles, which can get repetitive- The game is fairly shortComments:Like several other games I've played recently, I enjoyed Lifeless Planet, but feel that it's somewhat overpriced at it's regular cost for the amount of content it provides.  It's worth a playthrough, but wait for a sale.Overall Rating: 6.5/10 "

												The disjointed story is interspersed by frustratingly slow progression through vast, mostly empty landscapes.  The 3D platforming puzzles are, again, frustrating at best, beleaguered by an annoying momentum mechanic that will have you toppling over the far edge of platforms even when attempting to move backwards.  The ""conclusion"" is about as satisfying as the last episode of LOST.There are no critical thinking puzzles to be found here, only the occasional platforming.If you really must play it, wait for it to go on sale.

												I thought the concept was interesting and the game looked good, but it could have been much more than it is.This feels more like a follow-the-dotted-line story than an adventure game, though I thought it did a good job at the 'atmospheric' portion of things. The landscapes, 'biomes' and views were pretty cool.  Story was linear and hand-holdy but interesting enough (along with the scenery) for a play through.  There's also little to gain from checking corners, occasionally there's an optional point of interest that doesn't add a whole lot to the story (geology anyone?).What few puzzles exist are rather basic.Often transitions between 'levels' are disjointed. You walk to the entrance of a new area, then you get loaded into a completely different part of the planet, in no way resembling where you were or what you were looking at. No explanation for travel given.Some tension moments are very forced and silly. Filling up on air (""You're set for 8 hours!"") and again running out 5 minutes after is not nail-biting tension, it's annoying. Note that you will only run out of air with an air tank in clear view, I guess this was an 'immersive' way of telling you to walk straight forward. Certain questions are never answered, and I think the answers might have been more interesting than the intended story.Not enough game here for full price, maybe pick it up on sale. I got it at 50% off and not sure it was worth it.  Prepare to jump. A lot. So much jumping...I noticed some comments about the controls being problematic. Just FYI, I used a 360 controller and never had a complaint.			"

Early Access Review
								        When you purchase this game you are essentially purchasing a demo (first 6 out of 20 levels) in which you can easily complete in an hour and a half. This review ONLY covers the first six levels! With that being said, this is the best EAG I've purchased on Steam. This is one of those games where gameplay kind of takes a back seat for the story. It really does have the spirit of classic action-adventure games. There is no life bar, no weapons, and no HUD whatsoever. All you have is a flashlight, a one-time rechargeable boost jetpack (with an exception...), and a robot arm to grab things. From what I have seen so far the game is fairly linear, with some small diverting paths to grab some 'collectables.'           What has won me over to this game is the atmosphere and the mystery of the story (No spoilers, I will be as vague as possible). You start off with one simple mystery: ""Where are my buddies?"" Then it grows to: ""Who is that lady?"" Then it snowballs into: ""What is that thing!?!"" Then the demo abruptly ends… My curiosity has never been so enticed for a game's story in a long long time! Needless to say I really want to play the next levels.         This game is different and I have trouble thinking of a genre to place it in. It's a Sci fi mystery, it has some elements of horror, some elements of plat-forming, and some elements of puzzle-solving. If you are looking for a horror, shoot 'em up, space horror, this is not your game. If you are looking for a story driven, creepy, atmospheric, sci-fi mystery, this is your game. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs a break from typical AAA gaming and who doesn’t want to play anymore 8-bit style indie games (sorry my 8-bit buddies, I need a break from you as well).

												Lifeless Planet surprised me.Actually, the moment the game started and I looked around at the desolation and then took my first steps into the unknown, I knew I was going to love this game.  It just had that kind of promise to it.  And I'm glad to say that playing it was totally worth it.The game starts out innocently enough - an astronaut stranded on an alien planet, looking for the rest of his crew, hoping to survive it all.  But then our hero stumbles into a deserted town and it looks all too familiar, exactly like a scene from Earth: even a Russian flag flies in the alien wind.  Strange indeed, but it's just the beginning of more strange and weird but spectacular things to come on a very personal journey about surviving loss.You can't help but wonder what lies behind the next dune, the next giant doorway, the next turn in the path and where it is all going to lead to.You get to explore the seemingly lifeless planet, learn about what has happened there, using your jetpack in the lowish gravity to get to otherwise unreachable places and solving puzzles by interacting with the environment.  The controls are uncomplicated and the scenery is stunning.Lifeless Planet gets my vote and I'm definitely going back to experience it again.			"

								For some time now, I've been looking for a game in which I can simply get lost in. From what I saw and experienced in this game, I can confidently say that I enjoy the gameplay, I love the atmosphere of it and I have indeed found a game to just jump into and be immersed in its story. One thing that really draws me to this game is the Soviet Union references and the sense that you aren't truly alone.Overall it is a great game with a story that will satisfy your curiosities about where you are, what's going on and why you are here.As of right now the game only has a beta demo, but it has great potential for the full release.

												Lifeless game to be honest. Lovely graphics but the storyline, the challenges, the endless running.. not good. The game desperately needs an autorun option. No monsters so a great game to let your ten year old learn on but all in all a huge disappointment. Definitely not worth the £15.00. If you like 100% linear platform games, if you like endless pressing of the w key, if you like challenges a child could do, if you like lots of reading for no point whatsoever, if you like a boring story which leaves you thinking you really dont care and if you like a game you will finish in a few hours then go for it. Otherwise go buy some new underwear and save yourself some money.			"

												Basically I didn't like it - the game is very short, finished it under 4 hours and more than half of it was simply running - and the half of other half was reading log entries. You might think that I should've been enjoying the scennery - but there isn't much to enjoy, everything is pretty monotonic - starting from orange and brown hills, through grey and black hills and even some blue glossy hills that probably were meant as glaciers, finally finishing with green hills. Graphics of this game were pretty outdated, which would be hard to notice, since most of what you see are rocks and hills, but... well, suffice to say that I've seen better character models in games made ten years ago. And you'd think that gamedevs would put some more work into character models, since there are about THREE of those in the entire game.Dying - dying was pretty annoying. I understand the fact that dropping from 100 feet to the ground is lethal, but seeing me fall and turn into bloodied ragdoll about 30 feet above ground is laughable. Similarly, I understand that stepping into lava is lethal, but ragdolling with the cheerful sound of flatline after one step into a burning rock? Am I to understand that burning your toe causes immediate heart failiure?Well, you might say that this is a story-driven game and what I should look for is good story - and the fact is that story in this game is pretty interesting. But the way it is delivered is, in my opinion, horrible. Voice in this game is used only as single sentences spoken by main character (in plain, monotonic voice) or single words by the Russian girl (which are, obviously, in Russian). Pictures are so confusing that without reading full logs you're not sure what exactly is happening. So to sum up, what we have here is neglegible quantity of voice acting, couple of nice pictures and several pages of text. Good enough for a sci-fi novel, not good enough for a game, not nearly enough for this price.I'd say 4 out of 10.			"

												This was an interesting game to me. I can see why some people wouldnt like it, but I also think it was unnecessarily panned by critics. It does a great job a creating an uncertain and desolate atmosphere, and the sense of adventure and mystery was always present. The world is pretty large, and there is definitely a lot of open space where you are just walking, but visually, those moments still do a lot to please the eye. I wouldnt really call this game difficult at all either. Some of the longer jumps can be challenging, but mostly, this game is about the journey more than the challenge itself. Although it took me about 7 hours to complete, it felt like a lot longer, and not in a bad way. The game does a good job of putting you in the astronauts shoes, and the distanes combined with the relative sense of desolation does a good job of distorting time a bit. The story itself is pretty sparse overall, but well thought out nonetheless. There are really two stories happening simultaneously and they kind of feed off each other. One (the Russian settlement) is resolved nicely and is actually a pretty cool, 1950's sci-fi movie style story with a bit of an environmentalist message. The other story isnt well resolved in my opinion, but also doesnt really need to be. It sort of leaves it up to you to decide on what the story really means....it does carry a message, but it is also vague enough for plenty different interpretations.The actual gameplay involves a lot of running around (a lot), a lot of jumping (utilizing air thrusts for added distance), and the occasional blowing up of or repairing of necessary objects. You are given (about an hour into the game) a portable mechanical arm (like they use in the space shuttles) to help with some of this, and find dynamite every so often as well. Everything has a specific reason for being there in the game (with only one exception), so if you see it and you can interact with it, you need to. There is a bit of doubling back to complete puzzles so you can move on, but for the most part, the game keeps driving you forward and doesnt bog down at all. Since this is story driven (even though it takes a minimalist approach), you are always led to the next stage of the journey smoothly and efficiently.The setting itself was pretty amazing in my opinion. It was a beautifully crafted world. At first, its basically all barren and lifeleess, but as you travel across the planet, you start seeing more evidence of life, until eventually, you find verdant expanses of the wild. The subteranean sections are also really cool, but the show stoppers are when you start finding the alien technologies, and the final few sections are visually mindblowing (at least, I thought they were). This was really a stunningly well crafted world from a visual standpoint.So, as I said before, this game is all about the journey, and for me, it was a journey filled with so many nuances of human emotion, that it siply could not be ignored. My only complaint is that perhaps it is actually a little long, but really, I thought it was a an interesting game. I'd give it a 7.5 out of 10 or 78 out of 100.			"

Early Access Review
								To start of. This Early Access game is a Demo. But don't let that distract you from what a lovely gem it truely is.The game is basically a Story driven walking simulator/platformer. I've read some reviews saying its sort of a puzzler,the only thing that maybe a puzzel to some, is how do i get from A to B. The game is very linea and uses common sence (if there's no path this way, let's take a look that way, or look for some explosives to open a path) if you get my meaning.You Play as an Astronaut, that crash landed presumably on the other side of a lush planet but ended up on an open barron lifeless landscape, all alone and confused you wonder where your crew have all gone, you set of your grand hike to uncover the mystery thats befolded you, with many more questions that will arise.When you first start playing  you may ask your self, ok now where the hell do i go, But with good observation, the path is very clear for you to take. i don't want to go into to much detail into the story, so it's best for you to personally experience it.So far I've only came across one bug in the game, that was from selecting to load a last checkpoint while my character was on an elevator platform, Which resulted in me having to start that peticular level again. due to the fact each time i tried reloading, the Camera was stuck on the damned platform. Visuals and effects - 7.5/10Enviroment sounds - 8/10Voice Acting ( English and Russian) - 9/10Story - (Still a mystery that keeps asking me , whats going on here and who is that lady ) - 10/10At the moment the Game is short, but the way the story is played out, it will keep you wanting to move forward and unconver the truth, that remains unknown.If walking alot and not doing much but jump from here to there is not so much your thing, but you're passionate for unraveling mysteries, then you may want to hold out until the game is complete. Cuz damn i was so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at the end of the demo, only cuz i wanted to find out more as what is actualy going on.that being Said; I still highly recommend that you purchase the game as it is, Solely to help out the development team			"

												What an interesting game!Let me start by classifying this gem as an 'Adventure 3D platformer' :)For the most part of the game you would be looking for and following clues to progress the story and you'll be doing quite a bit of 3D jumping and jet packing to traverse the incredible landscapes (more and more as you progress). i really love the environment depicted in this game; the way they portray the hero in proportion to the landscape, how he move around, tight control, it's truly immersive for me. The screen is completely devoid of 2d overlay (no health bar\no maps\no nothing) and all the clues are embedded to the landscape themselves.Even without the gripping story, i would enjoy traversing thruogh the planet :)it's not perfect though, there are a few detractions that i think may be addressed in the future;- During scene change, your character may move\change position. It can be disorienting.- During night scene, you can easily lose your way because of somewhat repetitive environment.- Some puzzles can get 'stuck', you need to quit and restart the game to overcome this. (i 'ran out' of explosives on one).considering the whole, these are really minor gripes though.i'd give it 7.5/10			"

												Good game if discounted. I think $10 fits the value of the game pretty well. It's definitely an indie game, with lots of rough edges and levels of detail that are occasionally frustratingly lacking. You spend the entire game as a little astronaut man running around this planet with seam-heavy level transitions and a very linear path (not straight but definitely always on a rail). Given the type of gameplay, the linearity is definitely appropriate, it's just that it's a big, dull planet with some pretty ridiculous obviously computer heightmap generated canyons and crevices that steal away any suspension of disbilief. But it does make for some interesting sci-fi. The concept is interesting. It's kind of a movie type of plot where all you do is sit back and learn, slowly, what it is you're looking at. The gameplay is extremely dull, however, because the only challenges, with the exceptional of three or four mini-puzzles, are ""don't jump too far"" and ""*splat!* no not that ledge, the other one"". You have no weapon and there are only about three types of things you can push or carry. That's it, the rest of the time you're running. Run! Run, Forrest, run!With simplistic graphics and limited gameplay, I still recommend the game, but I rate it a 3.3/5.			"

Could not have been more wrong, it was just wonderful. A great little slice of what feels like PROPER sci-fi and I hesitate to spoil anything beyond that. Superb music too. For the work of mostly one person this was very impressive.If I had any complaints - maybe could have done with varying up the puzzles a bit more, and tightened up some of the open-spaces/jumping puzzle bits, but generally speaking, this could well be on my personal top ten of the year. Four carbon based life-forms out of five.			"

On a games market suffocated by videos for people too lazy to think, unproperly named games and done with ridiculous huge budget, the Lifeless Planet it's like an oxigen dose for people with the brain inside, and a proof the money and number of developers does not matter to do the real quality but only passion for a game idea and development.

												I really feel I ought to review this because I really enjoyed it. There's an achievement for spending 10 hours in the game, I know a few people cheat (hex ed) to get it (I dont care, each to their own) - but I truely was having so much fun I spent just over 10 hours in the game (I hexed it to get the 4hr cheev). This made me feel like an interplanetary explorer. The story reminded me of awesome 50's, 60's, and 70's classic sci-fi novels; especially Bradburys The City and The Long Rain. And the monoliths/power sources toward the end lent it a superb feeling of.... I don't even know... mindblownness, a la Clarkes 2001:A Space Odyssey.The soundtrack gave the entire game an incredible feeling of desolation, bewilderment, and heightened the ups and downs of hopeful expectation. The soundtrack (and incidentals) was beautiful, a hecking blessing for the game.The technicalities of gameplay - it all worked. No glitches, no bugs, no issues except my dumbass poorly timing really easy jumps. Framerate dropped occasionaly making it a bit stuttery. Lowering the graphics settings and then turning them back up fixed the framerate issue. The controls are easy, wsad/space/m/q/e/rmbSome people have said Lifeless Planet is like an empty sandbox walking sim - well, yes it is. Thats the point. It's literally called Lifeless Planet because it's about a guy on a ... wait for it... drum roll please... Lifeless Planet. Theres actually a really good story happening on that planet and a pretty resilient little guy to take you through it. Honestly, I barely cared about the story, just walking around that planet was awesome. You can see places far off in the distance and you just know, 'Stick to the path. You've got to find a way home. You go wandering, you're going to die'.The thought that my oxygen could run out was always in the back of my mind but never stressful. It was never (or rarely) a reason to rush. Other games give you survival elements like that and you just have to rush through stuff so you don't die, and you're forced to miss scenery or pick-ups. There's no rushing here. There's a sense of urgency but it instilled (in me at least) a sense of 'let's get this done properly, not quickly'.Originally posted by someone on a steam forum wrote:it's no AAA title however it has bags of atmosphere, exploration and that feeling you rarely get in games - a sense of wonder and imagination with a superb musical score by Rich Douglas. For the price of a couple of drinks you'll easy get 5 hrs gameplay and that's without any replays for acheivements.They ↑ were spot on.I give this 7.5 Terraformed Planets out of 10 "

												I thought I'd just try this out for a minute, and ended up playing it to completion over four hours later. It's that kind of game.Lifeless Planet is about discovering an alien world, with strange Soviet buildings and a mystery that needs to be solved. It is also about a man's personal journey through his past.That's the story. The gameplay is essentially a platformer with a non-Earth level of gravity, with the occasional puzzle thrown in. Along the way you encounter beautiful vistas, as well as some terrifying ones.The world is well built and I only got really lost in the volcano level, everywhere else it was always clear where to go next. Even if it took some time occasionally to figure out what the puzzle was I needed to solve.I find it hard to describe exactly what the draw is of this game, but I am very happy I picked it up and it was definitely worth the hours spent playing it.

												Lifeless planet is about an astronaut whos sent to a planet that is supposed to have life, but discovers something horribly wrong. He must find his own paths through the planet, as he solves the mysteries of what happened and why. Visually, this game is really stunning. I loved the scenery and it was a really nice walk through of the planet. I really liked the storyline, and it was unique. There were some puzzles, but nothing too difficult. My biggest qualm was I'm not a fan of parkour which there's a lot of, but certainly the jetpack you get helps with that. I've played worse games with much harder parkour, so that's not a huge issue. There's a few buggy spots, and times where its difficult to jump just directly on something. However, the game overall is a really nice short game. Probably will take you 4+ hours to beat. There is an acheivement for beating it less than 4 hours so you can always go for that. :P			"

												So as it turns out, the planet is not completely lifeless... cause - well uh – at very least you are technically alive and on the planet. Too bad if you don't get those ham bones a flapping the planet will indeed become a truly lifeless husk. Lifeless Planet is an exemplary game about a planet; once lush an inviting, now dead and barren, with one lone astronaut left to decipher the puzzle and escape nature's benign cruelty. Third-person exploration, with a good deal of platforming while you jump and jet your way across a beautifully eerie environment, and a fair amount of logic puzzles results in a game very worth breathing life into. Don’t wait too long to explore the Lifeless Planet or you will surely miss out on one of the best adventures out there.			"

												I have to admit that I was extraordinarily suprised by this game. I merely bought it, because it wasn't too expensive and the trailer kinda sounded and looked interesting. The main focus in this game is of course the story. And it is actually that story that keeps you glued to the screen for approximately 4 hours, and makes you want to reveal all the secrests of all these mysterious circumstances about an epiditition to an unknown planet. Do yourself a favor and don't read any spoilers, because that would probably ruin the whole game. Honestly, there is not much beside the story.There are are some exploring features in it, but nothing goes beyond the level's borders and except for some stones or minerals, everything that is mandatory will be pretty much laid before your feet. The level structure is pretty straight forward. You can't really miss your goal, and the main thing you will do is jumping and running. At first this might sound a bit boring and not really special. But that's okay, because this game's forte lies in the story and that's why you will endure these countless jump and run passages and all these kilometers that you have to run by foot gladly in order to reveal another part of the story. The animations and graphics weren't too great, not even on the highest settings. While they were able to provide a certain amount of diversity in the different ""levels"" or passages, you can't help but get the feeling that everything seems to be a bit simple and plain.The character animations of everything that was not in a spacesuit (I counted 2 people), were awful to be honest. They really reminded me of N64 games where everything looked like a wooden doll. But even that isn't too much of a problem since you will be mostly jumping and running with your astronaut in his spacesuit , and these animation were more than okay.All in all, I can recommend this game. Especially to those people who enjoy games like the Stanley Parabel and love to dig into a game's story. It probably won't matter if you are a Jump and Run fan or not. As long as you like storydriven games, you will enjoy this one a lot. When I started it today, it kept me glued to the screen for 4 hours straight because I desperately wanted to solve the mystery about this planet and all the strange occurences that accured there. And the same will hopefully happen to you too. "

												It's very odd and unusual for me to not recommend an Exploration Walking Simulator. I usually love all kinds of them.This one couldn't keep me, only reason I kept playing this game is due to the fact that I don't like reviewing games that I haven't finished.Nothing was really happening and the movement/controls was horrible, really jittery and I constantly got stuck in the envoirment, fell off of things and I also fell through the world multiple times.This game is unfinished. To many bugs including random instadeaths, unreasonable invincible walls, and holes in the world that killed me multiple times. And the movement system in general, as I said, is horrible.The game is to linear. Yes, I know this is a walking simulator but it wasn't like they usually are. There was a lack of a beautiful world to look at, lack of any atmosphere really except for triggered sound events and lack of any character. Making the walking through the designated path extremely boring, Dear Esther for example kept me invested. It didn't bore me to death like this one did. Dear Esther told an interesting story and had a beautiful world that kept my screenshot finger ready, this one did not.The character you play has horrible voice acting, no personality whatsoever.I wanted to enjoy the story but I couldn't due to all the other bad factors but the storyline wasn't to bad.This, in my opinion, is far from an adventure game, it's the exact opposite. You can't explore what you want or go where you want like 99% of good exploration walking simulators let you do. You can only follow 1 path, you can only mindlessly walk along the dotted path while pressing W and jumping every once in a while and it gets to boring as I explained earlier.And the graphics, I'm sorry but I can't let this go, this is, graphically, the ugliest walking simulator I've ever played. It looks like it was made in 2003, but no it was developed in 2014 and it has absolutelly horendus graphics, destroying yet another VERY important factor in walking simulators, it needs to have a beautiful world.The price point is extremely high for this low content, horrible, unfinished game. 17$ is unacceptable, it's worth more like 2-3$.I also feel like this game was dragged out to long, the story was more than finished before the actual game ended but it kept getting dragged out through filler content. This game is to long in context of the story.I don't understand how this could also be called a puzzle game, there is no puzzles in this game, I'm sorry but if you call that hook stuff puzzles then there is something wrong with you.Do not buy this game, trust me, I've played my fair share of walking simulators and all kinds of games that are always reffered to as ""not really a game"".This game doesn't hold up. It's horrible and I don't understand how it has so many positive reviews.Great concept for a game, couldn't be more horribly executed.1/10.			"

												An unfortunate case of a game's quality not living up to its potential. The potential I see for a game like this lies in its story and atmosphere, but neither manage to impress all that much.The story is minimal, or at least stretched thin enough to seem minimal, and has the foundation of something compelling. Unfortunately, most attempts to heighten the plot's mystique fall flat in the earlier sections of the game. Really only during the last quarter or so do things become intersting, but by that stage I'd already lowered my expectations for overall narrative quality.Secondly, and arguably more importantly, everything about the game screams that it is an absorbing atmospheric experience. The title itself is a statement of setting, game environments are left wide and sweepingly open, and the camera typically soars right over the player to focus on the vistas surrounding them. The problem is that these environments and vistas really aren't visually impressive. From the barren, stretched textures of the distant hills to the matte, ill-defined features of human characters, the graphical fidelity here is on par with something out of the PS2 era. I was honestly a little shocked to learn this was a 2014 release after being so thoroughly underwhelmed by the visuals.Despite these gripes, it's not like the game is aggressively bad. There are good moments of contemplative silence and solitude, and many of the puzzles and progression bits are logically well thought-out.  In this way, I think this game feels more like a proof of concept in the state it's currently in. It feels half finished; technically functional but not polished at all. I can't recommend it for the $20 price tag, but it is at least worth playing through once if you can grab it on sale.			"

												Not easy to recommend or not recommend this game, if i have a third option I chose between. The story is mostly original and will brings you trough various interesting locations and represent well the materialist communist ideology at the time. Secrets are hanging in the atmosphere but fade away on the last third of the game. I just played to see the end. The controls are acceptable but sometimes pose as the only challenge. I got stuck in the terrain occasionally. Unfortunately what is awaiting you is running and jumping 90% of the time literally, and get lost in the dark. The puzzles if i can call them that (the robotic arm for example) is interesting for someone who introduced to use a mouse and keyboard recently. The game itself is too linear, the player only choice is to follow the path.This is a play once and forget game, no replay value. Still If you looking for something for a day I can recommend it when up on sale only. Just because the story.			"

												This game instantly captured me. It's pretty simple when it comes to gameplay, but goes deeper with story. The game does a great job at making you feel alone and abandoned on this seemingly desolate planet. I can't help but to feel sad for the little astronaut guy. And the mysteries of this game are quite captivating so far, and has left me wanting more. As for bugs, I really didn't find any. When I finished the beta, I wasn't ready to stop. I can't wait for the full version to be released!*UPDATE* Completed my first playthrough. Everything about Lifeless Planet... the story, the atmosphere, the soundtrack, I loved every bit of it.

												I'd been looking forward to playing this game for quite a while, and it was everything I'd hoped for.A simple, short sci-fi outing with beautiful atmosphere and a relaxed pace. It took me 5 hours to playthrough, and that was with LOTS of exploring, and leaving (almost) no corners unturned.Gameplay wise, it's quite straightforward - you can jump and boost with your jetpack. No guns, no shooting. Essentially a 3d platformer set against the backdrop of a beautifully bleak alien planet. A relaxing combo for me personally, which is exactly what I wanted from this game.I found the story itself very enjoyable, however I had one major gripe: Between 'levels', the transition from previous to next scene was more often than not jarringly different, with no explanation. You could be walking down a path towards something, then the game would load the next area which was starkly different, and sometimes it would switch from day to night. The story is delivered via soliloquies and recovered logs.Also, be prepared to get lost often. The path is not always clear, and the puzzles are not exactly well indicated - but this made the game feel more realistic for me!Overall, it was a very satisfying experience, but a little bit rough around the edges in terms of continuity/explanation between levels. Despite it's minor issues, I had a lot of fun playing Lifeless Planet, and recommend it to anyone with a love of sci-fi.			"

												This game kept me going for more than 6 hours.I had so much fun unraveling the Mysteries of that Planet, the game is basically a 'walking Simulator', you walk, you explore, you look at the scenery, you read logs, and you discover and unravel the mystery.[It lacks a lot of cutscenes so far but i didnt have that much fun in a while.] By now that should be done. :)I also like the absence of a Interface, of Weapons and fights, it's nice to just explore and platform a bit.

												Greetings,Lifeless Planet is one of those games that you need to deliver yourself into before it gets really interesting. Seriously, it starts very slowly, some clanky mechanics that might stop you playing but then, you start finding out curious stuff in it. Exploration is not worthwhile but the main goal, which is to find whatever the hell happened to you and your buddies, makes you see and go through a lot of hard terrain. The puzzles are extremely easy to solve but like I said, the fact that you're in a different planet, with erm, interesting stuff lying around, makes it a very compromising game for me. Seriously, I love day dreaming about space travelling and finding life outside the solar system so this game kind of hit that spot in me. Nothing really brilliant but the setting, the goal, the story and I must say, the graphics, make it all worthwhile. Good game.			"

								Amazing, amazing and amazing... This is a jewel, hidden among so many bad ""jewels of the year"" a jewel that will teleport you on a lifeless planet with hidden mysteries that need to be solved in order to move on.The graphics are not next-gen (if u expected that) but they compensate with a deep atmosphere; given by all those game-fx's blend t in such beautiful way that will keep your eyes peeled for a few hours without you knowing it.The story is more then captivating and makes you ask yourself so preety interesting questions that for some persons; with a lower age then 18; would be groundbreaking that would change they're way of thinking or more.For me this is a masterpiece; a game that finds its way inside your head; just to take you for a ride in a beautiful game with awesome atmosphere; gorgeous music; voice acting and interesting secrets that reveal more about the planet.If you are reading this; BUY IT, its worth the price.

												This is a very weak recommendation as i have struggled to try to weigh the positives and negatives of Lifless planet. There are some absolute high moments in the game, but the lows are very low. Ultimately i was dissapointed but not from the gameplay, or game but more from the decisions from the lone designer. Major props again to anyone who takes 3 years of their time to amass such an experince, but in todays indie world collaboration within the community should have steered him towards a much more polished product. Again, im recommending solely if you are a player who enjoys a flawed, yet unique experience. Positives:Atmopshere and sense of lonliness is uniqueEnviroments are mostly the same but different enough to not feel stagnateMusic is an excellant balance between Deus Ex and JourneyControls were tight solid jumping and platformingA very relaxing gameNo hud or mapSome moments can make your hands sweat and others can make you jump out of your seatNegativesNever sold on either storyTextures are terrible, and no shadowsGraphically amatuerish- Should have hired artistsLighting and sky give for some spectacular viewsSimple puzzlesOld ideas need refreshing( tape recorders for back story)PacingWaaaayyyy tooo long(7 hours with exploring)Survival basics are basically ignored			"

												I was afraid that ""search-for-wife"" story shown in trailer will end up in typical psychodelic world of hallucinations. Fortunately game's story is much more than that.Definitely it's not an Open World, plot is completely linear. The other downside is poor quality of human model, fortunately you won't be seeing it up close.Music and audio are superb, landscapes are beautiful, might be influenced by ""Journey"" game - very atmospheric, but somewhat lonely. Story is evolving gradually, it feels like reading a book. Trailer might make it look shallow, don't be mistaken.			"

												Lifeless Planet is an awe inspiring journey that drives the player to pursue the story and traverse the beautiful and mystical environment of an unknown planet.Lifeless Planet is a walking simulator with mixed gameplay throughout, it is engaging but not difficult with scattered diary logs to read distributed on the planet and simple puzzles to complete. This game stands out from the endless supply of indie titles on steam simply because of its story, yes it involves a lot of reading to fully comprehendthe concept but it is done brilliantly and ensures the players attention is captivated right from the introduction. There are numerous platforming scenes where the player must utilise their equipped jetpack which in my opinion, is a key element as it really blends the gameplay and recenteres the games genre of exploration and adventure, plus it's fun and a little bit quirky! The enemies are unique and brew the story, adding to the players curiosity and yearning to unearth the answer to so many unanswered questions. Overall, Lifeless Planet is an excellent atmospheric and captivating Sci-Fi  indie title that I would recommend to  every story lover.			"

												Strangely atmospheric game marred by mediocre, sometimes downright crude, gameplay. Seems to want to be an immersive walking simulator, but is practically a platformer. Lifeless Planet throws you into the role of an astronomer post-crash. The smash cut from the intro video to your character jumping around in the sand is startling, and there is more of that to come. Lifeless Planet has some really odd segues between story and gameplay, cutting to new chapters and new locations without warning. It all gives you the feeling of a half-finished game, a feeling confirmed by the bugs (three times I got stuck in the scenery and had to restart) and the slippery controls. The essence here is the story, well-told and with a Soviet feel that is perhaps the best part of the game - the industrial building design and the voice acting reminding me of the first Pathologic. The atmosphere is unnerving and claustrophobic. But the bulk of the game is walking, lots of walking, and jumping with jetpack. Why do you have to stop and read all the story? It would have been so much better to have it as audio logs. Also why are there some demanding precision-platforming? The control really can't support it. The pacing is all over the place and the second half of the game just drags between tedious ""put the thing in the other thing""-chores and long, taxing walks. Somewhere in the middle of this there is a stark, sometimes scary story and some great atmosphere. With just a few tweaks, and a leaner gameplay, Lifeless Planet could have been a thing to recommend.			"

			Cosmic reviews Lifeless Planet an Indie action adventure game by Stage 2 Studios. Twitter - http://twitter.com/Cosmicengine99 Facebook - http://tinyurl.com/q5vpc63 Twitch -...		

Hello I'm Cosmic and welcome to Lifeless Planet, an Indie action adventure game brought to you by Stage 2 Studios or more specifically Stage 2 studios sole employee David Board. Yep, thats right this game was entirely created by one man in Alaska, an impressive feat to say the least. Lifeless planet tells the story of a lone astronaut who crash lands on his destination planet. Alone and running out of air, its time to go into survival mode, find air and see if any of your crew mates survived. You embark out into the wilderness of the Mars like planet with its red canyons and sand filled landscapes. The sceptical astronaut soon discovers not only scientific wonders on the planet's surface but begins to see and experience things that cannot be explained. You soon come across signs of life, not alien signs of life mind you but instead the remnants of humanity from earth, specifically remnants of a soviet union outpost. This leads the astronaut to question not only if he is indeed on another planet but also if any of this is even real.			"

												Meant to give Lifeless Planet a go since a long time. Started yesterday at last and finished just now.Let me preface by saying I like exploration and slowly uncovering stories through (audio-)logs. If done right it truly can make for great and immersive experiences.Lifeless Planet is only about that. Without spoiling too much, you are an astronaut on a mission to travel to a distant planet and promptly have a crash-landing. From there you start exploring a barren and alien world which from the get-go grabs your attention with alien structures and mysterious occurrences.The story I liked a lot. The one-man team has obviously interest in sci-fi. The pacing is fine but more on the slow-side. You have to bring some patience and be in the mood to walk. But I would not say this is a ""boring walking simulator"". Platforming with your jetpack and light puzzle solving are plenty. There is no shooting but that is just perfect for this game.Given it is a small developer don't go in expecting high-poly models, high-res textures and whatnot. It might deter superficial players at first but I adjusted to it just fine after a couple minutes. One thing which I usually never give too much mind in games struck to me throughout the whole game though. Music, or better lack of therein. Big patches have no background music which made me much more uneasy than I expected. There are some short tunes at certain events here and there but they only emphasize the parts without it that much more. Music is much more important to the overall experience than one might imagine.I don't want to spoil much, so I'll stop here. It has a great story and atmosphere and I was always interested in unraveling more about the world. Loved the ending. Recommend heartily.			"

												I can't remember how much I bought this game , but sincerely I made a beautiful journey.Graphically that's not perferct, but it's  very surprising to see how these landscapes are magnificent.The exploration is the center of Gameplay and scenario put on the curiosity.Frankly do not even look the trailer . when i bought it , i thought it sounds very special and strange and i didn't even know what to expect.(in fact , I forgot everything before I started And honestly i thank my ♥♥♥♥ing memory for that)i was in total confusion , like the main character , our Astronaut.because I loved this game ,I was totally intrigued all along . I wanted to know , what happened on this planet. the story is really the heart of this game""Lifeless Planet is more than just a video game. It's the expression of my passion for creating media that inspires. It's the culmination of years of learning, experimentation, and ambition.I'm trying to deliver something different from what you usually get from the big studios and publishers. As primarily a one man team I know I have to be realistic with my goals, but I do hope to surprise people with what can be produced by a small team with the desire to create something unique and unexpected."" I have trouble to Express my view on this . But you must understand , that not  Innovative gameplay .No , that's an artistical way of video game ,Poetic,intriguing, poignant.I'm exaggerating a little, I guess. because that's not a masterpiece, more better game exist  (like journey) maybe because i love science and Astronaut. It's what dreamed of as a kid.But Lifeless planet is there to tell you a story and He has done a good job of doing so.he'll keep a place of my list of games who marked me profoundly.Admit that's a little messy ,I expressed myself only in 25 %But this little pearl, I enjoyed it so much .I would want to forget everything to start over. and be amazed again(and yes 19 euros , it's too expensive for just 6 hours)OH , I almost forgot to tell you , The sound track is so beautiful, it's so well done for an indie game( and sry if there is mistakes in my English) "

												Really cool game with not revolutionary story, but nevertheless it has very addictive gameplay, easy going story telling, and best of it, it has incredible atmosphere (atleast to me :)..It revolves around a american astrounaut trying to survive on a strange planet after mission (landing) didn't go as planned.. His constant efforts  to find other survivors and exploring puzzling new world..Lifeless Planet gives you the feeling like you are exploring whole new gigantic world even though in reality, it doesn't have ""big maps"" or environment to start with..PRO:- cool graphics (acording to my standards :),- sense of world exploring,- capturing story and plot development,- easy gameplay,- NOT obsessed with classic action cutscenes :).CONS:- controls sometimes are not ""easy"",- not much else really.CONCLUSION:Great game to relax, especially when you are sick and tired of those action packed games like GTA, COD, L4D, NS2 etc. Ending is not quite standard which in the end really worked quite well and refreshing! You could argue that this game is pretty short, it takes around 4 hours of casual play to finish but my opinion is that 4 hours is really enough to enjoy it :), it feels like you are watching a great movie!This is my first adventure/exploring game in a long time that didn't need weapon to survive :) Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

Early Access Review
								Okay, it is early access.  You get six levels (there are twenty) to play with and it took me a little under two hours.  I could probably have done it quicker.I don't really want to say much about the storyline, other than you'll soon come to realise the lifeless planet is and isn't.So, is it good, or is it bad -- or even something in between?To start, the game is fully playable.  The sparse and open environments do lend to a lifeless feel, although the opportunity to explore is very limited and in effect is very much a directed affair.  One shouldn't feel too lost or wondering where and what to do with visual cues.  But like I say, the player is very much funneled.  You can't get lost.  This doesn't mean it's a bad thing.I know in many reviews the atmosphere was highly rated.  Over rated, IMO, but still suitable for the game -- although it does have its moments.  The story elements that are slowly dripped to the player are what count here.  And I have to confess that I wanted to keep playing just to unravel the mystery of the planet.  That was the hook for me, and works very well.I wish there was a maybe button for recommendation.  I don't think it is justifiable to pay ten english sterling for this early access which in fact is (at the end of the six levels is stated as) a demo!  On the other hand, if and when the product is released and the rest of the game is free (or extrememly discounted) then it would be a thumbs up.**EDIT** In case the developer's reply/comment is missed, the full game is given to those who pay for early access.  And that's pretty cool.  The game is intriguing.   But if you're a frugal type, you may well be disappointed with what you get for your monies worth.  On the other hand, if you don't mind spunking a tenner and have a little bit of time to kill then give it a go.It's neither a thumbs up, or a thumbs down.  But, if I had to pick one (and I do)...

												Story, music and voice acting are interesting and well done. The landscape and ""game"" is not - it is very tedious at best, and the interesting puzzles and platforming challenges are scattered too far and few between. You will be doing A LOT of walking across mostly empty space that is truly ""lifeless"". Its more walking and walking and NOTHING happeneing for long stretches of time. I enjoy Indie titles but I suggest passing on this one. They could have made this game a shorter experience and I might have enjoyed it more. The empty landscape and endless walking got too much and felt like a lot of ""filler"".			"

												The atmosphere is beautiful, Good game controls, I loved the different parts of the planet. I wish i was able to take a 15 year exploration on another planet, too lazy to walk everywhere, so i'll be an astronaut in a hoverround Kappa. The story is confusing SPOILERS:  So he goes into the cosmos to come back 200 years and check up on his wife, but he acted like he didnt know the russians were there? I didnt understand why the russians were apart of the story. They died trying to explore or make a new home for themselves, but why?  I'll admit i didnt read all of the logs and thats probably why i dont understand half of it. but i was trying to get the 4h playthrough achievement. So please excuse me from that. But wondering around is quiet and fun. The land is limited, so after one playthrough theres really nowhere else to explore. Its big but invis walls, Anyways its worth the buy.			"

												Tells a very short but interesting and original story. There's a handfull of jumping puzzles and occasional ""press buttons in the correct sequence"" puzzles to solve to be able to advance the story. The path is pretty much linear but allows you to do a little bit of exploration in some of the areas. Visually the game is just about OK and the controls are about the same level. If it had been a full price game I would have been furious due to how short the game is. I played it through in less than 4 hours, and that includes spending at least one hour trying to recover from what I believe is a glitch in the game that could have been avoided if there was a proper save function implemented instead of the automatic checkpoint save system.If there was a ""Maybe"" option I would press it, don't buy if you want an adventure that will keep you entertained for a long time.

												Pros:-great atmosphere reminiscent of intelligent (mostly Russian) SF (Solaris, Stalker, Aelita...);-nice, slightly arty, mostly linear story;-being relatively short (4-6 hrs.) it does not overstay its welcome.Cons:-jetpack platforming is only semi-decent due to camera issues and the inability to reverse course in mid air;-the puzzles involving the robotic arm are very easy and repetitive;-mineral collectibles are pointless.Conclusion:-For the fans of thinking person's SF more interested in the story than super tight game mechanics and flashy graphics, not averse to more artistic gaming experiences in the vein of 'Papo & Yo', Contrast' or 'Dear Esther' (but with actual gameplay and fail states) - an enjoyable ride.

This game should be called ""Jumping and walking like an idiot on the Planet""I can't believe I wasted my money in this gameEverything is soooo bad in this ""thing"" (if you can call it a game) that I can't express how much I hate itThe graphics are ""mediocre"" for a indie game (there are a lot of stunning indie games, this is not one of these)The Story doesn't even worth telling, really,doesn't worthThe audio is OK but not greatThe gameplay does not exist '-'You will walk a lot and jump a lot.. That's it! Nothing more! Except for the countless times you'll die because you'll be stuck on rocks and the HORRIBLE performance drops (seriously, on my HIGH END ENTHUSIAST machine, this game runs at 25 average fps when there are any objects, walls, anything nearby).And sorry for any grammar issues, I'm still learning english :)			"

												If you see Lifeless Planet on sale, grab it, otherwise I'm not sure I can recommend it at the full $20 price.  The first 30-60 minutes of the game will absolutely grab you, blow your mind, and leave you excited for more and more.Unfortunately, as high of a standard the beginning of the game sets, the rest of the game floats betwen okay and good but never returns to the level the beginning led you to believe.More than anything, Lifeless Planet is a running sim.  It looks like an open world and there is a lot of space in which to run, but by and large there is only one path to progress the story and lots of dead ends along the way.  Lots of running, lots of jumping, and it does get to be tedious after a while.  Every time I ran into a situation where I couldn't progress the story but it seemed like if I just timed this jump just right I'd make the landing and things would go forward, but instead I'd just keep dying over and over, in truth it turned out that there was actually a puzzle hidden somewhere off-the-beaten path that was overlooked so I had to go explore every nook and cranny to find where the puzzle was.  There's a number of 'puzzles' in the game though once you do one or two to understand how they work they are pretty simple to solve.  As immersive and excellent as the atmosphere of Lifeless Planet is though, these shortcomings are pretty easy to overlook. Atmosphere - atmosphere is what Lifeless Planet does best and at a level not many games out there can keep up with.  The graphics are imaginative and alien and beautiful.  I would love to play this again on a high-end gaming PC just for that experience.  Mine's just middle-of-the-ground PC but the game really begs to be revisited whenever I can upgrade - it's just too beautiful and alien to not.  Music is spot on and never intrudes.  What little voice acting is in the game is done well, too.  Story.........I don't know if the gamemakers were too overambitious or just lacked a professional writer on the team to tie it all in together better.  There's a few different plotlines and unfortunately they are all undeveloped.  The most story by far goes into what happened with the Russians and that is learned entirely by finding and reading documents or listening to audio recordings.  Far too much of the present-day story that you actually play in is progressed solely by you do this or you go here simply because it is the only thing to do or the only place to go.  Your are given a little bit of backstory for your character at the beginning of the game, which honestly is enough to get things in motion and get the game going, but any sort of character development is pretty much ignored until the very end of the game where those original few sentences of backstory are integral to so the whole thing ends up just coming across as shallow and anticlimatic.  There's also a few transitions between scenes or chapters where the screen will fade-to-black, sometimes unexpectedly, and the new scene starts in a new location and even if there is a cut-scene it lacks any explanation for the transition.  It was twice, maybe three times, I had to pause and look up some YouTuber Let's Play videos because I thought I had missed something.ConclusionI enjoyed the game.  Spaceman on a dead planet and all you got is your spacesuit.  ""Ummmmmmmmmm.......""  Yeah, it's bloody brilliant.  Setting and atmosphere are awesome and at a level all games should aspire to.It's just the story falls way flat in a game that should be story-driven.I think you're better off waiting for a sale to buy.  Maybe I'm a cheapskate, but that $10-15 range seems like a fair price for an incredibly atmospheric game, but there's enough story issues I'd feel let down if I paid $20.			"

												I'm not sure why so many people are recommending this game.  Here's what I found:1. Poor graphics.  It's odd to see so many people praising the visuals in this game, since...well, they just kind of suck.  We're talking about low-poly terrain with ugly textures.  And since the world is a barren wasteland, there's not a lot of interesting detail, either--which would be fine if the wasteland itself were pretty, but like I said, low-poly terrain and ugly textures.2. Frustratingly bad controls.  Somehow the character manages to move too fast for precision and too slow for transversing the game's ridiculously huge distances.  Strafing is awkward since the character seems to try to both strafe and turn at the same time, resulting in really awkward mouse-and-keyboard combination movement.  It also makes precision movement very difficult in areas where you have to, for example, land on or move around on a tiny platform.3. Dumb puzzles.  The first one is made artificially difficult by the terrible controls, but it essentially involves moving a single boulder to a single place.  The second one is of the ""find a needle in a haystack"" variety, where you're given half of a code for very little effort and then have to do the 3d equivalent of a pixel hunt to find the other half.  It also makes no real logical sense that the code is split into two pieces in the first place.  Maybe the puzzles get more interesting later, but I'm not willing to keep dealing with the terrible controls and ugly graphics long enough to find out.4. Pretty much no music.  This is especially important since so much of the game is just wandering from place to place.  Dear Esther and Everyone's Gone to the Rapture, for example, had very appropriate atmospheric music (also much better visuals).5. An interesting story concept and mystery that would be intriguing if it weren't for all the aforementioned flaws.  That's the only thing I could see that this game has to offer.I honestly feel ripped off, and I got this game for ten bucks.			"

												This is one of the most repeditive games ive ever played. i jumped 4 hrs though terrain even Black and White did better years ago. You will die because of nothing, get to invisible walls or instadeaths, even in or after cutscenes. sometimes you die because of gravity but you jumped just barely up. or your jump mechanics fk up and you cant reach the edge and can restart from a checkpoint again. this feels like a broken game. and the setting.. srsly.. ""Russian did it first and destroyed it""SPOILER: you will get a mechanic arm or whatever you want to call it. they need to tell you the movement because its so uncommom. and they really like you to use it too often.I really do not recommend this game.Play it if you like jumping through dust and sand and a story you could put in 2 minutes			"

												I had pretty high hopes for this game but it's turned out to be really lifeless. It's poorly made platformer/running through a corridors simulator with poor controls and boring environments. You run through a corridor then some poorly made jumping section begins, you fall off again and again because of awful controls. Checkpoint system is broken, you lose collectibles after loading checkpoint and often it loads too far and you must complete some stupid jumping section again. I don't even know if i will manage to finish this game and that's a really rare case for me.I thought it's some exploration game with beautiful environments and some story, maybe a bit similar to the Journey on PS3, but this is nothing like that.

								Wow...I mean, wow! This is a very impressive game, beta or not, I am very psyched that I bought this on early access.  The level of detail in this title is really nice. Hats off to the dev...one person only is doing all this?  Nice job, and thank you for this intriguing glimpse into the early access of Lifeless Planet.  I love the engine, you can feel the atmosphere in this game, it is almost palpable.  I like the oxygen mechanic...I had some frantic moments making a dash for the nearest reaupply point.   The environment is amazing, I love the look of the world, and having multiple places to be able to get to, and explore, is a nice reward.  I eagerly await further developments, and contiunued exploration, of the Lifeless Planet.  One last thought, as i played, I wondered if what this engine could do for a game based on H.P. Lovecrafts's ""At The Mountainsa of Madness""...I mean the terrain and views, with the ambient background music....man, I would love to see that, and I think this engine could do that story wonders.....snow covered peaks, footprints, and caves.  Bring on the shoggoth!  Anyway, great game, I look forward to updates.  Great game and excellent storyline from what I have seen so far, thanks for a great atmospheric exploration!			"

												BETA REVIEW: It's a good 3D puzzle platformer, there are better ones out there, but what really gets you into it are the mysterious story and the beautiful landscapes. It does have a good mix of easy and more challenging puzzles, that you kind of have to think about, and has multiple facets in which the puzzles are based around so as to add variety. The current beta is rather short (around 30-80 minutes depending on how fast you go), and ends on a bit of a clifhanger, so if you are looking to play the full game right now, you can't, but once it is released, you can, and the beta is cheaper than the full game will be when released, so get it now and enjoy what is currently implemented, and make sure to give your feedback to the author- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -FULL RELEASE REVIEW: If you just read the beta review, then you saw how much I looked forward to seeing the end product of the game, and now that its here, I must say I am rather dissapointed actually. The beta levels had such rich atmosphere and mystery, and they had so much promise, but after I passed through that green door on June 6th, eager to play through the rest of the game, the mystery just fell apart, and took the game with it. I would forgive these if it wasn't for the $20 price tag. The game is too small, and, as just stated, falls apart after the beautifully crafted beta levels, to be priced at $20. I still recommend the game to cold war fans, platformer fans, and to people just looking for a nice fun game to spend a few hours in, just wait for a sale, I could justify $10 on this.			"

Early Access Review
								The voice actors and the soundtrack in this game are great. The voice actors seem like very professional and talented and bring life to the characters and the story, allthough there is not too much voice acting in the beta so far.  The soundtrack fits so perfect to the atmosphere and carries it through your ears right into your mind and heart. Sometimes it is creepy, sometimes beautiful and sometimes sad, but always great quality.The gameplay is mostly Jump & Run. It is quite simple but always seems authentic too so far and therefore supports the player's immersion into the game. However, it never became boring to me. In fact I played the beta twice now, despite of being short and linear.Of course you can't really say much about the story when playing only a very small part of the game. But at least this much: So far it is very interesting, mysterious and exciting. I like Sci-Fi movies like ""Moon"", ""Love"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and this game brings up the same fascination in my humble opinion.The cliffhanger at the end of the early access beta is almost like torture to me since I am really excited about what will happen next,  which is a good sign for a game I guess.Is it worth a buy? HELL YEAH (If you are looking forward towards exploring a mysterious and exciting sci-fi story)!Edit: I forgot to mention that the graphics are OK but not that awesome. However, the fact that I forgot to mention the graphics in my personal review at first speaks for game additionally.			"

												I discovered this game purely by accident. As a sci-fi fan I long for a game that can take me to unknown worlds and let me explore them and Lifeless Planet seemed to be that game.I immediately acquired the early access and was very satisfied to it's initial promise.

Early Access Review
In BriefLifeless Planet is speculative science-fiction in the form of an alien world across which you trek in search of answers.Most valuable resource - Gripping story.Of interest to: - those who find classic science-fiction and speculation about other planets exciting.Since experiencing the entire game I can say that all the promise of the Early Access demo was completely realised.  The story became even more engaging, the lifeless planet even more mysterious.  The resolution was satisfying.It is difficult to classify this game without underselling it.  There is a great sense of exploration, like you are really trekking across an alien landscape, but the landscape itself - though it sometimes doesn't feel it - is very linear.  You have to learn to jet from ledge to ledge, but it's not really a platformer - even though there were two points in the game where I had to reattempt a jump repeatedly to get it right.Although there are puzzles, don't approach Lifeless Planet as a puzzle game in the style of Myst et al, because the puzzles here are really there to emphasise the alien wonder of the place, not to challenge.  On that front the alien nature of this place is well thought out, cohesive and, looking back, with all the information, absolutely realistic, even though as you progress it is hard to see where all this is going.No, what this is is an exploration of an idea of what life could be like on other planets, and all the rest is the vehicle necessary to take us on that journey.  From that perspective it is very well executed, both technically and as a story.  The game is beautiful and stark and alien, the plot is perfectly paced, and the experience is deep and engaging.  When you stumble across the journal of someone who was here before you, you spend the next part of your journey pondering the meaning of their words until the planet throws something new at you you distract you, perfectly bridging the human story and the story of planetary exploration.You can complete the game in one sitting of about three to five hours depending on how long you marvel at the scenery and how much time you spend thinking on the things you find.  There's not a lot of replayability here, as with most narrative games, but it feels the perfect length, with no padding and nothing skimmed over in too little detail.One word of caution: I would advise ignoring the achievements, as hunting them can break your immersion.  If they come organically, they come, although several won't unless you do things completely unnatural given the circumstances, like loitering for a long time at a location where there is no reason to loiter.Early Access review:Beautiful and evocative and mysterious.  Just be aware that it cuts off rather abruptly at a certain point when things are just getting really interesting, as that's as far as this early access game has been developed at this point.  Still very much worth a quick play though, even in its trunctated form, as apparently more elements will be added to the game so far, as well as its continuation.			"

												Okay it is a good game. And there are several factors that makes it a good game. First of all, the first impression was that it looks a lot like the game ""journey"". But the game itself is very different to it. The scenery, audio, story and etc its all good. But all the logs seems to get deleted after saving and exiting. I came back to play it again, but all the information I have gathered has beed erased... Now I am not very far into the game and do not know how this will effect me from progressing but I just thought everything would be there. It is not like I can go back and collect it again.Nonetheless it is a interesting game, with a touch of mystery and horror? in it. It certainly captures the audiences with the vast environments and I look forward to seeing how the game unfolds....			"

												Man, that was fun. Lifeless Planet, a short indie game about exploring a sister planet to Mars and uncovering secrets, was probably some of the most interesting time I've spent at my laptop. For the basics; voice acting = 10/10, physics 8/10, graphics 9/10 and plot 11/10. I don't usually get all gooey over small game like this but the story was so well built up that at the end, I was getting goosebumps when everything came together. It's fairly cheap I think, so spend a bit to have your mind blown. On top of being an outstanding single player game, it has a lot of replay ability. The game seems to have been built around exploration and excavation since you can search for mineral samples and research sites to get a better understanding of the planet and all that.Again, do yourself a favor and pick this up. Overall rating 9/10. Not a 10 because there were a few puzzles that seemed pointlessly difficult.			"

												Lifeless planet... Lifeless... Well the visual is definately breath taking. There are parts thou where the game is simply pitch black on my screen would of been great to have a gamma option or some sort of options in the options cuz the brighten dark does absolutely nothing. The game definately did breath some life back into this gamer. But the disapointing ending took it all away. The amount of bugs I encountered were 3. A memory crash, game itself froze, and a issue where I went the wrong way and it saved by itself and stole my extended jet pack boost and I had to restart. The story is great. One of the best story's I have had in a game for a while. I was expecting more thou. I think this game would be super if it had some kind of replayability or multiplayer. All in all It was too short of a game and due to lack of replayability I only give this game a 6 out of 10.			"

												Great game.  Can't say i've had this much fun planet exploring since mass effect 1, and this exerience is sans the janky more often than not mako.  Of course this is a completely different game style and vibe but as this is a 3rd person experience it is somewhat similar.  The game moves between beautiful and errie, often silent landscapes.  And they is a wide range of them.  The levels are kinda linear, but still at times vast enough that you can explore some secrets and even at times get lost.  The gameplay itself revolves mostly about keeping an eye out for the environment and the ""lifeless"" planet.  Your jetpack, which at times is upgraded is also a cool and usually not overly hard platforming experience.  Mostly though the game is a fairly laid back,   sometimes tense, sometimes creepy, experience though exploration and unraveling of the planets secrets.  There's been so few games that even are similar in the decades i've been gaming and this is a game exerience i've been waiting a long time for.  I would have more likely than not kickstarted it had i known about it.  A cool sci-fi story and a joy of a game.  It has a few flaws though for me that was mostly in the last part seeming to be prolonged.  Highly recommend it though and at about 5 hours its fairly easy to partake in a couple settings which is always nice.  Definately recommend it if you like adventure/exploration games or if like me have an unsatiable desire for planetary exploration.			"

												I love this game. It's got a great vibe. I really can't wait to veg-out on the full release.-------- UPDATE --------The full game was pretty damn satisfying. It's perfect for a sci-fi fan like me. I got sucked in to the story fast and wasn't ready for it to end when it was over. I did get stuck in a crevice or between some roots a couple or three times and had to restart a checkpoint, but other than that it was a glitch free experience. It's so well done, I'm really impressed.			"

								This is a great game, I haven't seen anything like this before and even if it's just the beta I didn't notice any bugs yet (except jumping on hills you're not supposed to jump on but it didnt get me out of the area or something). I think one thing can get better and that is an custom graphics settings option. I run this game on lowest settings now and I still don't have 30 FPS and that is because I can play the newest games but only with shadows on low. Now I can only choose between 5 different pre-settings.			"

												I've played a lot of indie games in my time, and I came into this game looking for some open exploring, puzzle solving, and a bit of a story. What I found was a lot more then I paid for.This game offers a unique story, interesting and fun puzzles, great music, and a fantastic story. From start to end it should take you no longer then  3 - 6 hours, however don't let that stop you from buying it. This game will immense you from start to finish, it will pull you into it, and you will play through. The voice acting and feel the two characters give is a real one, not something that you will find in a lot of indie games. It's not Call of Duty or Skyrim, it's really a genre of its' own, and at times it can feel like a mixture of Amensia, Portal, and Half Life. I highly recommend this game to any and all players who are looking for something to spend a weekend night with a beer, and a need for adventure, this game will surely make you believe.... You are on a lifeless planet.			"

								Has a nice feel to it, somehow reminds me of the feeling I had when I first played TombRaider. It's not at all like that game but has a similar feeling of being alone in a hostile environment. The respawn as it is now is maybe a bit forgiving, it even moved me to the place I was trying to make my way to at one point but other than that and a few other slight niggles I'd go as far as to say this is better than some full release games as far as bugs and niggles go. If they can keep up the momentum with the rest of the story then this could be a cult hit. Note: The game is short (1.5/2hrs) and ends abruptly at a pinnacle moment almost like an episodic game. Keep this in mind before you purchase although I am positive the rest of the game is on its way.			"

With landscapes becoming tiresome and the wonders of exploration diluted on unimaginative mechanics and intrusive narrative.Sadly the game never overcomes completely the said narrative and mechanics problems, but the world does gets better, with some excellent stages that made me connect again with my initial appeal for this game - I just wanted to feel like I was on another planet. Also, as you get to the latter stages, it manages to bring the narrative back to life and makes you realize that this could in fact be a much better game, but maybe due to inexperience it kind of get lost in it self.Still, despite the wasted potential, I say it's worth to buy. Specially to sci-fi fans like me that feel like videogames lack offer when it comes to sci-fi adventures. Also, on the science part, the attention to (exo)geology is really cool.			"

Early Access Review
In BriefLifeless Planet is speculative science-fiction in the form of an alien world across which you trek in search of answers.Most valuable resource - Gripping story.Of interest to: - those who find classic science-fiction and speculation about other planets exciting.Since experiencing the entire game I can say that all the promise of the Early Access demo was completely realised.  The story became even more engaging, the lifeless planet even more mysterious.  The resolution was satisfying.It is difficult to classify this game without underselling it.  There is a great sense of exploration, like you are really trekking across an alien landscape, but the landscape itself - though it sometimes doesn't feel it - is very linear.  You have to learn to jet from ledge to ledge, but it's not really a platformer - even though there were two points in the game where I had to reattempt a jump repeatedly to get it right.Although there are puzzles, don't approach Lifeless Planet as a puzzle game in the style of Myst et al, because the puzzles here are really there to emphasise the alien wonder of the place, not to challenge.  On that front the alien nature of this place is well thought out, cohesive and, looking back, with all the information, absolutely realistic, even though as you progress it is hard to see where all this is going.No, what this is is an exploration of an idea of what life could be like on other planets, and all the rest is the vehicle necessary to take us on that journey.  From that perspective it is very well executed, both technically and as a story.  The game is beautiful and stark and alien, the plot is perfectly paced, and the experience is deep and engaging.  When you stumble across the journal of someone who was here before you, you spend the next part of your journey pondering the meaning of their words until the planet throws something new at you you distract you, perfectly bridging the human story and the story of planetary exploration.You can complete the game in one sitting of about three to five hours depending on how long you marvel at the scenery and how much time you spend thinking on the things you find.  There's not a lot of replayability here, as with most narrative games, but it feels the perfect length, with no padding and nothing skimmed over in too little detail.One word of caution: I would advise ignoring the achievements, as hunting them can break your immersion.  If they come organically, they come, although several won't unless you do things completely unnatural given the circumstances, like loitering for a long time at a location where there is no reason to loiter.Early Access review:Beautiful and evocative and mysterious.  Just be aware that it cuts off rather abruptly at a certain point when things are just getting really interesting, as that's as far as this early access game has been developed at this point.  Still very much worth a quick play though, even in its trunctated form, as apparently more elements will be added to the game so far, as well as its continuation.			"

												Meh. Half the plot is in the trailer and the other half is unremarkable at best and dull tropes at worst. There are very, very few rewards for ever going off the path and the path is long and uneventful. I can't stress how uneventful. For a game that sends you through endless winding ravines, they should have invested in textures for vertical surfaces. The vertically stretched ground textures look cheap.The voice acting is well done. If you're looking for exploration, compelling story, or unique game play, you should look elsewhere.			"

												Lifeless Planet is essentially a walking simulator with a few puzzles thrown in.  Oh, and there are a lot of jumps... A LOT OF JUMPS.  I don't mean a couple dozen jumps and your done, NO.  You will be jumping throughout the entire game, which gets old very fast.  Other than that, this is a decent game.  It won't win any awards but it will keep you busy for awhile.The graphics are fairly well done, however, the atmosphere and the scenery are a bit bland.  The saving grace is that it changes throughout the game.  The few puzzles that do exist are well constructed and well thought out, nothing too difficult.  The best part of this game is the story.  It's an engaging mystery that slowly reveals itself as you progress through the game.There are only two things wrong with Lifeless Planet.  First, as I previously mentioned, are the jumps.  Far to many of them.  Second, the price.  At the time of this review, Lifeless Planet is selling for $19.99.  It's a short game, in my opinion, and should sell for about $9.99, tops.So if you want to buy this game, I suggest you do so when it goes on sale, as I did.			"

												Lifeless PlanetAfter reading some of the reviews for this game I wasn't sure if it would be any good, but when it went on sale I decided to pick it up, and I'm pretty glad I did. The game is based around you and your spacecraft crash landing on a deserted planet, which you thought would be full of life, and then attempting to search for answers on what had happened there. Throughout the entire game you're going to basically be following a path that the game has laid out for you, and at times this can get boring but for the most part it's okay because you are going to constantly be faced with platform challenges, deadly plant enemies, puzzles, amazing sights to see, and hidden mineral collectibles along the way. Lifeless Planet also has alot of variety in its stages and each new ""level"" will have a different look to keep things fresh. Some stages are bright, some are dark, foggy, windy, hot environments, cold environments, overgrown plants, hot springs, huge cliffs, forests, deserts, ect. This game kept me playing becuase I really wanted to find out what would happen to my character on this terrible planet and how the story ended. It obviously isn't perfect, but overall I'd recommend it.6 - 10			"

The story is very very interesting and the climax is worth finishing this game.			"

												I don't feel engaged by this game. It looks somewhat nice and it has some interesting sci-fi ideas but I can't get over its inability to tell a story. I just reached a point in the game where my character remarks on what to him look like one type of entities that were engulfed by root creatures. But all I saw were knarly trunks that didn't take any distinguishable shape. The game also has jarringly brief and tense cutscenes that, due to their brevity, drop you back into gameplay before you have finished taking in what you just saw. And then, for some reason, sound affects seem to prefer being mostly in the right channel. And the game relies on awful 3D jumping puzzles. They stop the game pacing when you keep blowing a jump because of unpredictable momemtum. Final complaint is about the broken menus. Why, for a game listed as having full controller support does it stop responding to the controller? Seriously, I have to go back to keyboard just to close up the main menu. The game feels like a game library in the hands of an inexperienced game designer.			"

												Lifeless Planet is an original and interesting game, with some lovely scenery and great music. The length is about 7-8 hours and consists of walking around, exploring and moving the story forward in bits, as well as solving puzzles, mostly of the jumping (and somewhat annoying) kind.I could have done without the lengthy and dull underground sections with a lot of jumping in the dark, they could easily have been cut down a lot without losing anything important.Still recommend the game for its originality and the otherwordly vistas to encounter during the game, as well as the music which is stunning.

Mysterious, creeping, and much more substantial than you expectIt's not a walking simulator. In terms of gameplay, this is very decidedly a third person platformer. You'll be hopping from surface to surface, sometimes making mistakes, sometimes dying. You will jetpack. You'll roll rocks. You'll use a hydraulic manipulation arm. You'll solve some simple puzzles. And yes, you'll walk and look and listen, so it has a bit of the ""walking simulator"" in it, but it's very much a game with game mechanics.The Steam description for the game already tells some details from the story so I won't worry about spoiling: you're an astronaut exploring a lifeless planet, yet finding remnants of a Soviet base, and then a figure in the distance who might be friend or foe.The game's backstory is told in bits and pieces, as you travel through setpieces on this foreboding planet. There are themes of fear, sadness, hubris, and exploitation.It's a lower budget game, evident from the models, the terrain, the quality of the cutscenes and animations. And I think they did an excellent job working within these constraints. Even with these limits, the game manages to be engrossing, even creepy at times.What I enjoyedWhile it's mostly forbidding Mars-like terrain, there's a wide variety of locations.The music and voice acting, top notch. The music is especially marvellous: brooding, melancholy violins and cellos, and the occasional sci-fi synth, do much to set the mood. The voices, while few in numbers, are just as engaging. The voice journals left behind (yes yes, that tired narrative device; personally I never really minded it) are in Russian and help immerse you more into what happened to the colonists that left them.A few simple mechanics add some flavour to the otherwise simplistic platforming gameplay. Most of all I like the extended jetpacking that lets you cross wide chasms.It's linear from start to finish, but there are a few collectibles to find if you wander off the beaten path.What I didn't likeA couple of spots have fiddly platforming. Very few though.One area of the game, towards the end, is rather tedious. Not only are you walking up thin walkways and jumping from one to the other, you're doing it in the dark. Thankfully, it ends before dragging on too long.Some strange lack of transitions between scenes. I get the feeling there were some cutscenes that never got made, or simply that the developers had no idea how to link the two areas. Can be abrupt and jarring. I wonder if they were going for a ""jump cut"" feel like in films.I can say I loved this game. If you want a semi-casual single player platforming linear experience, with a simple but engaging story, I say go for it.			"

Early Access Review
								-- REVIEW FOR BETA VERSION ONLY --Lifeless Planet is simple. Very simple. But a return to simple game mechanics and letting intrigue take the wheel is something we definitely need to see more of. LP, while still in Beta state and definitely not finished yet, is regardless one of the most enjoyable games I've played. Ever.It's an exploration/platforming/adventure sort of hybrid. And there even some elements of horror and suspense mixed in, though not very intense at all. You feel nervous at times, but never get the sense that you're in danger. There is only moving about, some light world interaction, mostly just running and jumping about. No combat. Thankfully.When the Beta ends, I was very disappointed. Not in the developers. It's not finished, after all...but I genuinely want to see what comes up next. And for me to be so interested in what's around the next corner isn't something I've felt in a very, very long time. I cannot wait until this game is finished, and I have the feeling that once it is, it will be quite the adventure.If you want an experience, buy this game.			"

												Let me express how good I think »Lifeless Planet« is: Since summer of 2014 (for 5 months now) I've been binge-watching playthroughs of this game. Now that I'm playing it myself for the first time, I've assumed that no aspect of the game would surprise me anymore (I wanted to play it despite that assumption). But my assumption was wrong: in the first three levels I've stumbled upon goodies none of the players I've watched discovered: tricky ramps and hills, seemingly inascendable, that could be climbed on with a bit of patience; minerals others missed; scripted events (mostly noises and music); a few bugs and quirks here and there -- equally fun, at least for me. So I'm enjoying every aspect of the game, even after having seen spoilers for months. That's how good the game is in my view. But the main reason, maybe the only reason, why I love playing this game (which is by now almost completely spoiled for me all to the end) -- it's the incredible atmosphere that keeps pulling me in. The vast landscapes, the part-familiar, part-alien geology, the awesome soundtrack and the unfolding story are part of this atmosphere that just resonates with me.  I recommend playing »Lifeless Planet« and taking time exploring it. And I hope it will resonate with you too.			"

								Even though I am not a big fan of 3rd person games, the story line is exactly as advertised.  Classic sci fi with the cold war thrown in.  I would just mirror what everyone else is saying about the graphics, mood, music, voice acting, so I will let the other comments speak for themselves.  I did find some aspects of the game a bit frustrating trying to climb a tower and failing miserably.  Did fall through the map a few times just past the twin fan area.  It was underneath the first cable car, if you fell off of it there was a map hole you could fall through.OH BTW, I hope you don't have a fear of heights......  This game made me queasy on occasions.

												This game felt like it had a lot of potential with its premis but I'd describe it as subpar for what it could have been. The entire game felt somewhat incomplete. The graphics felt incomplete and muddy. The story wasn't terribly dynamic. The voice acting was awkward and either a) underused or b) somewhat reduntant to the written pieces. The controls were functional but not good. A very unpolished game. Honestly, there are so many atmospheric games along this genre, just play one of those. This one has a cool premis and great music but that's it. You can find that elsewhere and more.			"

												The decision if I will recommend this game or not was pretty even.Running around in on a space planet without much additional sound effects and a leading voice was quite good. Most of the time you had just the background music and nothing else – this created a good atmosphere. Spacesuit, surrounding objects and the jump and run appear fitting for this game and planet.In my opinion you are very limited in your choices to run and interact on this huge planet. A lot of empty areas and little areas with exploring for achievements. Upgrades are only available, as long as you need them to proceed during the story. (Example: You receive a jet-pack fuel to jump higher. This is available an unlimited time and unlimited uses until you reach point X and it is immediately depleted). The chapters start and ending is also quite abrupt. No cut scene or a link to the previous chapter. You are running over a bridge and – bam – you are standing on a hill, no bridge or something in sight.I would like to vote ‘meh’ but it is not available.If you like such ‘running and jumping around accompanied by a little story’ – go for it.

												Lifeless Planet is quite a compelling adventure exploring puzzle game with platforming. The environments in the game ar vast and the locations you goto are many.There are a few gameplay elements added that add to the fact you are a astronaut such as need to replenish oxygen and need to use suits jump gets. As you progress ingame a certain amount of time passes as you get from point to point so you will play from day to night.Ruins of what you find wil be found everywhere as well as signs of what happened.The storytelling is done quite well and is more original than one would think.I can say the environment & puzzle/platforming meld quite well pulling you into the immersion exprience the game has. The puzzles are not too difficult at all,but there are some areas in the game where one can tell a slight design flaw based on if you mess up to much and cannot reset making you have to start from ur last save point area or checkpoint.Other than an annoying major bug where the save & quit function can become unacccessible the game is solid though a bit laggy at some parts. The game auto saves when you get to certain areas and there are checkpoints throughout your play so you hardly have to backtrack to much if something goes wrong. Get it on the cheap, or pay the full price, game is worth playing if you like the adventure/explore platforming puzzle gamess.			"

												Nothing really happens, and the walking and jumping is overkill.It's 4-5 hours, so if the game had half the amount of walking/jumping that would've at least condensed it down to a few hours and made it a bit more enjoyable.You can only give a thumbs up or down rather than a score, so to say I don't recommend it at all seems a bit harsh because by the end I was kinda ok with it. Just every time there was one or two jumping/walking areas too many.			"

												I have had the pleasure to play this game for the last two days and I am not disappointed. I'll try to make this review as good as I possibly can.Lifeless Planet sends the player into an unknown world full of mysteries and puzzles to solve. You play as an astronaut (whose name I have sadly already forgotten), who was sent to a planet far away from earth. After having spent 15 years in a spaceship, the protagonist finally arrives at the already described destination but is quickly confronted with a problem: a lack of oxygen. This is where the game starts. My first impression: It looks nice. I have always been a fan of games showing an atmosphere that sticks with you for a while. This game probably is one of them, since it never ceases to amaze the player with nice-looking surroundings. Another aspect I really love about this game is the music and its voiceacting, whereas I would have loved to have more of both. The player gets to listen to small pieces of a conversation between the protagonist and a woman from time to time which I always thought were interesting. They give a small insight on the astronaut's past. The Russian audiologs were very cool as well. (9/10 for the audio. 10/10 if there had been more)The astronaut soon discovers a Russian village and - of course - can't believe his eyes and thus believes that he is back on earth and that he has been played a trick on. From this point on the player moves from one area to another, which usually are connected to each other by small puzzles. The already mentioned audiologs and documents help the player to understand where he is and what has happened. Not too much time in the game and you are confronted with a female inhabitant, living on the planet you are walking on. Your main aim from now on is to follow her and to try to get some answers to the many questions that are still open. Don't worry, at the end none of them should be left. The story was interesting to follow. At first I did not expect the documents to be able to tell a whole story, but now - after having played the game - I can say that I didn't have any problems understanding the plot. I find it very well thought out and would thus give it a 9/10.The graphics are beautiful. Of course, you can't compare it to other newer titles or the Crysis games, but that's not what the game developers tried to go for anyway. I was positively surprised by the many areas you walk through and are able to (partly) discover. It varies from a desert-like landscape to glaciers, waterfountains, lava, forests, and much, much more. Designing these many arials must require creativity which this game sure didn't lack of. The graphics fit the game just well, so I'll give it a 8/10Gameplay. That's where Lifeless Planet doesn't hold up to the price it is being sold for. I wouldn't say that it was not fun for me to play, not at all. There are many repetitive parts and puzzles which you usually soon get the hang of, but the different surroundings and dangerous, creepy traps made it a new experience every time. Nevertheless, most of it was rather easy to solve and I never really found myself in a situation, where I had to think for more than 5 minutes in order to find the solution for a problem. A big part of the game consists of jumping from platform to platform which - once you have required the extra boost for your jetpack - is really fun. The controls were the average ones which were not a problem for me (thus giving them a 10/10), whereas some other people have complained about them being too sloppy or unprecise when doing long jumps. All in all the gameplay could have been a lot better by adding a greater variety of puzzles and missions to solve, but the surroundings made up for it and I often caught myself simply exploring what there was - even though most of the times there was nothing worth to see expect a collectible mineral. 6/10It took me about 7 hours to play through the whole game, but I really tried to take a look at everything instead of rushing through one area to the next one. In another review someone had written, the author said that the game was too short and that the achievement for the first playthrough being under 4 hours was too easy. Well, I have to disagree. You can get many more hours out of it when really looking for the minerals (which are worth two achievements too by the way) and exploring hills and buildings. I believe that 7 hours for a 10€ game is a good deal. Let's come to an end. I definitely recommend playing Lifeless Planet when you are someone who doesn't need highend graphics or a moment of action every five minutes. This game is - in my opinion - made for people who are patient, who like to take their time and who focus on music and sound, because that's where the game scores. It sometimes reminded me and can be compared to a game like ""Journey"" on the PlayStation. It is worth 10€, but I probably wouldn't buy it for the original price, which is 20€. I hope this review convinced you to either buy or not buy this game. Thank you for reading.P.S.: The game scared me at some points. It was all good and fun though. :)			"

												More than a review, this simply aims to be a collection of thoughts on my experience with the game.I was honestly very excited when I first heard of this title. Sadly, it didn't really live up to expectations.Not that it's a BAD game, it's just not consistent and often breaks the immersion and atmosphere. Which is a shame: this game would otherwise really do a great job in creating a haunting experience.One example:  roughly a few minutes into the game, after the impact, you find your oxygen levels are dropping dramatically due to a leak. After running to an oxygen tank, you will be able to fill up (and magically fix the leak) and be left with an autonomy of approx 8 hours.Shortly after that you will find your way to the Russian town where, among other things, you'll find another oxygen tank. Remember where it is, because you are likely going to use it more than once, as oxygen will run out within minutes and you'll have to track your steps back to it quite often until you unlock the next zone - which is where the game just resets its own rules: for most of the time your oxygen will last you days, with the exception of a few areas. You can argue that, as the game has cutscenes, you will have filled up in the period of time we weren't in control of him for - but there are plenty of areas you'll be roaming for a relatively long time without a worry. This may sound like a really minor thing to complain about, but it's one of many the immersion suffers from.Another aspect that feels often unnatural is that of puzzles: more often than not, the puzzles will feel completely irrelevant - you can safely pick up the green stones with your hands, but you NEED the robotic arm to place them in a slot roughly at the same height as your head, triggering a mini game. When you feel you might actually have found a use for the arm it won't be available for use, as it's only triggered when close to an object it is designed to interact with.The puzzles overall are never overly challenging, with the game mainly focusing on jumping, and simply feel out of place - situations that require you to interact with objects to actually clear a path are scarce, and when you do come up with a clever idea, the game just won't cooperate with you.It's not a bad design choice in itself, it just feels like the dev threw any potential the game had out the window.As for the story, it is obviously the aspect that should keep you playing the game until the end - but again, it starts with an intriguing premise and loses it's strength in the later chapters.What the game does achieve though, is in creating its atmosphere through haunting sound effects and a well placed soundtrack, which alone manages to keep the player on edge.Overall, I'd still recommend this if you can overlook it's flaws - the story is not without surprises, and the atmosphere it creates tries hard to make up for most of what the game lacks in mechanics.

												The problem with this game is that it is story driven. But it lacks story. Like at all - not even bad story, it simply does not have anyWhat you get here is merely a theme park you walk/run through, a museum of random ideas, images and references mashed together in apprenent attempt to create ""mystical"" and ""multilayered"" story. The game tries so hard to get many meanings that it fails to get even one. Most of things you will see has no point, no connection to other things (aside of exteremly vague secondary associations, that will only appear if you have read and know well enough Aelita novel by A.Tolstoy. And even then, game had to literally point you out to that novel for you to even start recognising references.The thing that is called story here makes no stance on anything. It does not tell anything. Even main hero adventure on those planet rapidly degrades into total mess leaving you confused, scratching your head and thinking ""what the hell was that?"". And later on ""and what was the point of all that?"" because all weird stuff to happen will neven ever get any development.The only thing that is somewhat resembles a story is overhead out-of-screen portions of interview (you have heard half of it in the trailer) that reflects on the main hero story, but it is not every interesting (because you the main hero is just a walking suit with little-to-no personality you will find hard to care about) and yes, made into mess by making totally pointless and never developed references to the game content.So it lacks story and it was meant to lack pretty much everything else, including gameplay (it is slightly more complex version of Dear Easher and similar, gameplay wise), so yeah. But even here it manages to get annoying by horrible level design, especially closer to the end. Things like ""if you die, you will respawn at last checkpoint facing the WRONG direction"" (and keep in mind that many locations are quite barren and look-alike, so it is easy to get lost there) are true gems.

												With this game being one of the so-called ""walking simulators"" with very simple and straightforward puzzles which include placing object A in slot B, pushing buttons in specific order and jumping puzzles, it is the story, themes and setting that is making this game shine.Without giving too much of the plot away, I will describe first half an hour of the game, which will make it easier to talk about the themes that the story explores later on. You're playing one of the Astronauts sent to a distant planet that is thought to be filled with various kinds of life. With the journey taking more than a dozen years to reach it's destination, even though the spaceship is travelling twice the speed of light, the crew is put into a cryosleep. On reaching the planet something goes terribly wrong and a landing pod with all of the crew still asleep is crashed into the planet's surface. Some time after the crash landing, the protagonist regains consciousness only to find out that all of the crew is gone, landing pod is damaged beyond repair, his space suit is leaking oxygen and the planet itself turns out to be the wasteland with no signs of life. However after spotting and following the footprints in the sand you discover a derelict Soviet Union outpost, and this is where the protagonist starts to question if their mission was a hoax.With the game starting out as a more straightforward sci-fi thriller, especially after encountering a strange woman who can walk the surface of the planet without the need for a special suit with the supply of oxygen, even with the influences of the early science fiction films of the first half of the last century (particularly Aelita[en.wikipedia.org] and Woman in the Moon[en.wikipedia.org]) it is very interesting to watch how the game expands it's story into a more intelligent and thoughtful themes. If you're familiar with the works of the great Stanislaw Lem[en.wikipedia.org], particularly the ones that explore attempts at communicating with an alien intelligence (see: ""Solaris"", ""The Invincible"" and ""Fiasco"") you will know what I mean. Having said that, I also have to say that as other great pieces of art Lifeless Planet is using those influences to tell it's own story. With the main themes of game being the ones of ecology and how species interact with the biosphere; Fermi paradox[en.wikipedia.org] and the concept of otherness; and of course the story of the main protagonist, which ties it all together through his own personal loss in the past that he overcomes by finding out the story of that mysterious woman and the chain of events that led the planet to a state in which you found it.

												This is the first so called walking simulator I have played and I have to say I really liked (most of) it! Having said that, though, I do not recommend it (read on to find out way).  You spend most of your time exploring the world, occasionally jumping across gaps or pushing rocks but mostly just walking around. The few puzzles really aren't anything extraordinary and the solutions to all of them are immediately obvious. The real enjoyment comes from exploring the vast and impressive environments and finding clues about what happened to this world and the Russians who first settled it. The story is definitely intriguing and kept me entertained the entire way through the game, which is good, because the exploration part unfortunately becomes quite boring by the end of the game.  The first two hours are fantastic!  The last two to three hours, are mediocre and bland.Early on there are rock specimens, scientist logs, and intractable locations all over the place, but by the end of the game, there's pretty much nothing hidden for you to find. I feel the designer, by placing these items throughout the early levels, deliberately designed the game to make you waste time looking for something when there is nothing to be found. Either that or he just ran out of ideas for the second half of the game. I stopped bothering to explore about 75% of the way through the game and instead just kept to the obviously marked path since there was apparently nothing else to find or see in the giant open areas.There are a few areas where the game gets in the way of the immersion. These are only minor at first, but they quickly become more prominent in the late game. Two minor aspects break the game's own rules: oxygen that you only need sometimes and jet fuel that is infinite until you move into the next area. The major problems I constantly experienced were:- the astronaut sometimes hits an invisible wall that prevents you from progressing down an otherwise obvious path- a rock will look like something you can stand on but the game doesn't let you- the astronaut suddenly dies mid-jump because you jumped toward an area you are not supposed to be able to reach- when walking forward up a steep incline, if you jump you lose all forward motion and actually go backwards (this one is a huge annoyance considering how often you have to jump uphill)More commentary on that last major flaw... This game is a platforming game, and the fact that the platforming is broken is a huge dissapointment.  I was honestly getting angry at the game with how difficult the jump mechanics make it to follow an obvious path through the world.The story and environments start really strong, but they significantly decrease at the end of the game. If you want to experience a good story and uncover an interesting history of a fictional distant planet, then certainly give this a shot. If you want a good game, you are probably best off looking somewhere else.			"

												The game really draws you in with a pretty landscape and engaging beginning but quickly turns into simply running from place to place for 4 hours. Transitions are weirdly placed and so jarring that it will completely throw you out of any immersion. The puzzles can't really be called puzzles as a child could complete them, the only really difficult part of the game is not backtracking because everything looks the same. I know this game isn't supposed to be about gameplay and all about the story and while the story is interesting the logs are scattered too thin and in some places are quite hidden, however each log doesn't really add enough to make it worthwhile to search them all out. Having the logs read out to you while you are doing your running could've made the trek less tedious, but if you are an english speaker that's not going to happen because all the voiceacting is in Russian. Not worth 20, not even worth the 15 it was on sale for during the summer sale.			"

												I tried to like this game, but by the end I was pushing through purely because I wanted to finish it. The character controls like a drunk toddler, and it's hard to judge distances. This often leads to you walking off ledges unintentionally because you overshot a jump, and needed to turn around. On top of this the levels were HUGE, with practically nothing to explore. I didn't expect a lot of gameplay, but I expected to not struggle with hopping between platforms purely because my character handled horribly. The story was ok, but only because of there being a bunch of logs for you to find and hear little snippets of information from. I almost expected upon reaching the scene with his wife for this to all turn out to be some kind of delusional haze he was in, but instead I found the story of his wife having virtually no tie to the story. It felt like they just wanted to throw that in there to make him seem more fleshed out.4/10. Wouldn't buy for $20 (ABSOLUTELY NOT) but I would buy for a couple bucks, or if it's ever in a humble bundle again.			"

Fortunately i am not the type of gamer thats gonoing to watse 20$ so simple. I waited a while. Read the reviews. Noyt good. Finally i found the game almost free so i bought it. I gave it a shot/ The story held me into the game. The mood and the voice acting. Not the gameplay or something else,Pros:-Great story-Enviroments-Voice acting-Music and atmosphereCons:-Very bad Models-Lifeless gameplay-The riddles are not even challenging-Overpriced-Sometimes feels really unreallisticI recommend the game only for the story. If you can find it for 5$ or less thengive it a shot but dont expect much!			"

												Lifeless Planet certainly sold me on a unique premise.  An American Astronaut lands on a planet 30 light years from earth, only to discover that not only did the Soviet beat them there, but that they've all mysteriously disappeared...And so begins what is probably the best 'Walking Simulator' I've played in the last three years, and all the usual suspects of the genre are here; diary entries, simple puzzles, no enemies, and most importantly, an atmosphere so thick and intoxicating that it just makes the games many flaws all that more tragic.  The majority of the games 'walking' involves linear pathways with simplistic jumping challenges and the occasional 'put the battery in the battery slot' puzzle, while gravity and vegetation serve as the games biggest threats.  It's certainly more involved than the other mascots of the genre, like Gone Home and Dear Ester.The graphics in particular deserve attention.  Specifically, they're terrible.  Even while playing on the highest graphical settings it felt like I was playing a game from the middle of the PS2 era.  Hope you like your worlds full of terrain morphing, because that's what you're getting, texture stretching on cliffs and all.  This plain geology is broken up with some simple rock models here and there, but it's no where near enough to fix how bland some environments feel.  The man-made structures are a mixed bag.  The simple utilitarian houses are well modelled and fit the theme well, while the larger structures are blocky and kind of silly looking.  The character models are also horrendous, and have such a cheap, low quality appearance.The games plot is also a bit of a mixed bag.  Earlier parts of the game sprinkle bits of character back-story on you, before deciding the to leave that arc alone until the end game.  In fact, so many plot points occur in the opening segments of the game that a lot of the middle section simply feels like filler.  On the other hand, this 'quiet' gives the game, and the player, a chance to take in the scenery, and with a full play through lasting three and a half hours, it's not that big a deal.Even with the visual and story pacing issues, I found Lifeless Planet to be a generally pleasurable experience.  It's aura of mystery and discovery kept me interested enough to see it to the end.  That said, it's a bit steep at $20, so you're better off waiting for a sale or bundle deal.			"

												If you're reading the 50/50 split on whether this game is ""good"" or not, consider that it may just not be for everyone.  I'd say the closest equivalent (which I surprisingly haven't seen referenced) is Journey.  If you enjoy an ambient experience where a story unfolds as you move through a unique landscape, this is for you.  The soundtrack enhances the experience, and while there is a good bit of jumping it doesn't really feel like you're playing a platformer.  If you are looking to point-and-click through things, or have high-action sequences, you won't enjoy this.  A $20 pricetag is on the high side, but I've paid more for less (and to be fair, less for more).  There's not really any replay value, but I've seen some pretty great movies I wouldn't want to watch either.  There are some people who are going to be really happy with this game - just know what you need from a game to enjoy it first.			"

												In the end, Lifeless Planet doesn't do enough right for me to recommend it. The gameplay is mostly functional and competent, but boring. The visuals and story are both good, but not good enough to overcome the tedious gameplay and game-breaking technical issues. If you're someone who really likes old-school science fiction, then this game might be worth the six or eight hours it will take to complete (and it's not worth it, unless you do complete it). Otherwise, you'll probably wind up bored out of your mind.Full review: http://www.megabearsfan.net/post/2015/02/13/Lifeless-Planet-game-review-and-plot-interpretation.aspx "

												I wanted to like this game so much, but the controls are the biggest obstacle int the game. The camera is the second challenge you face as you cant see most of what you need to. The night sections of the game are a chore as you cant see much, the torch is tiny and the camera angle is totally unhelpful. Finally the things that kill you just make you want to uninstall the game. They are so out of the blue or related to the terrible controls that its just not fun. It feels like the game developers never actually played the game themselves.Aside from all that, the story starts off great but then it becomes a huge amount of repetitive jumping puzzles and mindless walking around.This game had so much promise but fails to deliver sadly.I would recommend anyone reading this to avoid the game.

												I bought this game on Steam because the premise intrigued me. Loading up the game had me crash land on a strange alien world. The first thing that struck me while playing, was how generic the animations looked. Then how plain the landscape looked. It never got much better. I do realize it is an indie game, but I have seen better from indie devs. The overblurring of everything just struck me as lazy.The story was not as good as I would have hoped. The small tidbits of information you find around the world as you explore are enough to keep you going, but ultimately it isn't enough. The developer may have thought so as well, as there is a very loose story about the main characters wife thrown in there. I cared more about the history of the planet, and who/what is on it than a character that I was never introduced to in the first place.With the amount of jumping puzzles in the game, the mechanics are decently done. However I had problems trying to get my character to turn around without running in a half circle and walking off small platforms. This mechanic if you were running could be explaned with forward momentum, but it happens while standing still which creates an artificial difficulty with some of the jumps. Otherwise the game does a good job of holding your hand at the beginning as less as you go on. Where you need to go isn't clearly defined, but I found myself instinctually heading the right way.Overall the game wasn't terrible, but I was expecting alot more. the zones and graphics felt too recycled for me. I finished it (barely) in under four hours, and that felt like a good time to stop it. It might be worth buying on a Steam sale, but if you are expecting Gone Home on an alien planet, you aren't going to find it here.			"

												I haven't finnished the game yet, so I can't speak to the resolve of the story as to whether or not the journey is worth it, but the game design is just poor.  The controls are a bit awkward, you can't strafe, but rather turn in a circle.  The levels are designed with extremely clear paths for you to take.  There are almost no puzzles in the game.  The only puzzles that really exist are jumping puzzles, and that's pretty much the only mechanic.  So if you like Parkour games in Minecraft, you'll love this game, but otherwise you'll find it extremely frustrating.  The terrain is also poorly designed.  There are many places where I just got stuck because the models were just a little too steep in an unsuspecting place.Thigs in the game are either extremely easy or extremely frustrating.  I don't mind challenging or frustrating games, but when 90% of the game is as easy as following the path, when it finally tries to give you a challenge that is above average in it's level of difficulty, it's extremely frustrating.  Lastly, some things are just kinda broken.  Most recently, I went up an elevator, realized I had to go back down to find something.  On the elvator ride back down, I decided to jump off to save time.  However, when I jumped off the elevator it stopped where it was at!  There was no way for me to get back up.  I couldn't reach it.  And ""intentionally"" the call button is broken.  So i've had to quit the game.  I hope when I restart the problem fixes itself.Frustration aside, the story is very intriguing.  I'm still very interested in seeing how this story resolves.  That said, the frequency of details begins to drop off dramatically the more you play the game.  It's nice to be left in the dark for awhile so you can try to piece things together yourself, but the developers have defnitely not mastered the art of witholding information.  If you withold too much your audience will be confused or bored.  If the gameplay was more creative and challenging (in a good, well thought out way) I would forgive the major pauses in story progression.  But it's not fun to put a story on hold simply because I have to follow a path for 10min.			"

												5/10So i like space themed games. I'm a sucker for that type of genre. The only thing space about this game is the Astronaut suit. If you replaced the Nasa suit guy with any other type of character(space marine or whatever), im pretty sure this game wouldnt have half of the recommended reviews that it currently has. I really wanted to like this game, and to be fair there were moments of brilliance shining through the cracks, but i just cannot recommend it. At it's full priee of 20  dollars its an absolute rip off. i know this game is on sale now for 10 dollars so it MIGHT be tolerable to some. but for $20 hell no. This game doesn't have that isolated open barren waseteland planet feel, infact its rather quite linear with very boring level design.  Buildings and houses  in this game resemble something you would see in a dreamcast game. To be fair i enjoyed the story and thought the ending was ok, but the pacing and the delivery of the plot was awful. and the transitioning between levels was so laughable bad, prolly the worst i have EVER SEEEN IN A GAME. It made it feel really unfinished. Your just walking along when the screen goes black with no sound, next thing you know your in a totally different area on yet another narrow path. Voice acting wasn't good either. felt cheap. Although i did enjoy the soundtrack, and they didnt over use it thank god. I really wanted to like this. and the only reason i beat it was because of how much i spent on it. Its been a day since i played/beat this game and i can vaguely even remember anything about it,  nothing stood out and made it memorable. There were no ""Wow"" moments.  Even if you buy this on sale be prepared for a repetitive, boring journey through what looks like an old dreamcast game with high res textures.(Not that there is anything wrong with old games, but you know what i mean)			"

								Good game but beta version was very short. The game was really getting intresting near the end of the demo. Yes I know the full game will be released on the 6th June however I expected and wanted more; suppose that was the point!There were a couple of bugs throughout the game; such as the player getting stuck in rocks and not able to jump out.  The only way out was restoring form the last checkpoint. The arm object has problems for example picking up the green stone does not work and needs to be improved. The jumping and jetpack mechanics work well and easy to use. The environment is good great sense of space throughtout the environment. The voice overs and text is well done and keeps the player updated and informed about the world and how to use certain things. Some nice puzzles elements starting to happening making the player think more regarding which path to go. A few cars or buggys would of been great and maybe the abilty to glide also. However really enjoyed it so far!			"

												Lifeless Planet is a game with an excellent Sci-Fi story that kept me wanting to play this game more and more as I went on playing it. The platforming and puzzle solving aspects of the gameplay were pretty fun, although the physics in the game made the platforming more of a challenge than it should have been. I also had a few instances where I got stuck and couldn't get out, forcing me to restart from the last checkpoint, and it can be easy to get lost and not be able to figure out what to do next since the levels are quite expansive. But regardless of all of that, I would still recommend this game for it's story. Without the story it's a pretty 'meh' puzzle platformer, but the story makes the whole experience worthwhile.			"

												Mixed review for this one. I don't think it would be worth the money for the full-priced game, but on special or as part of a bundle... sure. I grew up reading a lot of sci-fi, so I was expected more from the story to be honest. And there was really only one type of 'enemy' in the game with really long, slow levels. Seemed as though it was intentially designed to be tedious to get from point A to point B. And if you don't like jumping puzzles, this game is certainly not for you... about 95% of the puzzles consist of jumping from platform to platform. And if you miss one step, you have to start all the way back at the beginning again. Also, the textures in the game were recycled over and over again, so the environments got really old, really fast. Not as immersive as I was hoping for. Oh well, still an ok time waster if you want one. Start to finish is between 4 - 5 hrs.			"

												It's basically an interactive story with a little bit of platforming and puzzles. Well, not so much puzzles as move-the-rock-closer-and-jump-up type moments. The scenery is spectacular and the story is compelling enough to keep you progressing. The platforming aspect is minimal but exciting. As it stands, it takes 4 to 5 hours to complete. I'm not sure I'd replay it unless they added more storyline. It's worth the $20 price but I'm sure it'll go on sale at some point. It would be worth waiting if for no other reason, there might be more content by then.			"

												Lifeless planet is an adventure game with some light puzzle-solving.  It's ambitious, and most of the time it manages to acheive what it sets out to do amazingly well.  It's occasionally let down by ""programmer art"", so the graphics are uneven in quality. This can be jarring, but the eye shown for the composition of a scene means that much of the time it's a very attractive game, and often breathtaking.  The sound design is fantastic throughout and the score is used very effectively.It's almost completely non-violent, it manages to hit all of its plot points with only very occasional bum notes, and it has a jetpack that allows you to double-jump.  I love it.			"

												Rich story, expansive world, and nice puzzles are contained within this game. The music was fantastic in its ability to immerse oneself into. The astronaut is the only playable character, and it sometimes is a little challenging to maneuver him in small spaces. This game also has lots of parkour elements into it, but is satisfactory in how easily managed the obstacles/ puzzles/ parkour can be. The ""About the Game"" section on this page does a great job of describing what you are up for.My only qualms with the game are the sensitivity of the controls and the seemingly low texture of the woman you are following compared to everything else. I bought this game during the summer sale for $16-$17. However, if I knew how great this game is beforehand I would greatly have paid the $20 for the game. 10/10 despite my criticisms. Would greatly recommend for everyone to try it.			"

												This is a great little game to pick up on sale. Its short (Has an achievement for finishing in under 4 hours), but is well worth a playthrough.Its graphics are average, but it makes up for it with some excellent music. It really sells the forlorn feeling of being alone on a dead world.The gameplay is simple, a combination of 3d platforming and simple puzzles. Its fine though, because you're playing this to uncover the story. Each scrap of dialogue and each found note leaves you wanting to find the next.I would suggest waiting for a sale for this game due to its length. Just know what you're getting, a short, simple sci-fi platformer game with excellent atmosphere, music, and story. A great way to spend an afternoon.			"

												Overall, I enjoyed this game. I have seen a lot of reviews saying that is it boring which I do not really agree with. It was not super action packed for very fast pace but it was enjoyable. I found myself at home with nothing to really do for an afternoon and this filled the void perfectly. It was a nice casual game I could play without having to think too hard really and hold my attention. Price wise $20 is maybe a bit much but whenever you see it pop up on sale I would definitely pick it up and try it. I loved the feeling of the planet and the enviroments felt large and looked amazing. The oxygen in the game seemed a little useless because I never ran into an issue where I needed it. Maybe if their was actually a timer going for it would add a little more pressure to the situation. All and all though I enjoyed the game and totally recommend anyone to play through it at least once.			"

												This is not a great game. The graphics are a bit dated (especially the one human character model in the game that looks like it belongs on a PS1), the story is bland and uninspired, the music is passable, the controls frustrating (platforming is not fun in spacesuit apparently), but this game does one thing very well. The game has a masterful sense of scale, Never since Shadow of the Colossus has a world felt so huge to me, and never has the character felt so small. Many areas of the game just feel astoundingly immense.This is definitely the game's strong point, and everything else feels very tacked on by comparison, but since it is short, I'd say it's worth the money if it's ons sale to check it out.

												Easily one of the best games I've played in a long time. It's kinda Portal meets Shadow Of The Coloussus, lots of puzzle solving, platforming and exploration. There are also survial horror elements, but these only intrigue, and ultmately this game is more tense then scary. The game is full of clever twists, that I have never really encountered before. These twists are sort of similar to those of The Twilight Zone. While some would compare this to Dear Esther, this is far more engaging and mysterious, and while the graphics arent as good at that game, there is so much more depth to this. And you know, you can actually understand whats going on!This game is not an action game, and I am concerned this game will be dismissed, because it does not have the fast pacing of COD or *insert AAA title here*. Please give this game a chance if you are intrested. There is so much to discover here, and I had a real blast with it. Thanks for reading.			"

												Lifeless Planet's story is orginal and invigorating. DO NOT WATCH A PLAYTHROUGH if you want to get the full immersion of this game. The graphics need work and the game still has alpha-bugs it also sometimes has flow issues.I would like to see a remake made with more people and maybe add survival and co-op features. I.E finding oxygen repairing the suit. The remake should be polished with good graphics and more sound effects. However, this game is a great first. I would like the remake free to people who already own lifless planet and if new people buy it, they get lifless planet 1 and 2. Finally, I would LOVE A PREQUELAll in all I give this game 3.5 out of 5 stars. It is worth playing and has a great mix of creaps, jumps, and bumps.I look forward to seeing more from these authors			"

												This gets a tentative recommendation, though in my opinion, this is a $10 game, not a $20 one.  Wait for it to go on sale, then buy it.*Spoiler Free Review*This is firmly an adventure game, and it uses its horror well.  You never have a way to fight back against the dangers of the planet, which works in the game's favor.  I was on edge the whole time, examining my path carefully to avoid dying horribly.  The game does host invisible walls, but with one or two exceptions, I never encountered them, focused on not being killed by the enemies lurking about.  To further play up the horror, you occasionally hallucinate through the game, which left me frequently wondering if what I just saw was real.The mystery of the first half of the game was phenomenal, as was the revelation of the planet's history, but this actually wound up working against the game.  The ending left me unsatisfied, and the twist revealed by the final document was disappointing.  I felt that it verged on pulling the game from Sci-fi to Fantasy, and after all that build up, it was a real let down.As you travel, there are set points where your jetpack fuel will run out (limiting you to just one boost, down from seven), as will your oxygen.  The oxygen is done to show passage of time, as well as to play into the story, and the jetpack fuel is done to present new platforming challenges, but both came off as contrived and pulled me out of the experience each time it happened.The controls work well on keyboard or controller, though a little bit more air maneuverability would have been nice.  Most of the puzzles are just a matter of finding the right object to drop into a hole, and the rest are figuring out a button sequence, but that's fine.  This isn't a puzzle game foremost, this is an exploration game.  The fact that the dev managed to make a linear exploration game not feel linear speaks volumes to his skill.The graphics leave much to be desired, but so long as you're looking at the surroundings, it works fine.  It's when you're looking at a facial expression that it becomes jarring.  Faces here always seem to be either neutral expression or vaguely malevolent, which makes the protagonist's description of what they were supposed to be expressing seem canned and insincere.I didn't get attached to the characters at all, and I can't help but think that had the protagonist's personal story been left out and the player been left to project on the character, the game would have been improved.  Without spoiling anything not already spoiled in the description, the mysterious woman had little personality.  Several scenes were thrown in to make me feel for her, and while one or two did make me feel horrified or confused as intended, I never managed an attachment.The level design is done quite well, though the transitions need a LOT of work.  Frequently a new level would start, I'd turn around and sit there wondering how in the hell I got here.  A few levels also felt that they were put in just to have them.  The fire level, or the hot springs level, for example.  The level in the volcanic area in particular was frustrating, as the game became one of guess and check to figure out which ledges were safe to land on, and which would kill you instantly.  A few times there were even invisible walls mid-air that would do the same.  Fortunately, the death system is done very well, or I likely would have stopped there in frustration.Overall, this is a good game, and it made me stay up far later than I should have to finish it.  A good story until the end, and I look forward to see more of the Dev's work in the future.  However, between the graphics, short run time (I finished it in ~4.5 hours), and lack of replayability, I don't feel it was worth the price of admission.			"

Lifeless Planet has much more gameplay than most walking simulators, with puzzles to solve and a lot of precision jumping. The game also sported a good sci fi story, though I would have loved a deeper story. Music was good and graphics were ok. I played using Xbox One controllers and the control felt great. By the end of the game I felt like a pro at jumping.			"

Early Access Review
								This is Journey, in space, with Russians, sort of... It's a great game because of the atmosphere and story.  The game mechanics are simple but that helps in my opinion.  This game relies on atmosphere and if the platforms and puzzles were too hard it would break that.  Heres a youtube review

												A solitude exploration of anomalies and catastrophic mystery.  Highlights are Adventure and Atmosphere, but Story and Gameplay fall short.  The Soundtrack is rich and dramatic for many curious forgotten enironments.  Much of the actual difficulty comes from exploring dark environments or massive deserts with clues to lead the way. Is it a lifeless game? No.  Is it for everyone? No. This is for space buffs who enjoy Myst or Dear Esther.			"

												A puzzle platformer with some adventure elements thrown in. The adventure-y parts aren't too hard, you shouldn't need to resort to a walkthrough. The parts that are challenging are the kind that don't need a walkthrough anyway, jump timing, figuring out where to jump and in what sequence.The story is innovative, and doesn't get in the way of playing the game. The cutscenes are short and to the point, which I like. They didn't work too hard on them and you don't have to work too hard watching them either.But jumping and jetting are basically the whole game. Catch it on sale if you can, I'd say $10 is a reasonable price for it.			"

												I have just finished this game. Great atmosphere, nice, beautiful landscapes, very appropriate soundtrack, and a quite enjoyable story (a little bit predictable after 1/3 of the game).Please take into account it is NOT a graphic adventure. The author says it is inspired, among others, in The Dig. The atmosphere recalls The Dig, but the gameplay does not. It is a platform game. There is a lot of jumping around, and the puzzles are much easier than the ones you fins in an adventure game.Nevertheless, it is very enjoyable. I usually don't play platformers (I don't like that kind of games) but i have finished this game. I'll probably play it again, just to visit parts I could have missed. "

												This game is trapped between being a classic sci-fi story and a platforming puzzler, and as a result it's not great at either. The platforming and environmental puzzles are not very difficult most of the time, and some of the hazards will almost never actually endanger you. The story was what initially drew me in and I enjoyed it much more than the leaping about, but it nonetheless suffered from what might have been a lack of focus: your character will remark on minerals he stumbles upon as part of a scavenger hunt type activity but not at all about the far stranger and more relevant things in the scenery, and too many of these intriguing-looking elements end up as mundane duds or get ignored altogether. Several other gameplay elements appear to have been added to create tension and the appearance of scarcity but the scarcity is scripted and you end up not caring. Nonetheless, the core concept is intriguing and is doled out well enough, with decent visuals, such that I wanted to keep going and see what was over the next hill, and ultimately did not regret doing so. On the whole I enjoyed Lifeless PLanet, chiefly for its story, but recognize its failings that may get in the way of other people's good fun.			"

												9/10 [SPOILERS] Despite the painfully slow start (in which i would've suggested adding more curious observations by our character about his crew or the 'alien planet' or possibly about his wife to engage the user), I was engaged into the campaign from the second we heard about the Green Fire and how it affected the soviets, then when we first saw the woman (whos name slips me) I was undoubtably hooked on following her and to find out who she is, or was. The second I picked up this game, I played the campaign straight until I was finished. The story just became so addictive that I really couldnt put it down without finding out *all* the answers. If i'm honest, this game felt and played a lot like Portal 2. Between the mysticism of the woman and the wrecked terrain with a beautiful past, combined with the small collections of puzzles ( -which I *really* grew fond of) I really enjoyed just admiring the story that was presented to me. The only thing I could nick at is that the wallpaper shown on a loading screen (the screen with the writing and mathematical equations) didnt really fit the story. ""Three or Four crew?"" really became redundant as after we'd met two of them and progressed far into the storyline.Generally speaking, this is one of the best story-driven game i've played since Portal 2. I'm really happy with how it plays and functions as more of an experience than a game (which, contrary to some peoples opinion is OK!) and would love to see more games like this in the future. (Thanks for bringing my attention to this game, KurtJMac and YogscastSips!!)			"

												Lifeless Planet, while it is a very short game, is a game that exemplifies the idea of the adventure being more about the journey than the destination. WHile I wouldn't necessarily recomend it at its current price, it is still a very good story for those fond of very outlandish oldschool sci-fi.The only real complaint is the fact that it was blatantly not designed for Keyboard and Mouse primarily, in the fact that the camera will move based on the direction your character moves, always trying to face where they're moving. This isn't a massive issue, but it stands out nonetheless.To avoid spoilers, there are segments in the game that require the usage of geysers to lift yourself upwards. They are very finnicky in how they want to work, and if they want to work. This can lead to about five to ten minutes woth of frustration, but I do not feel this ruins the overall experience.Overall I would give the game an honest 7/10. Reasoning being that the game was very short, though I do understand that this was a kickstarter project, along with other small issues. Otherwise, this game is excellent for those wanting to be immersed in an interesting sci-fi world that gets more and more interesting as you progress, giving a very classic sci-fi vibe in the meantime.

												This game is very... Special to me, as it tickles just all the right things for me. There is mystery, exploration, discovery, science and a little bit of horror in here, in just the right amounts to make this game feel increadibly atmospheric and fascinating. The actual ""game"" of it is a bit lacking - the platforming tends to be inprecise, I ran into a few places where I had to restart the game to get further and in some places, it feels a little aimless and you run around trying to figure out what to do. Still, I completely enjoyed unraveling this story and couldn't stop once I started. It's that good.If you're looking for a game that is absolutely brimming with atmosphere, chilling and very fitting music and a mysterious and interesting story, this is for you! That said, if you want smooth and responsive game play and don't care much for a story or a mystery - stay away! The gameplay is mostly walking, somewhat clunky platforming and simple puzzle solving.			"

												Here's a short but meaningful disclaimer: If you're looking for an action-packed alien-fighting laser rifle-filled sci-fi adventure, try another game. This game is purely aethestic, and is no way meant to be combat-based. The game takes you, an unamed widow of a man, through an alien world where the Russians have somehow gotten to and destroyed the place (Yeah, go figure, the Russians ruined everything). Stranded and with an oxygen leak in your suit, you set out aimlessly for reasons unknown, probably because you have nothing better to do. The game's storyline is ""Iffy"" to say the least, the gameplay is boring and repetative... But that's the point. It's an art game. You enjoy the scenery. Believe me, as far as art games go, this is one of the best I've ever played. It's a lot like Journey, there's good music and good environment but it's really sandy and you just kind of do the same thing forever. Long story short, if you want an action game, don't buy this, if you want an art game that's about appreciating the long hard hours it took to but this absolutely stunning landscape together, then go on ahead. I give it an 8.5/10 as far as art games go. It's also a great time waster!			"

												This is a wonderful game. Clunky controls, (relatively) low graphics, and bland voice acting do nothing to detract from this game. A tense and suspenseful world, but also relaxing and beautiful. Moments of horror and terror, with only one path given to you: run. These moments are balanced by snippets of story delivered as you explore the environment chasing after two things: the truth and hope. This game made me care about the characters, but didn't wrench my heart strings. Lifeless Planet picked me up and carried me for a while, and when it was done with me, gently placed me on the ground for another game to takes its place. The story it tells is full of contradictions that build a wonderful place where you can take a break from the intense action other games demand you take part of. The game took me 5 hours to complete, and left me happy with my purchase of 20 dollars. Do yourself a favor, and play this game. You'll thank yourself.			"

												Lifeless Planet might be compared to recent titles like Dear Esther, since the main part of the game is exploration. Like Dear Esther, atmosphere is a key element to the game as well. However, Dear Esther was no more complicated than walking. While they are not necessarily difficult, there are platforming and puzzle elements to Lifeless Planet. Neither will rival a game specific to that genre but they are there and are enough to make the game interesting and varied. Graphically, the game is beautiful and the music and voices are excellent as well. The controls can be a little touchy at times, but not enough to be frustrating. Sometimes the path is not clear but again, with the little study, figuring out where to go will become apparent. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent with Lifeless Planet and look forward to future games that David Board develops.			"

												Lifeless Planet is a great game. Gameplay is fun though a bit repetetive, the story is powerful with a tearjerker ending and it oozes atmosphere. However, it is by no means a traditional adventure. If you seek a traditional adventure game with complex puzzles that requires lateral thinking, look elsewhere. On the other hand, if you have fun with platform games like Portal and Prince of Persia or if you enjoy exploring vast mysterious worlds, you should definitely give it a chance. You won’t regret it.

Posted: June 6, 2014
												Lifeless Planet is certainly a novel idea, and although this review is a ""recommended"" one, this game does have its issues, and to be honest I can't really say I RECOMMEND it right now. I just feel that anyone who sees the red thumbs down on a review for a game that they like will just instantly hate on it without seeing what it has to say. Overall, I have mixed feelings about it. This is a spoiler-free review, so please read on.I'm not going to say anything about the story, except that the ending felt really unsatisfying for me. Other than that, I enjoyed it, and it certainly is a memorable experience... but it's just one of those things that I feel would work better as a movie than a game, at least in its current form. There is SO much walking without much happening, so many jumping puzzles which are made extra annoying by the walking mechanics--which make you move FORWARDS a little upon pressing S, before turning around. This has made me fall off of the edges of things countless times. There are very few puzzles and gameplay elements in between the walking, which aren't paticularly challenging... just dull.As for the graphics, they generally look a bit dated, but the skies and distant landscapes do look beautiful. The lighting isn't that bad either. However, I do seem to run into very random and inexplicable frame drops. (I have an i5-2500k and an AMD 7950.) Although this doesn't occur very often, one minute I can be getting 120FPS, the next it drops down to 15-30 in similar environments. Yes, I'm running on the highest settings, but my setup SHOULD be able to handle this game on the highest settings. The performance in this game is kind of unacceptable right now. Maybe it's something specific to AMD cards, who knows. I'm very disappointed with the performance in any case. Now, I love games about exploring desolate and abandoned things, such as in Portal 2 when you went though old aperture. That was honestly my favorite part of the game. Despite my frustration over the excessive walking and lackluster gameplay in Lifeless Planet, it managed to capture the same sort of atmosphere that made me enjoy the old aperture part of Portal 2.Really, whether I would recommend this game to you or not depends on your attitude towards ""walking simulators."" If you're one of the people who can tolerate Dear Esther, happy to just sit back and take in the pretty environments, then I'll hazard a guess to say that you will probably enjoy this game. If you dislike games where there is more walking than gameplay--in the case of Lifeless Planet, FAR more walking--then I would advise you to steer clear. To clarify, I am someone who dislikes Dear Esther, but loves The Stanley Parable--in fact it's one of my favorite games of all time. So I don't necessarily mind games where there isn't much ""gameplay"", just ones where there is too much walking without anything particularly interesting happening. Which is sadly, at least in my view, the case for Lifeless Planet.I'd like to state that I enjoyed the preorder demo, the sense of discovery when you come across that abandoned town and bunker is wonderful.  But unfortunately that's where it peaks. From there on out it's mostly pretty dull. I've been looking forward to the full release for a while now and I wanted so desperately to enjoy it. If the rest of the game was as interesting as the first few levels I could forgive all of its little faults, but unfortunately I found the rest of the game not necessarily BAD, but mostly disappointing. I bought this game for £8 from the humble store and I've gotten about 4 and a half hours out of it, excluding the time I spent on the pre-order demo. It had its good parts, and for that I don't regret purchasing it.Maybe you'll absolutely love it, I don't know, I'm not you. I'm not saying you shouldn't buy this, I just feel that someone needs to point out this game's issues so that they can be taken into consideration before you purchase it.TL;DR Lifeless Planet is a nice, pretty, atmospheric exploration game with an intriguing and original story--let down by excessive walking, lackluster gameplay and, at least on my hardware, unforgivable frame drops. If you have a tolerance for ""walking simulators"" then you may enjoy it. If not, steer clear.			"

												Lifeless Planet has a creative storyline. The load speed of the game is amazing, all the while requiring little from the hardware.  The game while enjoyable is not as polished as you would expect for a final release.  I would consider it 'Alpha' quality.  The transition from area to area is often lacking physical continuity.  The music is well done, but needs more variety.   Obstacles and solutions seem placed directly in the player’s path & require little thought, which removes a level of depth from the game.  A frequent example of this is the jet pack charge-once it is depleted you know that all upcoming jumps will be small, removing a level of unknown from the player.  Character development is crucial for the player to become immersed in the reality of this game.  Too much time is spent on the technology development, and too little on Aelita.  You have the opportunity to develop a sense of sympathy for the planet, but very little for Aletia.  It would have been endearing to see the two parallel each other.  There are also small glitches with the PDA and claw.  I hope to see more games in the future from this developer.  On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest rating, I would give it a 3.5.			"

												Enjoyable. Suspenseful.  Great musical timing. It really gives you the feeling of exploring an alien world, wondering why everything is the way it is.  If you're looking for something to keep you clicking to see what happens next, this is a great title.  I wouldn't so much call it a ""game"" though, more of an ""experience.""  To call this a game is like calling something at Universal Studios a ride.  Not so much, just an experience.  A few platform jumping puzzles here, pushing around rocks there... that's about it.  But put all that aside and play it for it's plot and the way it makes you feel, and you'll have an enjoyable experience.  Zero replayability, but great for a once-through.  Solid A-			"

												Lifeless Planet is a interesting game that has some losing points that went along with it.First the good stuff. Music is well done for the most part with only a couple of tracks that seemed to be slightly off.The voice acting was good and the main character has a very smooth story telling voice.This game is an adventure game that is reminiscent of URU and as a person that like this style I like seeing more of these games.Story has some good bones to it.Areas for improvementWhile the story has good bones there are some things that are not well executed and can leave you with a feeling that you are missing something or they could have been better developed.It lacks some of the creative puzzles that are usual for this style of game.Graphics were a little low end, but for an indie game I am not really going to pick at this much.Lots of running, which wouldn't be a big deal if there was more stuff to find, but a lot of it just seems to stretch on without a payoff.Game length is kind of short and I think this could have been remedied by some more character development.Overall I enjoyed the game and it can keep you going as long as you can have some patience and if you are not too eager to have immediate gratification I think you will as well. As for the cost I would probably not pay full rate for it, but on sale I would definitely grab it. There is a lot of promise in this game and I hope to see more from the developer in the future. Just in case there is a question about my play time I watched my wife play it on her computer.			"

												I think this is a very good adventure game with an interesting mysterious sci-fi story and with a good third-person adventure gameplay. That ""abandoned, barren wasteland planet"" atmosphere is wonderfull like the post-apocalyptic atmosphere of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games and other post-apocalyptic games. And it's musics take the point on the letter 'i'.There were few fps problems in some scenes (little lag) but these are not make any scars on the game. A little optimisation can solve it.Anyway, this is a wonderfull game, I really enjoyed it.			"

												Fantastic story and puzzle-solving game however a Lifeless planet 2 or DLC should be made to explain exactly where the character is now. Every puzzle is unique to the area and I just love puzzles. the next one should have much more complex puzzles however, so that gamers like me can have a real challenge.			"

												I bought this for several reasons. I was hoping for that The Swapper atmosphere, spooky sci-fi. Some walking, some puzzles - jumping puzzles mostly, but still - no shooting stuff. The idea, and screenshots, seemed quite interesting. Also, the developer seems like a nice guy, answering the questions on the Steam forums and all. At 20 euro the price was a bit of a stretch, but I found it for 15 and decided to throw some cash.It is not as good as The Swapper. Lifeless Planet is basically an action adventure game, just without much action. Which is good. In good old days we called that a platformer. You crash on distant planet and then the things start to get weird, when you find a remains of russian base and one survivor who is not human anymore. I was expecting a spooky sci-fi, but didn't found the game that spooky at all. The visuals are quite interesting though, if you like to travel through some wastelands and ruins. The second part of the game was much better for me with more jumping and varied visuals.The game length is ok at 5-6hrs for your first playthrough, the only playthrough if you don't want to hunt for achievements. If you like wandering through deserted wastelands and some platform jumping action give it a try. If you prefer to run killing aliens stay away.			"

 Review of the game ""Lifeless Planet"" from the director of Project Freelancer.This game is of particular interest to me, as it gives me pause from my own search.I will attempt to give a unbiased and partial review for this interactive audio/visual experience.Graphics: Nothing special, but the large scenescapes and visuals more than make up for this short coming.Controls: Standard platform game fare, but it needs the option to adjust sensitivity on gamepad controllers.Audio: The ambient music is something to behold, and is quite pleasent to listen to.Gameplay: I believe one of the games tags is ""walking simulator"". A fair description, but also add platforming.Replay Value: once you collect all the mineral samples, there's really not much motivation to go back.Overall: A good game that's worth its value, buick quickly loses value once you've found all there is to be found.Score: 7.5/10Notes: Please add the option to adjust gamepad sensitivity to the ingame menu for easy adjustment. Not just for the camera movement.			"

												This game is alright, it has beautiful scenery as you get to walk along this dead planet. Lots of puzzles for people who enjoy thinking and such (not my strong point, constantly getting stuck. =/) This game also has a bit of a suspensful atmosphere to the game as you walk along. I give it a solid 8/10, would be higher if I wasnt getting stuck constantly. Makes it a bit harder to play for me. Most people probably wont have that problem, but if you have trouble with games that offer little help at time, then don't rush in thinking it will be easy.			"

												This game is very different from what I've come to expect.   The only explosions created are from natural rock slides and the few coincidences where you need dynamite to progress through the story.   I liked the fact that the creators managed to enable the use of controllers, but the controls were a bit iffy.   The story itself was very interesting and was probably the only thing keeping me from turning off my computer.   That said, you shouldn't expect this to be a huge RPG top seller, but I'll give it a 7/10 for it being what it is.			"

												Easily one of the best games I've played in a long time. It's kinda Portal meets Shadow Of The Coloussus, lots of puzzle solving, platforming and exploration. There are also survial horror elements, but these only intrigue, and ultmately this game is more tense then scary. The game is full of clever twists, that I have never really encountered before. These twists are sort of similar to those of The Twilight Zone. While some would compare this to Dear Esther, this is far more engaging and mysterious, and while the graphics arent as good at that game, there is so much more depth to this. And you know, you can actually understand whats going on!This game is not an action game, and I am concerned this game will be dismissed, because it does not have the fast pacing of COD or *insert AAA title here*. Please give this game a chance if you are intrested. There is so much to discover here, and I had a real blast with it. Thanks for reading.			"

												Lifeless Planet's story is orginal and invigorating. DO NOT WATCH A PLAYTHROUGH if you want to get the full immersion of this game. The graphics need work and the game still has alpha-bugs it also sometimes has flow issues.I would like to see a remake made with more people and maybe add survival and co-op features. I.E finding oxygen repairing the suit. The remake should be polished with good graphics and more sound effects. However, this game is a great first. I would like the remake free to people who already own lifless planet and if new people buy it, they get lifless planet 1 and 2. Finally, I would LOVE A PREQUELAll in all I give this game 3.5 out of 5 stars. It is worth playing and has a great mix of creaps, jumps, and bumps.I look forward to seeing more from these authors			"

												This gets a tentative recommendation, though in my opinion, this is a $10 game, not a $20 one.  Wait for it to go on sale, then buy it.*Spoiler Free Review*This is firmly an adventure game, and it uses its horror well.  You never have a way to fight back against the dangers of the planet, which works in the game's favor.  I was on edge the whole time, examining my path carefully to avoid dying horribly.  The game does host invisible walls, but with one or two exceptions, I never encountered them, focused on not being killed by the enemies lurking about.  To further play up the horror, you occasionally hallucinate through the game, which left me frequently wondering if what I just saw was real.The mystery of the first half of the game was phenomenal, as was the revelation of the planet's history, but this actually wound up working against the game.  The ending left me unsatisfied, and the twist revealed by the final document was disappointing.  I felt that it verged on pulling the game from Sci-fi to Fantasy, and after all that build up, it was a real let down.As you travel, there are set points where your jetpack fuel will run out (limiting you to just one boost, down from seven), as will your oxygen.  The oxygen is done to show passage of time, as well as to play into the story, and the jetpack fuel is done to present new platforming challenges, but both came off as contrived and pulled me out of the experience each time it happened.The controls work well on keyboard or controller, though a little bit more air maneuverability would have been nice.  Most of the puzzles are just a matter of finding the right object to drop into a hole, and the rest are figuring out a button sequence, but that's fine.  This isn't a puzzle game foremost, this is an exploration game.  The fact that the dev managed to make a linear exploration game not feel linear speaks volumes to his skill.The graphics leave much to be desired, but so long as you're looking at the surroundings, it works fine.  It's when you're looking at a facial expression that it becomes jarring.  Faces here always seem to be either neutral expression or vaguely malevolent, which makes the protagonist's description of what they were supposed to be expressing seem canned and insincere.I didn't get attached to the characters at all, and I can't help but think that had the protagonist's personal story been left out and the player been left to project on the character, the game would have been improved.  Without spoiling anything not already spoiled in the description, the mysterious woman had little personality.  Several scenes were thrown in to make me feel for her, and while one or two did make me feel horrified or confused as intended, I never managed an attachment.The level design is done quite well, though the transitions need a LOT of work.  Frequently a new level would start, I'd turn around and sit there wondering how in the hell I got here.  A few levels also felt that they were put in just to have them.  The fire level, or the hot springs level, for example.  The level in the volcanic area in particular was frustrating, as the game became one of guess and check to figure out which ledges were safe to land on, and which would kill you instantly.  A few times there were even invisible walls mid-air that would do the same.  Fortunately, the death system is done very well, or I likely would have stopped there in frustration.Overall, this is a good game, and it made me stay up far later than I should have to finish it.  A good story until the end, and I look forward to see more of the Dev's work in the future.  However, between the graphics, short run time (I finished it in ~4.5 hours), and lack of replayability, I don't feel it was worth the price of admission.			"

												Overall, I enjoyed this game. I have seen a lot of reviews saying that is it boring which I do not really agree with. It was not super action packed for very fast pace but it was enjoyable. I found myself at home with nothing to really do for an afternoon and this filled the void perfectly. It was a nice casual game I could play without having to think too hard really and hold my attention. Price wise $20 is maybe a bit much but whenever you see it pop up on sale I would definitely pick it up and try it. I loved the feeling of the planet and the enviroments felt large and looked amazing. The oxygen in the game seemed a little useless because I never ran into an issue where I needed it. Maybe if their was actually a timer going for it would add a little more pressure to the situation. All and all though I enjoyed the game and totally recommend anyone to play through it at least once.			"

The graphics are a bit dated (especially the one human character model in the game that looks like it belongs on a PS1), the story is bland and uninspired, the music is passable, the controls frustrating (platforming is not fun in spacesuit apparently), but this game does one thing very well. The game has a masterful sense of scale, Never since Shadow of the Colossus has a world felt so huge to me, and never has the character felt so small. Many areas of the game just feel astoundingly immense.This is definitely the game's strong point, and everything else feels very tacked on by comparison, but since it is short, I'd say it's worth the money if it's ons sale to check it out.

The oxygen is done to show passage of time, as well as to play into the story, and the jetpack fuel is done to present new platforming challenges, but both came off as contrived and pulled me out of the experience each time it happened.The controls work well on keyboard or controller, though a little bit more air maneuverability would have been nice.  Most of the puzzles are just a matter of finding the right object to drop into a hole, and the rest are figuring out a button sequence, but that's fine.  This isn't a puzzle game foremost, this is an exploration game.  The fact that the dev managed to make a linear exploration game not feel linear speaks volumes to his skill.The graphics leave much to be desired, but so long as you're looking at the surroundings, it works fine.  It's when you're looking at a facial expression that it becomes jarring.  Faces here always seem to be either neutral expression or vaguely malevolent, which makes the protagonist's description of what they were supposed to be expressing seem canned and insincere.I didn't get attached to the characters at all, and I can't help but think that had the protagonist's personal story been left out and the player been left to project on the character, the game would have been improved.  Without spoiling anything not already spoiled in the description, the mysterious woman had little personality.  Several scenes were thrown in to make me feel for her, and while one or two did make me feel horrified or confused as intended, I never managed an attachment.The level design is done quite well, though the transitions need a LOT of work.  Frequently a new level would start, I'd turn around and sit there wondering how in the hell I got here.  A few levels also felt that they were put in just to have them.  The fire level, or the hot springs level, for example.  The level in the volcanic area in particular was frustrating, as the game became one of guess and check to figure out which ledges were safe to land on, and which would kill you instantly.  A few times there were even invisible walls mid-air that would do the same.  Fortunately, the death system is done very well, or I likely would have stopped there in frustration.Overall, this is a good game, and it made me stay up far later than I should have to finish it.  A good story until the end, and I look forward to see more of the Dev's work in the future.  However, between the graphics, short run time (I finished it in ~4.5 hours), and lack of replayability, I don't feel it was worth the price of admission.			"

												Lifeless Planet's story is orginal and invigorating. DO NOT WATCH A PLAYTHROUGH if you want to get the full immersion of this game. The graphics need work and the game still has alpha-bugs it also sometimes has flow issues.I would like to see a remake made with more people and maybe add survival and co-op features. I.E finding oxygen repairing the suit. The remake should be polished with good graphics and more sound effects. However, this game is a great first. I would like the remake free to people who already own lifless planet and if new people buy it, they get lifless planet 1 and 2. Finally, I would LOVE A PREQUELAll in all I give this game 3.5 out of 5 stars. It is worth playing and has a great mix of creaps, jumps, and bumps.I look forward to seeing more from these authors			"

The only thing i had problems with (MAYBE SPOILERS) is on the icy terrain i got wedged in between some of the glaciers a couple of times and the only way to resolve it was to reset the checkpoint. That was the only problem i had with the entire game, besides that, I think this is one of the best games I have played all the way through and enjoyed every second of it. Good Job!			"

												I've really enjoyed some of the recent ""walking simulator"" games like Dear Esther and Gone Home and that's all I expected from this. Instead I had 6 hours of exploration and adventure while a story was slowly being untold. Lifeless Planet has much more gameplay than most walking simulators, with puzzles to solve and a lot of precision jumping. The game also sported a good sci fi story, though I would have loved a deeper story. Music was good and graphics were ok. I played using Xbox One controllers and the control felt great. By the end of the game I felt like a pro at jumping.			"

A little optimisation can solve it.Anyway, this is a wonderfull game, I really enjoyed it.			"

												I bought this for several reasons. I was hoping for that The Swapper atmosphere, spooky sci-fi. Some walking, some puzzles - jumping puzzles mostly, but still - no shooting stuff. The idea, and screenshots, seemed quite interesting. Also, the developer seems like a nice guy, answering the questions on the Steam forums and all. At 20 euro the price was a bit of a stretch, but I found it for 15 and decided to throw some cash.It is not as good as The Swapper. Lifeless Planet is basically an action adventure game, just without much action. Which is good. In good old days we called that a platformer. You crash on distant planet and then the things start to get weird, when you find a remains of russian base and one survivor who is not human anymore. I was expecting a spooky sci-fi, but didn't found the game that spooky at all. The visuals are quite interesting though, if you like to travel through some wastelands and ruins. The second part of the game was much better for me with more jumping and varied visuals.The game length is ok at 5-6hrs for your first playthrough, the only playthrough if you don't want to hunt for achievements. If you like wandering through deserted wastelands and some platform jumping action give it a try. If you prefer to run killing aliens stay away.			"

 Review of the game ""Lifeless Planet"" from the director of Project Freelancer.This game is of particular interest to me, as it gives me pause from my own search.I will attempt to give a unbiased and partial review for this interactive audio/visual experience.Graphics: Nothing special, but the large scenescapes and visuals more than make up for this short coming.Controls: Standard platform game fare, but it needs the option to adjust sensitivity on gamepad controllers.Audio: The ambient music is something to behold, and is quite pleasent to listen to.Gameplay: I believe one of the games tags is ""walking simulator"". A fair description, but also add platforming.Replay Value: once you collect all the mineral samples, there's really not much motivation to go back.Overall: A good game that's worth its value, buick quickly loses value once you've found all there is to be found.Score: 7.5/10Notes: Please add the option to adjust gamepad sensitivity to the ingame menu for easy adjustment. Not just for the camera movement.			"

												This game is alright, it has beautiful scenery as you get to walk along this dead planet. Lots of puzzles for people who enjoy thinking and such (not my strong point, constantly getting stuck. =/) This game also has a bit of a suspensful atmosphere to the game as you walk along. I give it a solid 8/10, would be higher if I wasnt getting stuck constantly. Makes it a bit harder to play for me. Most people probably wont have that problem, but if you have trouble with games that offer little help at time, then don't rush in thinking it will be easy.			"

												First off, I want to say; this game is worth the $20 I spent. I started slow, though I sped up a bit towards the end. It took me about 4 hours to complete. This is a beautiful game, minus the ""human"" models and animations. This is not the prettiest game I have ever seen, but the devs obviously took the time to get it right. Atmosphere is the name of the game here; the sound effects are great, the music is fantastic. Voice acting is average. The experience was wonderful, creepy, and played to my inner conspiracy-theorist. I played with maxed-out settings (with an EVGA 760) and only encountered frame rate drops when confronted with scaffolding; a little confusing, as this is not a GPU-heavy game. However, there are elements in the game that seem almost like an after-thought; oxygen hunting, some of the puzzles. I did not get stuck on any of the puzzles, although I will say this; the platforming was weak. Not weak because it was so simple a 2 year-old could do it, but weak because the controls were not as responsive as they could have been. It almost seemed like there was an element of momentum to the jumping, but it did not always work. Sometimes I had to run in circles a bit before I took the running leap. That being said, I did not play with k/m. I used a gamepad to play, as it felt more natural in this case. I'm not sure if my troubles were because of my use of a gamepad, so I would not hold it against the devs.Overall; this was a 9/10.These guys know how it's done. If you think that $20 is too much for a 4-6 hour experience, try to remember the last time you went to see an IMAX movie. How much did you spend? Maybe $20 - $30? That experience probably lasted only an hour and a half. There is a lot to be seen here, a lot to be admired. They did a fantastic job, and I hope they make more games.			"

												If I had to descirbe this game in one word it would be ""competent"". The major failing is the gameplay which is fairly anemic ; the puzzels are easy and the platforming is a bit middle of the road so by the end of the game it can feel a bit tedious. Like with  some other puzzle platformers you will eventally a point in the game where you will think ""Okay that was easy, but how was i supposed to find that?"" Thus the gameplay isn't the major selling point. However I can recomend the game because the setting is well designed. I liked travelling across the planet and seeing the remains of what was a once thriving planet.They story of how a vivid planet turned desolate is done pretty well. For the most part I feel I got my money's worth , but I can undestand why you may want to get it on sale.			"

												Lifeless Planet is a peculiar game. On one hand it has that endemic lack of tact in the writing that indie games seem to all share and the production values (for the most part) are sorely lacking at times, but I still found myself playing through it and enjoying it. ""Just one more level"" was a frequently thought of phrase while playing the game and the source of it was wanting to have closure on the game's narrative.There's nothing but walking around, platforming and a few simple puzzles (obstacles would be a better description of the puzzles really) and it works for the most part. It is almost woefully simple and linear but the story and a few of the enviroments, though plain, makes Lifeless Planet an oddly engrossing and pretty game. I was disappointed at the rather weak visual design but it still fulfilled my urge of walking on an alien planet in a videogame; I just wished it was better realized.The music is good but I felt that it tried too hard to be the source of emotion instead of complementing the game, which brings me to a point that nagged me for most of the game. The game, though it tried, didn't really succeed when it tried to be meaningful. Sure there were a few moments that piqued my interest but I felt it was too vague and/or lacked tact when it tried to say something about the situation and the protagonist's motivations. What the story does well enough is that it hooked me into wanting to know more about it, thus pushing me into playing for longer sessions that I wouldn't have otherwise. In another note, the atmosphere was surprisingly good. While I won't call it a horror game, it did an ok job of setting the right amount of tension you'd expect in the same situation. Again, I just wish it was better realized but it still did the job.In the end, I can recommend the game to people that can look over the plainness and low budget of the game but that think it'd be interesting to explore a planet. While I wouldn't pay full price for it (got it during Steam's Summer Adventure 2014 Sale) it's still a solid and interesting enough of a game for that very specific niche of players.			"

												This is such a neat game.  The story is quite gripping, with a mysterious theme.  Every aspect of the world really brings home the 'alone' feeling, which is eerily exciting.  The sounds and music of each area also contribute greatly to the lonely mindset.  The controls are all solid and feel exactly like one would expect them to;  The objectives, while not exactly obvious (not saying this is a bad thing), all feel meaningful and contribute to the story.Overall, this game is worth a buy if you enjoy edge-of-your-seat suspense, massive and seemingly endless vistas, quality story (that you actually have to think about, vs. it all being laid out for you like many games), or all of the above.  I give it 2 lifeless thumbs up!			"

												If you are into adventure/mystery games, like myself, I recommend it to you. You will see beyond the flaws.If you are not, stay away.Pros: - Atmosphere (that's enough for me) - Voice acting - StoryCons: - Poor puzzles - Repetitive textures and objects - Clunky controls (you will die because of it)It is not open world as you would guess from the screenshots, on the contrary it is TOTALLY linear, but this doesn't mean that the game is bad. I'm just warning you.			"

												This gets a tentative recommendation, though in my opinion, this is a $10 game, not a $20 one.  Wait for it to go on sale, then buy it.*Spoiler Free Review*This is firmly an adventure game, and it uses its horror well.  You never have a way to fight back against the dangers of the planet, which works in the game's favor.  I was on edge the whole time, examining my path carefully to avoid dying horribly.  The game does host invisible walls, but with one or two exceptions, I never encountered them, focused on not being killed by the enemies lurking about.  To further play up the horror, you occasionally hallucinate through the game, which left me frequently wondering if what I just saw was real.The mystery of the first half of the game was phenomenal, as was the revelation of the planet's history, but this actually wound up working against the game.  The ending left me unsatisfied, and the twist revealed by the final document was disappointing.  I felt that it verged on pulling the game from Sci-fi to Fantasy, and after all that build up, it was a real let down.As you travel, there are set points where your jetpack fuel will run out (limiting you to just one boost, down from seven), as will your oxygen.  The oxygen is done to show passage of time, as well as to play into the story, and the jetpack fuel is done to present new platforming challenges, but both came off as contrived and pulled me out of the experience each time it happened.The controls work well on keyboard or controller, though a little bit more air maneuverability would have been nice.  Most of the puzzles are just a matter of finding the right object to drop into a hole, and the rest are figuring out a button sequence, but that's fine.  This isn't a puzzle game foremost, this is an exploration game.  The fact that the dev managed to make a linear exploration game not feel linear speaks volumes to his skill.The graphics leave much to be desired, but so long as you're looking at the surroundings, it works fine.  It's when you're looking at a facial expression that it becomes jarring.  Faces here always seem to be either neutral expression or vaguely malevolent, which makes the protagonist's description of what they were supposed to be expressing seem canned and insincere.I didn't get attached to the characters at all, and I can't help but think that had the protagonist's personal story been left out and the player been left to project on the character, the game would have been improved.  Without spoiling anything not already spoiled in the description, the mysterious woman had little personality.  Several scenes were thrown in to make me feel for her, and while one or two did make me feel horrified or confused as intended, I never managed an attachment.The level design is done quite well, though the transitions need a LOT of work.  Frequently a new level would start, I'd turn around and sit there wondering how in the hell I got here.  A few levels also felt that they were put in just to have them.  The fire level, or the hot springs level, for example.  The level in the volcanic area in particular was frustrating, as the game became one of guess and check to figure out which ledges were safe to land on, and which would kill you instantly.  A few times there were even invisible walls mid-air that would do the same.  Fortunately, the death system is done very well, or I likely would have stopped there in frustration.Overall, this is a good game, and it made me stay up far later than I should have to finish it.  A good story until the end, and I look forward to see more of the Dev's work in the future.  However, between the graphics, short run time (I finished it in ~4.5 hours), and lack of replayability, I don't feel it was worth the price of admission.			"

												Lifeless Planet's story is orginal and invigorating. DO NOT WATCH A PLAYTHROUGH if you want to get the full immersion of this game. The graphics need work and the game still has alpha-bugs it also sometimes has flow issues.I would like to see a remake made with more people and maybe add survival and co-op features. I.E finding oxygen repairing the suit. The remake should be polished with good graphics and more sound effects. However, this game is a great first. I would like the remake free to people who already own lifless planet and if new people buy it, they get lifless planet 1 and 2. Finally, I would LOVE A PREQUELAll in all I give this game 3.5 out of 5 stars. It is worth playing and has a great mix of creaps, jumps, and bumps.I look forward to seeing more from these authors			"

The only thing i had problems with (MAYBE SPOILERS) is on the icy terrain i got wedged in between some of the glaciers a couple of times and the only way to resolve it was to reset the checkpoint. That was the only problem i had with the entire game, besides that, I think this is one of the best games I have played all the way through and enjoyed every second of it. Good Job!			"

												Lifeless Planet has a creative storyline. The load speed of the game is amazing, all the while requiring little from the hardware.  The game while enjoyable is not as polished as you would expect for a final release.  I would consider it 'Alpha' quality.  The transition from area to area is often lacking physical continuity.  The music is well done, but needs more variety.   Obstacles and solutions seem placed directly in the player’s path & require little thought, which removes a level of depth from the game.  A frequent example of this is the jet pack charge-once it is depleted you know that all upcoming jumps will be small, removing a level of unknown from the player.  Character development is crucial for the player to become immersed in the reality of this game.  Too much time is spent on the technology development, and too little on Aelita.  You have the opportunity to develop a sense of sympathy for the planet, but very little for Aletia.  It would have been endearing to see the two parallel each other.  There are also small glitches with the PDA and claw.  I hope to see more games in the future from this developer.  On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest rating, I would give it a 3.5.			"

												It's basically an interactive story with a little bit of platforming and puzzles. Well, not so much puzzles as move-the-rock-closer-and-jump-up type moments. The scenery is spectacular and the story is compelling enough to keep you progressing. The platforming aspect is minimal but exciting. As it stands, it takes 4 to 5 hours to complete. I'm not sure I'd replay it unless they added more storyline. It's worth the $20 price but I'm sure it'll go on sale at some point. It would be worth waiting if for no other reason, there might be more content by then.			"

												This game could really go either way in the recommendations department; on one hand, it's an original, indy game that stresses some of the best and possibly most interesting features of an original concept. It's interesting in the same way the ""mystery box"" of horror or suspense is, and offers some interesting thoughts. I'd love to see more support for indy games, but...On the other hand, the game failes to follow through on those interesting thoughts. The platforming and controls are absurdedly weak for a game that relies on it. The movement, jetpacking, and other actions get old really fast, and this is for a game that boasts an achievement for completing the game in less than 4 hours on the first playthough. Half the puzzles are exactly the same as previous puzzles, and the other half feel inane and time-wasting. The protaganist is hardly there; rather than telling a story about his wife (as hinted at in the trailer), it becomes the story by lack of any competion, as we learn nothing about her besides her death and his nihlism; he leaves two crewmembers dead without a backward glance, ignoring a story about loss and space (especially in the context of a one-way journey where they likely expected to learn, live, and die together); he ends up following a ridiculously slow genetically altered Russian without ever discovering a way to talk with her and prompt any kind of story. In all, the game could be worthwhile as part of a bundle (Yay Humble Bundle!) but terrible as an individual game. maybe 1.5/5 stars. Watch the videos on YouTube if you want to learn the ""story""; GameKiller346 posted 8 videos that cover the whole thing.			"

												My score: 2/10I should have known what I would think of the game from my first impression - I couldn't get the main menu to work correctly! I could highlight New Game, but was unable to access the Options menu. After playing the game for a little bit, I would go to the menu and was unable to access the ""Save & Quit"" option. I basically had to just wait until I got to a save point and then Ctrl+Alt+Delete to the Task Manager and End Task to quit the game... This was only the beginning.Game Mechanics were a big issue for me, which makes it even more problematic knowing that this is a platformer from start to finish. Timing the jumps is part of the game, but basically missing a jump means dying and dying means restarting, A LOT. But then there are other problems with the game mechanics. There is a part where you have to use geysers to jump from place to place. Although, I was finally able to get through it (simply by luck), I was never able to figure out how the mechanic actually worked to make it happen. Basically, I just kept pushing buttons and after 50 attempts, I'd finally make it. Additional problems are that this was an obvious port from X-Box (still had places to push X or Y buttons), that was badly adapted to a keyboard and mouse. Finally, there were levels that I was able to complete without doing (what I would think are) necessary actibities.  Don't want to spoil the game, but in multiple levels there are these huge machines to turn on to get from one point to another. I went explorting before doing this and managed to reach the end of the level. This is just poor level design. In a game that is all about exploring, I should be able to explore myself out of a level without doing crucial steps.The puzzles were a bit interesting. The problem was that they were generally the same puzzles time after time after time with very little variation between them. This almost seemed like cheating to me. Pick up stone, use it to power a machine. Walk for five minutes, pick up stone, use it to power another machine. Rinse, lather, repeat about 20 times. Opening doors? Find a code from six buttons. Next door? Same 6 buttons but in a different order. Next door? Guess what? Same 6 buttons but in a different order. This same puzzle for about 6-8 doors.The most annoying part of the game was all the pointless dying. There were areas where it is difficult to tell where you could and could not go, but if you went to a area you were not supposed to go to, you died. Restart. One level (without giving too much away) sees the player navigating through volcanic activity. This level took me a good 30-45 minutes to navigate because I could not tell what was going to kill me and what wouldn't kill me. By the time I finally got through it, I was so frustrated, I wanted to delete the game. Another part of the game involves plants killing you by coming out of the ground and there was no telling (other than dying) where some of them would appear from. It got annoying because I was frequently not even close to a clump of plants, but still managed to die by getting spiked. Restart.The story was somewhat interesting. It was the only thing that made me play through the game to the finish. However, it was so anti-climactic that I was disappointed when I finally finished it. Not even the world made want to keep gonig. I did not really find myself once thinking, I wonder what's around that corner, but wondered many times, what is THAT supposed to be? There was one level that (I think) had a glacier or ice on it, but it was so poorly implemented I don't know what it was. The biggest problem with the landscape development was that the rocky outcroppings and ""boundaries"" of the level were supposed to be stone, but looked smooth instead of rough and rock-like. Was it worth $20.00? Not even close. It took me roughly 6 hours to win the game and with all the problems described above, I'm not sure I'd really even pay $5.00 for the game. Maybe $1.99 if I had a free afternoon on a random Satruday. The only reason this did not get a 1/10 is because there weren't any game breaking bugs nor anytime the game crashed to desktop. So at least they got that right.			"

												Lifeless Planet is unfortunately a game thay lived up to its title. Lifeless. Dull. Uninteresting. Which is quite a shame, as it looked very promising all the way up to the second fourth of the story. After that, the puzzles start to feel repetitive, the platforming gets mind numbing, and the story falls on its face. Honestly, the story was the most damning part. Specifically, it tripped on its boring plot twist and landed on its face in an anticlimactic ending that felt unfulfilling. If I can give this game points, the story up until the plot twist/villain reveal was amazing. They knew how to set up everything. Which is exactly why the mediocreness the rest of the game displayed makes this game feel unfulfilling. It created a mysterious and scary atmosphere splendidly. It felt open when it needed to and claustrophobic at the right moments. But then it feels like they tacked on everything afterwards almost like an afterthought. It also doesn't really have any replayability for such a short game. I finished the story in 6 hours! This game wasn't awful, but it was very unsatisfying.			"

												Lifeless Planet certainly sold me on a unique premise.  An American Astronaut lands on a planet 30 light years from earth, only to discover that not only did the Soviet beat them there, but that they've all mysteriously disappeared...And so begins what is probably the best 'Walking Simulator' I've played in the last three years, and all the usual suspects of the genre are here; diary entries, simple puzzles, no enemies, and most importantly, an atmosphere so thick and intoxicating that it just makes the games many flaws all that more tragic.  The majority of the games 'walking' involves linear pathways with simplistic jumping challenges and the occasional 'put the battery in the battery slot' puzzle, while gravity and vegetation serve as the games biggest threats.  It's certainly more involved than the other mascots of the genre, like Gone Home and Dear Ester.The graphics in particular deserve attention.  Specifically, they're terrible.  Even while playing on the highest graphical settings it felt like I was playing a game from the middle of the PS2 era.  Hope you like your worlds full of terrain morphing, because that's what you're getting, texture stretching on cliffs and all.  This plain geology is broken up with some simple rock models here and there, but it's no where near enough to fix how bland some environments feel.  The man-made structures are a mixed bag.  The simple utilitarian houses are well modelled and fit the theme well, while the larger structures are blocky and kind of silly looking.  The character models are also horrendous, and have such a cheap, low quality appearance.The games plot is also a bit of a mixed bag.  Earlier parts of the game sprinkle bits of character back-story on you, before deciding the to leave that arc alone until the end game.  In fact, so many plot points occur in the opening segments of the game that a lot of the middle section simply feels like filler.  On the other hand, this 'quiet' gives the game, and the player, a chance to take in the scenery, and with a full play through lasting three and a half hours, it's not that big a deal.Even with the visual and story pacing issues, I found Lifeless Planet to be a generally pleasurable experience.  It's aura of mystery and discovery kept me interested enough to see it to the end.  That said, it's a bit steep at $20, so you're better off waiting for a sale or bundle deal.			"

												Even though the character design and some the graphics aren't the most amazing looking, this game will greatly impress you if you are a fan of Sci-Fi.  The story feels like something out of Golden Era sci-fi and has some interesting Alternate History (maybe?) ideas it plays with.  The landscapes are also very simple but very beautiful, where it can sometimes get distracting moving from objective to objective.  The gameplay however is where the game does falter, with controls similar to old-school Tomb Raider where it feels like you are moving a tank.  If you do get stuck however the checkpoint system is a good way to restart, and get unstuck.  Its a good afternoon game to play through and plays comfortably on a controller.  I wouldn't mind seeing a prequel or sequal, but the story does a good job of wrapping itself up while still allowing you to wonder on the few strings left untied.			"

												A nice atmospheric story-rich simple game. It's not much game-play wise: you switch by just wandering around, balancing on tall structures, and jumping through rocks and platforms. There are a few very simple puzzles. The jumping part is fun, accompanied by low gravity.The atmosphere is spot on. Nice dark ambient soundtrack and visuals are unique, and good looking, although there could be more detail in certain more monotonic geographical areas of the game. The story is very good, rich in mystery and even emotion. In addition to the story there are some collectibles, which surprised me as they were accompanied by some intelligent information. The game world is divided into many short levels, all of which are very varied and some are absolutely astonishing in terms of atmosphere and visuals.The game is short and can be finished in five hours, unless you (like me) get drawn in by the atmosphere and want to explore every corner. Suggested to people who like post apocalyptic atmosphere and mystery.			"

												What started as an interesting story and challenging physics platformer, ended in cliche' sci-fi and aggrivating controls. The story progressed hastily and haphazardly, culminating in random information being thrown in at the last minute. All of it given great importance in an attempt attempt to explain the strange turns the story would take.The controls can be very unreliable.  Moments requiring precision are completed more with luck rather than skill, the camera does everything it can to fight you, resulting in alternative paths(even neccessary paths) blocked, hidden, or difficult to get to.  The player can turn on a dime or require huge turning arcs.  Either happening at any moment, but usually not when you really need it.  Turning left on a rock can find your character swerving off the edge, where turning right can see you spinning in place.  Landing on the same rock in a slightly different position, can yield different results.The saving system is unreliable at best.  Several times I would return to the game to find my character standing somewhere he had been ages ago, and having to plow through areas I had already completed just to progress the story(even having seen the game save my progress up to the point I remember).  Though, there were also several moments where the game would lead to a dead end, which was actually the end of the level.  The screen would fade to black and return with you standing in a completely different and unrelated area.  Also, the camera is notorious for loading with you pointing or facing in the wrong direction.  One zone you can load with your character facing the right way but not the camera, the next, the camera is facing the right way but not your character.  When loading new areas that don't start at a wall similar to one the last zone ended with, you can find yourself exploring the ""dead end"" of a level's starting area.  Forcing you to turn around and trudge back up the way you came in order to advance.Eventually I found myself towards the end of the game, pushing forward simply with the belief that I was almost done.  Thankfuly the strange turns happened in quick succesion and I found myself looking at the portal home.  I find myself disappointed at how the game and story turned out, and ashamed that my own stubborness drove me to finish it.  But, I'm glad its finally over and I can retire this title to the graveyard never to be touched again.			"

												This game could really go either way in the recommendations department; on one hand, it's an original, indy game that stresses some of the best and possibly most interesting features of an original concept. It's interesting in the same way the ""mystery box"" of horror or suspense is, and offers some interesting thoughts. I'd love to see more support for indy games, but...On the other hand, the game failes to follow through on those interesting thoughts. The platforming and controls are absurdedly weak for a game that relies on it. The movement, jetpacking, and other actions get old really fast, and this is for a game that boasts an achievement for completing the game in less than 4 hours on the first playthough. Half the puzzles are exactly the same as previous puzzles, and the other half feel inane and time-wasting. The protaganist is hardly there; rather than telling a story about his wife (as hinted at in the trailer), it becomes the story by lack of any competion, as we learn nothing about her besides her death and his nihlism; he leaves two crewmembers dead without a backward glance, ignoring a story about loss and space (especially in the context of a one-way journey where they likely expected to learn, live, and die together); he ends up following a ridiculously slow genetically altered Russian without ever discovering a way to talk with her and prompt any kind of story. In all, the game could be worthwhile as part of a bundle (Yay Humble Bundle!) but terrible as an individual game. maybe 1.5/5 stars. Watch the videos on YouTube if you want to learn the ""story""; GameKiller346 posted 8 videos that cover the whole thing.			"

												My score: 2/10I should have known what I would think of the game from my first impression - I couldn't get the main menu to work correctly! I could highlight New Game, but was unable to access the Options menu. After playing the game for a little bit, I would go to the menu and was unable to access the ""Save & Quit"" option. I basically had to just wait until I got to a save point and then Ctrl+Alt+Delete to the Task Manager and End Task to quit the game... This was only the beginning.Game Mechanics were a big issue for me, which makes it even more problematic knowing that this is a platformer from start to finish. Timing the jumps is part of the game, but basically missing a jump means dying and dying means restarting, A LOT. But then there are other problems with the game mechanics. There is a part where you have to use geysers to jump from place to place. Although, I was finally able to get through it (simply by luck), I was never able to figure out how the mechanic actually worked to make it happen. Basically, I just kept pushing buttons and after 50 attempts, I'd finally make it. Additional problems are that this was an obvious port from X-Box (still had places to push X or Y buttons), that was badly adapted to a keyboard and mouse. Finally, there were levels that I was able to complete without doing (what I would think are) necessary actibities.  Don't want to spoil the game, but in multiple levels there are these huge machines to turn on to get from one point to another. I went explorting before doing this and managed to reach the end of the level. This is just poor level design. In a game that is all about exploring, I should be able to explore myself out of a level without doing crucial steps.The puzzles were a bit interesting. The problem was that they were generally the same puzzles time after time after time with very little variation between them. This almost seemed like cheating to me. Pick up stone, use it to power a machine. Walk for five minutes, pick up stone, use it to power another machine. Rinse, lather, repeat about 20 times. Opening doors? Find a code from six buttons. Next door? Same 6 buttons but in a different order. Next door? Guess what? Same 6 buttons but in a different order. This same puzzle for about 6-8 doors.The most annoying part of the game was all the pointless dying. There were areas where it is difficult to tell where you could and could not go, but if you went to a area you were not supposed to go to, you died. Restart. One level (without giving too much away) sees the player navigating through volcanic activity. This level took me a good 30-45 minutes to navigate because I could not tell what was going to kill me and what wouldn't kill me. By the time I finally got through it, I was so frustrated, I wanted to delete the game. Another part of the game involves plants killing you by coming out of the ground and there was no telling (other than dying) where some of them would appear from. It got annoying because I was frequently not even close to a clump of plants, but still managed to die by getting spiked. Restart.The story was somewhat interesting. It was the only thing that made me play through the game to the finish. However, it was so anti-climactic that I was disappointed when I finally finished it. Not even the world made want to keep gonig. I did not really find myself once thinking, I wonder what's around that corner, but wondered many times, what is THAT supposed to be? There was one level that (I think) had a glacier or ice on it, but it was so poorly implemented I don't know what it was. The biggest problem with the landscape development was that the rocky outcroppings and ""boundaries"" of the level were supposed to be stone, but looked smooth instead of rough and rock-like. Was it worth $20.00? Not even close. It took me roughly 6 hours to win the game and with all the problems described above, I'm not sure I'd really even pay $5.00 for the game. Maybe $1.99 if I had a free afternoon on a random Satruday. The only reason this did not get a 1/10 is because there weren't any game breaking bugs nor anytime the game crashed to desktop. So at least they got that right.			"

												This game isn't a challenge, the mechanics aren't good, the puzzles are too easy, basically you just follow the greentrail till the end of the game. You get no sensation of danger and the creatures that try to kill you are too easy to avoid.The only good thing about this game is that it is really relaxing comparing to FPS, so i recommend it if you want something easy to play with a singleplayer experienceBut in the end still a good game, if you buy it with a discount.

And yes, later on i realized, that playing this game is more like reading a book. It may not suite everyone, the movememt is slow, interactivity of environment is almost at point zero, but even all negative points about this work i can only tell i want more pieces like this. Rather than game, i would categorize this as interactive book. So if you expect some full action jumping, shooting. hands off. If you like to read books and are willing to try a different way how to read one, then this piece is for you :-)			"

												You should get this at least for the audio-visual experience, reminded me of the movie Interstellar in so many ways.. Apart from the poor graphics, level design, buggy terrain and barren enviroment which may or may not be meant to be that way (I mean the game is called Lifeless planet and it's about an astronaut trying to get back home from this forsaken place, but the maps are still too big and a lot of the time is spent just running seemingly endless distances between two points), the story was quite catchy and emotional which brought you to actually feel for the main character and his cause, but what really set this game apart was the awesome soundtrack that brought life and much needed atmosphere to the wasteland and game itself.

												Lifeless Planet certainly sold me on a unique premise.  An American Astronaut lands on a planet 30 light years from earth, only to discover that not only did the Soviet beat them there, but that they've all mysteriously disappeared...And so begins what is probably the best 'Walking Simulator' I've played in the last three years, and all the usual suspects of the genre are here; diary entries, simple puzzles, no enemies, and most importantly, an atmosphere so thick and intoxicating that it just makes the games many flaws all that more tragic.  The majority of the games 'walking' involves linear pathways with simplistic jumping challenges and the occasional 'put the battery in the battery slot' puzzle, while gravity and vegetation serve as the games biggest threats.  It's certainly more involved than the other mascots of the genre, like Gone Home and Dear Ester.The graphics in particular deserve attention.  Specifically, they're terrible.  Even while playing on the highest graphical settings it felt like I was playing a game from the middle of the PS2 era.  Hope you like your worlds full of terrain morphing, because that's what you're getting, texture stretching on cliffs and all.  This plain geology is broken up with some simple rock models here and there, but it's no where near enough to fix how bland some environments feel.  The man-made structures are a mixed bag.  The simple utilitarian houses are well modelled and fit the theme well, while the larger structures are blocky and kind of silly looking.  The character models are also horrendous, and have such a cheap, low quality appearance.The games plot is also a bit of a mixed bag.  Earlier parts of the game sprinkle bits of character back-story on you, before deciding the to leave that arc alone until the end game.  In fact, so many plot points occur in the opening segments of the game that a lot of the middle section simply feels like filler.  On the other hand, this 'quiet' gives the game, and the player, a chance to take in the scenery, and with a full play through lasting three and a half hours, it's not that big a deal.Even with the visual and story pacing issues, I found Lifeless Planet to be a generally pleasurable experience.  It's aura of mystery and discovery kept me interested enough to see it to the end.  That said, it's a bit steep at $20, so you're better off waiting for a sale or bundle deal.			"

												I'll be honest, it's not Game of the year potential but it is a nice platforming puzzle explorer. I didn't know the references in the story so it was largely new and quite interesting to me. The gameplay is consistent but not exactly great, turn rate in fine tuned platforming is kinda awkward but it does very well for it's jetpacking and puzzling elements. I also appreciated a new gadget that while not exactly original was well implemented. It's only about 2-3 hours long as well.Overall I'd say it's not really worth $20 but 10-15 is quite reasonable for my enjoyment. I liked the scifi story and the way it was built into the world. I liked the collectibles and the linear but not guided nature of the world. (There's usually only really one way to progress but it doesn't have a bigass arrow or a minimap pointing it out) The gameplay was good but not great in my opinion, although it seemed consistent and realistic. I think it's a little small but I'm under the impression it was one developer so for one person this is an awesome amount of material and story to put out and I was quite impressed. It won't revolutionize gaming and to be honest there are better indie games for less but this one is certainly a fine game that could be played on a day off. I'd probably give it a high 6 to 7/10 (my grading scale may be different from others, this is certainly passing respectably. 5/10 is my fail point personally.)			"

												I was a little iffy about buying this game at first. I wasn't sure whether it would be worth the money or not. I read a couple really good reviews though, and the game was on sale, so I took it. Gotta say, it was a really good impulse buy. Very worth it.The game's atmosphere felt really mysterious, sometimes even a little creepy, and the planet was absolutely gorgeous (even being lifeless as it is). The game's more challenging sections were well spaced apart and even the ""more challenging sections"" as I am describing them, are not TOO challenging. You're never overwhelmed with super challenging obstacles or puzzles, but sometimes the game does make you think quite a bit.Now, every now and then you might find yourself wandering in circles, unsure of how to progress, but don't give up! The game is actually not that hard, and you just have to walk around for a bit and find out what you're supposed to do. And believe me, once you find out what to do, you may or may not smack yourself in the face and say ""how did I not realize that I was supposed to do that?"" or ""that was there the whole time?!""As far as dying in the game: yes, you can. I won't say how, but you can die, yes. So be prepared for a lot of parts where you're trying to avoid dying by... whatever it is that can kill you (no spoilers :3 except fall damage. I will say you can die by falling. It's also in this game's achievement list to do just that, so...).Overall, this game was absolutely fantastic. I don't know if I would buy it for $19.99 because really it's only roughly 3-5 hours of gameplay average (I beat it in just under 4 hours, even with getting stuck at a few parts and wandering around for minutes trying to find out what to do to progress) and is really only good for one playthrough I think, but I got it on sale for $9.99 and I think that was a good price for it. I say it's only good for one playthrough because once you know what's going on, you've read the documents along the way, and you finish the game, that's kinda just it. There's not too much reason to play it again, unless you want to search every inch of the game for all the hidden science-y samples you can collect, if that's your thing. I guess if you miss out on the Rocketeer achievement you may want to play again without reading the documents so you can beat the game faster (you have to beat it in under 4 hours to get that achievement) but other than just getting the achievements for sh*ts and giggles, I think one playthrough is enough to satisfy your needs.However, don't think that you shouldn't get the game just for that reason. That one playthrough, for me, was a true adventure, and one of the most fun experiences I've ever had with gaming. I haven't played a game like this one in forever, and I really really enjoyed every step of my journey, which truly felt like an immersive journey. That's really all I have to say about this game. Basic rundown: The planet was absolutely gorgeous, I loved the scenery, the challenges aren't TOO challenging, you may get lost but don't give up, and the backstory was very interesting (READ THE DOCUMENTS! DON'T YOU DARE SKIP OVER THEM! I WILL FIND YOU AND MOO IN YOUR FACE VERY OBNOXIOUSLY IF YOU DO!)Overall: 10/10 stars. Just yes. I really had a lot of fun on my journey. I recorded a video for YouTube and will add the link to my review soon, but I have to edit and upload it still, so my playthrough isn't up there just yet, but it will be, once I get around to it.

The storyline is interesting, the puzzles aren't hard but they're diverting, and it's just plain fun to jetpack around. There's a certain amount of discovery, not much but enough, there's also some collectables and achievements.Anyway, this game is worth a look even if only to cleanse the palate of all your regular gorey games, but I'd probably wait on a sale for this one.

Every time more story came, I couldn't wait for more. The story to this goes in depth, and at some points in the game it made me very annoyed (because some parts are really challenging), but despite the challenging part, I trucked through it and continued wanting more and would play for hours at a time. The first time I played this game, I played it for 4-5hrs straight. That's how interested I was. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who is into story driven, and adventuring games.

												This game is fairly short ... I finished it in 6 hours, but I felt I got my money's worth and then some.  As a puzzle/platformer game it is engaging and fun. None of the puzzles or platformer jumps were frustrating. Some were obvious, and others took a few tries.  The controls were solid. I never felt like I died or screwed up a jump because of the game itself ... I was always able to retry and get the timing right.  It was a good balance that made it fun and relaxing to play. Never frustrating, not too challenging, but just challenging enough.The game design is quite good at nudging you along the correct path, but still giving the sense that you're ""exploring"" a vast world. You're  probably not going to get stuck in a section trying to figure out what to do next.  I felt more like I was part of an interactive piece of art, and actively making the story unfold.Overall I'm quite happy with this game. It was six hours well spent, and I'd like to give it a second play-through later.			"

												After playing the game for longer i have come to realize this is quite an astonishing game. It's extremely surreal and sends chills down my spine.It's scary because the story sounds like it could actually have been a real thing. There is a lot of truth behind the fiction this game beholds.The male voice actor used for this game could not have been chosen better. The way he speaks sounds very authentic to the setting around him.If you are expecting a game with enemies, action, guns etc, this is not that game. It's more of an interactive storyteller. The only con in my mind is the retail pricetag. I don't think i could honestly reccomend such a simplistic game for such a high price.			"

												Lifeless Planet is a fun, enjoyable and beautiful game with simple gameplay mechanics. The selling point of this game is the world itself in which you get to explore. Story wise is pretty interesting as you'll get sucked into finding out what exactly happened on this supposedly new earth. Despite the exploration tag, it is pretty linear in a way in terms of exploration. It is also a short game so you could probably finish the game in one seating. Overall, I'll recommend this game to anyone who enjoys mystery, exploration, story driven game.			"

												Looking for an atmospheric indie space walking simulator in third person, platform and moderate puzzle solving game? Guess you found your game, although in contrary to what the title says... there's a lot of life for a so-called lifeless planet. Do I recommend this game? Yes, but not at full price. Wait for a sale and you'll have your money's worth. You're presented with a great storyline that's intriguing, while being accompanied by great haunting music, even somewhat Jean Michel Jarre like on some moments...  which undeniably adds to the feeling of exploring unknown dimensions, but it could be more imho... No complaints whatsoever about the excellent voicing. No place like home they say, but I still enjoyed this one so... 8/10			"

												I cannot recommend this game if, like me, you are playing on a PC with a left-handed mouse, and tend to remap key bindings from WSAD configuration to something else. The game DOES support using the cursor keys to control your character, but DOES NOT support remapping any of the other keys. The need to combine the space key for jumping with camera control by left-handed mouse and cursor keys for movement is so awkward that this game becomes unplayable, considering that it requires very precise jumping.Too bad, because I was really interested in experiencing this game's story.I really do not understand why developers are willing to spend so much time on developing a game and then do not allow key remapping, which is quite easy to implement. Effectively, they are shutting out about 10% of their player base.			"

It was atmospheric and thoughtful, and while the emptiness of it really added to the feeling,  I'd still like to see more to it.  Get it on sale and you won't be disappointed.  It's not a puzzle game, just a few minor things, it's more about the atmosphere and the back story.   It does some things very well and captures a mood that few games can capture.  Something lost and empty; a mysterious dreamlike quality...  tons of potential for this kind of game.  David Board deserves some recognition for creating something quite beautiful.  Overall, a thoughful, enjoyable experience.   "

												There is a Myst-like quality to Lifeless Planet. I mean this in the most flattering way. The game offers very little in terms of challenge, and it can get quite repetitive, but as interactive storytelling it works quite well. It helps that some of the alien landscapes on the Premier Edition, like the volcanic Inferno level, are truly breathtaking at first glance (hence the Myst comparison). If anything threw me off it was the character models, which look as if they could've used a little more design or better texturing. But considering this is mostly the work of one guy, David Board, I am willing to be lenient. Bottom line: Lifeless Planet is a nice short trip that may or may not stick with you, but either way you'll be glad you decided to take it.			"

												Before I say anything, consider this: the game was basically built by one guy. That’s a tremendous amount of work considering, that it’s a 6-hour game. GameplayIt’s a very-very-VERY simple game, more like a simulator where you control this little man in a space suit. He moves around and jumps, on occasions interacts with simple objects and that’s about it. It doesn’t have much of a character. He does comment on his surroundings at times and reads some documents that he finds but it’s nothing close to a fully developed character to have a bond with.The game itself is noticeably uneven, being exciting and tight in the beginning and getting more and more stretched out, unoriginal as you progress. About half-way through the game I started to feel impatience when again I saw some long distances that had to be covered just for the sake of extending playtime. The last chapters felt plain empty to say the least. I also felt that so-familiar irritation that bug games like Alice: Madness Returns – you know the time when you have to jump from one ledge to another but the normal jump is too short whereas the double jump leaps you way over it and into the abyss below. Be ready to swallow a decent amount of this.Other than that it’s working, doesn’t crash and if taken as it is – a simple game, then you won’t be disappointed.DesignThe game felt like Kairo. It could have been named ‘Kairo 2’ or ‘Before Kairo’ or something. This means that the environment felt very artificial and made of elements that don’t blend so well with each other. Now, that might be a good thing. This way you can create a game that feels abstract and Lifeless Planet, despite of it’s realistic setting de jure, felt abstract. The elements felt unnatural and out of place, think of it as Dadaism or postmodernism in art. In Lifeless Planet this conflict felt deliberate.  Everybody knows what a lifeless planet looks like, right? It’s a barren wasteland of sand and craters. The game starts out with the common idea of such a planet but how long can you show this before the player tires? No long. So, in every new chapter the design does get a little more daring, yes still trying to hold on to a sane image of a wasted planet and it was curious and funny to observe how the designer gave in to more and more of absurdities until it became a complete fantastical vista. This makes you give credit to games like Borderlands and Rage, which managed to hold it together.If you happen to have played with Unity’s terrain creator then you will get some flashbacks from the kitchen side of game development. I never noticed that in a game before and can’t say that I liked it. It felt like seeing the first clumsy experiments of a digital painter who tries out Photoshop’s default brushes.VerdictAfter all the whining and complaining I still recommend the game. Why? Because it felt chill and because then you know what one person with little help is able to create. Most of all I disliked the running around but everything else I’m ready to accept. I have far deeper issues with games from bigger companies.			"

												I just finish the game and i feel like amaze,in awe or something similiar to that, if you looking for a detail review about the game itself, you can't find it here, you can always look at someone else review, i sure they do better job then me, i going to talk about the suble message and lesson they given us through the game and honestly i don't know they intently do that or not but i don't care, it still send a massive message to me and probably to other people that feel the sameI recommend this for people who don't mind walking for a long time, weird transition and other thing being said in other reviewSPOILER ALERT ( i be skipping a few space so no spoiler can be seen)the message for the game is the consequences of taking shortcut in life In the game, you play as a astronaut travelling to a new  dsitant planet supposely filled with flora and fauna including, instead he found a barren place fill with sign of russia civilization appearing at the places,later on you discover that the russia discover a teleportation device powerful enough to send large amount of people,supply and equipment to the distant planet you are in right now and discover many alien technology and instead of creating they own power source,they use the alien tech instead of i don't know some light or water type of power source we discover there but no let us use some alien tech we have no idea side affect instead ( which help the colonist a lot honestly but they didn't make they own power source you know).They dependent of the alien tech and teleporter for easier life style have finally bite them in the butt when the planet is dying and the life form there started becoming hostile to the colonist ( this is due the fact the colonist bring they dieses and sickness to the world,this is kind like the spanish small pox when the spanish arrival america during the aztec empire, can't blame the life form there to be♥♥♥♥♥♥at the colonist and kill them) They lack of tech and knowledge have make them very desperate enough that they willing to turn a woman into a some kind of half plant and half human with the intention to use her to save the dying world. ( which she did but it happen after every single russian colonist have killed by the lifeform there which i presume took a lot of time to kill them all). Honestly i feel sad for those colonist because they didn't expect such thing would happen to them but honestly speaking they deserve it in a way, they have shortcut and they use it to the fullest. they don't deserve to be on that planet,they didn't take a leap for mankind or a small step for man, they just stand there and have silver platter giving to them,the director for the colonist understand this concept and even he know that they don't deserve hereIn the end, the colonist mission are doom to failed due to they took too many shortcut and rely on the alien tech for everything they do compare to the astronaut crew who came to the world using they own tech, sure nearly all the crew is dead but at least they prove that they have the tech and knowledge needed to get to this planet meaning they at least earn it through they own tech with blood,sweat and tear while the colonist just use the alien tech to get to the world without any effort giving, sure they work hard to build every building, equipment and other stuff in the planet but they still use the alien tech to fasten they arrival there including using the alien power source as they own powerwell that the end of my story, to everyone that read this till the end, thank you for reading this and have a nice day			"

												Overall, I thought this was a pretty good game.  You play an astronaut exploring a planet, but it's pretty linear -- for the most part, you're following a relatively fixed path and having to solve a few puzzles along the way to progress.  The story is kind of interesting, but there didn't seem to be a whole lot of it; there's enough to keep things moving, but it's told in small pieces with longer stretches of silence (well, environmental sounds) in between.  It took me around 9-10 hours to get through the game, looking up some info/hints when I got stuck in a few places, and generally not too difficult.  But around the middle of the game, one sequence of ~7 jumps in a row had me stuck for a long time (easily 30+ minutes of play time).  I knew what to do, but had a lot of trouble actually doing it and that really annoyed me.  That could just be me and my game-playing skills, but that part really disrupted my enjoyment of the game.  I eventually got past it and finished the game, but it just wasn't quite the same after that point.  I was a little disappointed to find out that I had missed some things along the way (I still hadn't earned some achievements), and you only get a single save point that's automatically determined by the game as you go, so I'd have to start all over again from the beginning again if I wanted to look for what I missed.  Yes, there's some replay value here, but having seen the story and everything once already, I'm not sure I'd enjoy it as much when I'd really just be looking to find some missing pieces / get some achievements.  Also note that once you finish the game, it's impossible to ""resume game"" from the main menu; it just crashes.  I was hoping to go back and see the ending bit again, but I'd have to play the whole game again now to do so.  :(  So as I said at the start, I think this game is good overall, and would recommend it if it sounds interesting to you or you generally like games of this type.

												    Lifeless Planet is anything but lifeless, from the first moments of isolation to final moments of realization ""Lifeless Planet"" keeps you hooked. My favorite detail of Lifeless Planet is how it allows your imagination to paint a spectacular picture of what transpired on the desolate world you find yourself on; a small note left amid ruins, a communications tower long quiet, and many more all carefully scattered throughout the world. Fun puzzle gameplay, intriguing story and a suitable environment make this game a winner.TLDR;STORY: 8/10GAMEPLAY: 7/10SOUND/MUSIC: 9/10CONTROLS: 7/10OVERALL: 7.75/10			"

												I bought it probably because there was a discount on it once on Steam and I just kept it in my libary for a while.I was playing it recently. To hell with those outdated graphics, but the game is not even optimized properly. I played it on my laptop whch runs Far Cry 3 with at least 30 FPS. But somehow my laptop was struggling with Lifeless Planet and the framerate was sometimes dropping below 20. You can choose the graphics quality from ""Fastest"" to ""Fantastic"", but there was no significant difference, so I kept it on lowest settings.But what about gameplay? Well, there we go. At the beginning it got me intrigued with the story so I kept playing, but as you go deeper into the game it turns out to be a platformer with poor (or lazy?) level design. And the plot turns into some kind of low budget sci-fi that you don't even have to bother about, because to most of it you have to read from the notes found around.Also the controls are not sharp, therefore there are some platforming you will repeat over and over due to that issue until you get it right. Otherwise it's just walking through a tunneled and long paths that are just boring. That's also because the character you control is slow and runs like he♥♥♥♥♥♥himself in his spacesuit.There are puzzles too, but they're not very challenging and won't take you longer than couple minutes to figure out and are usually repetetive, so all you'll have to focus on is to where to find the objects needed to solve the riddle.I guess somebody was too ambitious with making an indie game. It is a very mediocre independent game, but if you take note of the price, it is actually quite poor.3/10			"

								I had this pleasure of playing this at PAX 2012 with the creator and it has not failed to capture my attention again. Don't let the deceptively austere environment fool you - there is a high amount of detail and the atmosphere helps build the mysteriousness of the story. As for audio, music is sparse - in a good way. The tracks build slowly and help illuminate the progress you've made. I really enjoy exploring open-world environments to find hidden secrets, and this game rewards you with bits and pieces of information relevant to the story. You can die, as I did during a variety of the platforming style puzzles, but thankfully a checkpoint system is in place that doesn't put you too far back from your current position. It's unusual for a game to have no interface on-screen, but it really helps heighten the enjoyment of the overall ambience the game is trying to exude. I love everything about it so far, and am so excited to see what else is in store!			"

												Ok lets start with the end: is it worth the asking price? Considering what other games you could get on Steam for the same price id say definitely not worth the aksing price.What kind of game this is?It is built on the base of a walking simulator, with very good atmosphere added to it and more importantly, a very good story.There is not much else i could add, basically the gameplay treats you, the player, as a mouse in a maze, thats all there is to it, just find the right way in the maze to get your mouse food...namely advance the story, which its quite interesting, so the reward for your mouse-in-the-maze endeavour is quite good, no complaints there.Wont take you more than 7-8 hrs to finish the game, and the gameplay is basically find your way through a maze...sounds bad...but it isnt, because this game is more than the sum of its parts.The saving grace is a very good idea for the story and a very good atmosphere.A memorable little game that i recommend with all my heart, but definitely NOT for the full price, i wish the developer came to his senses and priced his game in accordance to other steam games, which will allow more players to enjoy it.

And walking got old. I mean, you can skip and jump, use a jetpack and then an extended jetpack, later even play with a robot arm, but in the end it's just not that entertaining. The game's physics isn't perfect: you get stuck in places and need to restore to the nearest checkpoint, I mean if you're asking 19,99€ for a game, at least make it work like it should.

You spend most of  your time jumping around and firing your jetpack.  I found that to be quite fun.  The death animations are pretty funny with the ragdoll like death rolls.			"

												Lifeless Planet is a 3rd person adventure game about an American astronaut who crash-lands on a mysterious planet and discovers the ruins of a Soviet settlement.The biggest thing you need to know about this game is there is so much walking.  Your feet may hurt by the time you're done playing.  This game is 70% walking, 15% story, and 15% puzzle.That being said, the story is pretty good.  The pacing seems off because plot developments are bookended by miles of walking.  Honestly, the story may have worked better as a novel, but perhaps that's due to the literary influence on this game.			"

												Lifeless Planet is a tale about loneliness. The game brings out one of our most important feelings - auto-survival - and makes us think about the limits of our human-hood, the end give us a sense of mystery which complete this tale. Alongside an awesome soundtrack, the voice actions and the dialogues - even in Russian - are pretty good and make this  a game that worth to be played.But there are some bad points that need to be highlighted. First, the game is small, something like 4-5 hours is enough to beat the history. The're are some problems also with the controllers and the way that the puzzles are designed. Those are problems but nothing that can block you to enter in this world and experiment this journey through this lifeless planet.			"

Starting the game, you are riveted to the actions of everything around you, and you want to know the truth about this place that you have landed. But, as the truth comes out - the game loses a lot of its mystery. It is still a stunning puzzle/platformer, and I was able to enjoy my playthrough of this game. Now, onto pros/cons.Pros: Can run on almost any computer, yet still beautifulDecent storylineGood control schemeDecent voice actingWide open world to exploreGood execution and introduction of morals through story driven text itemsRussian women (hehe)Cons:Enemies become very repetitiveToo many similar puzzlesThe story fades in intensity as it progressesClunky animationsStory is shortNow, with everything listed above - I would recommend this game. If it's on sale, its a good way to get through less than 4 hours of gameplay, and still be left thinking about ideas and morals brought up through the progression of the story.			"

												This game is focussed on uncovering pieces of the story at fairly regular intervals and tries not to slow this process down too much with difficult puzzels or frustrating action segments - some may say it's too easy, but I don't think that's the point here. The achievement for completing in under 4 hours would require a player to go through fairly quickly and not take much time to admire the beautiful landscapes portayed throughout - personally I completed in 5 hours with a bit of time spent just looking around.A nice story line, will be interesting to see if a sequel is made - I would certainly fund a kickstarter for that!Thank you for a great game!

												Some things can be done better but I have genuinely enjoyed the whole game as an exploratory experience. The game generates great views of the planet landschafts, which change from chapter to chapter not allowing your get bored. I can agree with other reviewers that puzzles are rather simplistic and not much of a challenge, but that's not the point really. One thing was actually bugging me through the most of the game - rewards for exploration. The game start off with a promise that exploring every corner and small hidden pathways would bring a reward in a form of found samples or artifacts with a small explanation or story behind. This puts you in a mood of explorer initially, but the game subsequently fails to deliver on this promise. After 3rd chapter I believe, I couldn't find a single sample, note or artifact anywhere no matter how hard I was looking around, I was finding perfect places to hide such things with zero result. This really puts you off and exploring becomes a joke. Add to this a completely linear gameplay and you'll understand why there are no many bad reviews. There are invisible walls around areas and in some cases camera would just stop following you so you can not go further. Really? Isn't it so impossible hard to put some ""natural"" walls or cliffs or something that prevent me from going further instead invisible walls that I really hate in games.In any case, this game could be absolutely awesome if there would be more freedom, more exploration, more elaborate storyline, more ""unknown"" (even not related to the main story line, man we are on alien planet!) to explore and study. Something like a soil scanner would cool to have to investigate surrounding areas in search for clues. Nevertheless I really enjoyed this game with all its drawbacks, so thumbs up! Hope the next game from this studio will deliver a deeper experience, lots of promise here!			"

												I didn't think too much of this game at first. It seemed too empty, the jumping was too wooden, and the flashlight was frustrating to use. Yet as the game progressed, it drew me in more and more. By the end, I was loving it. Some wonderful environs to explore and a compelling story. Just stick with it.			"

												Simple game with a lot of exploration to go about, I love the environment, music, and the simplicity of the game.You play as astronaut on a lost unknown planet, you go around collecting data, and solving many puzzles including jumping puzzles, the game is challenging and I wouldn't expect anyone to survive from their first try playing the game, cause it's too easy to make any mistakes, and that what keeps the game challenging and fun.The story is simple and unique providing a lot of real time information and SIC IF induced story line,the game purpose is single player so if you are not familier or get bored alone easy, then i wouldn't recommend playing this on your own.Great work on the game and I'm hoping to see more !

												The game is in the vein of the recent vanishing of ethan carter. Was a kickstarter project and at times it shows on production values. More of a platformer/puzzler than an adventure the game mostly stands on its great art and ost. I am not a fan of platformers myself but it was not challenging at all, the gameplay being a vehicle for the story mostly. It is rather creepy at times and rather sureal most of the time.(helped by the nice art and music). Still i enjoyed it despite being rather short (4-5 hours). I would reccommend it but not at its full price. at 10 or less for certain.  "

Posted: February 15, 2015
												I was looking forward to playing this.  It looked beautiful, and supposedly had a compelling story, complete with mystery and a sci-fi sort of feel to it.  What I got was 8 hours of walking through deserts, and a few notes about how the humans destroyed this planet almost as soon as they arrived.  Gameplay: Walk, run, and occasionally die at the same platform leap every time.  About 5 (very easy) puzzles in the whole game, I don't think I spent even 15 minutes total on puzzles.  Platforming, a few very very VERY tricky jumps but mostly a clear line where there's only one possible path to take, high above everything else so it stands out.  Walk, follow the green track (or footprints), avoid traps that are off to the sides of the footprints.  Walk across dunes. Walk across rocks. Walk up hills.  Walk alongside a canyon.  Walk up to a building. Find a note outside. All the doors are boarded up, so continue walking.Story: *SPOILERS* (well as much as there is anything to spoil anyway)I'm on this planet. My crew is missing. Oh there's an abandoned soviet town. Oh my crew is dead.  Oh the soviets are dead. Oh the planet is dead.  The notes say the Soviets killed everything on the planet because they used the sole energy source for power.  Humans kill everything.  Wait, there's one woman! Follow her.  Walk.Super game breakers:I might have still enjoyed the game except for the jarring limits placed on me.  Oxygen ALWAYS runs out when there's a refill exactly far enough away that I almost pass out right when I reach it.  Oxygen refills last 8 (in game) hours, or overnight and half of the next day.  Jetpack ALWAYS gets a booster right before I have to make a series of long jumps.  The booster will last until I make the last jump in the set, and run out immediately afterward.  The boosted jetpack was lots of fun, two levels made great use of it's superior platforming abilities.    The world looks HUGE until you realize that there's invisible walls preventing you from getting too far off track.  (With the exception of the forest level where I wandered around in mist for a full hour until I rage quit, looked up a walkthrough, STILL couldn't find the way out, and finally found the answer on a forum here on Steam).  Most of the game felt like the creators were pushing me into one path and saying ""Go THAT way! And get there on THIS path! Don't look for shortcuts, we're taking your climbing ability.""The ""Save and Quit"" function is broken. The only way to quit was ALT/F4 or Task Manager -> End Task.  The save might put you back a level when you restart the game.  In-Game options don't work. Overall:Graphics - 9Platforming - 5 (some levels 0, some levels 8)Story - 3Puzzles - 2Submersion - NonexistentGameplay - 4 (A few good sections boosted it)I would not have bought this if any of the descriptions had showed what to expect.

												If you're a fan of the Stalker series or Andrei Tarkovsky's oeuvre you might enjoy this... or you might come away from it feeling like the developer shot for Solaris (1972) and came up Solaris (2002), patching the cracks with a narrative epoxy derived from the bargain bin of Lost (2004) instead of the deeper and more consistent Eastern European science fiction referenced throughout.Early visual teases evoking Pink Floyd's Momentary Lapse of Reason set a misleading supernatural tone that undermines the science fiction bedrock of the narrative.  Key gameplay elements function as foreshadowing - if you see an oxygen drop in the distance you'll learn you have just enough time to beeline for it before you die; when you find jetpack fuel you know it'll run out as soon as you've cleared the jumping puzzle that it portends.  Air and propellant are otherwise infinite, which neatly avoids the tedium of ""survival"" resource management.  Jump cuts between levels are frequently immersion-breaking and serve as reminders that despite a very Open World feel, Lifeless Planet is a linear platformer with few, if any, rewards for exploration beyond the path set by the narrative.Pretty, minimal, and functional, with very low replay value - Lifeless Planet is a short game and a short story.  The brief runtime (or rather, walktime) combined with shallow gameplay and a personal distaste for certain elements of the narrative lead me to not recommend the game at the list price, though I certainly recommend checking it out it when it's on sale.

												The game is a third person platform and puzzle solver. Puzzles don't really challenge the user too much. The platform essentially relies on your ability to fing jet pack boosters. Things that you need are never far from you though and only take a little effort to find. Story line is a little predictable though. Cant help but feel let down a little by it personally as it promises much but fails to deliver. RATE 6.5/10			"

												I started out loving this game, about half way through it turned to strong like, by the end it was an okay game. The idea is great but there are glitches and issues that hinder the playthrough that really really frustrated me. First is the controls: in the main menu I had issues where the highlighted section never moved (made exiting the game a job for end task). Then i had some issues with the jump function. It would be delayed (though the game ran fine). Second was the achievements: one is (as far aas anyone can figure) not unlockable. This is the Planet Historian one. Either there is a glitch where the documents dont appear or just not for PC. Also for some of them you need to do it on your first playthrough. Turns out you can delete saved games and it will count again as ""first"" playthrough. I dont like deleting saved games so that was sucky. However, the plot is interesting and definitely moves the game along well. And even though some might complain about distances you have to walk I thought it was a great way to represent how large and empty the world was. Plus jet pack fun!6/10			"

YouTube™ Video: Lifeless Planet (BETA) Review 

			Views: 632		

			Review of Lifeless Planet for PC. You can find written review at http://www.heavenforgamers.com Lifeless Planet Walkthrough Playlist:...		

Originaly done for http://www.heavenforgamers.com (Nearly Finished).The Early Access build which I’m currently reviewing is now around 3 months old and the game has moved on significantly from what I’ve found. The full version of the game will be noticeably different and should be released on 6th June this year.This game was developed by one man army – David Board, who was based in Alaska in time when I was getting preview code which apparently should make game experiance even more amazing .Game is platform adventure with puzzle elements to solve while levels are unfortunately mostly linear but thankfully to good level design you will have feeling that everything around you is completely open and full of secrets. Apparently game was originally planned to be a action platformer but in my opinion with good decision from David Board this game went to different road where story is in main focus. Game was inspired by LucasArt’s’s The dig and Another World, also by Cold War sci-fi movies posing questions about humankind’s desire for space travel.You are taking roll of USA astronaut, waking up on far and unknown planet with ship wreck around. You are unable to find any of your crew while everything around is completely empty without any living soul except dust, wind and your needs for oxygen.Although with that being said planet isnt completely in sand-brown colour pallet, in fact soon after begining game gives you not so lifeless mountain ranges and flats where you can clearly see designer skills. The interiors of levels are also surprisingly well rendered, which provides some of the creepiest moments through whole thing.Eventually through your journey you will find out that this isnt really completely uninhabitable planet, while you are going to search for your crew you will stamble on abandon city full with old houses, a lot of russian logs where you are going to learn more about events which happened somewhere in time before our protagonist arrived on this planet. Seems like that Russians won space race after all ?Experiments, green footsteps, mechanical arms and systems for activating devices which were suited for slim and much taller beings rather then for people are only one part of discovery which will take your mind on couple different thoughts about who or rather what made this wasteland as it is now.How and when Russians found way to this planet ? How at first place they even brought that amount of people to build whole city or even more ? Hallucinations about empty beds perhaps even a russian girl who appears here and there, are complete mystery to everyone.At current stage of the game you will not find any settings related to controls beside Invert Vertical Look and Auto Center Camera while ingame settings offers and Higher Quality Effects option. Another problem which can be quite frustrating for some people is not being able to strafe properly which kinda limits your observation while you are running in some direction but still it can be done after couple minutes of practicing.Beta and currently available unfinished version is released on March 6th 2014 and includes only first six chapters from 20 expected overall which will provide you around 2 hours of gameplay if you are playing for first time and around 40 minutes of just rushing through the game.Release date is only in couple days from now so be prepared for Lifeless Planet which might not be so Lifeless after all.

												The game Lifeless Planet is one that feels like it has potential, but ultimately falls short.The story seems like it could be fascinating, but unless you take the time to go out of your way to search out every single tape in the game you are left with something that feels fairly generic at best.The game mechanics that are presented seem to work fairly well, but they're all things we've seen a thousand times before (with the possible exception of the robotic arm which was terribly under utilized). They really start to quickly feel samey.There are moments when you need to refill your oxygen tanks or top off your jetpack for some jumping puzzles which I felt were kind of hit-and-miss in their appeal. However, there isn't any kind of gauge or timer for either tank. You only need to bother with oxygen when the creators felt like having you worry about it at seemingly random points in the story. The jetpack also lacks any kind of gauge or limitation on it's longevity. You can try the puzzle and use as many boosts as you feel like all day long. But, no matter how quickly or slowly you solve a challenge, the jetpack's fuel level mysteriously goes low again a short distance away.The game feels like it has so much wasted potential. It's entertaining for a while, but quickly becomes dull and repetitive.If you want to try this game out, by all means do so. Just wait until it's steeply discounted in a sale.			"

												Walk.  Walk some more.  Then walk.  You can only walk one way, the rest is wasting time.  Now jump.  Jump again.  Jump some more.  You can only jump one way, the rest is wasting time.  Follow the obvious path.  Walk.  Avoid the bad path.  Jump.  Jump higher.  Tricky jump.  Save point (yes, nowhere useful).  Press a button.  Wait for a moment.  Walk.  Jump.  Die.Repeat ad naseum.  Pretty.  But too linear.  Easy to control.  But quite boring.  Nicely created landscape.  But you can't explore it.It's okay.  But 1.5 hours in and I'm bored and this is after I've tried to die in interesting ways to see if there was an achievement.  And it's still going.			"

												I love it... Fun atmosphere.. Dont want it to end! cant wait for full release <-- Early access review. After playing the full game, the developers should be ashamed. Its really short on content for  20 dollars, although I must say I loved the story and overall feeling and immersion of the game. The developer should refund the people who bought the early acess because that was exactly the same as the full release and lets face it, I saw no difference. It was great in  the beta, but for a full game release.. 3.5hrs of content just isnt worth it  The Content for the money just wasnt worth it in my opinion when you can get much more content in other games for $20. Story line shouldve went farther then it did as it was short to begin with, leaves a cliff hanger and there is no planned DLC or sequel. I feel like I wasted money. Shameful this game ended up cut short. It had potential and a really good atmosphere feeling when you played it but the developer seemed to just want to release it and make money quickly and cut the game short with minimal content. I would reccomend this if the price came down from its price when reviewed.			"

												I got the Humble Bundle mostly for this, I was disappointed.The beginning was alright, but then the game becomes a long chore of frustratingly easy and repetitive puzzles, bad platforming and some bad level design. Yes, the title has its merits, but there was hardly enough in here to make the game interesting or really stand out. So you end up reluctantly advancing while picking up logs and watching at some other stuff.If I had to put a finger on it, it is kinda like the Max Payne (1) dream sequence dragged out a lot in large parts. without the dizziness(except from the camera) or the horror-elements. Also there are levels that are just too dark and the brighten option hardly seemed to do anything.Tbh it became really boring in the end and I only finished it because I thought I had to.If you don't mind traveling over a countryside that looks in many places like the hills in Battlefield 1942 did, if you like exploring places that only occasionally yield another trifle to look at, if you don't mind kinda horrible platforming and some clunky mechanics and can immerse yourself in this, then get the game. I'd only recommend it like I got it, either in a bundle or in a sale with a huge discount.All in all it really just felt like a chore to me, which is kinda sad, because the initial idea was intriguing and I looked forward to this. In any case, I'll not replay it.			"

												Best walking simulation ever. A brilliant idea and atmosphere failed at execution. Spoilers ahead Immersion: An American astronaut boosts his jetpack with a canister of something left on the planets surface at least on year 1976 without any tool or leaving his suit ?  Feels So RealEnvironment:There are only six types of objects you can interact with; boulders, barrels,  small green boulders which provides electricity for machinery if you "" manage "" to solve puzzles, explosives ( you use them only for three times  ), sort of buttons for machinery and rectangular stone tablets towards the end of the game.  So there is no interaction with environment. Any interaction has sole purpose of moving forward.Survival: There is a problem and it is shortage of oxygen. When you fill your tank it only last for 8 hours. The problem is 8 hours of what ? Game time ? Real time ? But soon you learn it is just a scripted event and you are always safe until pre-set points in the game thus a minimal surviving experience. "

												Only a few hours in but the puzzles aren't complex enough to hold interest and the graphics aren't really good enough to bring the story to life in a cinematic way like a game such as 'Dear Esther' did.  The screen shots look nice but they are a bit of a cheat as you'lll notice that it's mostly soft focus out door scenery. Anything close up such as building interiors looks really, really bad. It's not an unplayable game, it just is NOT worth the amount of money they are asking at the moment. Wait for a sale. "

												Just finished it, and unfortunately I do not recommend it. I bought it influenced by several glowing reviews right after the game was released. Well, all those reviews seem suspect to me right now.Game is way overpriced, it is worth maybe a couple of dollars, and nothing more.Story is pretentious and ultimately uninteresting. It's like a bad episode of The Twilight Zone. Voice acting is pretty bad, at least the English parts.Some mechanics make you scratch your head and just feel rough and unfinished. Like the mechanical arm, which is just a gimmick that adds no value to the game... Extremely linear and very easy, to the point of insulting your intelligence.I feel bad for all backers. This game is pretty rough and underwhelming. "

												This game is bad.  BAD.  It has a nice hook and draws you in so that you are constantly waiting for that one delivery that one story twist that will make it all worth it... and then never gives it to you.  The game starts with nothing and goes on a long walk of pointless minor puzzle solving and stupid multijump platforming to get you nowhere.  Nothing is resolved, nothing is solved, there isn't ever really any conflict or rising action or big question that ever gets answered in any way.  There are many, many disjointed story elements that apparantly have nothing at all to do with anything.The ending isn't bad or good its simply a non-entity that means nothing and does nothing.Here is an ending that does more and resolves more than the one they give you.  Your spaceship crashed and your helmet cracked on a dead lifeless planet and you hallucinate out the rest of the game before dying alone on the wretched planet.  The end.Or if your an optimist the whole game is a cold sleep dream before you arrive at the planet and get to explore it for real!  The end.Take your pick.  Both of those are better than what the game will give you.			"

												It's always both surprising and depressing when a video game uses only a single game mechanic for the entirety of it, and that mechanic is implemented as poorly as possible. I cannot even fathom what others here who claim that this game has no bugs played but it certainly wasn't Lifeless Planet. You see, this game is one of those which wants you to experience the views and vistas while having minimal interaction with anything else. No shooting, no big puzzles. Running and jumping. The story starts out very intruiging and leads to a sub-standard and cliche'd ending. Running and jumping at first seems enjoyable and even quite fun and exciting until you jump from one rock to another for the 1000th time and wish the game would throw something different at you already, or just end. The jumping mechanic itself is done as poorly as possible. Yes it works, but barely. I kept getting stuck on rocks and canyons and the almost non-existent air control after a jump mostly lead to an untimely death. The best thing about Lifeless Planet is the music and the artistic concept of some of the environments. Because even though technically this game is nothing to look up to, it definitely has great atmosphere and you almost always feel alone and helpless on an alien planet. The orchestrated music, as I previously mentioned, is brilliant. I would recommend listening to the soundtrack because along with the atmosphere, it's the only thing holding this game up. Definitely not worth full price and definitely not for those who are looking for a long or special experience. The abundance of graphical glitches and audio bugs (music and sfx would suddenly disappear in many of the levels) hold this title back from becoming a true triumph. Treat the game as a 5-hour experiment from a promising bunch of indie developers and you'll probably find something to like. If you approach it with hopes of experiencing anything above standard (except for the music) it will lead to sour disappointment.			"

												After completing this, I felt really strange.This game had moments when I really wanted to just quit and never get back to it again, but I was curious, and kept on.The level designing's pretty lame, and it feels like the place only has what you need... Like a level of Portal.The story isn't very complicated or anything, it doesn't make much sense, but it sure is interesting!There's not really much else to say without spoiling anything.So if you like exploration and story, this game is sure worth a try. Though there's really not much else to do, and the game can get boring once in a while.This game sure made me thinking, and I may actually play it again someday, but only if I really have enough patience.My rating would be 6.8/10, put in to words: Interesting.

												Lifeless Planet is a walking simulator. Now normally I use that term as a kind of endearing, tongue-in-cheek term for narrative-driven exploration games like Dear Esther, Gone Home, etc. which I enjoy greatly. However Lifeless Planet is much closer to a literal going-for-a-walk simulator. You spend the vast majority of the game trundling along... well, a lifeless planet. The game is drab and brown and and boring looking. There are light platforming sections as well, which are serviceable but nothing really special. The jumping physics feel a bit off but don't get too frustrating. The excessive walking sections might be tolerable if paired with an interesting story (like ""Eidolon"") or beautiful visuals (like ""Mind: Path to Thalamus""), but they're not. The story is mildly intriguing, but never really goes anywhere outside typical sci-fi fare, and journal logs and story tidbits are too few and far between. You spend most of the game chasing after a mysterious woman, even though you don't really know why other than ""there's nowhere else to go"". It just feels kind of aimless. It's a 5ish hour game, but it still feels like it drags on too long. It just wasn't my cup of tea.			"

												Should be called ""Lazy Level Design and Walking Simulator""Basically you walk around, jump onto a platform, walk around some more, listen to a very boring story, walk around, push a boulder underneath a platform, jump onto the boulder, jump onto the platform, walk some more, forget to grab a robot arm that you had no idea existed because the dev assumed you would walk up some stairs to a second floor of a building, get stuck somewhere, be incapable of getting that very important robot arm, some how get back, glitch through the floor, teleport back, walk around, jump, find some woman who can breath on a desert planet with no oxygen, start to run out of oxygen 7.8 hours before you were supposed to, find a coincidentally placed probe with oxygen, find a enemy at last, and realise that this enemy is completely stationary, and is easily avoidable, continue until you find the portal, relieved that the horror is done, find out that the portal is broken, walk more, find some deadly giant dandolions, jump on them, quickly jump onto a dead dandolion, quit, go type an angry review.That was my experience. The graphics are pretty bad, the animations are choppy, its boring, uninteresting, the ""enemys"" are just lazily made and make the same sounds every time they strike out with no pitch change even, and you will lose interest about 35 minutes in. I tried to finish it, I really did. But I just couldn't go on. I could finish it from where I left off in about 30 minytes to an hour. It trys to be a scary game by adding some ""spooky"" sounds and some dark areas where you need a flashlight to see.Edit: I came back to this game, somehow. Just more basic 3D platforming, bad story, and lazy enemies.2/10. Not worth the time, and $20 is just not worth it at all. Even Octodad is a better purchase.			"

												I read other's people reviews, and I'm still wondering if they played the same game that I did.I start the game, and the first thing I notice is the standard-Unity graphics configuration panel where you can pick your graphics details from ""fastest"" to ""fantastic"". Ominous, but to be fair there are nice Unity games out there.After going for ""fantastic"", strong in my hardware configuration, the second thing I notice is that the graphic is *not* fantastic. And oh! The game *lags and stutters* on the very first level.Don't get me wrong: I don't have a Steam-VR ready machine or anything, but I just finished Batman Arkham City, and *that* game (which indeed looked fantastic) ran at full detail in full-HD on my hardware, so the that the barren and (quite bad looking...) planet surface is proving too much for it, is just preposterous (even by Unity standards).The game is basically a platform: go through a level of obstacles (very plain and boring ones, with occasional annoying spikes in difficulty), with the aid of a broken jet-pack that gives only small boosts (which look like small farts ¡­), reach a building, get a clue. Rinse and repeat.Everything else in the game is heavily and (sloppily) scripted.Your character can have a very limited interaction with the world around him, and even that feels horribly clunky: you can push things, but the effect is all but satisfying and all you can do is give small pushes to objects (barrels, rocks, etc), not shove them around continuously. Guess implementing that, code-wise was too difficult :)Around the planet you'll find a number of Soviet recordings: you have an automatic translator, so your PDA will be brought up and you'll be able to read the content. Pity that the voice-over in russian is absolutely distracting, so you have to patiently wait for blabbering to stop, to be able to actually read (and in case it's not clear, I'm not having a go at Russian, as a language, but on the opportunity of having people talk while you try to read…)Occasionally you need to push a button.When you do, it's connected to a moving platform. Wait (for what will seem) an eternity for a it to arrive. Walk on it. Press another button (isn't that fun?!). Travel (painfully slowly) on the platform through a chasm, step down, and it's Farting Mario Bros all over again…Some other time you get some dynamite that you can use to destroy an obstacle. You pick it up, place it near the offending rock and go hide. 3.2.1. ­ Boom! You're dead. Why? Because the game does a rather basic check on the explosion (no ray-casting: maybe just a distance check?) and you where not in the right place, or at the right distance.But tt doesn't matter anyway: you'll just re-spawn nearby: the obstacle is removed and you get to even keep the dynamite that should have supposedly exploded, so you have you cake and you can eat it too!  Isn't that great? :DWater is your own kryptonite: you are walking in a pressurized suit (so you are basically a walking inflatable puppet), still you sink like a rock. [EDIT: as someone in the comments has correctly  pointed out, space suits *do* sink, so this one is on me. Not that it changes the overall judgment much...]The graphic is plain and unassuming, when it's not just bad. The only two NPC in the game, your wife and another woman, are a thing of nightmare.To give an example of how bad the graphic can just be, early in the game, there is a huge vent with a rotating fan. Put some sort of hard garbage while it's spinning and get through it: classic. The vent is just plain horrible to look at, the aforementioned physics is embarrassing and, in the end, even the vent's explosion seem to be ripped directly from a Half Life 1 era game.There are a lot of interesting settings on the planet: a small village, a long big hulking building near a chasm, etc, but you can't actually visit them: you can just look at them, pick some hint that might be laying around, and that's it. Farewell.I dutifully jumped and farted my way through the game, but the mechanics where atrocious, dull and repetitive, the graphics plain, the story not so good that you might feel hard pressed to move on, and the final attempts at introspection and at pulling som ""2001 Space Odissey"" s..t, laughable.I just wanted the game to finish and get over with it, but it kept shoveling at me the same repetitive stuff over, and over. I don't know if I hated more this game for the boring chore it is, or for the wasted potential, of what it could have been.The sound compartment is adequate, though still on the boring side. At some point during one of the lava background noise samples, I heard someone coughing. I don't know if on purpose.This is a horrible game, probably the worst game I played in more than a decade, and I regret every minute I spent on it so don't make the same mistake that I did, and stay clear from it: it's not worth it, even if you get it for free.The promotional text says: ""Equipped with a limited-use jet-pack and a mobile robotic arm, the player must use wits and skill to solve puzzles, unravel the mystery, and survive the Lifeless Planet!"". Please…AWFUL.AWFUL.AWFUL.			"

												This could have been a great game or even the best game of last four years if the original idea (Soviet colony in Earth-like planet, kept secret from the world, USA discovers the planet and sends an expedition team) was developed properly. It could have been a new universe for gaming, even may expanding into RPGs, strategy games, MMOs, fanfiction and comics. Instead of building upon this great idea which allows a variety of paths to take about story-writing, it turns out to be dull and somewhat cliche (human greed ruins everything) plot and it kinda ruined the experience for me as only thing I knew before buying was the original idea.I was actually pretty excited when I first saw the utility poles upon setting foot upon the planet, my excitement doubled then I discovered the colony and in the first hour I deeply felt isolated. But upon seeing how linear and pointless the story and mechanics is my excitement turned into a giant sigh followed by forcing myself to complete the game.Gameplay and UI is pretty clunky, even the Save&Quit button on the main menu was not working for me. This is a walking simulator with some puzzle platformer elements thrown in, but those additions felt more like chores to do for me as most of them were pretty easy and rest of them were just easy.I enjoyed only 1.5 hour of my 6 hours of gameplay time (story ruined by human greed thing, ""wife"" and the game's perception of other life forms, isolation feeling ruined by swiftly attacking roots) so I will give this 2.4/10 which should be pretty fair, as maths is always fair.

												I wished the reviews would've been more objective. Sadly they weren't. That's what I can say after paying 20€ and 7 hours of playtime for my first playthrough. The thing is, you can literally feel what the creator tried to accomplish. He had a story in mind, a great story. But it seems he wasn't able to translate it into the game. So it ended up in being a walking simulator. I expected a melancholic scenery, maybe with a good puzzle here and there, but I was just walking and walking and walking and mostly nothing in between and I was always thinking (and hoping) that something will happen because the last thing that happened was an hour ago. Conclusion, it started good, the last scenarios in the game were good and interesting, but the middle part was just boring. Nothing what I would call a puzzle and a relatively empty world (what was intended, but it's too empty). I almost feel bad writing such a negative review, but it's definitely not worth 20 bucks. And that makes me angry because I know the game could've been so much better. Much much better. Nonetheless, I appreciate what the developer was trying to create. Try it when it's on sale for 5. It's definitely something different.			"

I bought it thinking it would be an engaging exploration story, and instead it was just endless jumping puzzles. I played a couple hours, put it down for two months, then finished it off in another two hour session. While the game had atmosphere and piqued my curiosity, I was bored with the whole thing before it was over and playing just to finish it. What started out as an intriguing puzzle about space, time, and this planet, was quickly eclipsed by boring repetitive game play. It felt like an idea that was stretched out far beyond whatever potential it had, and left thin and wanting.However the game was beautiful, and there were times when I did marvel at the level design and enjoy what I was playing. By the time I was done though, these positives were outweighed by boredom. On the whole, if this is on sale it's worth a buy, but don't expect much. It also has zero replay-ability in my mind.			"

												This is a perfect indie game.When I first noticed this game I knew instantly that I will like it. It was not the graphics but the idea that made me to want to play this game.The game is actually simple. You have to manage to go somewhere on each level. Not an open world game, just go that only way and learn what the story has to offer. A few minigames that makes you wanna just skip them but the story is the arrowhead.To the cons it is that you somewhat have to do certain things only to specific moments like they tell you to do something you do it and then you can not do it again like you forgot how to do it...Anyway the story is really nice and that could be a movie idea...

												I haven't finished the game yet, but I sincerely doubt the ending of the game is going to fix any of its issues. First of all, the premise is actually quite interesting. You crash land on a planet that is supposed to be full of vibrant life and oxygen levels close to Earth's, but instead you get a barren wasteland with no air. Right off the bat, you discover a deserted Russian colony, which should not be possible, as you're the first people landing on this planet after a 15 year journey. As story settings go, this one is pretty damn solid. The only problem is, the characters suck. Straight away, the main character is bombarded with situations both deadly and bizzare and 90% of the time he won't even bat an eyelash. For somebody who saw his crew die violently in front of him, he is pretty damn composed and that screws with immersion so bad! You're supposed to empathise with the guy you're playing, but most of the time I just wonder what the hell is wrong with him. If the game was trying to put all its chips on atmosphere and playing experience, the complete lack of emotion really kills it. The secondary character, who you follow for the entire game, is just as uninteresting, except she speaks in Russian.In terms of gameplay, there are no new or exciting elements in Lifeless Planet. For most of the game, you're just jumping around. I wouldn't really call the obstacles in front of you puzzles, since they are entirely too simple. You just move from spot A to spot B, jump over some cliffs and enjoy the scenery. Skill is not really a factor in this one - if you happen to die to something, you just make a mental note of it and any sense of danger is gone. You also get get a robotic hand at some point, but that fails to inject even the smallest bit of fun. Without a single mechanic to pull you into the game, it gets boring VERY fast. Lifeless Planet is not worth the asking price of $20.			"

												I really wanted to love this game... but be advised if you are looking for a rewarding experience such as Journey look elsewhere.  Granted, there are some cool visuals BUT... too few and far between especially after a tremendous amount of hapless running and jumping.The writing is quite clunky and not paced out well at all.  I'd give it 2 out of 5 stars.			"

												Personal Rating: 8/10An atmospheric game heavily based on exploration, Lifeless Planet felt more like reading a book or watching a film rather than playing a game. The minimal puzzles aid in creating some appropriate confusion for the player while they uncover the secrets of the planet and the astronaut's own story. While some of the controls are a bit on the rusty side and there are some improvements that could be made, the game remains sound.The impressive soundtrack sells some of the primary moments of the game and can leave you either longing to be back home on Earth or wanting to explore. Sometimes the expansive maps can leave you feeling overwhelmed. This can be a good thing for some scenes but also runs the risk of tiring you out just by thinking of all the exploring to be done.Lifeless Planet won't have you solving difficult puzzles or shooting down evil aliens. Rather, it will provide you with a story you can immerse yourself into and experience more than anything else.			"

												A brisk run through clocking in under 4 hours for a first playthough. The game holds up well in the beginning, decent writing and pacing, but as the game stretches on the pieces of engaging story or backstory become much less common. There are very long stretches of platforming with very little to recommend them. The character doesn't respond or move sufficiently to make those segments entertaining in and of themselves. Adding to the general clumsiness of the platforming is the fact that some sections, one in particular, have regions where merely stepping on the wrong area of a platform ends up in instant death and the coloration differences from ""Safe"" to ""Dead"" are so small as to be unnoticable. The intro and beginning are an EXCELLENT use of affordances to have the player move in the right direction and find parts of the story and history of the Lifeless Planet, but these disappear later in the game leaving a frustrating feeling of trial and error in some portions.Overall the platforming and frustration of getting through various stages could be forgiven if the story and engagement of the first hour or so had held up. From about 1/3 in until about the last 15 minutes there's precious little to find or do other than follow a linear path of jumping and occasionally pushing buttons until something happens. For a first shot at a game I think it did better than I would have expected, but the first 1.5 hours or so is undoubtably the best part simply for how the exploration and mystery are handed to the player. The rest is just abyssmal.			"

												Story and setting, interesting. The look, decent. The controls, ehhhh. The price, no chance (8.99 at a stretch).If you want to complete the achievements then you'll have to play through the game at least twice, as there are two sets of opposites (complete in less than four hours, spend over ten; die every way possible, don't die at all). Controls aren't great and tends to be pretty frustrating, especially when many of the puzzles require precision movements. This is the killer for me. I've spent far too long trying to climb as the game demands, and failing, because the movements and the controls just freaking suck. Gonna have to rage-quit here.			"

												This is the best 4-5 hour movie/game I've ever watched/played.  It's mind-boggling how big this game is.  Extremely atmospheric and the atmosphere is one of immensity and desolation.  Long drawn-out jogs through immense landscapes from deserts to hotsprings to lava flows.  On the highest graphical setting in the launcher, this game is beautiful.  Dynamic shadows react to your headlamp and even little details like correct reflections in your character's helmet are fantastic.  I've paid $20 for movies (after popcorn and soda, of course) that were far, far worse.  Definitely worth the money, but not for the impatient or adrenaline-seeking gamers.			"

												Do I recommend this game? Yes, but not at full price.Introduction:I'll get some of the more objective stuff out of the way. The game is a linear platformer with some puzzles thrown in for kicks. The term ""walking simulator"" is a very apt one as that is essentially the core of what you'll be doing in this game. Most of the game involves walking from place to place, discovering message and data pads that slowly reveal what happened to the colony that was previously living on this planet. The only real challenge that comes from this game are the platforming sections where you'll be jumping, frequently with the assistance of a jet pack boost, from rock to rock in an attempt to get to the next location. Puzzles are also a component in this game. They all involve either figuring out how to get a glowing green power core into a monolith or pushing rocks and barrels around to divert liquid or give yourself a higher place from which to jump. There is no combat in this game. The only collectables in the game are the documents which tell you a great deal of the story and samples of rock which allude to volcanic activity on the planet.The Good:1. This game has a really good soundtrack. It is a mix of atmospheric, space ambient, and synth. While the soundtrack is very sparsely played, when it gets going, it has a power to it and I found myself standing, admiring the view while it played.2. There are a ton of beautiful vistas in this game, many of which I took screenshots of an uploaded if you want to see them. While the graphics aren't exactly what I'd call stellar, Stage 2 Studios manage to work with what they have and make an environment that captivates the senses.3. Atmosphere is one of the game's strengths. This planet truly feels dead. From the scorching deserts and abandoned bunkers to the fiery volcanoes and haunted dead forest, it truly does seem like all life is gone from this world.4. The story was quite good. You are an astronaut (I never caught a name if he has one) who has just crash landed on a planet which you were told was filled with life. You quickly discover that the other members of your crew have left the crash site and headed out into the wild. You follow and quickly learn that something happened on this planet to cause all life to vanish. Not all is as it seems. I can't go into anything else without spoiling the story. They story is told through both voice acting and documents you find. The main character gives the bulk of the dialogue, only broken up by a man speaking Russian in the documents and a couple of mysterious voices as your character hallucinates. 5. For me, this game was the perfect length. I beat it in about four hours and feel that if it had gone on much longer, it would have gotten tiresome. The Bad:1. The camera in this game annoyed me. While running, you can't rotate the camera around your character with turning the character and making the camera spaz out.2. Character movement is very clunky. This is particularly noticeable during the platforming sections. You essentially can't turn your character in midair and he slips and slides a lot while running, which caused me to slide off the rocks several times.3. I encountered several bugs while playing though none of them were unfixable. There are multiple times where I fell through the landscape and clipped through terrain to my immediate demise. I encountered a bug during a puzzle during the Ancients chapter where you have to push four stone blocks out of the way so that you can move a semicircle down a little strip to another semicircle. Due to the clunky characters movement, I accidently pushed the semicircle out of the strip so that it was floating in mid-air and I couldn't push it back in. I was able to fix this by quitting out of the game, load back in, and repeat about five minutes of walking.4. The save system in this game could use a little work. In some areas, it works fine. If you die, you won't have to repeat much to get back to where you were. There are several areas though where I had to repeat ten minute chunks repeatedly because the game didn't have any saves close by.5. Exploration in this game frequently doesn't lead to any rewards. There are a lot of giant flat areas with paths that seemingly lead somewhere but ultimately end in a dead end. There is nothing which tells you your objective so often you can be left wandering around until you figure out what to do. I found navigation in the Chasm and Inferno levels to be frustrating because I didn't know which direction in which to head.The Ugly:1. Some of the textures in this game look like they're from the early '90s. I particularly noticed this during the Chasm chapter. Many of the texture are smeared and stretched so that they are just a giant blur.2. The framerate frequently dipped below 60 for me. I have 2 GTX 970s, both of which had no problem running poorly optimized games (as of the time of this review) like Arkham Knight at above 60FPS. I noticed the frame drop most prominently in the chapter called Ancients. According to the frame counter that was introduced in a beta client of Steam, I was getting anywhere from 15-40 frames in that section unless I was looking directly at the sky or ground. This shouldn't be much of a deterrent as there are only a few spots like that in the game. Most of the game ran at or around 60 frames per second.Summary: This game is good little game if not a bit rough around the edges. Most of the negatives can be overlooked and some people may not even have a problem with them. I would definitely buy this when it is on sale, around $10.00. It offers a good little story and some beautiful vistas and some a few interesting platforming sections. "

The story is incredibly week and I soon found that following a set path incredibly boring.

												Terrible checkpointing, which is what killed the game for me.  If you're okay with either repeating boring sequences of game (atmosphere is only really impactful once) or not being able to stop playing when you need to stop playing, then count this as a recommendation instead.  For me, it was bad enough to be a dealbreaker.The atmosphere was good and easily the best part of the game; the voice acting was less than stellar but not bad.  I don't think I got far enough in to actually see any puzzles other than some light platforming.  It all seemed like it was still in tutorial mode at that point so I'd give the simple nature of the platforming a pass.			"

												A solid game with an interesting story and enviroment. Competent gameplay mechanics mix with an eerie atmosphere make this game worth the purchase. There are several bugs here and there and the gameplay and puzzles themselves are a bit one dimensional. If you can I would definitely suggest waiting for a sale to pick this up as the $20 price tag may be a bit steep.Overall I actually quite enjoyed the experience and look forward to future games from this developer.

												While I was initially sucked in by the cool premise, the game far over-stayed its welcome.  There were minimal ways to interact with the world, and the actions you're taking at the beginning of the game are essentially the same as at the end.  Given the distance between narrative beats I frequently just felt that I was playing ""Height-map scalar, the game.""  There is some good stuff here, but it's not enough of it to warrant a full purchase.I will note though that the soundtrack is excellent.			"

I'll put up with a lot of stuff in the name of a weird WTF story, but this was pretty bad.In the Chasm level, I ended up falling through the world four times in the course of an hour.The part that really just made me nope out and refund the game was suddenly, for what appeared to be no reason, the game told me I no longer had multiple jet pack boosts.  It then immediately presented me with a jump that required *perfect* timing of your single jet pack to just barely make a jump.  The jump felt pretty ""pixel perfect"" too, in that I basically spent the next 5 minutes dying to the exact same jump over and over Super Meat Boy style.  An artificial and arbitrary difficulty spike in what up to that point had been a smooth and enjoyable navigational puzzle learning curve just murdered any interest in the whole story and game.			"

												Don't buy this game unless you like throwing money away. I've spent over an hour trying to get out of a crater which is the very first part of the game and you cannot avoid it. The so called jet pack doesn't work and there is NO obvious way out of this damned crater which means the game ends right there. People on the forums have tried to help with advice on what to do and I thank them, they have played the game and gotten out of the crater, but lord knows how. Maybe its just hit and miss with this game. I've reinstalled the game many times now and verified the game cache and still no joy. If you like wandering around and discovering stuff, forget this game and try The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. Now that is a brilliant and pretty game. A waste of £7.50.			"

												The game is very linear, requiring the player to follow a trail of green moss through a ""lifeless planet"".  Since the planet is lifeless, most of what you find are rocks, rocks, and well, rocks.  You will have to push the rocks around, jump from rock to rock, and sometimes you will find yourself trapped inside a rock!Finishing the game with a fair amount of exploration takes about 5 hours.  Around 3.5 of those hours will be spent walking between ""puzzles"", 1 hour will be spent walking back to the puzzle that you didn't quite make the next ledge so you died and went back to a checkpoint, and about 0.5 hours will be spent actually working through the puzzles.  These ""puzzles"" are nearly always just platforming (with one exception near the end of the game).This game has a simple story that advances through the game, but provides the player with a somewhat hopeless ending (if months are weeks and centuries may have passed, would someone be kept on life support for 100s of years?)Overall, about 2/5 stars.  Would not recommend the game. :( "

												Atmospheric indie sci-fi walking simulator with a little bit of platforming and puzzles. Maybe I´m sometimes easily etertained, but I think it was pretty nice game. Had problems with some of the puzzles not working as they should, but after loading savefile and trying again few times things started to work.Some of the platforming parts were bit frustrating, mainly because at first I could not figure what way to go or jump so it was a bit of die and try.For me game lasted about 7 hours, but I think there is not much of a replay value, since the game is pretty linear and there is not really anything extra to be found.  Think about watching couple of decent sci-fi movies. You probably don´t want to watch them again in year or two, no matter how good those movies are since you already know what is going to happen. Or do you? Well how would I know. o_OAnyways I think the right kind of price tag for this 6-7 hours long game would be around 5 €/$, even 10 feels bit too much, not because of quality, but because it is a short game with no replay value.I´m personally not too much for this kind of games, but I still enjoyed playing it for a couple of nights. Sometimes when all triple A games start to bore the  soul out of you... Well variety is the spice of life.I recommend it.That being said only if you like this sort of games and you can get it from a sale for a decent price.And/or you just want to experience something different than what you usually play.7/10			"

												Based on the STEAM trailer I was expecting that this game will be mysterious with big number of unexpected twists.Unfortunately it was boring and irritating. Why ? Let me put it in + and - category:Advantages:1. Good and fresh idea - there is not so many FPP/TPP games that you are not shooting to some monsters/guys.2. Music was quite nice - let say it was properly selected to create good mood.Disadvantages:1. Boring as hell - If you will decide to play ""LifeLess Planet"" you will spend several hours mostly on walking: you switch something - you walk, you push something - you walk sometimes you have riddle and then... you walk. And it will take you 30 seconds to solve the riddle and 30 minutes to get to the another.2. Inconsistencies in story - most irritating is companion of main character there is some lady, half human-half ?. The main character do not even try to ask: who you are? or how did you get in here? - just, ok there is a woman, she can bread with CO2 and has green feet - horrible.But the top is where your character says - ""it is time to get some answers"" - you think: finaly there will be some cool explanation, but there is nothing, complytly nothing, again you just walk and walk. 3. No final battle no middle bosses - just walking and trying not to step on  ""vegetables"" which leads you to be bored.4. music - yes,yes music is in advanteges - and it should be, but if you are listening most of the game 1 track you can be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of.5. In trailer the story about wife seems to be realy important. But in the game it finished like 3rd order story with forced ending.I can create realy long list of ""I hate"" or ""I do not like"" points about this game, but I do not want to tell you full story.In my opinion it will be less painfull for you to just read the story than buy and play this game.

Different types of atmosphere Lava, Winter and dust. find way like puzzle. Heart touchingi found this game so sensitive and heart touching.

												This game didn't sit long on my wish as I was really excited to play it. The ambience and style was just my speed.One of the first things about this game that got me really excited was the fact that it was $20.The imprtance of this made me think that it was going to be a high production game.Though it wasn't as high as I had hoped it would have been, and though it didn't meet all of my expectations, I would still recommend this game.Just not for $20.For me, the fist thing that stood out in this game the most was the sound track! It was fantastic, soaring, epic and really helped with the overall immersion of the game. Definitely worth $20.The size of the game was also great, and the added bonus of the search for the minerals was also a plus! Game size definitely worth $20.The story line was a little scattered. I understood what was happening, and the end made the point of the russian girl/ wife connection apparent.However.The mechanics, the movements, the cutscenes, and overall operation of the game.Not worth $20. $15? Yeah!The movements and cutscenes were just so choppy, I understand that its a small time production company that had made it, and i can appreciate that fact 100% no doubt.To me, the game seemed just a tad imcomplete. It had the potential to be a really really great game, storyline, music, and all, even for $20.But, I will absolutley be keeping this company on my radar for future titles!			"

												I was not aware of Lifeless Planet during its Kickstarter campaign and subsequent development, so what drew me to it was the curiosity I had regarding its teaser video.  It looked like a neat ""explore this alien world and no you don't have to shoot bad guys"" game, which lately is something I'm very interested in.  So I was happy when it showed up in a bundle (Humble Flash KISS bundle) and gave it a shot.The aesthetics of the game are immediately wonderful - this world was rather painstakingly designed for all the emptiness it invokes.  Hills roll, rock formations appear haphazardly, and you are free to explore quite a bit of it.  This comes in handy during some sections where it seems to allow you to create your own shortcuts simply because the designer didn't feel the need to have invisible walls all over the place (there are some, admittedly, but I was really surprised at how far I could wander without hitting one).  There are several different environments to see, though to be fair there isn't any real connection between them and they often seem to be there because they are neat.  The music is minimalist and effective; most of the sound in the game consists of your character's grunts as he hits a landing particularly hard, and the sound of your jetpack expelling air.  What is Lifeless Planet exactly?  It's an explatformer (patent pending) - you wander around the world, picking up bits of information via glowing documents on the ground and assorted important landmarks and using your jetpack to clear gaps and obstacles.  The story reveals itself over time, with no pressure except the sequences when you arbitrarily run out of air and need to find a conveniently located oxygen station.  I'm not even sure why those parts are in the game, as they don't really bring any value to it.  At various times you are able to boost your jetpack to reach higher/further platforms, and you use a mechanical arm found early on to solve a few basic puzzles involving alien (?) technology.  One of the nice little touches is the weight and momentum you have.  It takes a few strides to get to full speed, and if you time it well, you can really boost with the jetpack beyond what you'd expect.  The crux of the game is always exploring, however.  So in a game where most of what you are doing is strolling through really cool environments, how is the narrative?  It probably isn't for everyone, but I think it tackles the sci-fi aspects pretty well and while it may wrap things up a little too tidily, I didn't dislike it, and I certainly didn't see where it was going ahead of time.  I had a good enough time jetpacking around hot springs and enormous forests with the occasional story interruption to continue through to the end.  The ending music piece is pretty good, by the way.			"

												Very Weird.I liked the game, I'll say that.The story was interesting at first, but I felt that the crew mates you are looking for and the answers you seek are all utilized lacklusterly. Cut scenes felt rushed and really jarred, there were several times where I felt like a cut scene was just removed and found myself standing in a very different place with no real explanation as to why I was there. I enjoyed the jumping segments, and found the Lady character to be a good motivator.			"

												I really tried to like this game, and I really want to recommend this game but unfortunately the gameplay ruined the experience.Gameplay-wise, this game offers almost nothing but jumping puzzles. And most of them are tedious and artificially difficult. I can understand that the creator wanted the player to feel alone in a vast, lifeless planet. This interactive experience does a bad job being a game, but delivers on other aspects. The story, atmosphere and music is good but you can't judge a game by its story, music or atmosphere. It is a ""game"" after all.The pacing of the environment and story is very good. You never feel tired or bored in one location. The levels, in terms of aesthetics, are unique and you are never stuck on one level too long. You aren't stuck because the game is too easy. The puzzles aren't hard, clever or well designed (in my opinion). And the pacing of the gameplay is also pretty bad. In the beginning you are introduced to your oxygen-meter, which by the way is non-existent. The first thing you do is struggle for air, and when you do find a supply, the game tells you that you have 8 hours of oxygen. This number is of course not real, and you  could potentially spend an eternity without ever needing to find a supply of oxygen. This is important because the game are hinting that you have to survive in a lifeless planet. But there are no survival-mechanics in this game (if you don't count the fact you can die from enemies and other dangers). You get other abilities such as a mechanical arm that you can only use on specific devices. You only need your mechanical arm about 6 times though-out the game, all feeling artificial and an excuse to call them puzzles. The second ability you can get is a yetpack boost that gives your the ability to jump 7 more time in the air. You get this ability when you need it, but your gas supply magically disappears when you don't have a need for it. It felt like I was doing the same for 4 hours. This game is also badly optimized. I tried to play this on ""Good"", ""Beautiful"" and ""Fantastic"", but when there are too many objects, or a huge structure the framerate drops like a hot potato regardless of what setting you play on. So what you have here is a walking and jumping simulator with an interesting story, good music and atmosphere. But why did this game has to be made? The story, music and atmosphere could very well fit in a movie. I am not saying you should not buy this game at all, because it was an interesting experience, but I just can't recommend this game because it's supposed to be a game and it failed to be that.			"

												Dont bother. The game is mostly tedious running, with some boring jumping puzzles inbetween. The game is not hard beyond the occasional ""Oh... that kills me"". The puzzles do not go beyond Putting balls in holes, Pushing a switch and Pushing rocks ontop of squirty-holes. (Now there's a visual for ya)I found the controls a bit wonky, but i guess they work. The graphics are... eh... i mean, stale at best, you're not in for any remarkable visuals, just different shades of rock.The story? Well, thats what you're here for, right? Sure you're interested in the first hour tops, but its a lot of running and jumping between miniscule diaries and recordings that reveal the backstory of your surroundings. The mystery quickly turns dull as you crest a hill and see yet another desert to cross. Walking simulator tag has never been more accurate.			"

												It pains me to put a 'not recommended' mark here. (Also was not an early access contributor).The game starts out with a brilliant concept, beautiful visuals and atmosphere. It quickly turns into jumping puzzles. Then more jumping puzzles, then vaguely timed jumping puzzles. Then jumping puzzles in the dark with no clear path, leading to keyboard-snapping frustration.I approached this expecting an exploration/story/adventure game, in the same vein as Dear Esther. The first hour or so of that game is exactly that, until it jumps off the rails and becomes Slender with jumping puzzles. The one thing that kept me on task to finish the game were the visuals, straight out of 60-70's era sci-fi, beautiful and eerie. Come for the visuals, leave before the jumping puzzles make you kick the wall.			"

												The story is okay (though not as creepy or profound as the trailer makes it seem), but the landscapes are repetitive, the graphics are buggy, the gameplay is frustrating, and the controls are unreliable. There were a couple sections were I had to make over a dozen attempts to pull off a precise jump, and it just seemed pointless to include such challenges in a game that's really about story. What really ruined the game for me is that during one of the last stages, the game did not respond to certain command (either from my controller or my keyboard) *even when it was prompting me to use it.* Other users have had the same problem (the robotic arm). I ended up having to quit the game and just watch the last coupe stages on a youtube playthrough. Even if this game worked, I would only pay $5 for it because, like I said, the story is just okay.

												Atmospheric indie sci-fi walking simulator with a little bit of platforming and puzzles. Maybe I´m sometimes easily etertained, but I think it was pretty nice game. Had problems with some of the puzzles not working as they should, but after loading savefile and trying again few times things started to work.Some of the platforming parts were bit frustrating, mainly because at first I could not figure what way to go or jump so it was a bit of die and try.For me game lasted about 7 hours, but I think there is not much of a replay value, since the game is pretty linear and there is not really anything extra to be found.  Think about watching couple of decent sci-fi movies. You probably don´t want to watch them again in year or two, no matter how good those movies are since you already know what is going to happen. Or do you? Well how would I know. o_OAnyways I think the right kind of price tag for this 6-7 hours long game would be around 5 €/$, even 10 feels bit too much, not because of quality, but because it is a short game with no replay value.I´m personally not too much for this kind of games, but I still enjoyed playing it for a couple of nights. Sometimes when all triple A games start to bore the  soul out of you... Well variety is the spice of life.I recommend it.That being said only if you like this sort of games and you can get it from a sale for a decent price.And/or you just want to experience something different than what you usually play.7/10			"

												Based on the STEAM trailer I was expecting that this game will be mysterious with big number of unexpected twists.Unfortunately it was boring and irritating. Why ? Let me put it in + and - category:Advantages:1. Good and fresh idea - there is not so many FPP/TPP games that you are not shooting to some monsters/guys.2. Music was quite nice - let say it was properly selected to create good mood.Disadvantages:1. Boring as hell - If you will decide to play ""LifeLess Planet"" you will spend several hours mostly on walking: you switch something - you walk, you push something - you walk sometimes you have riddle and then... you walk. And it will take you 30 seconds to solve the riddle and 30 minutes to get to the another.2. Inconsistencies in story - most irritating is companion of main character there is some lady, half human-half ?. The main character do not even try to ask: who you are? or how did you get in here? - just, ok there is a woman, she can bread with CO2 and has green feet - horrible.But the top is where your character says - ""it is time to get some answers"" - you think: finaly there will be some cool explanation, but there is nothing, complytly nothing, again you just walk and walk. 3. No final battle no middle bosses - just walking and trying not to step on  ""vegetables"" which leads you to be bored.4. music - yes,yes music is in advanteges - and it should be, but if you are listening most of the game 1 track you can be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of.5. In trailer the story about wife seems to be realy important. But in the game it finished like 3rd order story with forced ending.I can create realy long list of ""I hate"" or ""I do not like"" points about this game, but I do not want to tell you full story.In my opinion it will be less painfull for you to just read the story than buy and play this game. I am really disapointed.			"

												Don't buy this game unless you like throwing money away. I've spent over an hour trying to get out of a crater which is the very first part of the game and you cannot avoid it. The so called jet pack doesn't work and there is NO obvious way out of this damned crater which means the game ends right there. People on the forums have tried to help with advice on what to do and I thank them, they have played the game and gotten out of the crater, but lord knows how. Maybe its just hit and miss with this game. I've reinstalled the game many times now and verified the game cache and still no joy. If you like wandering around and discovering stuff, forget this game and try The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. Now that is a brilliant and pretty game. A waste of £7.50.			"

												This is a very interesting, well-written concept. Unfortunately, it falls a little short on the design and execution of the product - so much so that you can almost feel what David Board had intended with it, but didn't manage to pull off entirely.I'm still recommending this game though, as you can really feel the level of scientific literacy in the writing, and the story gives room for some interesting afterthought. The best part about the game, is perhaps discussing the story with other people, afterwards. It also has its moments where the ambience strikes the right chords, making for some memorable events here and there. But they are a bit far in between, which is a shame.Perhaps if he had been a little more experienced in game design, this could have been a really great game. You can feel that there's a lot of influences from places like Stargate, Alien, Space Odyssey and perhaps even a bit of Shadow of the Colossus? But it all wraps together in an, unfortunately, slightly monotonous jumping ""road-trip"" where not that much happens throughout it.I'm not sure if I can say that it's entirely worth the 20 euro it costs now, but you should consider it, if you ever see it on sale.

As a result, you are forced to disconnect any and all joysticks, throttles, pedals, etc. prior to playing this game, or you'll just run around in a circle since the game will take feedback from mentioned controls constantly. There is no way in hell that I'll get down on my knees crawling around under my desk to disconnect 4-5 wires and then have to re-assign all controls for at least one whole flight sim every time I want to play this game. I don't care how good it might be, there's just no way that I'll even try to complete the first mission if that's what I have to do.Get a grip for crying out loud devs, this is ridiculous. Don't get this game, it's not worth 1 cent if you've got controls other than mouse and keyboard connected to your PC and don't want to disconnect them all for the sake of playing this game.			"

												It's a very entertaining little game that puts its aim at telling a story rather than hard-to-solve puzzles. I never got stuck not knowing what to do or where to go. I did however die a lot while exploring the world outside of the main path of the story. Falling to your death is not uncommon trying reach that place up there...The changing of levels sometimes lacks any explanation on how you got to where you are. When one level ends it's night and when the next starts it's daylight. Some narrative on why would be a good thing.Some of the Achivements are pretty silly; Rocketeer (Finish the game in under 4 hours on your first playthrough), and Survivalist (Survive the game without dying on your first playthrough). To me those are now unachivable since I already finished the game once. The ""on your first playthrough"" part needs to go.Those small things set aside it's a pretty fun game with a good story that draws you in to it. I played it start to finish in only two sessions. That does not happen often.			"

												Mix the following ingredients into well designed, atmospheric, gorgeously Unity-rendered setting:Post-apocalyptic wastelandHuman hubris brought low by nature20th century Brutalist architecturePlatform jumping2001 - A Space OdysseyThe law of unintended consequencesAnd you'd get something like Lifeless Planet. The game looks great, but some of the game's platform mechanics are a bit frustrating. Of course, in a game which has no combat, you must have some other means of challenging the player. So, jumping puzzles for everyone!It's a bit hard to discuss the game without spoilers as so much happens fairly soon. Your spacecraft has made a non-recoverable landing on what you expect to be a lush, living world some light years distant from Earth. What you find is a desolate wasteland until you discover signs of life, impossibly, yet somehow from Earth's past. You must discover what this is and how it happened before you run out of oxygen.As I usually don't like platform games, I was a little hesitant to try Lifeless Planet. I'm glad I took the chance. The level design, while sometimes a bit obscure, didn't frustrate me nearly as much as I expected. The lava level, though, is notably very tricky to traverse. But it is a platformer game through and through.Music in the game is quite good, enhancing the atmosphere and environment in just the right amounts. Sound as well is complementary to the game, and the Unity-engined visuals do a really good job of conveying the vast distances in the game.One of the most glaring aspects of the game deal with the arbitrary requirements for oxygen and the boosted jet packs. These two items are used and required in only some very specific situations. It's almost like the game designers had something more in mind for these two gameplay elements but didn't get the chance to fill out the design.For instance, if a level doesn't require you to find oxygen, you can explore that level for days and never run out. Then, at the next level load, suddenly you're almost out of O2. It doesn't matter how long you explored previously, the O2 only becomes necessary at the next level's load. So, that arbitrariness is distracting.Another distraction is that the level transitions can be quite jarring. More than once I wondered how I went from the previous level to the one in which I suddenly found myself. Fortunately or not, the fairly linear design keeps you going in the right direction without being too obvious about it.So, would I recommend this game? If you like good-looking atmosphere and slow, non-combat gameplay, then DEFINITELY. If you like any of the ingredients listed at the start, then give it a try!			"

												Lifeless Planet has a great concept and pretty good story. The game play is not as good overall and the puzzles (which are mostly jumping-related) are pretty straight-forward; there's a bit too much walking, although sometimes it is used to good effect to build up anticipation. Unfortunately, one of the big, early reveals has been mentioned in a lot of reviews, etc. about the game and I wish I hadn't known about it ahead of time. Ultimately, its a fun game that's really carried by the concept and the story, but its short (under 4h), so there isn't the depth to the story one might hope for and it probably isn't worth $20, but definitely worth $10-15 if you like third-person concept/story games.

												This is NOT a non-stop action platformer.  There is NO combat whatsoever.If you are looking for a sci-fi ""Left 4 Dead"", this is NOT what you are looking for.This is, however, a story-driven game.  Some reviewers complain that it is slow, and it is - although there are jumps, and times where you feel claustrophobic, it is the STORY that makes this game shine.Is this a truly great game?  No, I don't think so.  But it is very good, an my roughly 8 hour investment (I did a LOT of exploring) was time well spent.			"

												What a journey! The game brings back so much nostalgia of all the games I used to play growing up as a child. Probably due to its graphics and simplistic gameplay. The game reminded me of KOTOR when you would run around discovering new planets. Whilst the gameplay and graphics were simple, it's the story that truly keeps you playing. The platforming sequences were sometimes clunky and I found a few bugs here and there, but in the end it was the story that kept me playing. Simple yet enjoyable. I won't play it again, but I shall tell other people about it.			"

												Game Description Misleading - This is a third-person PLATFORM game. I am all for smaller developers and fully support them and wouldn't have a problem with this game if I was fully aware of what it truly is.The game is all jumping around with a hint of a storyline to urge you on and try and justify the $20.00 you spent on the game. The description, tags, etc. all do nothing to truly tell you what kind of a game this really is and I firmly believe that Steam should step up and offer refunds based on this. For lack of a more proper description, this game can be considered a third person platform-type and NOT the quest game the decription would lead most people to believe it is.The screenshots are great, the soundtrack is spooky and well done for the game and the backstory is really interesting for us science fiction / cold war story buffs... Great combo, I thought... Unfortunately, it is all jumping... Seriously it is nothing but jumping from one ledge, rooftop, wall, etc. Now, you might say that you like such a game, but be warned that there are glitches that will tick you off when trying to jump around as well...Last, but not least... DON'T even THINK of buying this game unless you have a controller. It was a pain to get my Microsoft controller to work, but luckily I was able to after a while. This game is not fun to play with a keyboard and mouse. "

												The story is interesting but the gameplay is extremely basic and lackluster.This game is in the same vein as Dear Esther.Gameplay mostly consists of following a very linear path through vast landscapes and manipulating objects by either pushing or grabbing to solve extremely basic puzzles. The player can stray from the set path however and is sometimes rewarded with finding strange minerals that do nothing except fill the log book with a little more information about the planet.Graphics wise, the game can be very pretty at times. Crossing vast casms can be quite unnerving.It's just not worth $20 in my opinion, $10 maybe.If you want to be told a story and only a story, consider picking this up, otherwise stay clear.			"

												Lifeless Planet AKA Rock Climbing Simulator is basically a 3D platformer with linear adventuring. The music is good - almost reminiscent to some of the scores in There Will Be Blood. The atmosphere and overall settings are beautiful on max graphics. The actual platforming is fairly simple and is overall meh.Pros:1. Graphics are candy2. Game is fairly easy3. Storyline is interesting enough4. You get your money worth - you cover TONS of ground in this gameCons:1. You never really know 'why' you are going in a particular direction2. Quite a bit of reading - why couldn't the text translator just translate to English?? I mean the game literally has someone reading all the text in Russian3. I found myself yawning in the middleOverall, I think this is a good indie platformer with just enough charm to get my approval.			"

												If you're looking for a light and casual game with an interesting storyline to follow, this is a good game. While I don't think its worth full retail price its definitely something to consider during the sales.The music was beautifully done and contrasted well with the gameplay. Parts had you on edge wondering what was going to jump out at you next, while other levels were laid back and you could enjoy the view. The scenery for each level was amazing, I especially liked the volcano and how it was in the background for the levels after that.The gameplay itself is not difficult at all, I'm really not into puzzle games but the simplicity of this made it more of a parkour and follow the green glowing path. I think the gameplay was a little too slow paced for my liking in parts. You travel from A to B and thats pretty much all you can do.The storyline does make up for a lot of its downfalls. The concept and plot throughout the game kept me playing until I could see how it all ended for myself. It definitely went a different route than I expected with the plot which was exciting to see unfold, I think this was definitely the main reason why I kept playing and why I am writing this review now. Its original and refreshing to see something so out of the ordinary for gaming.I'm recommending this because despite its problems I did enjoy what it had to offer. I'm happy to have supported the developer and hope to see another game from them with the right improvements.			"

												I honestly wanted to like this game but really think it fell short. I had it on my wishlist for a while and the game was gifted to me by a friend. I had reasonably high expectations for the game since the story looked really appealing to me. The game is too short to be worth 20 euros. I finished the entire story in about 4 hours. After those 4 hours you can replay the game but i really do not see much point.The good:- interesting story- jetpack can be fun to play withThe bad:- literally all you do is walk and sometimes use youre jetpack- puzzles are way to easy and don't really add anything to the game except annoyance- way too much walking- graphics are bad- only a few scripted events and even the ones that are in game are really short- Surroundings and levels look bland and boringI would be able to forgive the game its flaws if it was just a 5 euro game but for the 20 euro pricetag this just fe			"

Your journey is entirely linear, heavily scripted and only requires the odd bit of platforming or basic puzzle solving to maintain your progress.The pace is REALLY slow at times and you'll have the odd bit of frustration with the controls - it could certainly have more 'game' in it but the story aspect kept me going anyway...Also has one of the best Aurora effects I've seen ;0			"

For those of you who got through it in <6 hours you are probably laughing at me, but it is what it is.  Here is my review.* This game has a very good story (I LOVED THE ENDING WITH THE SOVIET CHICK!!!)* This had to be the most easy to control third-person game I've ever played* Most of the levels are huge with absolutely nothing in them, which causes a problem with an explorer like me* There is no mapping or objectives or anything like that, which lends itself to the fact that you are on your own, but in some areas it just left me completely lost because of the completely cavernous levels and no directionI was having a lot of fun until the last four levels, which just felt like PITAs that I had to do to finish the game.

It wasn't satusfying in any way. I commend the independent development company for making a go of it but at the end of the process, the game still has to deliver some tangible game play value. This game seemed more of an exerrcise of programming than any serious thought in game play.At any price, it's still not worth hours of your life, especially with so many other well-designed and thoughtful low-price game product available on Steam.

												Actually pretty radIts a super simple concept, like, you're a little dude in a barren wasteland and to progress you just have to get from A to B, but holy hell is getting from A to B a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ plight and a half. What looks to be an easy jump between rocks turns into half a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hour of WHERE THE HELL AM I HOW DID I GET HERE AND HOW THE SH*T DO I GET DOWN. I have to admit, there were a few times I had to consult a walk through, but thats probably entirely because Im just dumb.The important thing is, I love this game. Its challenging, its weird, its curious, and everything is in ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ russian, so for me, an english speaker, it added to the sense of alienation first created by being and alien on some god forsaken planet. You'll just be plodding along like ""yeah okay, I see where Im going this is pretty straight forward"" and then BAM DEATH. Like what??? Then you realise ""oooooh yeah that was my bad I wasnt paying attention because death is literally everywhere and i got complacent because it looks like a cake walk when in actual fact IM DEAD AGAIN."" But you get right tf back up and soilder on because more than anything, you do NOT want this game to beat you.Not the mention, the achievments are hilarious and I love them and im so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ frustrated and i love it.I highly recommend this game.

												This is a perfect indie game.When I first noticed this game I knew instantly that I will like it. It was not the graphics but the idea that made me to want to play this game.The game is actually simple. You have to manage to go somewhere on each level. Not an open world game, just go that only way and learn what the story has to offer. A few minigames that makes you wanna just skip them but the story is the arrowhead.To the cons it is that you somewhat have to do certain things only to specific moments like they tell you to do something you do it and then you can not do it again like you forgot how to do it...Anyway the story is really nice and that could be a movie idea...

												There are some nice ideas here, but the execution leaves a little to be desired.I know that it's mostly the work of one person, and in that respect it's an incredible achievement so I don't want to be too down on it, but viewed abstractly it's not a game I enjoyed spending any time playing.For an exploration game like this, there needs to be something that draws you through the story. Games like 'Dear Ester' and 'Gone Home' do this incredibly well; at every point there's something more you want to learn, some goal you want to reach, and this is what keeps you engaged and interested.By contrast, a lot of the time in Lifeless Planet you're only going somewhere because there's a (literal) line on the floor saying 'go this way', and you do so not because you want to but because there's no alternative--though occasionally you'll be left abandoned and will probably have to resort to a walkthrough. The plot doesn't make a huge amount of sense, and frequent violations of the cardinal rule ""show, don't tell"" (usually in the form of unecesscary voiceovers) serve to break any immersion you may have built up. Trudging through the barren landscapes becomes somewhat tedious after a certain amount of time, especially because the third-person floating camera angle means you spend most of your time looking at the floor.There's also a strange mish-mash of game mechanics in play, the main one being platforming, which is a problem because your character handles like a sack of potatoes. There are a couple of sections where you have to make some precice timed jumps to get through which took me about thirty repeated (and incredibly frustrated) attempts to get right. Movement becomes almost bearable when you get a multiple-jump ability, but this is only granted to allow you to solve a particular area and is taken away again almost immediately, which might be for the best as it lets you jump high enough to kill yourself by falling--something which gets old, real fast.Everything you do is about getting from one place to another, and you keep having to do pointless things in order to open a door, or unblock a passage, or that sort of thing. There's also a strange thing about putting power sources into recepticles -- but the power sources are always so close to the recpticles that there's really no point in them, and the mechanic feels like an arbitrary and inconvenient gameplay lenghtning device more than anything else.It's a worthy attempt, but it's hard to enjoy.

In the beginnning you need oxygen, but then you don't, first you can only double jump, so rocks are precisely are just double jump away from each other, then you get multi jump, so imediately they are much further away from each other. It just stops giving you story or hints after 20 min and gives you huge boring walking/jumping part which never ends, and if you fail checkpoint can be far away, which also takes away all the desire to boringly jump same jumps again.

												Let me start by saying that this game definitely does a few things right. The atmosphere is great and the overbearing loneliness of the situation is made very appearent, especially because of the soundtrack. Now, that being said, this game does fall flat in a few aspects. The journey is long, and I'm not saying that that's a bad thing, but it suffers from something that I think a lot of games are sometimes a culprit of; waiting. Example: There's a rocky platform that I need to get up onto in order to progress the narrative. Although, instead of just being able to scamper on up to it, I have to use a lift. Unfortunately the power is out so I need to follow the cables to the source to get it back on. I do that and then the path I took there crumbles and now I have to take a longer way to get back to the lift. Once I've made it, I then have to turn it on and time my jumps carefully to get from ground to platform, and finally, onto the path to move forward. The platforming in this game is very basic to say the least, but to put off the story to go make the player perform a tedious and time consuming jumping puzzle just to get back onto the right track is pointless. Why? Why couldn't I have just flipped a switch next to the lift to get it going, or maybe a master power switch just a few yards away? Instead I traveled a few football fields just to accomplish the mundane task of turning a lift on.I really wanted to like this game and i must say that, at least in the beginning, I was completely immersed in the lonely astronaut's plight. The peril of being abandoned on an alien planet 15 years from home is projected well and the look of everything is quite forlorn. The big problem is that the game itself doesn't seem to want you to progress through it. It constantly makes you stop and worry about doing the next thing to make a door open or a path become available.There are other areas where the only way to go is onward, but you have to make it across multiple platforms. This isn't so bad, but the jumping mechanics aren't very fun to begin with. The astronaut has barely any weight to him and his movement is slippery making for a few frustrating retries at certain points. The jetpack only adds to the grief, sometimes causing you to overshoot a jump, die, and be taken back to the beginning of the platforming encounter to try again.Overall I enjoyed the first 1 or 2 hours, but then all of the problems I mentioned above started impeding my progress and began to drag it out way too long. Once I reached the end, instead of feeling accomplished for what I had done, I just felt relieved that it was finally over. It all felt like a chore. You can call this game a platformer but the fact that it can't do that right makes it a mediocre experience. The story is the high point most definitely. If only the controls were tighter and the level design wasn't so focused on having platforming obstacles just for the sake of platforming.			"

What looks to be an easy jump between rocks turns into half a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hour of WHERE THE HELL AM I HOW DID I GET HERE AND HOW THE SH*T DO I GET DOWN. I have to admit, there were a few times I had to consult a walk through, but thats probably entirely because Im just dumb.The important thing is, I love this game. Its challenging, its weird, its curious, and everything is in ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ russian, so for me, an english speaker, it added to the sense of alienation first created by being and alien on some god forsaken planet. You'll just be plodding along like ""yeah okay, I see where Im going this is pretty straight forward"" and then BAM DEATH. Like what??? Then you realise ""oooooh yeah that was my bad I wasnt paying attention because death is literally everywhere and i got complacent because it looks like a cake walk when in actual fact IM DEAD AGAIN."" But you get right tf back up and soilder on because more than anything, you do NOT want this game to beat you.Not the mention, the achievments are hilarious and I love them and im so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ frustrated and i love it.I highly recommend this game. Please play it. Please play it forever and cry with me.			"

												(Full disclosure, haven't completed this game, but have spent about 3 hours playing) I have no idea how to feel about this game. On the one hand, the story is interesting and pulls me forward. However, at no point in a well designed game should I be asking myself ""is that how I was supposed to get here?"" And more importantly, I should not be CONSTANTLY asking myself that question. And I am. The controls are gluey and frequently result in falling off ledges and platforms that you need to be following. And you will be doing A LOT of platforming, making the sticky controls unforgivable. But I still want to know what happens next. I want to know the story of this far-away planet. So I'm torn. If you like a good story, then play this game. If you hate platforming, and especially hate trying to do it when your little astronaut will likely fall off the other end or overshoot the platform with no way to control the fall, stay far the ♥♥♥♥ away from this game.

												Just.. NO! The idea was great and trailers are tempting, but.. It's simply boring. Everyone tells about great story.. What story? The game bases on jumping around the deserts and rocks, and even when you get a stronger jetpack it suddenly runs off  when you reach a certain point on the map. The same thing is with the oxygen. You can move around one location, not moving on with the story (what story?) and the oxygen is full, you do not need to refill it, but when you reach a certain point it runs off, and you cant go back. You have to run straight to the next tank to refill your oxygen. That's ridiculous! I guess I won't play it again. The grapchics are also not that good. It's all too simple, not detailed and I felt like playing game from before 2000, with all respect to the games before 2000. Interaction with the enviroment? What interaction? What environment? You can fall and die, that's the maximum interaction you get.And the last thing.. the price. For 19,99€ you can buy 3-5 a lot better games for their full price. If you have to buy it do not spend your money, spend someone else's money or talk them into buying this game to you as a gift. This way you will make them happy by lying how much you like this game and you appeciate this gift. Seriously, do not buy it for more than 5€, that's the highest acceptable price for me.			"

												In this game you're a fat little astronaut jumping and bouncing from rock to rock, listening to logfiles about another horrible incident. Personally, I can't care about these anymore. Something went wrong on planet asshat, humans died, probably their own fault. Humans are stupid, that's a new one.Taken as a sightseeing adventure (personally, I love these, walking straight foward for 10 mins doesn't bore me) the quality of the vistas is a little uneven. Some are truly amazing - the screenshots on the store page prove it - and have a sense of place, others look like randomly generated pudding ""hills"" without any physical substance.Puzzles are very astronauty, they are about fixing things and survival, you do stuff with barrels, rocks, overcome obstacles. Sometimes you press a button and a platform moves.As far as I've seen, there is really no combat in Lifeless Planet, something I approve. It focuses solely on platforming (imagining that Mario is under that helmet made the game more fun for me), path finding, problem solving.It could have been the Martian Chronicles 64 or something else Ray Bradbury would have played in his lifetime. But I can't recommend it. Because there is barely any challenge. Pushing a button near a platform that then starts to move made me feel like a lab rat in a very linear obstacle course.And finally because it didn't make me feel lonely at all. I can't tell why exactly. Maybe because steady progression, simple, solvable problems create the opposite of feeling lost. I haven't finished the game yet. I'd really like to. But it bores me with linearity, engineering puzzles and a worn off, logfile driven story.			"

												If this was a $6 game then I would recommend it, however at it's price range I feel that more is required of it and I am reviewing it as a $20 game, which it is not worth. Only approximately half way through, ""Lifeless Planet"" and I am curious about what is next, but finding it hard to motivate myself to carry on. The story is given almost too incrementally and feels very contrived, the main characters dialogue does nothing to further the narrative, or make it more enjoyable. Gameplay is basic, with puzzles a child should have no issue figuring out, and doesn't really challenge, except when it comes to judging distances and hoping to hell you do not over or under judge and fall to your death. Aside from jumping, the only other thing you have to worry about is your oxygen supply, but is just another thing that has been added in for a false sense of depth as everytime you're about to run out (scripted) there is a place to fill up just ahead, similar to the enhanced boost for the jetpack, running out at scripted areas instead of by actual measure. For a game that people are touting to be very atmospheric, it is seriously lacking it; as well as depth and fun, for the most part. The graphics are very dated, sitting around turn of the millenium for texturing, shading etc, but it does have some decent models here and there. It's a mixed bag with nothing to really wow you. The still shots of the game look pretty but those are not in motion, where the lack of textures and mapping really glare and are pretty much the few pretty areas in an otherwise bland game. Though if the rest of the game was actually decent, and the price set to something reasonable, I wouldn't give a damn about the graphics. The audio in the game is about as basic as the game itself, with only the soundtrack to be worth anything of note. Most of the sound effects could have been pulled off with an compressed air canister, a fan close to a mic and placing a coffecup heavily onto a wood desk. Like the rest of the game there is no real depth or realism to the audio to pull you in.3/10 It is a good effort, but all in all the game is bland and boring. I cannot find any reason to recommend it, especially at the $22CAD price point it sits at. If this was $6 or less the serious flaws could be overlooked for what it is, a basic game. People praising this game for all things it is not confuse me. We do need indie developers, we do need variation in our games, but charging what this dev is for something that would have been basic on even the PS2 is no better than paying EA/Activision for their half baked buggy games and DLC. If we convince ourselves and developers that this is okay, we will be sitting in a rut of half arsed games forever.Thank goodness I got this as part of a bundle.Update 1) After another round trying to make it through the boring tedium my opinion of the game has not increased. More enhanced jetpacking, with it's arbitrary emptying, more bland graphics with a smattering of beauty here and there. Still looking for the horror and suspense that people are talking about, but only getting really boring, spoonfed story which seems as forced as before with very little depth to it at all. Oh, and I actually started nodding off this time on some of the boring walks. I'll see if I can even finish this turd.			"

												Lifeless planet? More like lifeless game. This hunk of crap should be priced at no more than $1. In fact, they should be paying YOU to play this repetative, ugly, boring ""game"". If you like long walks in uninteresting deserts, then this game is for you. It even has a plant species that will kill you if you go off the designated path. Everything is so ""mysterious"", so naturally you just keep pushing on down the track instead of stopping to do any REAL investigating. From the beginning you can tell that not a whole lot of thought was put into this game. Your team of three astronauts crash lands in a tiny little pod, the kind that drop people from the space station. So how the hell were any of the characters supposed to get off the planet?? It's obviously a suicide mission, but they never touch on that. And you wake up magically outside your craft and in your boring, inept suit, your teammates long gone. Who were they? Why did they leave? Meh, it's not important. Naturally the first thing you should do is split up when landing on an alien planet you believe harbors life. And you randomly run out of oxygen, but only when you're nearby a convenient oxygen dump. Simply go near it and you're good. What's the point of this  little exercise? Not a damn thing. Oh, and you can collect little rock samples, which is neat because you're character is a geologist. A geologist that gets sent to an alien planet presumably because it has alien life on it. Smart. As you stumble down the track (which you cannot deviate from), you quickly come across one of your crew, bleeding in a barn. The crewmember doesn't speak, you don't say their name (they're just ""buddy"" to you) and then they get sucked into the ground and your character is like ""huh... better press on then. Gee wiz this place is strange."" Oh, and did I mention the barn is guarded by a sentient tornado? You can outwalk it, so you never need deal with it, and it never gets mentioned in the game, so it really doesn't matter. After meaningless exercises in jumping and jet packing along most perilous and haphazard trails, all in an effort to chase down some Russian-alien hybrid girl (with rendering from 2005, even with the graphics jacked up to ""fantastic"" level). The story comes to an abrupt end when you come to the second big alien door with buttons that are just too high, which require the use of a super-exciting robot arm. The first door opens easily enough, but the second door features nothing but broken buttons that you can't press, leaving you stuck. Think there's a way around it? Nope. There's invisible walls guarding the only way around. Think there's something else you should do? Nope, there's absolutely nothing else going on, except some huge structure that you can't access due to a broken lift. Think you can save right there and load it up later when you've calmed down? Nope, you're starting all the way at the beginning of the level so you get to go through the meaningless trails once more. Hope you like walking, jumping, and jet packing (but only a little bit, because your suit is♥♥♥♥♥♥, because that's all you're going to be doing.			"

												Hmm, the question ""Do you recommend this game?"" is answered in my mind with a ""maybe"". I liked the story of it, but there were quite a few moments of gameplay that I did not like.Probably the biggest downfall of the game is two achievements that are supposed to only be obtainable on the very first playthrough - meaning if you screw up, you shouldn't be able to get them. I believe there's a FAQ by the developer on how to reset the saves so you can get these achievements, but considering that's how they were initially put in I still find it rather stupid. Who the heck plays a game perfectly the first time?The other part about the achievements I do not like would be time related ones - while Rocketeer is rather easy to get (finish game in 4 hours first time), having an achievement about playing the game for x amount of hours total is not really that good of a idea in my opinion. Some games I expect to rack up 300+ hours playing - this type of game I would be suprised if I have more than 8hrs trying to get all the achievement (except for the one about how much time to play). Thankfully it's only 10hrs, so I should be able to manage to muddle through it in the end - but I hate this type of achievement.Moving on to whether you should get this game or not. I do not recommend this game at the full price of $19.99. To be quite frank, it's not worth that much. It's barely worth paying $5 for, but I would recommend it if you can find it at $5 or cheaper.

												The first two hours are great and rich in atmoshpere and mystery but then it stats to fall flat. The game is frankly boring to play through as its a story driven rather then challenge based game (think Gone Home, Dear Ester etc...). The problem is once the story starts to unfold its not very good and without any solid gameplay to fall back on its gets tiresome to play through.If this is on Steam Sale for under £5 then worth picking up.

												I don't recommend this game. I love sci-fi games, but this just isn't what you think it is.How's the gameplay you ask? Well, it's running, jumping, avoiding stuff, and reading. I don't like reading, so I always skipped that stuff, and was left with a boring platformer.If I had to describe this game, I would call it a completely unrealistic, dull, platformer game with a vague and uninteresting storyline.If this was made by one person, I would've understood why it's like this, and even commended the creator, because it's an achievement to make something like this on your own.But I still don't recommend it.

												Quite a decent sci fi game with a lot of atmosphere. You play an astronaut sent with his crew to land on a distant planet but of course it all goes wrong. The astronaut wakes up to find his crew missing and the lush fertile planet he thought he was landing on is almost completely barren. To make things stranger he soon discovers a Soviet era settlement and the mystery  goes from there. This game is pretty much a walking simlator though it does have a lot of sections where you have to jump across platforms and a few basic puzzles.Good Points:- The atmosphere in his game is great and is brilliant in creating a feeling of isolation as you explore the games barren alien world- The story is pretty decent. There was enough mystery there to suck me in keep me playing.- Voice acting is good too and adds well to the games atmosphere.Bad points:- As i mentioned ,despite a good few jumping sections, this game is pretty much a walking simulator and there isnt much here in terms of varied gameplay- Pretty short though to be honest its about the right length. Any longer and it wold have felt drawn out. Not much replay value either.Overall its an alright game that might be worth picking up if you dont mind walking simulators.

												Bought based on the good reviews and faced quite a letdown. Gameplay consists of walking around, occasionally inserting Tab A into Slot B, hopping from place to place, and then repeating. ""Puzzle"" is a strong word for the interruptions which sometimes break up all the walking around. Going off the always-marked path never reveals any hidden secrets or prizes, it merely creates the need to walk all the way back to the marked path.The mechanics of the game are not without issue. I got myself permanently stuck several times, broke puzzles several times, and even managed to make objects disappear a few times.			"

												This is one of those times where I wish Steam had a ""Maybe"" button. This game is worth playing through once, and only once. And if you do play through it that one time, just try to run through it as fast as possible - trust me. I'm the kind of guy who likes to explore, and this game has A LOT of ground to explore. Emphasis on the ground. It is, indeed, a Lifeless Planet. And not only is it lifeless, it has nothing interesting off the beaten path - a path which, I might add, seems designed to make you think there's something interesting if you just take the five minutes to go down a branch or the 20 minutes to explore an open area only to disappoint you Every. Single. Time. No, finding the quartz/mineral/science collectibles was not satisfying. The collectibles are not worth it in the least, and you'll get all the logs as far as I can tell just by keeping an eye open for them while you progress.So, with all that in mind, the story is something that I feel should be experienced at least once, and the pacing is such that if you move through it as fast as possible, you may be able to make up for some of the poor poor pacing of this game. Oh, and another thing, grab it for $5. It's really a $5 game. I know this review sounds like I should have given it a good ol' ""No"" as far as recommendations go, but it really is a great effort for the one guy that seemed to have had anything to do with making it and if there was ever a proper re-make with a large team behind it, I'd pay $60 in a heartbeat, nevermind the $21.99 it is now.

												My friend and I have dubbed this game ""Walking in a Space Suit"". Overall, I was disappointed by this game. The landscape was mostly dull and poorly rendered. The puzzles were mediocre at best and fairly easy. The narrative was delivered by blocks of text and the occasional voiceover. While the voice acting was good, there was about 15 minutes of it in the entire game.I recommend you go to the National Air and Space Museum and stare at Neil Armstrong's spacesuit for two hours. It will be more exiting and eventful. You might even meet some people who know something about space travel, scientific exploration and rational thinking, unlike the development team for this game.

												The trailer made me a little curious about it because of the sovietic reference (this is not common in games). But it was a little frustrating.1. Lifeless Planet is not an ""exploration game"". You just have to walk forward, climb huge rocks and follow the weird girl. You can't explore much (it's not a open world game - you will find lots of dead ends) and you just have to believe that if you keep going forward and forward, something good will happen.2. Gameplay is really awful. In the game, is not easy to do simple acts, like move little rocks in the place you want, operate the robotic arm or jump in the platforms.3. The story is interesting and it's what keeps you playing - I wanted to understand what was the explanation for all that mess in the planet. I liked the misterious atmosphere (the thoughts about life and existance) and the fact that the astronaut does not have to fight some alien monster (he's just an astronaut).But the bad things, in my opinion, don't let you feel the good things of the game. If Lifeless Planet was shorter, it would be better, but still far away from being a good game			"

												Regardless of what other people say about this game, I thought it was phenomenal, especially because it was made by such a small team.The story picks up as you play along, and though it can be hard to piece it altogether, reading the hub in game helps (read all the transmissions and logs). The chase and mystery of the woman in the game added a bit of excitement as well.I loved the whole story to the game, it made up for what can be quite a repetitive run-about-press-this-walk-here sort of game, but it does a great job of putting you in a place where you are isolated; it puts you in the suit of the astronaut trying to find his lost crew members and find a way out of the planet.I wish we'd have learnt more about the aliens who built the portals; the small piece we learn is quite blunt and quick which was disappointing.Other than that, this is a very good game and I'd highly reccomend you buy it when it's on sale (I don't think it's worth full game price for such a short game).

												Conceptually, this game is great. The rest is a sorry disappointment. To begin with, the graphics look like a budget PS2 game, even with the highest settings. It really takes away from the experience. If you want to make a mysterious humanoid figure ACTUALLY look both mysterious and humanoid, make sure it's rendered well. Otherwise, just leave the mess out.Secondly, the gameplay mechanics are clunky. It's quite difficultto accurately maneuver the camera using either a controller or a keyboard. I understand that this is supposed to take place on an alien planet (I won't divulge any spoilers), and perhaps the gravity is a bit different than Earth's. But the jump mechanics are all off. Yet another thing that takes away from the overall experience. Why would I feel compelled to see what's beyond a vista or over a ridge when it's almost impossible move from one platform to another?Lastly, the story is spartan at best. The plot progression lacked, well, progress. There was nothing driving the character, save for a few kitchy, awkwardly placed objectives (why would I run the risk of running out of oxygen on one part of the planet while not on another?). The areas which are supposed to look abandonned by something in the game look more like they were abandonned by the developers a quarter of the way through making the game. There's a difference between minimalism and lack of effort.I really wanted to like this game. Maybe that's why I stuck with it for as long as I did. But I wouldn't recommend trying it unless it's on sale for at least 90% off.			"

												I can't see whether this moniker has already been assigned, but a more appropriate title might be Lifeless Design; or Mediocre Planet. Now that opening sentence may seem a tad savage, but hopefully upon further inspection of the review - or your own explicit experience of the game - you may go so far as to agree to such a damning critique.I will preface the remainder of the review with the following statement; I only played an hour of the game and the method with which I played was via Keyboard and Mouse.TL;DR the game is mediocre in almost every aspect - except the audio design department - which is the only reason for the game's just below average final score.I have conducted surface level research as to the development of Lifeless Planet, to which I discovered the game is a ""solo"" effort by the indie developer David Board. While it remains impressive that it was developed by a one-man band, it doesn't excuse the rather ham-fisted mediocre design throughout the experience. There is a severe lack of material variety in the game. Establishing a wider variety of materials - such as more varieties of metal, varieties of wear and tear or different rocks - would've gone a long, long way in breaking up the slow pacing of the game. Additionally, this may have lead to more exploration of the environment, which would have further emphasised the feeling of isolation and miniscule scale in this desolate landscape.While the sole addition of a wider of variety of textures would have greatly boosted the game's visual design, it wouldn't have been a one-size fits all solution. The game needed much more variety in it's 3D model geometry. Examples include the lifts you use at approximately 45 minutes into the game, or the various pieces of concrete which are very clearly repetitively tiled, and finally the lack of moderation of the application of rust textures (also over tiled and over used).A final comment relates to the lack of imagination to the game's platforming elements - which as far as I'm concerned - is the primary mechanic. The above walking simulator is hilarious, but fails to capture the mediocrity of said platforming gameplay. In my experience (again, 69 minutes total) there was no hazard other than gravity. To have gone so long without any sign of hazards such as unstable ground (there was one falling boulders hazard), or timed platforming sections is a major crime against platformers in my opinion. The mechanic of platforming is about traversing an environment - regardless of it being devoid of life - or spatial navigation. Both of these core values are ignored thus making the primary mechanics very, very disatisfying.Unforunate the experience panned out this way, but none the less I do not recommend this game.2 out of 5 stars			"

								This is a bit of a weird game. Somehwere between a retro sci-fi movie and a slowed down tomb raider with a twist.It's not really difficult and so far all the puzzles have been pretty easy to solve.But, the story, that's a different thing to talk about. It's entertaining, cold-war like and very mysterious.The voice overs are very, very good and the narration is spot on.I don't want to tell anything about the plot, but if you like mysterie games and feel the urge to explore..; get this game. It's worth your time.			"

												Picked up Lifeless Planet on sale, then played straight through it in one sitting.It's definitely a walking simulator, with intuitive puzzles, but the story holds together well and never feels like it's getting old.I clocked in around 4 hours, which felt like the 'right' amount of time for the game.

												This game is pretty good, it's not worth $20 dollars though. There isn't much gameplay besides ""press that button to push/activate this object"", ""dodge/dont get too close to the spookey evil plants"" and my favorite ""Jump on stuff to get where you're going"". This game has a really interesting story, and a great atmosphere.It's an alright game but I wouldn't pay more than 10 or 12 dollars for it.			"

												This game consist of slowly walking around the environments solving extremely basic puzzles and jumping from platform to platform. And you got a few notes and audio recording to collect so you can get some more intel of the story.Your character responds to the controls in a very jerky way (quite laggish). At times, I had to reload checkpoints since I just couldn't progress any further in the game. I was literally stuck as a required item was stuck in a danger zone, meaning I simply couldn't reach that said item without dying. Lifeless Planet ain't a bad game per sé, but it's not groundbreaking either. For a platformer game, it feels much more like a ""walking simulator"" than doing platforms. Lifeless Planet's real problem is that it drags on far longer than it should, with no real reward for persevering through it. I wished the game was over way before it actually was, even though it figured the plot wasn't advanced nearly enough to provide the finale and the answers.PROS:+Very atmospheric game. You truly feel alone on this game and I loved that!+Stunning visuals.+Audio, mainly the music ambiance not only get's the job done but serves as your only companion on this game.CONS:-Controls are atrocious... even with the Xbox One controller.-While the game is neat, the gameplay takes a huge drag, lots of filler, before getting to the endgame.-20$ retail price is steep for an indie game. Wait for a sale!-Simplistic platforming and puzzle-solving.-There’s far too much pointless walking around.-Intriguing and promising story but also quite confusing. It stumbles to an incomplete and almost incoherent conclusion.RECOMMENDATION:Lifeless Planet's trailers portrayed something far greather than what the final product got to be. The game itself ain't mediocre but it has many flaws. It has great atmosphere and I recommend you give it a spin for that alone. But the steep 20$ price tag for a dragged story makes me not recommending this game at retail price. Wait for a discount!RATING:6.5 / 10			"

												The trailer sold me. It seemed like a really cool idea and I really wanted to like it.The atmosphere, the music, and the setup of the story is fantastic. However, after an hour into the game I came to following conclusions:- You walk. A lot. It's a complete walking simulator with big giant set pieces that set up the isolation that you're supposed to feel. It works, but most of the time I played it I was walking instead of looking around trying to get the story going.- It's very linear. The game is on rails and you can tell that you can't go to certain areas. The terrain luckily blocks you from going anywhere that the story doesn't want you to and it got old pretty fast.- The jumping is hugely awkward. You also jump a whole lot as well. There were plenty of times where the jumping wasn't accurate and I feel off the many platform rocks because I jumped too short or too far. You try and angle the camera to give you the best shot but you never know if you're going to stick a landing. This is especially frustrating if you fall off at the end of one of many jumping sequences and you have to traverse to the beginning of the area because the scenes are so big.- The Mystery of the story seemed to be solved within the first minute and a new mystery popped up in order to replace it but by this time you don't care. If the first mystery was stretched out instead of given away for such a cliche second one, I'd much prefer that set up.What ultimately caused me to stop playing the game was one such jumping sequence where I over jumped a ledge in the dark and fell to my death. Normally not a big deal but when I respawned, I was in the middle of a rock and unable to move. A Menu selection of to my last checkpoint did nothing to ease my problem so I restarted the game. When I reached a story/plot note that autocollects in your PDA, it registered but I fould the rest of the story notes blank. I didn't have the motivation to go on without my earlier story notes. Is that semi-petty that I'm stopping after a glitch in the game? Maybe. But it had lost most of my attention with the issues that plagued it in the first place.I really wanted to like it, but there's too many games in my library and not enough time in the day to continue with this game. The game does try, but it didn't work for me.			"

												I really, really wanted to like this game. But it's not optimized well at all (my computer should run it very well, but the frame rate is about 20-25 fps). The phenomenal voice acting could have saved it except for the fact that if you ever die, the game gets stuck--literally, the camera just sits and stares at the place where you died and you have to Save and Quit, which for some reason ignores all the progress you've made and takes you two acts backwards. I've played the first underground part three freaking times because I fell off the radio tower near the end of the part AFTER that. I wish I could get a refund on this buggy♥♥♥♥♥shovelware.			"

												As a American volunteer with few attachments to earth you sleep for 15 years in a spaceship traveling two times the speed of light. When crashlanding on a new planet with close to no life, water, air and gravity you must find your teammembers and figure out why there's already signs of russian settlements.If you enjoy reading and follow a interesting story in a slow paste, jump-puzzle based explorer game this might be the game for you. How ever, for me the puzzles are way to easy, and the only challenges seem to be falling off a cliff or walking directly on spikey plants. As the game may seem ""open world"" to some, this game is very restricted and the ground is filled with footprints, goo, blood and sparkly things leading your way. The game tricks you to thiunk you must rush becouse of your low oxygen but it's always scripted and world clipping and invisible walls may be seen all over the maps. If you die the game will respawn you a few feet behind were you die. At every jumping puzzle theres always a few easy to spot perfectly placed object for you to pump on, and theres only one way of doing things.I wish they would have done more with the small features you gain and loose through out the game, they are interesting but limited in use. I would suggest the common player rather watch a play through of this game.			"

The story line is pretty lame but roaming around the world can be fun...for a bit...A few things here and there to look for but staya at the same pace as the opening 5 minutes. There were only 2 memorable moments for me in this game and it was teleporting through portals and the end game finale. I would say wait until game goes under 10USD then decide on making purchase first.			"

												Lifeles Planet = Lifeless Gameplay. Read tag tha says Walking Simulator...This game is really fun for the first 2 hours you play, after that (and sometimes before) It's a walking simulator with rage quit after rage quit.  It's got serious potential, but I cannot stress this enough; the level design is awful, complete garbage. I have spent the last hour trying to figure out where to go on the level ""Inferno"". I finally found a little space that looked like an exit. I went through it for 15 minutes just to realize it brings me back to the beginning of the level. The numbers:Graphics: 5/10Controls (PC Keyboard): 6/10 (Remote): 8/10 Handling: 4/10The jet pack is the most annoying thing ever because you cant turn while in mid-air. This is extremely aggravating on long jumps with little space to land. Also the robot arm controls on the keyboard are awkward and i'm still not used to them. Finally the parts where you push rocks; when you push something heavy you lean against it and push slowly, not here. In this game you click the left mouse button and the rock SLIDES across the dirt and stops a few feet away. It feels like you have no control of where you are going.Story: 4/10 It's just okay, nothing special and a little bland, no emotion.Game play: 2/10It feels like you are doing the same thing every second; Put green ball in hole, move rock, follow girl, collect paper, avoid death-plant thingy, etc. That is literally all you do. (there are some exceptions; finding you're crew and getting oxygen and fuel)Creativity: 6/10Interesting enough. The monsters are unique and the landscape is very good.Price: 3/10Getting it on the Humble Bundle, its a grate value. Full price $15.00, not so much. Wait for it to go on sale before buying.Hype: 0/10This game is totally NOT what i got from the description. I saw a fun and challenging game similar to Limbo in the puzzles and close to Moon Base Alpha for texture/modeling of the world and people. Absolute turn off.Over all: 3/10 Do not buy!NOTE/EDIT: If you are getting this because you love space simulators/adventures, don't. I'd suggest Take On Mars and/or Lunar Flight. Both 8-9/10's for me :)			"

												A drab and boring platformer that would have you believe it is an open world. In truth, there is only one (and often narrow) path and very little interesting to see. The platforming mechanics are often flawed, bouncing you back if you're close to a wall.Good- There's a story in there, if you can suffer the hours of platforming and running around.Bad-Tacked on mechanics (needing oxygen when you enter an area with an oxygen tank, losing the jetpack fuel as soon as you finish a platforming area)-Empty and uninteresting environments-The camera will point you in a random direction after changing area or respawning, potentially sending you in the wrong direction since everything looks alike.-The main mechanic, platforming, isn't even well done or interesting.

												I was going to give a positive review since this is still an Early Access (unreleased?) game, however apparently on 6/6/14 it went full-release.  Based on that it is buggy, with missing graphical assets (character comments on visual things that are not present) possessing of a terrible movement mechanic (6""/15cm cannot be stepped over and instead you must jump, sometimes a single jump will fall short but a double jump overshoots, turning in place is impossible you can only walk in a small circle to turn, etc.).This game could have had lots of potential to be a very fun and atmospheric puzzle game.  Instead it's a good idea with bad implementation.			"

												This game comes across as being an amateur school project. I hoped this game would give me the mystery of exploring a strange new planet, but instead the game I bought was a linear platforming game with basic puzzles and a tedious, cliched story that never really went anywhere. Many folk praised the game for its atmosphere, and whilst there were a few creepy moments, the gameplay and the jarring way the game moves from one area to the next damaged what little atmospheric effect was built.Lifeless Planet started off promising, but then became more ""lifeless"" as the chapters progressed. It's not worth the full price.			"

Only negatives were that the game was quite laggy for me in some areas and I did find it a bit annoying at times when I'd fall off something and have to start again because of it, but mostly just user error! It was also a bit longer than I expected which could be a positive or a negative, it was a positive for me as I really enjoyed playing!Good work guys and I hope to see more games from you in the future!

The worst one being the crater where what you seek is a lot closer than you think just you have a massive area to search which was mostly empty and generally kick yourself for checking there sooner once you find it.

												Really enjoyed this, brought back memories of Lucasart's ""The Dig"", being on an alien planet with very little direction and having to figure everything out for yourself. Thought it was a great little game, it's all about exploration and some light puzzles & platforming with your jet pack booster. I'd read nothing about it going into it so the way the story evolved was a surprise at every turn. Didn't take long to complete, maybe 6 or 7 hours in total but I was kept intrigued throughout to see what was going to happen next.Would definitely recommend. "

												Reviewed in 2014: http://realmsofchirak.blogspot.com/2014/12/lifeless-planet-platformeradventure.html This is a playthrough review of the original game, not the ""Premiere Edition.""Lifeless Planet is a sort of platformer/adventure game with a story about an astronaut who has landed on a remote world 20 light years away, on a one-way trip with two other astronauts to explore the first known habitable world. However, things go wrong and on arrival the ship crashes, the planet turns out to be barren and then mysteries begin to appear. If you've heard anything at all about this game then you know the (SPOILER ALERT) key premise of the mystery is that your astronaut stumbles across what looks like a remote Soviet-era town, leading to many more questions about how this could have happened, if it's even really an alien planet, and so forth. There's a lot more to it than that....but the core conceit drives much of the mystery.Unlike many adventure games of this sort the core gameplay is driven by platforming...which means lots and lots of jumping. It's not overwhelmingly all about jumping, but there's enough of it that if you're playing the game for the story and mystery it can get a bit tedious. If you're playing for the platforming elements first and foremost you'll probably find this to be below-par for your average dedicated platformer ...but don't take my word for it; I'm not a platformer kind of guy, and I definitely played this for the story.Graphically the game was designed by one man and it does show a bit. The game would have looked stunning a decade ago; now it looks and feels like a genuine above-average indie game. I am not easily impressed by indie titles, by the way....I find few of them grab me or offer more than a moment's distraction before becoming tedious, but Lifeless Planet manages to keep you going with a decent mixture of story, ambiance, mystery and discovery.A few items to note: there is no violence as such in this game beyond the risk of death from exploring a sometimes hostile alien world. There's a certain sense of dread at times but it is not a horror title, either. This is a solid straight SF tale through and through. There are some ""huh?"" moments in the plot, but it's more fun to let you see if you can find them. I'll just say this much....as you find each of your fellow astronauts, think carefully about how they came to be where they were, and what exactly happened to them. They were clearly experiencing a more terrifying game than our protagonist!All told it takes roughly 5 hours to complete the game and the experience was fun. If you like adventure games like this and can tolerate a little jumping around you will likely find this worth your time. I suggest you play with a controller, as there are some exercises in the game that are just easier with a controller setup than a keyboard. Addendum: I ca't say this was a $20 purchase, but if you can find it for $12 or less I think it's worthwile. "

												This game is totally one of those atmospheric walking simulators.... with a great story, nice visuals and perfect music. The only real downside is the abundance of unneccessary jumping puzzles which caused me to die repeatedly in certain areas.  You can only watch your carcass hit the ground and roll away so many times before it gets old.  The story made it worth it for me, I really liked it.			"

												Pro: I had a good time with this game, though it does not have all that great of graphics it still has a very great atmosphere about it. You truly feel alone and I found myself driven to beat the whole game in one sit down, it's not long, but I did stay up until the crack of dawn to beat it. Good story and the experience is worth it. Con: There are some really annoying game breaking bits I had where I died but the object I had to move was in a insta-kill zone and never respawned, so I was forced to constantly throw my body on the object to push it out of the way. Also word of advice, NEVER get off the elevator, just don't, trust me.			"

												Really enjoyed this, brought back memories of Lucasart's ""The Dig"", being on an alien planet with very little direction and having to figure everything out for yourself. Thought it was a great little game, it's all about exploration and some light puzzles & platforming with your jet pack booster. I'd read nothing about it going into it so the way the story evolved was a surprise at every turn. Didn't take long to complete, maybe 6 or 7 hours in total but I was kept intrigued throughout to see what was going to happen next.Would definitely recommend. "

												Reviewed in 2014: http://realmsofchirak.blogspot.com/2014/12/lifeless-planet-platformeradventure.html This is a playthrough review of the original game, not the ""Premiere Edition.""Lifeless Planet is a sort of platformer/adventure game with a story about an astronaut who has landed on a remote world 20 light years away, on a one-way trip with two other astronauts to explore the first known habitable world. However, things go wrong and on arrival the ship crashes, the planet turns out to be barren and then mysteries begin to appear. If you've heard anything at all about this game then you know the (SPOILER ALERT) key premise of the mystery is that your astronaut stumbles across what looks like a remote Soviet-era town, leading to many more questions about how this could have happened, if it's even really an alien planet, and so forth. There's a lot more to it than that....but the core conceit drives much of the mystery.Unlike many adventure games of this sort the core gameplay is driven by platforming...which means lots and lots of jumping. It's not overwhelmingly all about jumping, but there's enough of it that if you're playing the game for the story and mystery it can get a bit tedious. If you're playing for the platforming elements first and foremost you'll probably find this to be below-par for your average dedicated platformer ...but don't take my word for it; I'm not a platformer kind of guy, and I definitely played this for the story.Graphically the game was designed by one man and it does show a bit. The game would have looked stunning a decade ago; now it looks and feels like a genuine above-average indie game. I am not easily impressed by indie titles, by the way....I find few of them grab me or offer more than a moment's distraction before becoming tedious, but Lifeless Planet manages to keep you going with a decent mixture of story, ambiance, mystery and discovery.A few items to note: there is no violence as such in this game beyond the risk of death from exploring a sometimes hostile alien world. There's a certain sense of dread at times but it is not a horror title, either. This is a solid straight SF tale through and through. There are some ""huh?"" moments in the plot, but it's more fun to let you see if you can find them. I'll just say this much....as you find each of your fellow astronauts, think carefully about how they came to be where they were, and what exactly happened to them. They were clearly experiencing a more terrifying game than our protagonist!All told it takes roughly 5 hours to complete the game and the experience was fun. If you like adventure games like this and can tolerate a little jumping around you will likely find this worth your time. I suggest you play with a controller, as there are some exercises in the game that are just easier with a controller setup than a keyboard. Addendum: I ca't say this was a $20 purchase, but if you can find it for $12 or less I think it's worthwile. "

												I've had this game in my library for a while and finally got around to playing through. I had played a bit of it and dropped it after thinking it looked cheap and plain.  I was wrong.  Graphically not something to write home about, and understanding that I am not a platforming fan- this game was outstanding none the less.  A very well written story. Long enough to be interesting and short enough to not overstay its welcome. Very impressive indie fare.  7/10			"

												If you dont like games that require a lot of time and don't have the shooty shooty like an action filled Call of Duty game, this game may not be for you. Even if you claim to hate that gnere and you're very impatient, you may not like this game. The best way to enjoy this game to me is to admire the beautiful and most of the time dangerous planet you've been sent and crashed to. Its supposed to be lifeless yet why is there an old, Soviet abandoned town? Who is the mysterious woman that guides you? All of this will be answered the more you play. Its very story driven and forces you to take in virtually elemental force this planet has to offer. However no game has flaws. The jump mechanic via a broken jetpack and sometimes a full working jetpack, to climb mountains or that whatever objects that are in your way can be finicky. You'll fall down. A LOT! But its all worth it when every so often you get another piece of the puzzle thats the mystery of this planet and everything on it.			"

												Oh Boy, so I finally finished Lifeless Planet and I have to say I really like it! The story and environment really interested me back when it was being developed and after playing the demo back in the day, I jumped the gun and bought it way back, now with some spare time I thought I would finish it and am happy I did. The game is made on Unity so we are aware of the issues there.. sometimes specially at the end the FPS would plummet even though am rocking a 980GTX, but the story and playability is what counts and even though at times it could get my blood boiling at the weirdness of the terrain for not making it obvious what would kill me, or what landing might get me killed, over all is a great game! I love the soundtrack perhaps the best thing? The protagonist background story moves along pretty slow, but that's understandable as the main story, is what keeps you playing. The graphics are OK.. Unity3D.. and the developer has kept it up to date, news on bringing the game to Mac/Linux and console is superb and I have to admit for a single developer this game rocks! Is well work the money! A few bugs here and there, but nothing that would render the game unplayable and for a plat-forming game it kept it mixed enough so I wouldn't get boring! 8/10!! way better than some so called AAA games out there!!

												Pros:The story was interesting and unique. I enjoyed playing this game quite a bit.I especially loved the design of the Ancients' technology.Cons:Just be aware...The physics can be a bit buggy at times, and the GUI has some glitches which caused me to crash out once or twice. Also, on occation a broken level element  would force me to get real creative in order to salavage my progress and be able to continue on with the game.Finally, at certain times my framerate would drop suddenly under 10 fps. I also noticed quite a bit of screen tearing. I tried running it both on SLI and just on a single card, but it didn't seem to have any effect, neither did changing the graphics settings from high to low. It was quite distracting, ruining the immersion of the game's atmosphere, not to mention very disorienting.			"

												 Fun game.  A little on the short side, though.  This is best viewed as a low stress time passing game.  The puzzles are not challenging.  The robot arm has only certian activation areas.  The jet pack is limited most of the game.  And a lot of walking.  And the astronaut that you play seems quite underwelmed by the crazy events going on around him.  That said, the game is visually beautiful.  It is simple to master the controls, as there aren't many.  For me the fun out weighed the drawbacks.  It is basically a 3D side scroller, if that makes sense.			"

												I really, really wanted to like this game. But it's not optimized well at all (my computer should run it very well, but the frame rate is about 20-25 fps). The phenomenal voice acting could have saved it except for the fact that if you ever die, the game gets stuck--literally, the camera just sits and stares at the place where you died and you have to Save and Quit, which for some reason ignores all the progress you've made and takes you two acts backwards. I've played the first underground part three freaking times because I fell off the radio tower near the end of the part AFTER that. I wish I could get a refund on this buggy♥♥♥♥♥shovelware.			"

												As a American volunteer with few attachments to earth you sleep for 15 years in a spaceship traveling two times the speed of light. When crashlanding on a new planet with close to no life, water, air and gravity you must find your teammembers and figure out why there's already signs of russian settlements.If you enjoy reading and follow a interesting story in a slow paste, jump-puzzle based explorer game this might be the game for you. How ever, for me the puzzles are way to easy, and the only challenges seem to be falling off a cliff or walking directly on spikey plants. As the game may seem ""open world"" to some, this game is very restricted and the ground is filled with footprints, goo, blood and sparkly things leading your way. The game tricks you to thiunk you must rush becouse of your low oxygen but it's always scripted and world clipping and invisible walls may be seen all over the maps. If you die the game will respawn you a few feet behind were you die. At every jumping puzzle theres always a few easy to spot perfectly placed object for you to pump on, and theres only one way of doing things.I wish they would have done more with the small features you gain and loose through out the game, they are interesting but limited in use. I would suggest the common player rather watch a play through of this game.			"

There were only 2 memorable moments for me in this game and it was teleporting through portals and the end game finale.

												Lifeles Planet = Lifeless Gameplay. Read tag tha says Walking Simulator...This game is really fun for the first 2 hours you play, after that (and sometimes before) It's a walking simulator with rage quit after rage quit.  It's got serious potential, but I cannot stress this enough; the level design is awful, complete garbage. I have spent the last hour trying to figure out where to go on the level ""Inferno"". I finally found a little space that looked like an exit. I went through it for 15 minutes just to realize it brings me back to the beginning of the level. The numbers:Graphics: 5/10Controls (PC Keyboard): 6/10 (Remote): 8/10 Handling: 4/10The jet pack is the most annoying thing ever because you cant turn while in mid-air. This is extremely aggravating on long jumps with little space to land. Also the robot arm controls on the keyboard are awkward and i'm still not used to them. Finally the parts where you push rocks; when you push something heavy you lean against it and push slowly, not here. In this game you click the left mouse button and the rock SLIDES across the dirt and stops a few feet away. It feels like you have no control of where you are going.Story: 4/10 It's just okay, nothing special and a little bland, no emotion.Game play: 2/10It feels like you are doing the same thing every second; Put green ball in hole, move rock, follow girl, collect paper, avoid death-plant thingy, etc. That is literally all you do. (there are some exceptions; finding you're crew and getting oxygen and fuel)Creativity: 6/10Interesting enough. The monsters are unique and the landscape is very good.Price: 3/10Getting it on the Humble Bundle, its a grate value. Full price $15.00, not so much. Wait for it to go on sale before buying.Hype: 0/10This game is totally NOT what i got from the description. I saw a fun and challenging game similar to Limbo in the puzzles and close to Moon Base Alpha for texture/modeling of the world and people. Absolute turn off.Over all: 3/10 Do not buy!NOTE/EDIT: If you are getting this because you love space simulators/adventures, don't. I'd suggest Take On Mars and/or Lunar Flight. Both 8-9/10's for me :)			"

												I'm a little torn about this, but even though I played it through and enjoyed sections of it, I can't recommend it at its current price.Just to elaborate; I really wanted to like this. The concept is cool, I thought the town scene towards the beginning was good and I was excited to see where this former USSR alien planet colony was going... sadly it sees that was pretty much the only place it went. The communist/cold war theme is essentially played down for the entire rest of the game, even when you approach an impressive/interesting structure all you do is walk past it.Here are the things I did enjoy: - The plot (where is exists) is actually a good concept and towards the end it picks up pace again- Some of the scenery is epic- The visual style is nice- The jumping mechanics (although not what I was expecting) are actually pretty good for a 3D platformer- The Cold War theme (towards the start) is a good conceptOn the negative side: - This is essentially a platforming game with lots of jumping sections (not expected)- The path is very linear- Many of the sections feel thrown in to add length to the game (lots of rocky sections and desert sections just to walk through)- The plot is far too stretched out- The cold war theme essentially disappears after the town- What happened to the hospital-bed that the character kept seeing at the beginning of the game? I'm guessing it ties in with the other character you meet, but for something that happens quite often in the the 1st 30 mins it does just disappear)- Walking up the ""logs"" is awkward with the controls- Lots of Walking... and I really like exploration games... - Oxygen mechanic is poorly implemented and adds very little to the game- Some graphical glitches coming in and out of cut scenes and easy to get stuck on terrain- just bland...

												G'day from Australia!I just finished Lifeless Planet and I was genuinely pleased with my gaming experience. There is an amazing and intriguing story, beautiful music and atmosphere and it was quite challenging in some areas! Only negatives were that the game was quite laggy for me in some areas and I did find it a bit annoying at times when I'd fall off something and have to start again because of it, but mostly just user error! It was also a bit longer than I expected which could be a positive or a negative, it was a positive for me as I really enjoyed playing!Good work guys and I hope to see more games from you in the future!

												If you can get passed the frustration, slow pace of the game, lack of any real content besides decent scenary, and can overcome countless failed jetpack jumps, the ending will knock your socks off. Seriously.For whatever this game hopes to accomplish, it is justily done in the end.Bravo. 10/10			"

												surprisingly good game, the plot is very gripping and drives you on till the very end and certainly keeps you guessing. it is tricky in places as its not always obvious what you're supposed to do next but generally this is solved by exploring the giant levels which while look good can take a lot of time. The worst one being the crater where what you seek is a lot closer than you think just you have a massive area to search which was mostly empty and generally kick yourself for checking there sooner once you find it.

												the 2 first hours are lots of fun. The platforming mechanics are smooth and precise, the story seems promissing and the visuals are gorgeous.However, it's a downhill slope from then till the very end of the game. Lack of indications, lack of coherent and interesting story and vast empty spaces make for a pretty boring platformer.It seems to me like they came up with the great introduction to the story and then lacked inspiration to make something out of it.

												Really enjoyed this, brought back memories of Lucasart's ""The Dig"", being on an alien planet with very little direction and having to figure everything out for yourself. Thought it was a great little game, it's all about exploration and some light puzzles & platforming with your jet pack booster. I'd read nothing about it going into it so the way the story evolved was a surprise at every turn. Didn't take long to complete, maybe 6 or 7 hours in total but I was kept intrigued throughout to see what was going to happen next.Would definitely recommend. "

												Reviewed in 2014: http://realmsofchirak.blogspot.com/2014/12/lifeless-planet-platformeradventure.html This is a playthrough review of the original game, not the ""Premiere Edition.""Lifeless Planet is a sort of platformer/adventure game with a story about an astronaut who has landed on a remote world 20 light years away, on a one-way trip with two other astronauts to explore the first known habitable world. However, things go wrong and on arrival the ship crashes, the planet turns out to be barren and then mysteries begin to appear. If you've heard anything at all about this game then you know the (SPOILER ALERT) key premise of the mystery is that your astronaut stumbles across what looks like a remote Soviet-era town, leading to many more questions about how this could have happened, if it's even really an alien planet, and so forth. There's a lot more to it than that....but the core conceit drives much of the mystery.Unlike many adventure games of this sort the core gameplay is driven by platforming...which means lots and lots of jumping. It's not overwhelmingly all about jumping, but there's enough of it that if you're playing the game for the story and mystery it can get a bit tedious. If you're playing for the platforming elements first and foremost you'll probably find this to be below-par for your average dedicated platformer ...but don't take my word for it; I'm not a platformer kind of guy, and I definitely played this for the story.Graphically the game was designed by one man and it does show a bit. The game would have looked stunning a decade ago; now it looks and feels like a genuine above-average indie game. I am not easily impressed by indie titles, by the way....I find few of them grab me or offer more than a moment's distraction before becoming tedious, but Lifeless Planet manages to keep you going with a decent mixture of story, ambiance, mystery and discovery.A few items to note: there is no violence as such in this game beyond the risk of death from exploring a sometimes hostile alien world. There's a certain sense of dread at times but it is not a horror title, either. This is a solid straight SF tale through and through. There are some ""huh?"" moments in the plot, but it's more fun to let you see if you can find them. I'll just say this much....as you find each of your fellow astronauts, think carefully about how they came to be where they were, and what exactly happened to them. They were clearly experiencing a more terrifying game than our protagonist!All told it takes roughly 5 hours to complete the game and the experience was fun. If you like adventure games like this and can tolerate a little jumping around you will likely find this worth your time. I suggest you play with a controller, as there are some exercises in the game that are just easier with a controller setup than a keyboard. Addendum: I ca't say this was a $20 purchase, but if you can find it for $12 or less I think it's worthwile. "

Whether or not the full price is worth it depends on your personal sense of money. Knowing what I know now about the game, I certainly would pay the 20. My playtime is taken at a moderate pace, with about 65-75% completion rate so far.			"

												Beautiful landscapes combine with an often minimalist soundtrack as you solve physics and other puzzles to make your way through the game. In a nice change of pace from FPS games, I became totally immersed in the mystery, slowly unfolding story and history of the planet.I came across the odd glitch (I could see through some border scenery when close, sometimes got caught in between small rocks and had to reload the checkpoint), but not often and nothing that spoiled or broke the game.I absolutely love this game. If you want a game where you can chill out and explore cinematic landscapes with an awesome soundtrack, this one should be for you.			"

												When people try to describe video games as art, I would advise them to include this game as an example. It has an intriguing story, hauntingly beautiful visuals and solid presentation. The game feels more like an interactive story book, with a protagonist who is faceless enough to act as a simple self-insert, but still has enough depth to give a player interest in his story and situation. The story and setting give off an eerie vibe and really sells the idea of fearful isolation on a barren world far from Earth, the puzzles are fairly forgiving but challenging enough to not become tedious, and there is lots of room for exploration to find hidden collectibles for achievement hunters.If there was anything negative to say, I wouldn't play this game if you're looking for a challenge or fast paced action. It's very easy for anybody whose played puzzle games before, and is largely worth playing for the story and setting. If you're not in the mood for trudging a largely barren alien world trying to piece together a mystery, I'd say move on and find something that caters more to a fast paced or action packed style of gameplay.All in all, I'd give this game a solid 7.5 out of a perfect 10. Definitely recommend for someone in the mood for a great immersive experience.			"

												I would recommend Lifeless Planet as an interactive story that combines science fantasy, mystery, and exploration. This game has a variety of sprawling, richly detailed environments that frequently require you to puzzle the correct path.The game mechanics make sense, and are quite fun in the platforming elements, especially when you have an extra boost from your jet pack.This is not a violent game, though you can fall to your death, and some of the environments contain deadly elements.

												Do you like it when movies keep running even though you thought it should have ended up 40 min ago?Do you like it when you watch anime and they add tons of filler episodes before you get to know anything more?Well, you get my point. There are occasional moments where the level design is bad, some ""puzzles"" can be bypassed even though they intended for something else and moments where you don't really get a clear indication of what you are suppose to do next but that latter part is probably your own fault...or is it?You might not understand why you are running through lava, water, ice and other environment but you are.You might not understand why you are walking too much, but you are.You might not like half of the flaws that comes with the game.But you should still play it. Yes, I still recommend the game. I think it was unnessary long, frustratingly boring moments and painstakingly confusing parts but you should still play it.Why? Imagine walking for a few hours in rain, thunderstorm and complete utter chaos when you could have taken the car to work or bus to school. Well, on the way to work or school you stumble upon an envelop you get a few dollars, and as you keep walking you find more of those envelop increasingly more valuabe then the next. By the time you reach work or school you have had a ""richer"" experience.So, the first 2 hours of the game is completely and utterly booooring but the last 2 hours really catches up with interesting .... things and faster pace and events than the start.It isn't a great game but its worth playing.

That said, I found the story to be pretty average and the gameplay repetitive and at times, buggy. Overall, I don't recommend this one. I suppose the one saving grace was that it's short. I'd say it might be worth $5 or less if the premise interests you and you truely have nothing else to play.			"

												I'd like to recommend this. I'm a fan of weird science fiction, even weirder stuff than this.I just can't. As the story progresses, less and less of it makes any cohesive sense.I don't mind the graphics aren't that great, or that the platforming and puzzles become more and more abitrary (and less linked with the story) as the game goes along.  Hell I'll even put up with the disorientating scene changes that don't explain why you are suddenly in a different place than you were before.But the story is just bad, and in a game like this the story is everything.SPOLIER ALERTThe main character is meant to have turmoil over his comatose wife, which is never fully realised.  You never really quite feel for him or her.  It feels like padding because it also has no bearing in the story.The alien technology would never have been made by the aliens. They are so tall they could have stepped over every wall and would have needed to crawl to fit through their own doors.The didn't seem to need the portals either, at least not on the scale they had built.  They were mean to be a single intelligence as an ecosystem, and were relient on this specific planet.  Why would they try and travel at all.  Even if they would, why would they need large circluar portals.  They would still need to stoop to fit through. "

There are parts of it i just had to stop and really look around at the detail. I just wish there was a ''Hard mode'' That ways can play it again! This game i will definatly be telling everyone about and they should play it. It's a wonderful experiance from start to finish.

												I put this down as a No for reccommendation because I do not advise ANYONE to buy this game at the 20 dollar mark unless you want to be highly disappointed, now if you want it wait for it to go on sale I got it for about 7 USD.Pros: 1.The story is wonderful, and has a good plot.2.There are a few times that the game's setting is very beautiful looking.3.Lastly even though there is alot of times you are lost its a relaxing game.Cons: 1.Edges are very slippery, your main way of getting around is a jetpack and unless you hit your target perfect you will slide off and die.2.The gameplay is really not even there even though you encounter some ""puzzles"" (most of them a five year old can figure out), you are basically just walking in a straight line (unless you take a tiny path to a side area to get a rock specimen that does nothing for your game experience).3.Alot of the game could have been chunked out and you would have never seen a difference in your experience because you are walking through some areas that do not change in scenery for 10+ mins a piece. 4.I found myself getting bored throughout the game because of #3 even though scenery does change sometimes its nothing to exciting.All in All:I would not reccomend this game at 20 dollars buy it when its on sale for 6 dollars if you really want to waste 3 hours on an hour long story.

												A game that feels way too long despite its 3.5h play time. The characters in the story are bland and unrelatable, the levels are barely more than wide stretches of nothing and the gameplay is barely there as well.The graphics show a distinct lack of artistry throughout the whole affair: terrain textures are low res and stretched beyond reason over what looks like noise-generated terrain, the character(s) animations are abrupt and unnatural, light/shadow effects are mostly absent - the graphics were barely marketable in PS2 days. Dear developers, drenching everything in bloom, DOF and SSAO does not make up for lack of... everything.Gameplay-wise, it is a walking simulator, with the occasional unchallenging platform passage. And walking is what you do, through one of the most uninteresting, empty, and same-y landscapes in recent gaming history. Please have a look at real landscapes to get inspired, do not let game engine terrain generators dictate your aesthetics.I cannot recommend this to anyone, sorry.			"

Product received for free
												i honestly went into this game knowing id like it with the neat mystery esch backstory of the assuemd main character and theres a TON of good ideas of how to execute the ""thought provoking meta whatever plot"" right? but all but maybe a handful of those concepts were even touched apon later. it started off half decent and got me super pumped. but then not even half way through it just becomes a super low  texture quality puzzle game. each level is just one puzzle type used to explore the eviroment. but when the enviroment is boring to look at in the first place(for most of the game i should exclaim) and the game for whatever reason makes exploring the enviroment a hastle its just not worth it. the length of the game was the reason to finish it. the smallest of possible jumps either kill you or bring you to a ""stomp"" to the ground that stuns you for a whole hot second. that last part wouldnt be too terribly annoying but it happens so very frequently that it was hard not to get frustrated with the game. the momentum mechanic would have made the game so much more fun if it wasnt for this. maybe even making the game more fun to explore. i get this game was suppose to tell the story more than some titanfall mechanic clone. but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥the stoy isnt even followed through as far as i could see. yes theres resolution but so many of the good story telling aspects were never expanded apon. i think there was at some point a really well thought out game and story to go with it. but some time during development the puzzle aspect took on too much or maybe the team just really wanted to get the game out there instead of ploishing it. not even to mention the many numerous menu and collectable glitches. thanks game			"

												Optimization issues, awkward controls and unnecessary narration aside, Lifeless Planet is an otherwise respectable space survival adventure, one drawing an obvious inspiration from soviet era science fiction. Commendable for its unsettling desolation and impressive music score, this is one that I'd recommend for the more adventurous, ambient-minded gamers out there, though I'm personally uncertain if I'll ever be compelled to revisit it in the future.

												+ Atmospheric game... kind of sterile, lonely, lost, sometimes surreal feeling. It’s definitely not a funny game.+ Music... where you can hear music.+ The first 1 hour is a little weak for a start, but it’ll be a little –just a little- better, when you progress the story.+ Story is fine, but there will be unanswered questions.0 - Controller support is a good thing, but it’s not enough precise and the buttons maping is not enough good.- In the deep it’s a simply platform/jump-a-lot game, which is sometimes frustrating.- The gameplay is the main problem. Puzzles are too easy, not much to think just go forward and forward and push the forward button... oh man, I’ve never ever walked this much in a computer game. It’s a walking simulator :-(- Whole game is very static. Objects and textures are low detailed even in 1080p.- Too little interaction with the world.- You’re in a big planet, but the game is very linear, but you have to walk too much.- Some illogical stuffs... ""You’ve enough O2 about 8 hours."" then 5 minutes later you trigger a script and bang your O2 level is low. Other example: You can jump an hour with your upgraded jetpack in one place, but if you reach a specific place and trigger a scene, bang your out of your better jetpack.- Engine bugs (stuttering, texture flicker problem, rarely ""stucked floating object"". (I’ve a strong gaming machine.)- Camera problems.- 20 Euro is simply too much.It’s simply not enough for a good GAME(!), it’s ok for an alien planet ""road trip"", but for an entertaining product it’s weak, and also weak for being a good platform game.Sorry, I really want to love this game as a sci-fi fan, but I can't.5/10.

The story was light yet filling and the Player character's controls were simple therefore easy to get used to. Nothing to ""write home about"" but a great way to kill a rainy afternoon. Unfortunately I'm giving this a total thumbs down due to the ""First Playthrough"" condition on the achievements and I'm boycotting the Stupid studio that thought that that was a good idea. Sure - it can be done but when are the devs going to get it in their heads that setting land-locked achievements is like being punched in the face after being invited to a party. Watching out for the developer Stage 2 Studios and BOYCOTTING anything else that comes from them. Pity, good game but they'll never see another cent from me. 0/10			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. The premise and the creepy atmosphere set against this huge, awe-inspiring backdrop both made the beginning of this game feel so unique and exciting. I hate to speak badly against such a small indie studio's efforts but ultimately Lifeless Planet is more boring and frustrating than it is enjoyable.It's most praiseworthy element is the story it tries to tell. You are an astronaut stranded on a desolate planet, discovering abandoned human settlements and structures whilst trying to find your crew. The first hour and a half or so captures the mood perfectly. It is genuinely unsettling to wander through this world and slowly unravel the mysteries of those who came before. However, after a certain point, the pacing just falls off dramatically. There are no new developments in the story for nearly an hour, and the atmosphere wears paper-thin. You will find yourself becoming irritated at performing the same weak platforming sections and avoiding the same old boring dangers. The puzzles are also a joke - childishly simple little sections of putting the only X object present into the only Y hole available. On top of this, the controls are awkward and will lead you to many any unfair death.Unfortunately, I haven't even been able to finish the game. Despite all my complaints about the gameplay and mechanics I still wanted to see the story's conclusion (after suffering through all LP's faults I think I deserve that) but no. I think I'm still roughly a couple of hours away from the end, but thanks to a glitch on one of the last hammy, awkward puzzles, I can't progress any further.I was lucky enough to get this at a discounted price, but if you want to spend £15 on a buggy game with an (at first, anyway) intriguing and promising story riddled with boring exploration, puzzles and jumping, this is the game for you. Otherwise, I cannot recommend Lifeless Planet.			"

												I was expecting Lifeless Planet to be so much more than it is.  Having said that, it's still very beautiful and enjoyable.  Where the game lacks is in its mysterious story it's trying to tell.  It just isn't very interesting and makes discovery rather boring and tedious.  Still, I recommend this game since the price I paid for it as part of a bundle was cheap enough that I got my money's worth.			"

												1/10, misleading name.But seriously, this game is gorgeous. Check out my screenshots if you're unconvinced by the trailer. The soundtrack is stellar, the graphics are superb, and the story is intriguing and has a decent arc (which these days is a real gem). It initially annoyed me that I couldn't sprint and could only walk, but by the end I had seen the light. It's not a particularly long game, so don't be shy about taking your time. You're on another planet!!! The detail that went into the different regions just blew my mind. This is not just walking around Mars and saying ""Oh hey yet another rock sample,"" this is a brand new world with so much to see and explore and so many ways to die horribly and it's rife with mystery that unfolds throughout the story.My one major complaint was that for the amount of platforming the player has to do, the controls were too loose and the landing zone was often unclear. I appreciate and accept that the landing zone needs to be as unclear as it is to keep up with the aesthetic, but the number of times I caught the very edge and either got stuck and had to restart from the last checkpoint or simply bounced off and fell to my death...that got frustrating at times. I wouldn't call this a buggy game at all, but I think I found every single crevice to get stuck in irreparably. Perhaps it will be fixed in an update, or maybe I'll learn to suck it up and get over it. Regardless, if you find th some trouble, know you are not alone, and perservere.Also, I loved the touch of putting in day/night cycles. This is not a horror game; but if you generally avoid the horror genre, play the nocturnal bits during actual daytime, not at 1am. I hope this helps.In short: gorgeous, engaging, some minor issues but what game doesn't? Actual score: 9.25/10			"

												Terrible pretentious game. I was hoping for the wonder and exploration here, but what we got here is an uninspiried monotone jumping-game.Thats all you do, hop from one rock to another, almost no variation!Pro:+ at times the visuals look good (not great, just good)+ Soundtrack is fitting+ native controller support with a good standard layoutCon:- there is little to no gameplay here. Puzzles repeat annoyingly often and you walk for hours!- it is one of those where-da-hell-do-I-have-to-go-game- jumping.....thats it, you jump platforms for almost 90% of this game which is very boring btw- the story is horrible, boring and has a bazillion plot holes- ""show, dont tell"" --> the story is completly told via texts that you have to find in the game, I mean who in the right mind would ""hide"" texts that tell the story! - a totally dead end story sub plot about the protagonists wife.....it leads nowhere.....- developer attempted to make this game look more than it is. He is trying too hard to appear artsy- controls can feel sluggish at times- there is no exploration! this games level design is at its worst. We have a linear path in an open world with stupid dead ends build into it.......what is the point?- never have I encountered something cool or worth looking at, you will be totally disinterested- when-is-this-going-to-be-over-feelingThis game is really bad. Its playable, but not worth anybodies time. Check out some other games that deliver way more worth your money!			"

												This game is just not worth the time it takes to play it. It's not the worst game in the world but there are probably 1000 better things to do with your time.  Here is why.  The graphics are pretty awful and they are very bland.  Not just atmospherically bad, they straight up show you all you can hope to see of the unity engine in the first 20 minutes.  The gameplay is bland.  All you will do is jump from point A to B and occasionally pick things up and put it down.  This would almost be excusable if the story was actually interesting or poignant.  It wasn't.  The whole story could have been told in 15 minutes but instead you get to jump 15 mi before you get the next note unlocking another piece of bland story. The only good thing about this game is the soundtrack, which has a nice Mass Effect sound to it.  Don't buy the game unless you really have nothing at all to do for 5-10hrs.			"

												Nice game, pretty cool story and nice atmospheric environments.However the jumping puzzles are insanely hard. I spent 20 minutes trying to get past a 'man-eating flower' multi-jump puzzle before I gave up and probably won't play it again. It's a shame there's no cheat codes or anything to get past these crazy hard parts.Please note I'm someone with zero dexterity, I also hated half-life 1 for this reason (all the jumping on moving cylinders and stuff). But at least there was a cheat mode to get past the awful parts :)It's a shame because it ruins an otherwise nice game for me.			"

												While the game LOOKS wonderful, and occasionally stunning. It is not worth the time and effort to play it.  There are defunct mechanics such as ""need oxygen"" which only serve as mcguffins to make you move in a particular direction occasionally. It has trivial puzzles with exceptionally ham fisted story telling. Instead of a voyage of discovery there is a ""oh looks like this happneed"" dialogue. Alot of jumping, some occasionaly rocks to push around which are bizarely difficult to stand on. And creatures just vanish into the ground. The sound design is really quite great, and it looks pretty. But everything else (particularly the awful cutscenes) is unpolished and sub par. I feel robbed :P			"

												Lifeless planet. Well. My friend was playing this game and he sounded like he was enjoying it so I was all like ""Sure, I'll make an impulse buy"" NEVER AGAIN. This game, if you could call it a game, is just incredibly boring.  The mechanics are boring and unoriginal. Jumping 'puzzles' and square peg square hole 'puzzles' are about as complex as it gets, nothing challenging. There are often bits where you walk around following a glowing path, so you can avoid the giant spike monsters... Why do you need a glowing path for that? Well let me tell you, it’s to involve a pointless alien character in the non existent plot. This game is labeled as an action adventure. Action, none of that, the most action thing that happens is maybe the occasional rock slide, or a spike shooting out of the ground in your general direction. As for adventure? Well plenty of that, if you think adventure is wandering slightly off the linear path and encountering a poorly textured dead end. I think in an adventure game especially one like this where you are supposed to be unraveling the mystery a lifeless dead planet, exploration should be rewarded with story, with plot, not with a dead end. Early In the game you gain the ability to use your jetpack for more than one burst (In this game you can jump, then jumping again gives you a short bust of jetpack) of your jetpack that allows you to traverse relatively great distances then it swiftly takes that away from you, sternly saying ""NO. No fun for you"" (It helps for comedic effect if you think that in a Russian accent) Instead of making the game more grandiose to fit this new fun ability you have, it just goes back to the same old walk here, jump here, jump over a thing, move a thing to help you jump on another thing gameplay. The environments are boring. Unless you enjoy desert. I'm sure some people enjoy looking at sand and rocks for extended periods of time, geologists for instance, but I'm not a geologist. I am however supposed to be on an alien planet that was populated by Russians. Think you could do something interesting with that, no? Really? They sure nailed empty though when that monotony it is finally broken by some man made structures, you quickly get bored of those too. One of the first 'interesting' areas is supposed to be a research facility, what wonders are in this research facility you ask?  Decaying soviet technology? Leaking vats of unidentifiable goo? NOPE. I counted about eight microscopes and some grey wooden desks. Chairs to boot. Can’t forget the chairs.  That's right. An Interplanetary soviet colonization party sent to set up the 'new motherland' bring enough construction materials to make several large bunkers and a dam, some tesla coils, desks, chairs and eight microscopes, got your priorities straight there. In terms of other environments there is the aforementioned desert, copy pasted buildings and bunkers, a dead forest (Desert with tree shaped rocks), canyons... Well... That's is... Bar some poorly textured alien set pieces  which they make use of several times. The plot? You want to know about the plot? Wait. This game has a plot?! It does, and guess what it's boring. Actually. Scratch that it's not boring it's just dumb. I thought it was just about walking and jumping but no, It's some crap about soviets discovering a stargate, going through the stargate, somehow infecting and wiping out a weird moss that for some reason all life on the planet lives off that is also a power source with a terrestrial virus (quite how a terrestrial virus would adapt quickly enough to wipe out an extra terrestrial form of plant life when usually virus have trouble crossing the species barrier I'll never know, but then again I'm not a biologist or a xenobiologist) thereby killing all life on the planet. Oh except the mutant plants, what caused them to mutate so quickly to become deadly spike extending plants you ask?... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA...  Apparently they tried to cure this virus, presumably with the microscopes. You got space soviets wrong. SPACE SOVIETS. There's an Russian alien chick too I think I mentioned before, she's suppose to be an allusion to your dead wife or something. I can’t really remember because of the two hours I spent playing this game I spent half an hour trying to climb a really tall pylon she was sitting on top of just to prevent me from slitting my wrists out of sheer boredom. I thought perhaps there'd be a spy who loved me cross captain Kirk style Easter Egg at the top but eventually I gave up. Not just on the pylon, but also this bland game, and also humanity, but that's a separate issue.    AVOID AT ALL COSTS. You get it, costs, because this junk cost me 15 quid. You want to play a similar game that is several magnitudes better. Go take a look at Waking Mars. Better environment, characters - actual characters, good gameplay, it's less than half the price and accomplishes this without one third of the dimensions this game has.			"

												HI,This game is still in need of some 'rudimentary' code to enable advanced players to play this game without unnecessary difficulties. In this specific case I have spent a great deal of time trying to understand what was going on with my game at the very beginning.After start up the game starts with the astronaut running in an uncontrollable fashion. which eventually turned out to be caused by the fact that the pedals of the rudder kit were in their rest state which the game interpreted as instructions to walk. Pressing either pedal (i.e. using the toe brakes) causes the astronaut to turn and move in that direction. After some experimentation it seems that if both pedals were pressed such that they were at the midpoint of their rotation all movement ceased.In  practise the game appears to make use of multiple joystick devices plugged into a platform but fails to take the trouble to identify the class of device. In my case I have the Saitek X52 pro Joystick and the Saitek Rudder pedals connected.The config screen identifies the throttle quadrant as joystick 1, the joystick itself as joystick 2, but there is no obvious way to disable the use of the rudder pedal (bar disconnecting it [not an acceptable option]). In this case I have attempted to modify the null zones for the rudder pedal but without any impact on the game.It is requested that the development team look into this problem as soon as possible and hopefully provide a fix.

 Lifeless Planet  is not bad given that it's created by just one guy. However, jumping puzzles can be tough to complete, and there's not enough motivation within the story to carry on.			"

												This is not for the hard core action gamer, to be sure.It is, however, freaking gorgeous.   a lot of time is spent in journey from one plot point to another, but if you can temporarily  let go of your achievement oriented paradigm, and enjoy the view on the way, there's plenty to drink in. I just got it today (Jim Sterling sent me) and  haven't finished it yet.---I just finished it, and am very satisfied.  only, now I want to...You know what? I''m not about to spoil anything here.  you'll probably see what I mean just before the credits.This game is like ICO for astronaughts.---Dear Devs of Lifeless planet,Sound track please!  I love the Tangerine Dream / Crystal Method feel of the music.  It's just so damn, short!  the music fades out right when I'm starting to really feel the groove. I'd love to have a key to press to let my little astronaut sway along with me.			"

Lifeless Planet is a beautiful, bleak game that ultimately fails in an impressively wide variety of ways. The game has significant problems with story, environmental design, input controls, game-play mechanisms, and graphics. And some of the problems would have been solved simply by adhering to industry standards. (Why, oh why, does a game with long, intricate jumping puzzles offer no means to safely pivot in place?) The few times when the game creates a legitmate opportunity for discovery or an ah-ha moment, it sabotages itself with poorly tuned controls, deadening repetition, or, in one case, the protagonist's internal monologue explaining—for no reason—how to solve what could have been a fun puzzle.Even the Steam achievements seem designed to make the game less fun. There is an achievement for playing this 5-hour game for 10 hours (whee?) but not for completing the game (speedrun excluded). Even Jonathan Blow, who seems determined to free gamers from being shackled to their persuit of achievements and allotted a scant two achievements to his 2016 masterpiece The Witness, made sure that one of those two achievements was for reaching the end. In not acknowledging completion, the creators of Lifeless Planet seem positively mean-spirited.			"

												Do you like playing games with annoying jumping puzzles, boring and ugly environments, and a story that will cure your insomnia?Congratulations! You're a masochist! Also, Lifeless Planet is the perfect game for you.I beat this game in 5 hours. During that time, I saw textures and level geometry that would have been right at home in a 1st-year PS2 game (despite a release date of 2015). Seriously, this game is UGLY. I mean, I have seen tech demos from half a decade ago that look better than this game. On the plus side, you can adjust the visual settings in the game options menu. The trouble is that it doesn't do a whole lot to make the game look better, just more crisp around the edges. Lifeless planet is ""gritty brown realism"" taken to a comical extreme, only without much of the ""realism.""I was nearly put to sleep by the game's storyline. You're an astronaut who crashes on a seemingly dead world, and you have to find out where your crew is and make your escape. SUPER ORIGINAL! It doesn't really get much better but I won't spoil what little story there is to be had.If you're looking for action, combat, strategy, etc., look elsewhere. The whole game consists of jumping around (sometimes using a pathetically weak ""jet pack"" that is neither physically visible nor produces any kind of effect beyond a single white light pulse originating around your character's butt), reading documents, and listening to recordings. There is an extremely limited number of puzzles that need solving, but they wouldn't challenge anyone above the age of 10.The only real plus side to this game is that it didn't have any bugs to speak of. Installation went fine and the game never crashed, which ironically puts it above some AAA titles in that regard. That being said, if the game did crash, it would have been more exciting than actually playing Lifeless Planet.There really isn't much to do in this game. After completing it, I felt like I'd just gotten done with some mundane chore like mowing the lawn or doing the dishes. I can't even bring myself to hate the game, because hate is a strong emotion, and strong emotions have to come from somewhere. Lifeless Planet barely managed to make me feel like I had done anything more than watch beige-colored paint dry.To add insult to injury, according to the credits, this game was Kickstarted. As in, people actually invested real money to make this lame excuse for a game happen. I feel truly sorry for anybody that parted with their hard-earned cash in exchange for seeing Lifeless Planet get made.Spend your time and money elsewhere.3/10			"

												Big fat thumbs down from me. You spend huge chunks of time holding down W, and occasionally jumping. There's little danger, except when you miss a jump and it wastes your time. There's so little game, yet a lot of walking to do.The problem is that even with the limited mechanics it could perhaps make up for it in immersion or atmosphere? But it doesn't really, other than a pretty decent score. I don't know anything more about me or my mission in the last 3 hours than I learned in the trailer. It hasn't developed any character or given me a reason to give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about anyone. But it's called Lifeless Planet, so you think the planet would be the star, but it's just such a boring place to be. The story itself has been pretty meh so far, and the collectables dull so finding things isn't a reward, and generally it takes so long to trek anywhere off the path that you won't want to bother.And what's the point of the oxygen mechanic exactly? You're running low! Quick, get to the container that's really close and probably on the main path!Fantastic trailer though.			"

												Atmospheric and enrapturing are how I would describe Lifeless Planet. It's not perfect, such as some of the platforming parts feeling a bit iffy, but it feeds you just enough of the story and sets itself up at just such a pace as to make it easy to lose an hour or two in one sitting. And while I wouldn't put it under horror or anything, turning off the lights during the darker parts of the game really enhances the experience, in my opinion.It's a little short (there's an achievement for beating it in less than 4 hours and an achievement for playing it for longer than 10 hours) but its come down to sub-$10 before so snipe it for sure if you see it, otherwise check the trailer and make the $20 call yourself.

												8/10 Actual playtime: 7h 45m*Extremely underrated game. It's a very interesting and unique experience, and unlike most desolate-walking-simulators (e.g. Gone Home or Dear Esther), this one has abundant gameplay and interactivity. Length is perfect - not too long, not too short. The main things to improve (and I hear the developer is working on a major update) are the save system and a few control bugs which can make it difficult to move in some places. The atmospheric music and map design round this up into a very good game.* The ""hrs on record"" is totally wrong. I had this game minimized while I was away for extended time (I find minimizing better than saving). Steam really should count gametime only when the game has focus. If you have this issue and want to learn how much times game actually take you to finish, use Gameplay Time Tracker (which I started using after seeing these odd game times).			"

Frustrating. There are other bugs that are apparent too. Really wanted to love this game...........but I can't. It is not hard just frustrating.

												It's pretty for something with low requirements.The game play, if that's what you call it, is fairly bad. Think Crash Bandicoot 1 only in a larger space. Fiddly controls like nobody's business. It's like if the Mario Brothers had an uncoordinated cousin playing their own platformer on Mars. Few games are as rail roaded as this one. If it was a movie, it'd play exactly the same, only it'd take less time and you wouldn't be constantly annoyed by how bad the platforming is.The worst part, tho, is that 3 minutes into the game you know it's going to be several hours of beating you over the head about saving the environment. And then, yes, it's several hours of beating you over the head about saving the environment.If you thought Avatar was a good story, this is for you. If you thought Avatar was done better when it was Fern Gully, this game is not for you. If you thought playing Super Mario Bros with half a controller and a stick in one eye - this game is perfect for you.But hey, it's kinda pretty.			"

								Even tho its an early access...I think I've seen enough. Feels more like $4.99.Story and overall concept is excellent. Unfotunatelly it follows  a point to point linearity that I personally hate. Not to mention the controls are wack. Standard WASD config is flawed by A+D being tied to the camera, so walking and strafing is not going to happen. Making it annoying to traverse the map. The biggest problem is what I feared tho, you are left with no options on where to go, deviating from the path with only lead you to a wall or fence leaving you no option but to stick eagerly to the destignated route. Big disappointment for me, I really had high hopes for this one.  "

												There's an achievement for beating it in less than 4 hours, so you know it goes quick. However, it is still a beautiful, sad tale. I'd say there's at least a little bit of replayability, not just for the achievements, but to make sure you hear the whole story due to way it is told through finding research and journals.			"

												A suprisingly good game for the price nice little indie game to casualy play now and then. Some nice little early plot twists keep the momentum going and i found its story appeal to be similiar to Spec Ops: The Line in that its story was very developed and kept you wanting more. Not the most mind blowing graphics but the stroy and atmosphere make up for that.			"

												I really enoyed this game.  Not terribly hard, but it's nice to have a game that isn't ridiculously challenging as well.  The story was very good and intriguing, but seemed to lose some steam towards the end.  Beatiful visuals and awesome soundtrack.  All the voice actors were amazing.  All in all, a really well done indie game.			"

												I am yet to find any challenge in this game. You follow a pretty predetermined path, you can roam for ages and then when you are in close proximity to an oxygen tank, you must sprint dash to reach it before you run out! Also, I prefer to zoom all the way in for my view, but after any cutscene or action (engaging a switch) it defaults back to zoom all the way out. Nice game though, I DO keep playing, which says a lot!			"

												This is one of those games that make me wish there was a ""middle-of-the-road"" option rather than a simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down. Given that I have more good things to say about the game than bad, I suppose it deserves a recommendation.From the first time I saw the game's trailer and screenshots, it looked interesting. An atmospheric puzzle game where a lot of the entertainment came from exploring the world and finding the clues that help explain what really happened on this planet. And it's got plenty of that, from scientific studies your character does of the geology around him and the documents left over by the vanished inhabitants of the planet. In the beginning, that alone kept me trekking across the endless wastes.There are some issues, however. First of all, the controls themselves are tight enough. Moving your character is a bit awkward for anyone who has played most first- or third-person games on a keyboard. Instead of strafing with the A and D keys, your character will turn themselves in that direction. This means you have to stop and turn the camera with the mouse any time you want to look around the landscape; if you try to do this while moving, you'll be fighting the character's shuddering urge to turn rather than keep moving linearly.Your suit also comes with a short burst of gas that allows for something of a stunted double-jump. Every other platforming game I've played in the past allows you to correct yourself mid-jump, even if only slightly. In Lifeless Planet, once you've jumped, you're entirely committed to it. The majority of times I've failed a jumping puzzle in this game was due to thinking I needed a little extra mustard to reach the next platform.. and instead watching helplessly as my astronaut barely misses the far edge - and then it's another jog all the way around to the start of the section, if you haven't otherwise plummeted to your death.There's one last downside I can mention about this game. At different points throughout your journey, the game will inform you that you're running low on oxygen and that you need to find some way to top yourself back off. Similarly, there are occasional tanks of gas that boosts your suit's jumping capability from a single short burst to seven larger ones, allowing for higher or longer jumps.The only problem I have with either of these mechanics is that they are entirely plot-centric - the only time you'll ever run out of either is when the developer decided that you should. If you're running low on oxygen, there will definitely be a reserve supply somewhere within jogging distance. If the game tells you that you've run out of jump gas, it's only because you won't need it for the next section of the level. Rather than allowing for an interesting mechanic which would force a player to keep track of the nearest oxygen and jump-gas containers, it simply ends up feeling more artificial. When my suit would randomly decide it was out of jump gas even when I hadn't tried to jump in a minute or two, it broke some of the immersion.Final Verdict: If you like atmospheric and investigative games, and you don't mind having to wrangle some awkward control issues and the occasional unintuitive puzzle, then this might be the game for you. It somewhat reminds me of the old LucasArts game ""The Dig,"" though I've personally never played it (I did read the book, though - yes, someone wrote a novelization of a point-and-click adventure game). Even then, I'd suggest picking it up when it's on sale rather than at full price.			"

There are a couple challenging areas, so it's not exactly a fly through game. The challenges are actually fun to get if you can find yourself willing to die in everyway possible. The ending is what you make of it. And watch the short ending after the credits...wait for it...wait for it! Overall great game.			"

												Unfortunatly, nearly every aspect of this game, from the visuals, to the story, to the sound editing, leaves something to be desired.  However, I still enjoyed making my way through the vast environments and discovering what this game was all about.  While the idea of a planet exploration game seems like it could be rather easy to pull off,  Lifeless Planet proves that it  is  easy to pull off, but difficult to make it very good.  Yes, it is easy to make everything tan, and yes, it is easy to arrange a bunch of rocks to make a jumping puzzle.  However, it is difficult to contain the player in a space without just surrounding him with cliffs, and it is difficult not to keep giving the player the same problem to solve over and over.  Even though no aspect of this game sticks out except for the general idea itself, it's still good, but leaves plenty of room for improvement.			"

												If you like Heavy Rain type games or ""The Dig"", and you like Sci-Fi you will probably like this, and think it falls under the Genre Game-Film or Story-Game.I took my time when playing, exploring, dieing a fair bit and enjoying the game rather than rushing through - although despite this still did not find all historic documents or gems (achievements). Most of the puzzles are simple but rather than go away and think about the few times I got stuck, I did watch help videos. The playthrough lasted about 8 Hours.The only disapointment is there is only one ending and one way to play the story. It would have been nice if you could have made a few different choices, perhaps resulting in different endings (like The Dig which had a couple of different video cutscenes depending on choices made in the game).The game has little replay value, but most indie games I have been playing recently have also had set storylines (like Papers, Please), and buying this for less than the RRP in the Humble Sale, it was worth what i paid.I may play through the game again at some point, even though it will be the same and much like watching a film, playing a game like this for the first time is more enjoyable - although I will probably play the game with an erection the next time around to make it more interesting.The visuals are good as is the story (but perhaps a little weak in a few places). I enjoyed it and if you see it in a sale its worth getting.			"

												Lifeless Planet, where to begin?A brilliant game for the gamers who love free-roam style adventure games with lots of twists and turns in story line as well as scenery. I would definitely reccommend this game for those people who want to take a break from the FPS' and play an exceedingly well thought out game. The one and only downside I feel is that you can get lost rather easiley in some terrains and it takes a lot of time to get from one place to another, however this is pardoned by the games beautiful graphics.- System_Start			"

												I couldn't recommend this game. I had gone into it with an open mind, sci-fi being one of my penultimately favourite genres of story, and Lifeless Planet looked just like something I had been waiting for.The story was interesting, but far too slowly told to keep my interest throughout my playthrough. There is too little substance and information in the datalogs you find, spreading the plot out too thin as you explore. Virtually everything you need to know plot-wise is told within the first half-hour or so into the game, and you find little to no closure until the very end. The gameplay is in focus more than the story at many points, and the gameplay its self is nothing to write home about.While it does have a great ambiance, especially several stages near the beginning, it quickly boils itself down to two different elements of play: running forward and jumping for the platform sections, and finding a way to move an object from one place to another to trigger an event or operate a machine. Virtually the entire game feels like it plays out in these two ways with little variation in an attempt to keep it interesting. Bugs were also prominent in my playthrough, having had to restart on several occasions due to getting stuck in the landscape and clipping errors that prevented me from completing important plot puzzles until I reloaded a previous save.The landscapes are definitely striking on occasion, in particular the scenes in the beginning of the destroyed, sand-covered Russian colony. But much to my dismay they too quickly broke down into little more than arrays of high cliffs and barren valleys. While an effective way to portray a 'Lifeless Planet', it gave very little to look at or take in which is something I would have hoped to occur since the gameplay leaves you running forward for a vast majority of the game.The sound design is alright. The low tones of the cello really do accent your...loneliness and the lifelessness of the planet, but the music is almost negligable as it often disappears beyond the background noise and SFX. The Russian voiceovers in the data logs are a welcome addition though!Ultimately though, I would definitely NOT recommend Lifeless Planet. In my eyes the price tag of something is dependent on how much fufillment I get from a game (I had no problem paying $15 for Journey even though it had only a two hour playtime). Lifeless Planet should be a budget $5-$10 game at most but $20 is FAR too steep for this game. Get it on sale if it appeals to you, because I can't see it being worth the steep price point towards most players.			"

												I can't recommend this game, nor can I finish playing it. So if there's some gold at the end, I missed it. This review is based on playing about halfway through.Lifeless planet lacks any fair challenge. The only way I died between starting and where I gave up were ""unfair"" deaths - rocks with textures that made them look closer than they were, touched hitboxes, surprise kills. The grabber hand starts to hint at challenge, but it never gets there. Puzzlewise, the challenge comes from things not.. going... quite... in the right slot. You have crippling clumsiness.The pacing is way too slow for my taste. If you can admire 2-3 textures for the 5 minute run each level puts you past them, you will simply love this game, but for me the novelty of each area was far shorter than the time spent there. (which was generally a very long time)The levels are designed poorly. The leading tactics are mostly brute force, there is little elegance, and if you ever miss a hint, you are in for a two way run past those textures.The novel stuff (notes, gems, collectibles) are sometimes hidden along pathways. Most of the time, the hidden places are just obvious _long_ paths around a corner, with a dip at the end to make sure you run all the way down there. Past the textures. Again.The models are terrible. Not like, ""this one here is bad"" but they're such a mismatched incohesive jumble, with scaling broken and artificial environments in particular feeling ""wrong"". Also there one point (you'll know it by the stutter) where a random ultra high poly model is used a few times. Oh, and it's meant to be a dramtic moment, but the stutter ruins that.Generally annoying little things... the voiceover prevent you reading with their volume (they're russian), the female is... broken, physically, and the camera and control system do not favour admiring the vistas (the character tries to follow the camera, so you can't run while looking sideways). Oh, and between levels sometimes there is immersion destroying catastrophic change in scenery. Like, what just happened on that load screen? There's also way too much ""scripting"" here for me. Exploration of a lifeless planet? You _are_ on the rails.Now to finish on the good stuff.The music was pretty nice. If levels weren't so very damn big and empty, the concept might be nice too. The story might also hold some tiny bit of interest, but the text was hard to trawl through, especially with mr russian voice talking over it.I would recommend this only as a reference to make discussion on. There's nothing much to really enjoy and no grand experience to take away.			"

												You land on another planet .... all alone (- this game can only be exciting, you might think). Then you start to walk around the ""strange"" planet, where it all pretty soon shows that things are not as expected (SURPRISE!) ... Though with that said, it is a liniar game - you do not have the possibility to choose A or B, at some points, and despite the world is pretty big, you can pretty soon see, that a specific path is designed for you, and the world actually isn't that big after all.I think, if you really have the patience to complete the game, that you are most likely to get all achievements, since, as said, you don't really have any freedom to do as you please, but you just have to do the right things to progress.If you complete it, you will never play it again.

												Fascinating but mostly frustratingA story-centered platform-puzzle game. The music and overall creative direction including story grew on me especially towards the ending. Might've been that it was apparent that soon I wouldn't have to deal with the the awfully frustrating design decisions anymore – like the platforming/controls/terrain often feeling like pure b-s. The game left a sense of not knowing what it'd like to be – freeroaming exploration with vast areas that gets old too quickly, mixed with linear path-highlighting that suddenly disappears – and the backtracking, I mean come on.So, this game really is a mixed bag; I found myself hating it, getting frustrated, bored – it felt like a god damn running simulator more that once – then all of a sudden I was immersed by the suggestive combination of music, voice-acting, story and world design. Because of this, I can't say I regret playing through the whole thing. Is it worth 20 bucks? Nope, more like 5-10.			"

Be prepared to immerse yourself into the 6 different textures of the same enviornment. Follow a non-existing storyline, random deaths, cutscenes that spawns you in unknown locations and getting stuck in between rocks. Furthermore, but I do reserve myself to this only being a MAC issue, but pressing any of the numberkeys will drop the character into an oblivion and the game needs a restart.			"

												I wish the review system had a middle option between tumbs-up and thumbs-down. I would use it here.I love the atmosphere, and to start with that's all the game is: exploring a strange place, and piecing together what's happened. It's geninely creepy, which I wasn't expecting. It's also beautiful. There are puzzles, though they're not the focus and they're not difficult (for the most part), they just add something to the exploration.So why am I so mixed? Because there are so many frustrations: sometimes, arbitrarily, you suddenly run out of air and have to quickly dash for an air tank, despite having been told you have 8 hours of air left a mere half-hour earlier. A confusing section where everything is pointing that you should go one way, when you actually have to step off a cliff and go around the back. Sometimes things kill you when you're already out of range. I finally gave-up when I repeatedly failed a tricky platforming section where the platforms try to kill you, and I kept missing the platforms because the controls are so floaty.I would have forgiven it and carried on, were it not for that last platforming bit. Still, I got it in a bundle, and for that price, it was worth it.			"

												Interesting story - this is the best reason to play I can think of.I'd recommend it if someone is into platforming play - jump from platform to platform.  Timing of taps starts easy enough and builds up a bit as you progress.  Otherwise the play isn't that interesting.There's no save point just before you do a set so if it's a death drop - you'll end up running back to the spot, at times via a set of jumps... To then try it again...  That can be rather frustrating.It's not an overly complex game to play but you really do need to be into the platforming style to enjoy the actual play - otherwise it's for the story but that is very nicely done.

												Jetpack simulator 2014. In Lifeless planet, play as Buzz Lightyear on a quest to restore the planet... sorta. It mostly functions as a wide ranged 3D platformer. Easy (but not terrible) puzzles.With all due respect, this game is very good. The atmosphere is well made. However, I wouldnt call the game as a whole a $20 game, im glad i got it on a sale for $8. The story is what I most wanted out of it given the premese of life on a lifeless planet. In a way it delivered, i liked it. I wont tell the developers how to do their job, but i felt like it could use more detail on the story. Everything happens sorta quickely and sometimes seems odd. Other than that, really liked this game, but its really short for what you pay for. It also seems odd to have an acheivment wanting you to finish the game in under 4 hours. Thats sort of a bad sign for how long the game is... and also having achievments for dying certain ways and another one for not dying. I guess im just nitpicking though. The game is good. Id just prefer people wait untill its on sale rather than feel ripped off.			"

												WOW!!!! I bought this game on sale and still I wish I hadn't. There are no puzzles, there is no mystery, you just follow a green trail, slowly, and painstakingly, across a bunch of nothing. You get tid bits of a story here and there, and when your done, you just sit there and say, ""Wow, was that it, is that the whole story... and why did he keep talking about his wife?"". The story honestly consists of about 4-5 paragraphs. So five hrs of walking through a desert, to learn what can be told in just a few paragraphs, and not long ones either mind you! So ya, sure, buy the game if you want to spend your money on walking.... litteraly, walking. OK, OK, a chimp probably couldn't beat the game, but I'd bet 1K$ a five year old could!			"

												It's honest. It is indeed a walking simulator...but at least you have failure state (99.9% of the time being a gravity-induced face-plant). But that's not to say this game isn't worth your time, even if you've watched a let's play. In fact, there is an acheivement for a zero-death first time walkthrough, which unfortunately means you almost certainly MUST watch a let's play to even stand a chance. I myself never died due to the primary 'adversaries' (no spoilers, I just decided not to touch anything I didn't have to), but boy did gravity decide to rear its ugly head again, and was the bane of my existance.It's little bit unfair of an acheivement, but at least it's one of those achievements where if you see someone has 100% achievements completed in every game they've ever played, and that zero-death first-runthrough achievement is among them, you can safely say they modded.It has a pretty good story, and that's pretty much it. There are puzzle and plateforming elements, but never anything that will end your playthrough. What it is really is an interactive movie, basically. But there is good news, which might sell you on it: There is absolutely no quick time events (QTEs). However, the game story dictates when or when not to use a jet pack, and when you do or don't need oxygen.  There are no meters, and you cannot refill when you want to. In the case of the oxygen, you don't ever need to refill unless the game finds it necessary for the plot.I don't think the majority of people would actually find this game boring...especially when there is an achievement to encounter every morbid death in the game. I haven't tried that yet, but I think I will now that I've completed the game not touching anything. Now I'll touch everything...that poor astronaut...All and all, I suppose you can some up the game with this phrase, when you reach the end: ""Well, this is going to be one heck of a debriefing...""

For me, the gameplay was ""okay"". + Visuals+ Voice Acting+ Storyline+ Initial immerision in the vast landscape (got old by the end)- Glitchy at times, but not enough to pull out my hair- Seems hollow somehow (mostly wandering around and following story)- There isn't not much in this game to do except perform jumps and 1/2 dozen or so puzzlesOverall, I would recommend the game for Walking Sim & on Atmospheric merits. However, I don't see this as an Adventure, Puzzle, nor Platform title.			"

												A puzzle platformer where the puzzling and platforming are secondary to the story and exploration elements.Don't expect amazing gameplay here or even much of a challenge beyond some tough jumps, but where the game really shines is in the story.  Both the plot and the way it is revealed are executed extremely well, leaving out enough detail for you to piece together your own conclusions but not leaving you confused or lost.  The soundtrack by Rich Douglas astounds as well, and adds to the mysterious and sometime treacherous atmosphere.My first playthrough was around 7 hours, I could have been quicker but I got to see almost everything there is to see in that time.

												You just crashed on some unkown planet which was supposed to be habitable for human kind.Without any signs of your ship srew members you follow some tracks in sand on totally deserted planet.No oxygen. No ecosystem suitable for humans. You just follow tracks when abandoned willage appears on horizont ...Well, game is really good, not only due to fact one person did al the work (plus one musician). It has really strong atmosphere, i found myself maybe too much in game very often ;). Confused mind with tons of thoughts drifting my mind - why? Who? How? Where? You just simply can't predict the story in this game. And i found pretty scary being maybe only living person on abandoned planet with all of those signs of abandoned human activity years ago.So much for positive things about this piece.When i've heard about game for a first time and saw some screenshots i felt it like Dear Esther in sci-fi setting. DE was ""walking simulator"" with strong and graduating story and i liked it. But in Lifeless Planet ss you play game from some point it starts looking just like some concept of larger future game. By both story and gameplay. There are nice mechanisms like supercharging your jetpack so you can do really long jumps across canyons and craters. Need of refilling your oxygen is also fine. But those mechanisms are just bonded to certain levels. I can imagine to do maps a bit opened giving player some possibility of choice to take certain path. Unfortunately game has really tight corridors (but tries to pretend opposite). I loved one of last levels by the volcano, it was real challenge to find right way through it :).Graphics is average, some places look beautiful (thermal springs level or volcano were fantasic), as it is in Unity engine it would run fast even on ancient machines. Noticed rapid fps drops under 30-25fps (by eye) is some areas mostly for no reason on my i5 4670, GTX 970, which is able run such things in hundreds fps at 1080p with some decent AA (as Unity is performance low-demanding engine).Music is nice and i could listen to such nice and atmospheric music for whole gameplay, unfortunately there are certain spots in levels where music plays, otherwise not. Also walking on different materials like sand, rock, metal, wood etc. doesn't chande sound of footsteps. Come on, we are in 21st century :)Conclusion:Very nice strong-atmosphere 3rd person platformer. Be warned as gameplay looks like walk, walk, walk, walk ... walk, jump, push some button or something like that, jump, walk, walk, walk, walk ... etc. Jetpack ftw. Not bad for 5€ and not bad as game was developed by single person. Story could be a bit richier.6/10			"

It's nice to see an indie dev make a platformer that is not retro 2D.  It is very atmospheric, and the story is engaging enough for at least one playthrough.

												The game is too repetitive, all you do is walk and jump with the occasional pick/drop of objects.  There is a really bad bug on the game, if by mistake you press any of the numeric keys in your keyboard, the character resets it location to a place outside the map.  If you are lucky to die from the fall outside the map it will return back to the game.  Right after if you attempt to use the robotic arm on an object, the robotic arm disjoints itself and begins moving all over the place on its own, you have to wait about a minute for the arm to connect itself together and be able to use it. The game is fun for about the first 5 minutes, but after playing the game for 5 hours, the level of repetitiveness and boringness it was too much for me.  I had to end up returning the game.			"

												Lifeless Planet is a very nice game where you are an astronaut that went on a journey to some planet.Pros:- Beautiful Enviroment- Well themed songs- Cool Story- Nice puzzles  (they may not be hard, but they surely are not the main purpose of the game either)- Contemplative game feelingCons:- Has some texture glitches (which at first I think its nice, but only if the dev's explore it, and it does'nt happen)- If you get tired of walking on games, this game may not be for youI would like to say that the game needs a LOT more easter eggs than it has right now, that would be on the ""cons"" too but I say that specifically to the textures glitches. There are so many places that you can go, and almost nothing happens when you go there. Ok, the game wasn't designed to have anything there, but the dev's really need to reconsider this. Because mainly you are able to reach certain places, and those places are not only random places, I'm talking about buildings, mountains and there is NOTHING on those spots.But, anyways, I recommend this game because indeed it is a very good game. I enjoyed playing it, took me around 5-6 hours to beat it. I don't think it needed to be longer, doesn't make any sense to say that, considering the story and all the stuff happening, it is good the way it is.The most impressive thing about this game I'd say it's the exploration of the planet. If you like contemplative games, and like I said if you don't get bored of walking (endless walking btw) this game is for you. You move, as default you run wasd, if you press shift you walk. You can jump and you have a jet pack which sometimes get a boost. You also have a mechanic arm for certain puzzles.It is a must have item for Contemplative Games List. (y)			"

												Lifeless Planet's goal is similar to that of many ""walking simulators"", but its execution is what sets it apart.The game's emphasis is on telling the story of a world and providing the player an immersive experience through the environment and atmosphere. However, this is punctuated by segments of 3D platforming, with the use of a burst jet pack, and puzzle solving. The base platforming, with a single jet burst available, is simple and serves to make traversal of regions more interesting that only walking. The occasions in which multiple bursts are provided are more challenging, and sometimes thrilling. Timing the multiple bursts to provide just the right height and/or distance to reach the next platform is tense, even moreso when you're looking down into a vast crevase below you.Puzzlesolving is relatively straightforward and repetitive, with the real highlights being the brief platforming segments sometimes provided.But the real focus of the game are the story of the world and the story of your character. The world's story is told in pieces given every 10 to 20 minutes as you discover areas, clear areas, and solve puzzles. Areas provide the geographic history of the planet through minerals and the human story on the world through documents, audio logs, and structures. Atmosphere is crucial to this with setpieces and haunting string and synth tracks to set the mood for each area.Presentation of the story is well done. The story pieces are slowly presented and several times lead the player to assume what has happened to the planet before a new piece of information causes you to look at all of the previous information in a different light. You progress under this view as newer pieces seem to back it, when another new piece of information causes you to reconsider all of the prior information once again. This occurs a few times to great success without it feeling as though the developer has pulled it out of nowhere.TL;DR - If you like walking simulators you'll probably like Lifeless Planet. If you haven't tried a walking simulator before then Lifeless Planet is a good starting point.			"

												I found this game to be such a huge disappointment because it always made me feel like it was building up for some huge grand finalie. All the way up to the end of the last cutscene I was expecting something. Everytime I thought some sort of plot climax was going to show up, nothing happened. I figured that it was getting me excited and building up for something really shocking or worth 4 hours of my life, but everytime I was disappointed. It's as though this story completely skipped the climax and the falling action. It just went from rising action to resolution. If you want a game with a great story, Half Life (any game or episode is great), any Bioshock game, or even Minecraft has a better story than this game. tl;dr: It is a decent game but the story left a lot to be desired.

Starts out promisingly enough but squanders the atmosphere (boom boom!) quite quickly, devolving into a repetative, fiddly and rather contrived experience. Arbitrary game mechanics that come and go, a surprisingly uninvolving story combined with lacklustre visuals and sound make for a fairly lifeless experience. It also manages to be the only game I've played recently when I've actually been bored. Completing felt like a chore finally ticked off the 'to-do' list.There's a twinkle of an interesting idea in there somewhere but I don't think this makes the best of it unfortunately.			"

												The game is alright I guess. Kinda interesting (although easy) platforming, prety scenery, great concept... it just fell through in the story aspect in my opinion. I felt the game was trying to feel like it was a huge, lonely, massive expanse (which would have been GREAT) but then it just gets linear. The story could have been much better, I was hoping for a haunting story that would make me want to press on to find out what happened.. but I instead found myself grinding to progress, more interested in just moving on than finding out information. I stopped in the middle of my playthrough (only 3 hours... I game for much longer than that normally) because I got tired of all the mindless travling.Has great promise, but if you are hoping for something on par with games like Gone Home, this isn't your cup of tea.

												First and foremost, for how simple this game is, it's been one of the best single player games on steam that I've played. While the controls can be a little clunky, especially when you're in one of the platforming areas of the game they arn't game breaking, The visuals and music in the game are stunningly beautiful and I can easily see myself playing this game several times over. I have to give a big thumbs up to the guy that made this game. It was delightfully original, fun and beautiful. So in conclusion I give this game a hearty 10/10 and look forward to playing it again.			"

												I got this game of a Steam Auction... So I didn't really pay for it and thank god I didn't.Not gonna lie here, this game isn't for everyone. It's like something mashed to be one thing but turns out to be a completely different thing. It's nice that game makes you go WTF... But here you might go WTF about the WTF... Meaning the twists they tried to create are more likely to get you confused rather than trully shocked and surprised. "

												I wish the review system had a middle option between tumbs-up and thumbs-down. I would use it here.I love the atmosphere, and to start with that's all the game is: exploring a strange place, and piecing together what's happened. It's geninely creepy, which I wasn't expecting. It's also beautiful. There are puzzles, though they're not the focus and they're not difficult (for the most part), they just add something to the exploration.So why am I so mixed? Because there are so many frustrations: sometimes, arbitrarily, you suddenly run out of air and have to quickly dash for an air tank, despite having been told you have 8 hours of air left a mere half-hour earlier. A confusing section where everything is pointing that you should go one way, when you actually have to step off a cliff and go around the back. Sometimes things kill you when you're already out of range. I finally gave-up when I repeatedly failed a tricky platforming section where the platforms try to kill you, and I kept missing the platforms because the controls are so floaty.I would have forgiven it and carried on, were it not for that last platforming bit. Still, I got it in a bundle, and for that price, it was worth it.			"

												Interesting story - this is the best reason to play I can think of.I'd recommend it if someone is into platforming play - jump from platform to platform.  Timing of taps starts easy enough and builds up a bit as you progress.  Otherwise the play isn't that interesting.There's no save point just before you do a set so if it's a death drop - you'll end up running back to the spot, at times via a set of jumps... To then try it again...  That can be rather frustrating.It's not an overly complex game to play but you really do need to be into the platforming style to enjoy the actual play - otherwise it's for the story but that is very nicely done.

												Jetpack simulator 2014. In Lifeless planet, play as Buzz Lightyear on a quest to restore the planet... sorta. It mostly functions as a wide ranged 3D platformer. Easy (but not terrible) puzzles.With all due respect, this game is very good. The atmosphere is well made. However, I wouldnt call the game as a whole a $20 game, im glad i got it on a sale for $8. The story is what I most wanted out of it given the premese of life on a lifeless planet. In a way it delivered, i liked it. I wont tell the developers how to do their job, but i felt like it could use more detail on the story. Everything happens sorta quickely and sometimes seems odd. Other than that, really liked this game, but its really short for what you pay for. It also seems odd to have an acheivment wanting you to finish the game in under 4 hours. Thats sort of a bad sign for how long the game is... and also having achievments for dying certain ways and another one for not dying. I guess im just nitpicking though. The game is good. Id just prefer people wait untill its on sale rather than feel ripped off.			"

												WOW!!!! I bought this game on sale and still I wish I hadn't. There are no puzzles, there is no mystery, you just follow a green trail, slowly, and painstakingly, across a bunch of nothing. You get tid bits of a story here and there, and when your done, you just sit there and say, ""Wow, was that it, is that the whole story... and why did he keep talking about his wife?"". The story honestly consists of about 4-5 paragraphs. So five hrs of walking through a desert, to learn what can be told in just a few paragraphs, and not long ones either mind you! So ya, sure, buy the game if you want to spend your money on walking.... litteraly, walking. OK, OK, a chimp probably couldn't beat the game, but I'd bet 1K$ a five year old could!			"

												This isn't so much a game as it is an interactive storybook that you follow along with.  It's a lot of fun to get lost in for a few hours, especially if you enjoy sci-fi.  There is not much gameplay here, but the simple platforming and jumping I found to be decent and I liked that the game lets you go at your own pace.  Price is a little steep, and the story itself isn't really fleshed out to the extent I was expecting it to be, so throw it on your wish list and buy it on sale.			"

												ProsCool concept and the story ultimately held my interest. “Space jumping” plays into the gameplay and was oddly enjoyable. Game isn’t a 90-hour epic, and the story felt original. Appreciated that there is a Mac version to play.ConsHowever, the the pace slows down at the end. There is a narrative thread involving an interviewer that seemed unnecessary. I experienced some majorly choppy graphics near the end.Perhaps the biggest problem was that in several areas (near the end of the game) I got quite lost. Even more frustrating, it seemed like the game was leading you in certain directions (landscape color, lights, other affordances) when it actually wasn’t. Several times I begrudgingly looked up a walkthrough only to the find the person struggled with the exact same issues I did.			"

												I paid $5 for the game, and it took about 3 1/2 hours to beat, and my feelings on a game are tempered by how much commitment it took for me to play the game. I really enjoyed this game, I know there are those who hate it, but I think their expectations were off. Lifeless Planet is a kickstarter game, pretty much made by 1 dude. I had some glitches (the quit button didn't work, puzzles don't reset on a respawn. This rarely matters, but some puzzles involve green balls, and I did lose all of the green balls. But it wasn't hard to start a new game at that stage, and it didn't cost me too much time.I found the platforming and puzzles to be fun, and the puzzles were mostly simple.The focus is the story -- why isn't this planet covered in life (like the space agency said it would be), and why is there a Russian passport and powerlines here? Who is that girl? etc. I found the story to be interesting, and most of the answers satisfying (but not all). [But to be fair: How often does a AAA title have a 100% perfect story]But this was a fun palate cleanser after some AAA titles.			"

												I would've recommended this game if it was a bit shorter and had a more refind jumping mechanic.Whilst the storyline was somewhat flaky I enjoyed it; the whole premise behind the game was interesting to me.The backstory into the main character was really interesting and sad!Graphics were nice and the music was really well done, puzzles were nice but a tad on the easy side.The major downfall to this game was the controls when it came to jumping. I would spend a lot of frustrating time trying to clear a section of tedious jumps only to have my character decide not to run as fast as he was or overshoot the thing or undershoot it when he was fine before. I'd fall and have to start again. Sometimes if you mess up because of it you just die and the somewhat dodgey save system would set you back further away.I had to completely quit the game at one point to reset an elevator that got stuck half way and so I couldn't get up to it, reloading the ""last checkpoint"" didn't do anything.Also there is a lot of aimless wondering, it's not that bad as you can take the time to enjoy the seneary but then again when you've failed a jump multiple times all you want to do is get this thing finished.There were a few times when the way wasn't all that clear (mainly my fault) but coupled with the bad jumps it was frustrating at times.I wouldnt recommend it at the current price, if it was to go on sale then by all means try it out. I should mention I played using the keyboard and mouse so that may have had a negative impact on gameplay as it seems to support a controller.If you love platforming then by all means pick it up, I'm terribly into those types of games and got it without knowing it was going to consist of a lot of platforming.

												This is an expertly crafted little game set on a beautifully rendered alien planet.  The game mechanics themselves are relatively simple: explore, find things, solve puzzles, don't fall to your death etc.  But what sets this game apart for me is the storyline, delivered a little at a time as you progress through the game, leaving you to work out what is going on, and what it means to you.  Similar in style to Ico, or Shadow of the Colossus, I found this incredibly rewarding to play.Whilst completing this game is relatively simple, it looks like there are some achievements here for the truely hardcore gamer, that seem like you can only get them on your first play-through, namely completing the game in under four hours on your first playthrough, and completing the game without dying on your first playthrough.  As an indication, my first playthrough took over 9 hours (I'm a stickler for exploring the entire map and finding everything possible) and I died *very many* times.If you like science fiction and or Christopher Nolan films, I'm sure you'll enjoy this game.

												I am not finished with this game yet, but I have to say I have thoroughly enjoyed every minute so far.  It is a simple game play, not much more to do than a little bit of jumping and figuring out where to go next, but the atmosphere and simplicity and the pace are quite fitting for the storyline.  To be honest, the only time I find myself jarred back into remembering this is just a game is when somehow it knows exactly when my extra jetpack fuel runs out...  just at the end of all the big jumps.  Other than that though, I have really enjoyed it a lot so far.  I did not pay full price for this, I got it from Humble Bundle, so I do recommend waiting for a sale.  I think most games are kinda way over priced for the content these days, but if you watch and get it on sale and you like a bit of a slow paced, unfolding story, then you will enjoy it.  I think it actually has more to do than Dear Esther, but to me, it has the same lonely and sometimes very disturbed feel.			"

												i really didn't like ""dear esther"" and was skeptical when i saw lifeless planet, worried that it was a similar game, and in some ways it is.  However, being a long time fallout and post apocalyptic genre fan, the wilderness of an unknown planet appealed to the more morbidly-curious side of my personality.  The music in the game pretty much makes it, the composer did a fantastic job.  The story itself, wow. just amazing, i'm not often moved by much, and i'm not saying i teared up when i completed the game, but it was just wonderful, there is no let down at the end, no loose ends (none that bothered me anyway).  do yourself a favour and buy this game, it's an experience.

												Do NOT buy this game.  It was kickstarted and and it is expected that during development there will be bugs.  But now it is supposedly ""Full Release"".  Sorry , but bugs which prevent you from continuing on after you die are not small issues.  That is lazy/greedy on the part of the developer.  Shame on you for releasing this as ""Full Release"".  Just bought it today, June 22 and one of the major bugs has supposedly been fixed in 1.2 update...but not so. And that isn't even the worst bug.  I died in the Chasm..and then restart I am not visible.  It's like the camera is in the wrong place. I can hear footsteps..I can hear jetpack..but it is like I am trapped under the earth or behind a ridge and the camera can't see me.  All I can do is move about until I die again an then it starts me in another position like that(repeat 100 times trying to get a good starting position back).  Ok..that's messed up..I'll just go back to last checkpoint.  No can do..welcome back to the beginning of the research facility like 20-30 minutes of gamplay ago.    Once again...""Full Release""??? Is this a joke.  STILL a rip off at 15 bucks!EDIT:  Updated my review once the breaking bugs were released for me.  This was a while ago,  but just got around to logging on to steam again.  Once fixed, the game was fully playable and a great joy to play.  Not completely polished graphics/game mechanics wise, but so what..story, environment, and creativity are what compel me to games like this.  The retro/alternate history Soviet theme was very original.  Well told, well executed after a few hiccups.  I would love to play another immersive ambient story like this..with perhaps different game mechanics just for the sake of not repeating myself.			"

												These are the times i wished there was more than a ""yes or no"" recommend. The game runs fine, i didn't experience any bugs, and has a decent story. The trailer was great and i wanted to buy it. However, they game is extremly slow paced. from the start to the almost end of the game there almost seems like no reason to continue because it is completely un interesting. This is ine of those times where indie games try to draw themselves out because they feel let are too short i feel like. It took me 4 hours to play through it, i firmly believe a 1.5 hour or 2 hour game time would have worked out better to keep the pacing of the story line interesting. I would recommend this game, but only at a $1-$3 range on a sale. I would not recommend buying it if you have to pay the full price.			"

But what caught my attention initaly was the enviorment design, for what they had to work with they managed to make a truly beautiful envirment, even at its most desolate it still is great to look at. The gameplay is tight and does what it needs to do, and the puzzles may start out easy but later on they require alot of paitents. From what i saw of this game through previews the stoyr was FAR better then expected. While alot of it may be told through text, combinding the text with the evniorment it still comes across very well. This game is a great game, get it when you have the chance, you wont regret it.

												Incredible.  This game is excellent.  Immersive, emotional, and surprising.  The gameplay is simple and engaging.  The story is compelling, but also sparse and not intrusive.  There is plenty of empty space, as there should be in a game where you are a lone astronaut on a desolate planet.I found the puzzles to be the perfect amount of challenging.  I got stuck a few times, but never reached an infuriating level of frustration.  I felt a true sense of reward upon figuring something out.Lifeless Planet is a very linear game.  I actually found this to be quite refreshing.  Compared to today's sandbox, procedural, open-ended games, this one stands tall in its assertiveness.  Even though there is usually only one way to go in this game, I never felt limited.The atmosphere is breathtaking.  So immersive.  Tense and frightening at times.If you're interested in an innovative and interesting science fiction aesthetic & story in an engaging, non-violent game, you must buy Lifeless Planet.  We need more games like this.			"

												These are the times i wished there was more than a ""yes or no"" recommend. The game runs fine, i didn't experience any bugs, and has a decent story. The trailer was great and i wanted to buy it. However, they game is extremly slow paced. from the start to the almost end of the game there almost seems like no reason to continue because it is completely un interesting. This is ine of those times where indie games try to draw themselves out because they feel let are too short i feel like. It took me 4 hours to play through it, i firmly believe a 1.5 hour or 2 hour game time would have worked out better to keep the pacing of the story line interesting. I would recommend this game, but only at a $1-$3 range on a sale. I would not recommend buying it if you have to pay the full price.			"

												This is an expertly crafted little game set on a beautifully rendered alien planet.  The game mechanics themselves are relatively simple: explore, find things, solve puzzles, don't fall to your death etc.  But what sets this game apart for me is the storyline, delivered a little at a time as you progress through the game, leaving you to work out what is going on, and what it means to you.  Similar in style to Ico, or Shadow of the Colossus, I found this incredibly rewarding to play.Whilst completing this game is relatively simple, it looks like there are some achievements here for the truely hardcore gamer, that seem like you can only get them on your first play-through, namely completing the game in under four hours on your first playthrough, and completing the game without dying on your first playthrough.  As an indication, my first playthrough took over 9 hours (I'm a stickler for exploring the entire map and finding everything possible) and I died *very many* times.If you like science fiction and or Christopher Nolan films, I'm sure you'll enjoy this game.

												I am not finished with this game yet, but I have to say I have thoroughly enjoyed every minute so far.  It is a simple game play, not much more to do than a little bit of jumping and figuring out where to go next, but the atmosphere and simplicity and the pace are quite fitting for the storyline.  To be honest, the only time I find myself jarred back into remembering this is just a game is when somehow it knows exactly when my extra jetpack fuel runs out...  just at the end of all the big jumps.  Other than that though, I have really enjoyed it a lot so far.  I did not pay full price for this, I got it from Humble Bundle, so I do recommend waiting for a sale.  I think most games are kinda way over priced for the content these days, but if you watch and get it on sale and you like a bit of a slow paced, unfolding story, then you will enjoy it.  I think it actually has more to do than Dear Esther, but to me, it has the same lonely and sometimes very disturbed feel.			"

												Loved every minute.I’ve been looking for a game that would let me get away and explore a beautiful, dramatic, natural place. I’m not big on fantasy worlds. Reimagining culture, dress, language, race, etc. for some reason is not exciting. I like it when things go beyond known reality, but are descendent from it.Lifeless Planet met everything.The place is gorgeous with large, open expanses beautifully rendered. You can walk around and explore. There are just enough clues to give you an idea of the direction you need to move in, but where you go and in what order is your choice. You’re in there all alone.It combines many elements of known reality or not-too-distant reality into a surreal experience. Like great classic science fiction.			"

												I did not come into this game with many expectations. When i started it seemed simple enough. But what caught my attention initaly was the enviorment design, for what they had to work with they managed to make a truly beautiful envirment, even at its most desolate it still is great to look at. The gameplay is tight and does what it needs to do, and the puzzles may start out easy but later on they require alot of paitents. From what i saw of this game through previews the stoyr was FAR better then expected. While alot of it may be told through text, combinding the text with the evniorment it still comes across very well. This game is a great game, get it when you have the chance, you wont regret it.

There are a couple challenging areas, so it's not exactly a fly through game. The challenges are actually fun to get if you can find yourself willing to die in everyway possible. The ending is what you make of it. And watch the short ending after the credits...wait for it...wait for it! Overall great game.			"

												[Potential Spoiler Warning]Lifeless Planet is a puzzle-platformer where you're an astronaut travelling to another world 20 lightyears into the future, but, twist, the USSR beat us there in 1979 because plot and, twist, they ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed everything up. The good:The controls were fluid and responsive, or at least for me. I also have an appreciation for exploration and puzzle games, but...The ugly:Meh. That's the best way I can sum up this game. Just... meh. Voice acting? Meh.Graphics/Art? Meh.Gameplay? Meh.Music? Meh.Plot? Meh.Meh? Meh.It seems like the project tacked on too much. Like... okay, great example- the plot. I understand it's suppsed to be plot-heavy, right? But, there's the astronaut, and the russians, and the ancients, and the dead wife, and the plant chick, and it's just a complete mess. The game's 4-6 hours long, and the plot's trying to go fourty different ways. By the time I hit the end, they're hinting at this twist with the dead wife, and I know I'm supposed to feel something, but I just... *sigh* I just don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥The gameplay itself seems like it doesn't know what it wants to do. Open-world exploration, without being open and nothing to explore; puzzler, with only one actual puzzle that I remember; a platformer that's unchallenging and monotonous. The gameplay is repetitive and dull, the scenery gets old after an hour of seeing just desert and rocks, there's four soundtracks and only one of them is decent, and the entire time, there's this hide-and-go-seek challenge to find minerals scattered around the world. That's right. You're supposed to find hidden minerals amongst the barren, rock-filled landscape.LIFELESS PLANET: WE GOT ROCKS. LIKE ROCKS? FIND SOME ROCKS. GET ACHEIVEMENTS WITH ROCKS. ROCKS WITH ROCKS ON ROCKS. ROCK SIMULATION 2014. 10/10 GAME OF THE YEAR, ALL YEARS.The game's trying to be this grandoise art piece, but it's not really focusing on anything. And yet...The ugly:It's still charging my credit card like it's some grandoise art piece. This game is not worth $20. I complained about AntiChamber being $20, and that is a fantastic puzzle-platformer. This? I /might/ pay $5 for it, if I was drunk.Final words:This game was so close to being something worthwhile, but a lack of focus and a short gameplay meant that this became a bland, uninteresting mess. It's not awful per se, but just the sheer medicocrity of it is almost insulting considering I paid $20 for it.Final score: 4.5/10Cost: $19.99 USD			"

The atmosphere of the game was great, I really got sucked in and caught myself asking questions about what was going to happen next. What makes this game not worth the full price was simple things like jerky character movement, frame rate drops in larger areas, and poorly disigned mechanics.

												This is a fantastic game for fans of sci-fi.  If you like movies like Mission to Mars, or Red Planet, you should try this game.  I wouldn't say the game was challenging, and I found that to be a plus.  I rarely found myself frustrated with this game.  It was a strange combination of peaceful and melancholy if that's possible.  I would describe it as walking through a great science fiction short story.  I enjoyed the visuals of the game.  Though the game clearly needs you to go certain directions to progress, the boundaries are subtle and don't make you feel confined.  Between the various planet landscapes and the grand structures, my curiousity to continue the game was often piqued.  I also really enjoyed the music but I'm at a loss to describe it; Perhaps ambient to movie preview.  To the game creator and everyone who worked on it, Thank You for the experience.			"

												""Short and simple but  sweet""This is an interesting game which I enjoyed but I am not sure it's worth $20. I finished it in 5 hours and that's with struggling through some ""jump around"" puzzles. It has a great story and atmosphere although the environments can seem too similar even when they try to be different. (different colored cliffs can only go so far). I would say the ""beauty level"" is average at best by today's standards although the story makes you forgive that and I am someone that looks at content first and graphics later.I definitely think the story is the best part of the game and the atmosphere can be haunting at times. If you're not short on money I definitely recommend the experience.  "

												This may seem like a scything review, but bear in mind that it is overall positive.Lifeless Planet is like a rather gripping story book made game, in a very engaging way.  I enjoyed the story quite well, visual clues and backstory presented in a way that ""keeps you turning pages"", as it were.  In the end, you feel you have little to no control over the events taking place, which fits into the storybook motif. There are a few minor puzzles, but they make no sense whatsoever in the context of the story, or the puzzles themselves.   The achievements are poorly designed, with one achievement going only to cheaters.  That achievement is to ""Beat the game without dying on your first playthrough"".  That, can only be achieved through dumb luck or reading ahead which totally breaks the exploration of the story.   To give an idea, one of the other achievements was to get killed without knowing what killed you.  (Which actually happens a lot.  There's invisible death-walls that are there to say ""No, you can't go that way."")Lastly, if you're used to playing with a joystick, then the controls will make perfect sense.  The Keyboard controls are a bit nausiating and inconsistent.  A Joystick pretty much is the only way to play this one. All this negativity aside, the game was quite enjoyable.  But does leave me with one unanswered question - ""Why have I been carrying this rock for the last 3 chapters?""			"

												Having finished the game, here are my pros and cons;The Good: -Visuals, the game looks really pretty and I love how well the Unity engine is utilized here.-Sound. This includes music, which, by the way, was fantastic. The world is filled with fitting sounds from ambient noices to rocks crumbling. The voice acting is also really well done, I love how It's actual Russian dialogue instead of English with forced Russian accent.-Story. Few plot holes aside, I did enjoy the story, and didn't find it too hard to keep up with what was happening around me. A few things were left seemingly unanswered, but we can always guess.-Lenght. Took me about 4 hours, which felt alot longer. I think the game has a very optimal lenght to it, you feel like you've seen alot but not too much or too little. The Bad:-The save system, which didn't even save the first time I exited the game and I had to start over. I wasn't far though, and it didn't happen again.-Controls. I get that I'm playing as an astronaut, and that movement shouldn't be like a walk in the park, but considering this, it was still a bit off. In the end this just resulted in jumps too long or too short, but i never found myself incredibly frustrated. Also when using a gamepad, the sensitivity for turning the camera is god awful, and couldn't be changed, so it was just easier to use keyboard and mouse.-The puzzles. Nothing complex, or even challenging. Lots of puzzles are just copy pasted, or are painfully obvious the moment you see them, with a few exceptions towards the end.-There's no real character development happening, which irritated me. Some of the side plot seems to be thrown in there 'just because', and doesn't really add up to anything. Also the astronaut we're playing as: first he's confused, then he's more confused, and suddenly he's cracking jokes about his situation? Seemed kind of odd.So in the end I do recommend giving this game a go, if you have the money and time to spare. I do however, advice to buy when it's on sale(like now as I'm writing this), especially if you feel that the price is a bit too high for a game like this. Use your best judgement. "

												Lifeless Planet is not just a game. It's a Science Fiction book that you ""read"" by playing the game. The story is one of the most interesting SciFi one I've played, watched or read. Well, there are some exaggerations about what the Soviets were supposed to have done as an ""experiment"" to one of them... Anyway, I'd say it's equally good to the Dig's story. It's about exploring the once-inhabited-now-lifeless world you're on and that's the best part of it. Exploring the unknown. The graphics are really good as well as the sound. The gameplay is fine (could be a bit smoother in some cases but nothing serious) and it's as ""repetitive"" as every other game. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes SciFi, either if it's literature, movies or games.			"

												Lifeless Planet is not a perfect game. Far from it. In fact for every spark of brillance, there is an annoyance or strange design decision that threw me off the experience. Yet, I feel I'd recommend this game - caveat being - play it if you are willing to overlook many shortcomings.While the story is quite lacking, it is delivered in a way that does not interrupt the game flow (long-ish logs with shorter voiceover summaries). While the art direction is very simple (low poly environment, natural textures, weak models and character animation) - it suits the game and gives it a unique atmosphere.While the pacing has long section of hitting the mark, other times it may torture you with repeats of floaty 3D platform sections.Music and voice acting are great (especially for an indie title) but then they tend to cut off abruptly as you hit an invisible zone wall or a save point.The balance tends to tilt towards the positive though. I can say I had an interesting experience, and the fact that I burned through the entire game in one sitting (5hrs or so) means I must have enjoyed it. Again, try it if you have a few hours to burn and don't mind a slightly unpolished, but atmospheric and enjoyable title.			"

												I would reccommend this game as long as it's puchased for ≤ $10.  It's absolutely worth that much in visuals.  The dialogue is very nice and the voice actors are believeable.  It's definitely a 'walk in the park (on Mars)' game, so if you're wanting something action packed or survival-realistic, then this probably isn't for you.The few complaints I have are that there was plenty of open word to discover, but absolutely nothing in it.  I like to search every crevice in hopes I'll find a hidden something, and while there are collectibles in this game, they're only in a few of the places off the beaten (glowing) path.  The next is that this game is too goodlooking to have a couple certain very-important somethings look so lifeless and empty, especially at the end.That's it.  I highly enjoyed the game, and I think anyone who wants to play an easy cinematic game will enjoy this as well.  The story's pretty good.			"

												Ah, Lifeless Planet... I wish I could recommend this game. I saw so many positive reviews and praise. Atmosphere is great, story looks like entertaining at the beginning. But the game just feels too empty.  There's too much space, you walk too slowly, and too little things to do. You almost cannot interact with anything except with what you're supposed to. You will just end roaming without knowing what you're supposed to do next, until you've tried everything. It's pure guessing on some passages. Also the ""platform"" puzzles are superfluous. They don't add anything to the game or the story. And the story.  Simply didn't catch my attention, although I'm a BIG science-fiction fan. Sorry, I can't recommend this game, although I would love to.			"

												I paid $5 for the game, and it took about 3 1/2 hours to beat, and my feelings on a game are tempered by how much commitment it took for me to play the game. I really enjoyed this game, I know there are those who hate it, but I think their expectations were off. Lifeless Planet is a kickstarter game, pretty much made by 1 dude. I had some glitches (the quit button didn't work, puzzles don't reset on a respawn. This rarely matters, but some puzzles involve green balls, and I did lose all of the green balls. But it wasn't hard to start a new game at that stage, and it didn't cost me too much time.I found the platforming and puzzles to be fun, and the puzzles were mostly simple.The focus is the story -- why isn't this planet covered in life (like the space agency said it would be), and why is there a Russian passport and powerlines here?

												I would've recommended this game if it was a bit shorter and had a more refind jumping mechanic.Whilst the storyline was somewhat flaky I enjoyed it; the whole premise behind the game was interesting to me.The backstory into the main character was really interesting and sad!Graphics were nice and the music was really well done, puzzles were nice but a tad on the easy side.The major downfall to this game was the controls when it came to jumping. I would spend a lot of frustrating time trying to clear a section of tedious jumps only to have my character decide not to run as fast as he was or overshoot the thing or undershoot it when he was fine before. I'd fall and have to start again. Sometimes if you mess up because of it you just die and the somewhat dodgey save system would set you back further away.I had to completely quit the game at one point to reset an elevator that got stuck half way and so I couldn't get up to it, reloading the ""last checkpoint"" didn't do anything.Also there is a lot of aimless wondering, it's not that bad as you can take the time to enjoy the seneary but then again when you've failed a jump multiple times all you want to do is get this thing finished.There were a few times when the way wasn't all that clear (mainly my fault) but coupled with the bad jumps it was frustrating at times.I wouldnt recommend it at the current price, if it was to go on sale then by all means try it out. I should mention I played using the keyboard and mouse so that may have had a negative impact on gameplay as it seems to support a controller.If you love platforming then by all means pick it up, I'm terribly into those types of games and got it without knowing it was going to consist of a lot of platforming.

												You just crashed on some unkown planet which was supposed to be habitable for human kind.Without any signs of your ship srew members you follow some tracks in sand on totally deserted planet.No oxygen. No ecosystem suitable for humans. You just follow tracks when abandoned willage appears on horizont ...Well, game is really good, not only due to fact one person did al the work (plus one musician). It has really strong atmosphere, i found myself maybe too much in game very often ;). Confused mind with tons of thoughts drifting my mind - why? Who? How? Where? You just simply can't predict the story in this game. And i found pretty scary being maybe only living person on abandoned planet with all of those signs of abandoned human activity years ago.So much for positive things about this piece.When i've heard about game for a first time and saw some screenshots i felt it like Dear Esther in sci-fi setting. DE was ""walking simulator"" with strong and graduating story and i liked it. But in Lifeless Planet ss you play game from some point it starts looking just like some concept of larger future game. By both story and gameplay. There are nice mechanisms like supercharging your jetpack so you can do really long jumps across canyons and craters. Need of refilling your oxygen is also fine. But those mechanisms are just bonded to certain levels. I can imagine to do maps a bit opened giving player some possibility of choice to take certain path. Unfortunately game has really tight corridors (but tries to pretend opposite). I loved one of last levels by the volcano, it was real challenge to find right way through it :).Graphics is average, some places look beautiful (thermal springs level or volcano were fantasic), as it is in Unity engine it would run fast even on ancient machines. Noticed rapid fps drops under 30-25fps (by eye) is some areas mostly for no reason on my i5 4670, GTX 970, which is able run such things in hundreds fps at 1080p with some decent AA (as Unity is performance low-demanding engine).Music is nice and i could listen to such nice and atmospheric music for whole gameplay, unfortunately there are certain spots in levels where music plays, otherwise not. Also walking on different materials like sand, rock, metal, wood etc. doesn't chande sound of footsteps. Come on, we are in 21st century :)Conclusion:Very nice strong-atmosphere 3rd person platformer. Be warned as gameplay looks like walk, walk, walk, walk ... walk, jump, push some button or something like that, jump, walk, walk, walk, walk ... etc. Jetpack ftw. Not bad for 5€ and not bad as game was developed by single person. Story could be a bit richier.6/10			"

												The Good: Breathtaking environments and a well placed soundtrack make for an amazing atmosphere.  The puzzles themselves are very straightforward but still meaningful. The story is a bit of a stretch but it never made me stop playing, on the contrary I wanted to see what happens next.The Bad: Lots of walking ... there was one specific level where you tight rope walk across a giant canyon where the walking actually made sense and which I actually enjoyed.  Elsewhere it just seemed like a chore.  There were a few rough level transitions and the controls did get a little finicky at times.Overall I recommend buying this during a sale and playing on a rainy day when you have nothing else to do.

Appropriate music, generally good mechanics/controls, just challenging enough at times to be interesting.

												If you have problems with games that don't have something to shoot with - or are looking for a puzzler that will stretch your maths degree - this isn't going to be your kind of game. But, if like me, you crave exploration and an intreaging story line mixed in with some simple puzzle elements and ooodles of atmosphere, then Lifeless Planet is something rare and treasured that you are going to love. Don't expect as much action as the early Tomb Raiders, but expect vastly more action than Dear Ester. Not a particuarly long game, but enough to get your monies worth and have a satisfying conclusion.			"

												I found this game to be such a huge disappointment because it always made me feel like it was building up for some huge grand finalie. All the way up to the end of the last cutscene I was expecting something. Everytime I thought some sort of plot climax was going to show up, nothing happened. I figured that it was getting me excited and building up for something really shocking or worth 4 hours of my life, but everytime I was disappointed. It's as though this story completely skipped the climax and the falling action. It just went from rising action to resolution. If you want a game with a great story, Half Life (any game or episode is great), any Bioshock game, or even Minecraft has a better story than this game. tl;dr: It is a decent game but the story left a lot to be desired.

												i really didn't like ""dear esther"" and was skeptical when i saw lifeless planet, worried that it was a similar game, and in some ways it is.  However, being a long time fallout and post apocalyptic genre fan, the wilderness of an unknown planet appealed to the more morbidly-curious side of my personality.  The music in the game pretty much makes it, the composer did a fantastic job.  The story itself, wow. just amazing, i'm not often moved by much, and i'm not saying i teared up when i completed the game, but it was just wonderful, there is no let down at the end, no loose ends (none that bothered me anyway).  do yourself a favour and buy this game, it's an experience.

												These are the times i wished there was more than a ""yes or no"" recommend. The game runs fine, i didn't experience any bugs, and has a decent story. The trailer was great and i wanted to buy it. However, they game is extremly slow paced. from the start to the almost end of the game there almost seems like no reason to continue because it is completely un interesting. This is ine of those times where indie games try to draw themselves out because they feel let are too short i feel like. It took me 4 hours to play through it, i firmly believe a 1.5 hour or 2 hour game time would have worked out better to keep the pacing of the story line interesting. I would recommend this game, but only at a $1-$3 range on a sale. I would not recommend buying it if you have to pay the full price.			"

												Interesting story - this is the best reason to play I can think of.I'd recommend it if someone is into platforming play - jump from platform to platform.  Timing of taps starts easy enough and builds up a bit as you progress.  Otherwise the play isn't that interesting.There's no save point just before you do a set so if it's a death drop - you'll end up running back to the spot, at times via a set of jumps... To then try it again...  That can be rather frustrating.It's not an overly complex game to play but you really do need to be into the platforming style to enjoy the actual play - otherwise it's for the story but that is very nicely done.

Not quite at the same level as Gone Home but a nice departure from the standard fare. It was made with Unity, which I respect, but there was some unnecessary slowdown in areas because of poor structuring of the 3D geometry. I was able to work around it every time and it didn't keep me from enjoying the game. There was only one spot I had trouble and had to get a hint which is good.

Not a major adventure as I finished in under 4 hours of light play.Verdict: Light platforming, and light puzzle elements make for a enjoyable space journey.

You can step well off the path and explore to find a few items strewn about, but it really only nets you a Steam achievement.It took me a little while to get used to 3rd person control & view, but it certainly makes the game more enjoyable from that perspective.

It's nice to see an indie dev make a platformer that is not retro 2D.  It is very atmospheric, and the story is engaging enough for at least one playthrough.

												This is a simple, short, but quite interesting game. I've spent about 3 hours, walking it through. Overall I think, big impact on my feelings about this game was made by the plot, which is strongly associated with Russia, my home country.Plot itself feels like, you're reading something from Stanislaw Lem or Klifford Saimak, meanwhile being in story yourself.There is not a lot of action, and quite obvious places to go. There are a lot of dark corners, where a lot of interesting stuff could be hid. But, at most of the times it's empty.Obstacles are easy to manage... So if you like FPS and graphics, go your way. If you're here for the plot - definitely have an hour ot two, enjoy fantasy of the distant world.			"

This could have been a really cool space exploration/puzzler game with a really good athmosphere, but it's just a boring, follow the green trail and jump arround from time to time, space walking simulator.

												Loved every minute.I’ve been looking for a game that would let me get away and explore a beautiful, dramatic, natural place. I’m not big on fantasy worlds. Reimagining culture, dress, language, race, etc. for some reason is not exciting. I like it when things go beyond known reality, but are descendent from it.Lifeless Planet met everything.The place is gorgeous with large, open expanses beautifully rendered. You can walk around and explore. There are just enough clues to give you an idea of the direction you need to move in, but where you go and in what order is your choice. You’re in there all alone.It combines many elements of known reality or not-too-distant reality into a surreal experience. Like great classic science fiction.			"

												The visual-audial experience is absolutely incredible; done to perfection. The plot is well thought-out and unique but was a little dissapointing that it was pretty much only told through dialogue boxes. That makes sense, however, do to the setting of it being an abandoned planet but can still take away from the immersion at times. The gameplay is not great, the platforming can be really wonky at times but it never gets frustrating. There are a few puzzles here and there that aren't hard at all and are most likely just there to serve as world-building structures. Pros:-Atmosphere- (the different parts of the planet that you explore are all crafted to perfection, really making you feel like you're in a believable world. Exploration is optional but is something that you can still do. Every structure that you see gives such a great eery, sci-fi vibe)-Plot- (it's a unique plot, and without giving anything away, it's definitely not what you'd be expecting yet still tells a classic sci-fi story)-Visuals- (While the graphics may not be uber-realistic or anything, the use of colors and shadows really add to the atmosphere, and really anywhere you look could be a good desktop wallpaper)-Soundtrack- (It's a wonderful soundtrack that compliments that experience superbly, I'd reccomend you check it out: http://richdouglasmusic.bandcamp.com/album/lifeless-planet-ost)Cons:-Gameplay- (the platforming is clunky and floaty, giving you no precision in your jumps. It takes a while to get use to it and even then you can easily get lost. Puzzles are only there to look cool... which is ok, I guess. I did encounter a bug but it was my own fault and was easily fixed with a restart)-Text Boxes- (most of the story is built through documents that you find laying around, scattered conviently all over. They give off a bright glow that can really through the immersion off and it brings up a UI everytime where you can read it.

												Having finished the game, here are my pros and cons;The Good: -Visuals, the game looks really pretty and I love how well the Unity engine is utilized here.-Sound. This includes music, which, by the way, was fantastic. The world is filled with fitting sounds from ambient noices to rocks crumbling. The voice acting is also really well done, I love how It's actual Russian dialogue instead of English with forced Russian accent.-Story. Few plot holes aside, I did enjoy the story, and didn't find it too hard to keep up with what was happening around me. A few things were left seemingly unanswered, but we can always guess.-Lenght. Took me about 4 hours, which felt alot longer. I think the game has a very optimal lenght to it, you feel like you've seen alot but not too much or too little. The Bad:-The save system, which didn't even save the first time I exited the game and I had to start over. I wasn't far though, and it didn't happen again.-Controls. I get that I'm playing as an astronaut, and that movement shouldn't be like a walk in the park, but considering this, it was still a bit off. In the end this just resulted in jumps too long or too short, but i never found myself incredibly frustrated. Also when using a gamepad, the sensitivity for turning the camera is god awful, and couldn't be changed, so it was just easier to use keyboard and mouse.-The puzzles. Nothing complex, or even challenging. Lots of puzzles are just copy pasted, or are painfully obvious the moment you see them, with a few exceptions towards the end.-There's no real character development happening, which irritated me. Some of the side plot seems to be thrown in there 'just because', and doesn't really add up to anything. Also the astronaut we're playing as: first he's confused, then he's more confused, and suddenly he's cracking jokes about his situation? Seemed kind of odd.So in the end I do recommend giving this game a go, if you have the money and time to spare. I do however, advice to buy when it's on sale(like now as I'm writing this), especially if you feel that the price is a bit too high for a game like this. Use your best judgement. "

												Whilst I have not yet finished the game I feel I have played enough to write a review, or short review of my experience thus far. The game gets a lot of praise from me for the gameplay, style, and the atmosphere it creates that so many AAA titles fail to produce. The gameplay is simple and most people could pick up and play this without any trouble at all. The style of the game is what helps to provide the atmosphere and whilst not as graphically pretty as I had hoped it still helps contribute to the atmosphere it is trying to produce- which it pulls off with perfection. That said whilst I have many positive things to say, I also have a few negative points and warnings. The game's story is good and intriguing, but requires a lot of reading to get the full experience from what I have played. Being someone who likes reading everything from start to finish in a game like this, I'm quite happy doing so but I know many people would not. Like I said in the paragraph above I feel the game could and should have been a lot prettier. Another problem which I encountered was that the esc menu would not allow me to select things using my mouse and instead I needed to opt to use my keyboard which was quite frustrating when I’m so used to selecting options with a mouse. The game leaves you trying to figure out what to do and where to go. This perhaps may have been better if I had a compass, as at one time you were asked to go south. Without knowing where south was I was left looking around for several minutes and found myself starting to lose interest. When I first started the game I found myself die within minutes looking for oxygen not knowing where to go or what to do. Being so used to objective points in other games left me confused but you quickly pick up what to do, where to go and the game is a lot more linear that it appears. I would call this game a space puzzler. At times figuring out what to do or where to go is tricky but greatly satisfying when you figure it out, and at the same time frustrating when you can't but it compels you to move forward and I'm looking forward to finishing this game off in the future. This review may change in the future and I will update it with other positive and negative points I encounter.  "

												This game requires a good bit of patience. The story takes forever to develop, and is interspersed between increasingly irritating platforming puzzles. Maybe I'm just bad at platformers.Here's a tip: when you get to the big portal later in the game, grab one of those green balls to the left of where you'll find the jetpack fuel BEFORE you ascend to the top of the portal. The platform doesn't go all the way back down.Buy it when it's on sale. Don't pay full price.			"

												Played LP today in one sitting, which took me around 5 hours. The first impression was great and the game felt so mysterious. At some point you start to jump alot more and get to know the possibilities into the game. Level design and sound was great and worked fine together. At some point the game felt like neverending though, it became a bit too much repetitive. If it was a bit shorter it would be better. I recommend this game for everyone who likes to explore and loves a mysterious atmosphere.7/10			"

												This game is best described as a third-person platformer, with the jump distance and random steep angles being the biggest challenge. But beyond the dated graphics and simplistic gameplay is a refreshingly original story with some decent voice acting and good atmosphere. It's good short enough that it doesn't become grueling, so give it a shot if you want a quick narrative experience.			"

												Picket this up on Steam Sale for $10.  I think it was well worth it :)A simple premise that slowly evolves through the game play.  I agree with other people who say it's more of a story you get to walk through.  Most of the puzzels were fairly straight forward but the scenery was well done, especially the sun effects and the hot springs.  The music was fantastic as well!The only downside I would say is a few of the level transitions were a little choppy.  That and the cut scene near the end could have been a bit longer.  However, once I saw the kickstarter credits at the end it made sense and the ending was quite satisfying so I'd give it a thumbs up.			"

												I enjoyed Lifeless Planet (played on a Mac, using a Logitech gamepad for control). The look and the sound are great, pulling you into the game's atmosphere. The story is quite interesting, as it is gradually revealed through logs and recordings you find as you explore. The game has a few mechanical problems though, which sucked out some of the fun.Some aspects of the game felt very ""gamey"" and mechanical, which pulled you out of the story a bit. The astronaut's oxygen supply and jet-pack fuel definitely felt very scripted, lasting arbitrarily just as long as the plot required. It would have been nice to be able to get some benefit, for example, from being economical with fuel, so as to be able to use it later.I found the controls a bit wonky, but tolerable. The camera, however, is pretty awful; it gets jammed in the geometry again and again, and at some critical points forces one to jump ""blind"" unless you get your positioning exactly right. There are also way too many places where the astronaut can get hopelessly stuck in the geometry.. Having said all that, I have played Lifeless Planet through multiple times, and still go back to play a level from time to time, so I overall, I definitely recommend this game.			"

												= Please note that this review was originally meant as a reaction to AshenRowan's review == We seem to find the same pro's/con's, but in a minorly different measure of importance == Leading to a different recommendation total =Review:After having finished the game, i agree with most of what AshenRowan said.- The music/ambient sounds were wonderful. They acted out the exact role they're supposed to; drawing the player further into the game, rather than just being distracting random music. While never truly noticing any sounds/music, i always felt it there. As strange as this may sound. Think of it as air: you know it's important, you know you're always inhaling it, but you never really realize or appreciate it as such.- The scenery, especially in cinematics, were beautiful. I have to say, however, that i don't completely agree with the comment on the graphics quality being a lot worse at times. I noticed (pretty late) that the image quality seems to be directly linked to the center of the screen. Looking directly at parts of the scenery seem to brighten, sharpen ánd enhance the overall quality of that specific part of the scenery. The point that's actually sharp is pretty small though. (Please note that i have my graphics set to ""fastest"", as i'm working on a laptop that doesn't fully accept its own graphics card)- The enemies are absolutely awesome! The design is wonderful, and they're placed at good locations in the game. I find some points about the enemies quite confusing though. Some seem to be programmed to follow a specific path, while others seem to act either at random, or to your movements. Don't get me wrong, i wouldn't consider this a Con, it's just... if you don't know, it can be a bit confusing, i guess.- I didn't really mind the ""Put the rock in the whole"" thingy, to be honest. However, this could've been made a bit easier, or at the very least, they could've taken out the cinematic leading up to the necessary equipment.- AshenRowan seems to have encountered more environment issues than i have. I agree that some parts of the environment doesn't work well with the intensity/air-movement of the jetpack, but that's a matter of feeling it a few times, and it'll be fine until the next time you need to slightly alter your technique. Only once have i encountered a seemingly solid piece of environment to be completely intangible. However, again, after knowing that, i managed to jump that gap with the second try.- There's one thing AshenRowan didn't say in his review, that seems pretty important to me: the end. It doesn't seem finished at all. There were so many things i still had to do to feel like i had completed the storyline, but it seems that only one part of the storyline is officially considered the storyline? and that one honestly only seemed minorly important, considering how the storyline developed throughout the game.| In conclusion, i also agree with AshenRowan: I'm not necessarily satisfied (especially due to that last bit), but it's a very enjoyable game. And if you don't feel like playing for a while, and you're in a fully safe spot, just leave the game open and enjoy the ambient sounds and the music while you're busy doing other stuff.			"

												In general a pretty good game, but glad I didn't pay full price for it. Has no replay value to me. Turns into more of a platformer than a walking simulator imo, and you definetly can and most likely will die a few times to environmental hazards. Story was decent too but I found that following the breadcrumb journal entries soon became unsatisfyingly sporadic way to keep me moving forward. About halfway through I started asking myself, ""Okay, when is this going to end?"". But needing closure I perservered through a plot that gave no hint as to how close we were to the climax/finale and thus started becoming monotonous. What I did like was how large the areas were even if you couldn't venture off the beaten path much, it still gave a sense of emptiness and seperation.If you are patient or more tolerant than I am and/or appreciate the journey as well as the destination, there's a good chance you'll enjoy this game.

												The game was fun and interesting from start to finish. Great story. However, the frequent crashes at the time of this writing was really heartbreaking. Sometimes it would crash more than halfway through a checkpoint and you'd have to start that area all over again. The crashes varied from D3D driver resets to blue screens to reboots. I've played various sets of games this week from Battlestations Pacific to LImbo to Deus Ex - none of them so much as caused a blip on my system. This game? Crashed 10x in a 5 hour session.If you can live with the frustration of the crashes, this game is worthwhile.			"

												Lifeless Planet is a walking simulator, essentially developed by David Board.What David Board did rather well:GraphicsSound designAtmosphere (very well)Environment designLevel design - linear levels can be quite enjoyable if the designer manages to hide the fact that they are linear levels. David Board has mastered this art.What David Board did not rather well:Choice of achievements - to not die during the first playthrough and finish the game within four hours, one would need a lot of luck and a sense of intuition that is bordering on clairvoyance. (By messing with savefiles, you can fetch these later. And David Board is considering to change the achievements.) This was indeed changed in a patch.Communication design - Lifeless Planet is not so good at communicating stuff to the player. For example, it does not communicate properly when a cutscene ends. Letterboxed cutscenes are industry standard for more reasons than to just create a cinematic effect. Lifeless Planet also often has problems to communicate what you are supposed to be doing, where you are supposed to go. Occasionally I found myself backtracking because I performed some actions and I neither actually knew where to go now nor recognized that I had walked that path before. If you call me spoiled from modern games which tell you absolutely everything and argue that you are supposed to be exploring, then I counterargue with the aforementioned achievements. And Lifeless Planet could on these occasions at least tell what you are supposed to do, not how to do it.Gameplay:The core of Lifeless Planet is a walking simulator, but the mantle is a sub-average 3D platformer. And the crust consists of a few puzzles which are not difficult. The sections where you have octuple jumps are quite nice, being able to jumping eight times is almost like having a jetpack, partially because the character is an astronaut and has kind of a jetpack.Rather not nice was the section where you have to ride geysers. It was next to impossible, I only made it through with trial and error and a bit of luck.Some of the grabbing arm sections where difficult to control as well, especially because they provide no good perception of depth, yet another issue in communication design. Pricing: A walking simulator for 20€ is rather expensive, and so is Lifeless Planet. Definitely wait for a sale or an indie bundle.I still recommend Lifeless Planet. It may just be a walking simulator, but then it is a very fancy and atmospheric one. Also note that, despite being out of Early Access, David Board still patches the game, some of the issues I mentioned might be resolved by the time you read this.			"

Lifeless Planet will always be a favourite of mine RECOMMENDED :)  THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY! (What's this? :- Like some games get ""Best Game of 2014"" or ""Best Indie Game"", etc... So I have decided to make my own!)  "

												You know what, i actually enjoyed this game... Quite a journey.It most definitely is a walking simulator, yet it's calming. It provides an atmosphere you can just relax and switch off to. All the while you're wondering what's going on.I do understand why a lot of people can find it boring, repetitive and not really worth the £15, so i'm reccomending this game on the basis it is purchased in a sale.

												I really like the game.  It's intriging.  It keeps you wanting to play.  It's interesting and you can walk just about anywhere.  The puzzles are not like some games where its just a pretty puzzle, they are like real life situations, if you were stranded on Mars.			"

												Incredible scifi platformer/puzzle game with fantastic graphics! Engaging story that managed to keep me hooked. I didn't want to stop playing. I wanted to keep going to see what was going to happen next. The ending left me feeling a bit empty, but everything leading up to it was the bees knees!The game seems relatively bug free, which was nice and had super simple controls. Overall I really enjoyed myself..which is good because the last 2 games I played sucked so bad I was about to give up on games completely. It's nice to see that there are great games still out there!The only real downside is the fact that the game doesn't really have any audio options, which was annoying because I have trouble focusing on what I am reading when there is a voice talking in the background. Which this had, unfortunately the voice was Russian, so I would have to wait for it to finish it's voice over to read what was ""Translated"". Other than that, it was perfect!			"

												Endless walking! About 90% of this game is walking, 5% jumping, and the rest involve simple puzzles and a tad bit of story. I must say, the environments were often stunning and immersive, but about two-thirds into the game I found myself just wanting it to be over already. I pushed through, but that last third felt brutally tedious. I thought the story was interesting, but ultimately didn't feel it had as much depth to it as I would have liked it to have had. I somewhat enjoyed it, just not quite enough; the reward did not quite meet or outweigh the effort. I'm kind of on the fence about recommending it, but if I had to choose, I'd lean towards not recommending it.			"

												I loved everything about this game. The music, the character, the settings, gameplay, etc.. I like that it's one of those games where you're alone and have to figure out the story for yourself. It makes playing the game more worthwhile (for me, personally). I'd totally recommend this game to anyone who may have played Firewatch already. It's completely different in storyline, gameplay, and graphics, but I think the build up of the stories work the same way. By holding out on giving away information so easily, it kept me interested in finding out what was going on till the end of the game. (It's a quick game too, for anyone interested. It seems like the game will take a long while to finish, but I was able to complete it in 4 hours).			"

												Whilst the story is fairly interesting, the gameplay itself is a little simplistic - it's very linear, which I could see being a major problem for a few users.At times, some of the puzzles were a little frustrating, and it was kinda easy to get turned around in the very similar-looking puzzles, easpecially during the poorly-lit areas.

												While I personally did not enjoy this game that much, I am going to recommend it.  I feel that, for what this game is, the creators did an excellent job.  The scenary is pretty decent, the music is at times beautiful and the story is pretty well written.  However, the puzzles are far too easy, and the game is filled with parkour (the extend of the puzzles).  So many times it isn't challenging - simply frustrating.  But I know there are people who enjoy those types of games even if I don't, so I must recommend it on the merits of the game.  Also, there are times when a transition to a new part of the game throws you completely in to a new biome with no explanation of why.  This happens about 4 times where it fades to black, and comes back and you are in a completely different area with no idea on how you got there.  This was distracting - particularly one time when I wanted to check out a temple, but was sent to a different area with no warning.  It would be nice if you moved from area to area mre seamlessly.  ALso - none of the structures are explorable.  That was disappointing too.Watch all of the credits for the final cut scene.  It's worth the 2 minutes.			"

												The game is too repetitive, all you do is walk and jump with the occasional pick/drop of objects.  There is a really bad bug on the game, if by mistake you press any of the numeric keys in your keyboard, the character resets it location to a place outside the map.  If you are lucky to die from the fall outside the map it will return back to the game.  Right after if you attempt to use the robotic arm on an object, the robotic arm disjoints itself and begins moving all over the place on its own, you have to wait about a minute for the arm to connect itself together and be able to use it. The game is fun for about the first 5 minutes, but after playing the game for 5 hours, the level of repetitiveness and boringness it was too much for me.  I had to end up returning the game.			"

												Acheivements didn't work on the mac version but it was a satisfying game. It's nice to see something like this. It's slow and methodical. Moody and mellow but interesting. Not quite at the same level as Gone Home but a nice departure from the standard fare. It was made with Unity, which I respect, but there was some unnecessary slowdown in areas because of poor structuring of the 3D geometry. I was able to work around it every time and it didn't keep me from enjoying the game. There was only one spot I had trouble and had to get a hint which is good. Overall I found it enjoyable and would recommend it.			"

												Lifeless Planet's goal is similar to that of many ""walking simulators"", but its execution is what sets it apart.The game's emphasis is on telling the story of a world and providing the player an immersive experience through the environment and atmosphere. However, this is punctuated by segments of 3D platforming, with the use of a burst jet pack, and puzzle solving. The base platforming, with a single jet burst available, is simple and serves to make traversal of regions more interesting that only walking. The occasions in which multiple bursts are provided are more challenging, and sometimes thrilling. Timing the multiple bursts to provide just the right height and/or distance to reach the next platform is tense, even moreso when you're looking down into a vast crevase below you.Puzzlesolving is relatively straightforward and repetitive, with the real highlights being the brief platforming segments sometimes provided.But the real focus of the game are the story of the world and the story of your character. The world's story is told in pieces given every 10 to 20 minutes as you discover areas, clear areas, and solve puzzles. Areas provide the geographic history of the planet through minerals and the human story on the world through documents, audio logs, and structures. Atmosphere is crucial to this with setpieces and haunting string and synth tracks to set the mood for each area.Presentation of the story is well done. The story pieces are slowly presented and several times lead the player to assume what has happened to the planet before a new piece of information causes you to look at all of the previous information in a different light. You progress under this view as newer pieces seem to back it, when another new piece of information causes you to reconsider all of the prior information once again. This occurs a few times to great success without it feeling as though the developer has pulled it out of nowhere.TL;DR - If you like walking simulators you'll probably like Lifeless Planet. If you haven't tried a walking simulator before then Lifeless Planet is a good starting point.			"

I would definately recommend this to someone looking for a good sci-fi indie game who doesnt need to blow somethings head off every ten minutes with gun. The atmosphere is great and I wont go into detail about the story but  if you feel like you arent really getting into it just push through a little farther and make it to the end. It is a decent payoff, leaves you feeling like a game should in my opinion by giving you alittle what you want but not everything.			"

												Lifeless Planet sells itself as an action adventure tribute to Cold War era science fiction. What’s clear from the very beginning of the game is its dedication to creating a rich atmosphere and an engaging plot, but its gameplay may be unable to keep up with the elements surrounding it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE1CXAXP9XM&list=PL3DFDLFub9-pGLzqUqejMmyNwvJo5Qz7C&index=1It starts with an international space mission’s crash landing on a planet that was supposed to be covered with a blanket of life. Of course, when the unnamed astronaut the player controls wakes up, they find their crew missing and the planet lifeless – just as the game’s name suggests.  The astronaut must explore a barren landscape to find his crew and figure out why the planet has turned to waste. The astronaut provides commentary and occasional flashbacks to reveal a character left troublingly lonesome after the loss of his wife. The fair voice performances and writing are enough for the clichéd premise to be convincing and successfully instill loneliness to the player. What really makes it work is the raw isolationist tone emanating from the very composition of the environment. Grand expanses of seemingly endless nothing stretch out towards the horizons. Massive cliffs, rocks, and mountains dot the landscape to remind the player just how small we humans are. The camera itself is positioned purposefully distant from the player to compound the humbling effect. The astronaut is small, lost, and alone. The player feels small lost and alone. As the game progresses, the mood evolves with it. The environments become increasingly hostile and sinister in appearance. Horror elements are sprinkled in adding an effective sensation of uneasiness. It’s not terrifying, but it does venture into unnerving areas to evoke the frightening nature of space exploration. Regardless, the astronaut keeps going. According to the occasional loading screen, it’s what his wife would have wanted. He eventually comes across the ruins of a Soviet colony, adding new elements to the mystery. Why are the Soviets here, how did they get here, and what happened to them? Logs from the colony’s leader can be discovered providing clues into the planets colonization and destruction. It’s no surprise the story’s themes play heavily with the environmental consequences of man’s hubris, but the game trickles out new information and insights at a satisfying rate. New ideas are consistently unveiled, often altering previously formed understandings of the plot. It successfully provides answers leading to more and more questions. While the outcome likely won’t take anyone by surprise, the long and twisted road to get there is a deeply fulfilling mystery. Unfortunately, the quest for understanding might as well be the sole driving force of Lifeless Planet as its gameplay leaves much to be desired. For the most part, there isn’t much to do other than walk from clue to clue while admiring the game’s rustic beauty along the way. It’s almost enough to work as an endearing walking sim, but it adds clumsy mechanics on top of what could have been a purely explorative adventure. The most common obstacle is basic platforming, but the game lacks tight enough controls to be anything more than frustrating. It requires the mastery of managing forward based momentum over precision jumping. This direction makes thematic sense with the planets low gravity and generally large settings, but it ends up feeling as though the player can lose control at any moment. The problem is made more evident when the player comes across special jetpack fuel allowing for multiple bursts. With triumphant music accompanying the new ability, these moments are presented as empowering, but the sight of fuel canisters often produces dread. More boosts means longer jumps, and longer jumps provide more opportunity for failure. The particulars of the game’s physics can be learned over time, but successfully landing a jump never feels skillful. Getting past a platforming segment should feel like an accomplishment, not a relief. Occasionally a lite puzzle will block the way, but calling them lite puzzles feels a tad gracious. Solutions are always obvious and are never far away. More often than not, they only require a peculiar sphere to be placed inside an equally peculiar obelisk providing power to doors or elevators. A cool mechanical arm is sometimes required, but it isn’t used for anything remarkable. It’s just conceptually intriguing and nothing more. The puzzles never give an intellectual challenge, but do succeed in managing the games pacing while occasionally triggering neat visual treats. 	While lacking in enjoyable gameplay, the game’s mysteries and environments are enough to carry the game to its conclusion. Lifeless Planet is occasionally frustrating and often vapid, but still manages to be engaging and beautiful.			"

There was alot of nothingness. Now dont get me wrong I understand the game is called ""Lifeless Planet"" and all but the mountains and endless desert sceens could have had cooler rock formations or more alien ruins. When I play a game though I find the story more important anyway and this game definetly had a great story! I give it a 7.5/10			"

At some point you start to jump alot more and get to know the possibilities into the game. Level design and sound was great and worked fine together.

												The Good: Breathtaking environments and a well placed soundtrack make for an amazing atmosphere.  The puzzles themselves are very straightforward but still meaningful. The story is a bit of a stretch but it never made me stop playing, on the contrary I wanted to see what happens next.The Bad: Lots of walking ... there was one specific level where you tight rope walk across a giant canyon where the walking actually made sense and which I actually enjoyed.  Elsewhere it just seemed like a chore.  There were a few rough level transitions and the controls did get a little finicky at times.Overall I recommend buying this during a sale and playing on a rainy day when you have nothing else to do.

												A puzzle platformer where the puzzling and platforming are secondary to the story and exploration elements.Don't expect amazing gameplay here or even much of a challenge beyond some tough jumps, but where the game really shines is in the story.  Both the plot and the way it is revealed are executed extremely well, leaving out enough detail for you to piece together your own conclusions but not leaving you confused or lost.  The soundtrack by Rich Douglas astounds as well, and adds to the mysterious and sometime treacherous atmosphere.My first playthrough was around 7 hours, I could have been quicker but I got to see almost everything there is to see in that time.

												I found this game to be such a huge disappointment because it always made me feel like it was building up for some huge grand finalie. All the way up to the end of the last cutscene I was expecting something. Everytime I thought some sort of plot climax was going to show up, nothing happened. I figured that it was getting me excited and building up for something really shocking or worth 4 hours of my life, but everytime I was disappointed. It's as though this story completely skipped the climax and the falling action. It just went from rising action to resolution. If you want a game with a great story, Half Life (any game or episode is great), any Bioshock game, or even Minecraft has a better story than this game. tl;dr: It is a decent game but the story left a lot to be desired.

												*No spoilers*First of all, I absolutely loved the game, but I would suggest only buying it on sale. I bought it at around $10, so 50% off, and I'd say that's the maximum it's worth. For it to cost more it would need at least better graphics or other improvements.Pros:-Great story-OK graphics-Atmosphere of the game is set up perfectly-Short, the story line would have dragged on otherwiseCons:-At times it can seem like endless walking, but mostly it was broken up enough that it wasn't mind-numbing-Puzzles weren't very difficult and were sometimes repetitive-EasyPros Explained:This sci fi story was superb. It's open-ended enough to let you form your own opinions but it still leaves you satisfied. The graphics aren't the most beautiful. The landscapes are stunning even if they aren't perfect, but you can definitely see the limitations when it comes to people. But what can you expect from an indie game made mostly by one person? I loved the feeling of the game. The barren landscape really made me feel like I was all alone on the planet; it added to the story as it made me feel apart of it. I read complaints about the length of the game, but with this type of game I think it would become tiresome if it were longer.Cons Explained:At some points the walking would become annoying and I would stop playing. I had to be in the mood to play this game as it is on the slow side. I mostly played in spurts because I would get bored and tired of the walking if I played for too long. There are puzzles scattered throughout the game and are pretty entertaining the first time you do the type of puzzle, but every new type of puzzle introduced is used at least 2 or 3 more times and are virtually the same, maybe a pattern is changed. This got irksome at points but was mostly easy to overlook. The game does pretty much hold your hand when you are exploring, but it is almost necessary as otherwise you would be wandering for hours to finish the first few levels. The paths you follow are clearly laid out but there is still an element of adventure despite this. Overall:The game is fantastic and I loved every minute of it. The setbacks are mostly easy to ignore. The game seems to be exactly what the creator, David Board, wanted it to be: ""something different from what you usually get from the big studios and publishers"" (from the lifeless planet website). I highly recommend the game to anyone looking for a relaxing yet charming game.			"

												Awesome space game. Really feels like you're exploring a remote planet. Intriguing story. Maybe a bit short for some people, I don't often have a lot of time for playing so this length works for me :) Would love a sequel.			"

												Lifelss Planet is an interesting game, the premise especially is rather intriguing. Overall its a nice game that ultimately falls short of greatness, basically because its kind of limited in its diversity, coupled with the fact that its fairly easy. While as I said its fairly easy - without any complicated puzzles or dificult platforming action, this is also a stength (in a sense) because it allows you to stay in touch with the story flow, rather dealing with the mechanics of beating specific locations.The graphics are good and convey the dull atmosphere of the lifeless planet rather well. The music is at times amazing and very very atmospheric.The story itself is good, which begins really well and ends on a good note as well (even if it becomes slightly predictable after a point).Generally the game is a bit expensive for its offering. It will only take you a few hours to finish, and I cant see (for myself atleast) much of a chance of replaying it.Still I have to say that I enjoyed it and thus would recomend it, especially if its on sale, as for a lower price it would be good value for the entertainment.

												It's honest. It is indeed a walking simulator...but at least you have failure state (99.9% of the time being a gravity-induced face-plant). But that's not to say this game isn't worth your time, even if you've watched a let's play. In fact, there is an acheivement for a zero-death first time walkthrough, which unfortunately means you almost certainly MUST watch a let's play to even stand a chance. I myself never died due to the primary 'adversaries' (no spoilers, I just decided not to touch anything I didn't have to), but boy did gravity decide to rear its ugly head again, and was the bane of my existance.It's little bit unfair of an acheivement, but at least it's one of those achievements where if you see someone has 100% achievements completed in every game they've ever played, and that zero-death first-runthrough achievement is among them, you can safely say they modded.It has a pretty good story, and that's pretty much it. There are puzzle and plateforming elements, but never anything that will end your playthrough. What it is really is an interactive movie, basically. But there is good news, which might sell you on it: There is absolutely no quick time events (QTEs). However, the game story dictates when or when not to use a jet pack, and when you do or don't need oxygen.  There are no meters, and you cannot refill when you want to. In the case of the oxygen, you don't ever need to refill unless the game finds it necessary for the plot.I don't think the majority of people would actually find this game boring...especially when there is an achievement to encounter every morbid death in the game. I haven't tried that yet, but I think I will now that I've completed the game not touching anything. Now I'll touch everything...that poor astronaut...All and all, I suppose you can some up the game with this phrase, when you reach the end: ""Well, this is going to be one heck of a debriefing...""

												I really wanted to enjoy Lifeless Planet. The concept, storyline, and graphics all pulled together to immediately catch my attention. But after actually playing through, all I could do was sit back and say ""... how about that.""The only way to make the game more linear would be to release it as an ebook. The game virtually plays itself, and leaves almost no room for exploration or decision-making. You either follow Path A or you die. While that at first sounds sensible given the whole ""marooned survival"" aspect of the game -- where your options are, by design, very limited -- it quickly becomes tiring.Run in a straight line from point A to point B. Find miraculous emergency supply of air. Watch cutscene C. Run to point D. Find miraculous emergency supply of air. Watch cutscene E. Run to point F. Search for hidden item G. Surprise - find miraculous emergency supply of air. Wash, rinse, repeat.The entire backstory about the Soviet space program feels like an afterthought. Which is unfortunate, because ... well, that's the entire plot of the game. The concept itself -- being marooned on a planet only to find you weren't the first human to set foot there -- is great and ripe with potential. But in this case, it wound up feeling like a hastily-written backstory to flesh out someone's desire to write what basically amounts to a first-person platformer on Mars.The graphics left a lot to be desired in terms of depth and creativity. This felt more like a 90s VR demo and less like a modern game.Long story short, I really, really wanted to enjoy this game. The story has tremendous potential and could easily have been expanded upon. But at the end of the day this felt like someone came up with a great idea, then slapped a mediocre platformer around it, and called it ""indie"" so people would excuse the subdstandard quality.			"

												I enjoyed Lifeless Planet (played on a Mac, using a Logitech gamepad for control). The look and the sound are great, pulling you into the game's atmosphere. The story is quite interesting, as it is gradually revealed through logs and recordings you find as you explore. The game has a few mechanical problems though, which sucked out some of the fun.Some aspects of the game felt very ""gamey"" and mechanical, which pulled you out of the story a bit. The astronaut's oxygen supply and jet-pack fuel definitely felt very scripted, lasting arbitrarily just as long as the plot required. It would have been nice to be able to get some benefit, for example, from being economical with fuel, so as to be able to use it later.I found the controls a bit wonky, but tolerable. The camera, however, is pretty awful; it gets jammed in the geometry again and again, and at some critical points forces one to jump ""blind"" unless you get your positioning exactly right. There are also way too many places where the astronaut can get hopelessly stuck in the geometry.. Having said all that, I have played Lifeless Planet through multiple times, and still go back to play a level from time to time, so I overall, I definitely recommend this game.			"

												Picket this up on Steam Sale for $10.  I think it was well worth it :)A simple premise that slowly evolves through the game play.  I agree with other people who say it's more of a story you get to walk through.  Most of the puzzels were fairly straight forward but the scenery was well done, especially the sun effects and the hot springs.  The music was fantastic as well!The only downside I would say is a few of the level transitions were a little choppy.  That and the cut scene near the end could have been a bit longer.  However, once I saw the kickstarter credits at the end it made sense and the ending was quite satisfying so I'd give it a thumbs up.			"

												really disppointed for this game .... I was waiting something really more interresting .... Well how to start ? Firstly, it was look like an explorating game : wrong, it's a plateform game .... Well, not really annoying... But the game is based on jump and walk and it's really difficult to play it as it is, you know, that kind of game where everything is greasy.After that, the game is a long corridor, more a narative game without any challenge : you alternate between boring puzzles and jumping plateforms. Background is missing I think, most of the time there is like nothing to see and everything is so obvious when you need it. Well, for the quality graphic I will not talk about it 'cause it's not a thing I could include on review but they are not too ugly.Story is too much classical and that was where I was hoping so much : we are like waiting for an amazing thing and we've got a very basic story with issues on scenarios (time with oxygen, cut scene and .... Where the ♥♥♥♥ Am I ? , black points on the board that should be more developped ....) I cannot believe in these days we still could have ""walls of the minds"" like I am walking and ... Oh ... Why I can't go over here ? There is nothing ! Sound design have issues : sometimes the ambiant is too much noisy or not in adequation of the scene.Well ... I want to finish with a really good thing on it : the music . Amazing ! Just amazing ! Mix of violins and kind of Jean Michel Jarre, I could say it's a really great thing in it. And the last scene of the game which it is very good. For me, 20 bucks for this game is really too much ... I had it with Steam promotions and thanks for it. Bur I wanna see other games from this company as it is .... well .... Maybe a ""first try"" and not so good as expected but it feels like there is lot of motivations and good ideas. Whishing that they will evolve in the good way ;).			"

												Overall I enjoyed this game greatly, although there are some caveats.  Although Lifeless Planet is referred to as a ""walking simulator"" it doesn't neatly fit into that category, insofar as there is a LOT of platformer action throughout.  The Good:The story is what is at the core of this game, however and it is pretty awesome.  The way it is slowly told throughout the game keeps your interest up.  The visuals also match the narrative very well--they help set the mood and whomever designed them did an outstanding job.  The game's length is also great...not short by any means, but not so long that things get drawn out needlessly.  I enjoyed the fact that despite the vastness of the world, the correct path is fairly evident (in most cases).  Also, the storytelling elements (notebooks, recordings, etc.) are not hidden--i.e. you do not have to scour every corner of the map (which can be vast in some areas) just to look for ""clues"" or narrative elements.The Bad:The platformer sections, however, are very hit or miss.  I appreciated this element of the game, but the experience was undermined in places by the game's most obvious flaw--the controls.  I played Lifeless Planet both with Keyboard/mouse as well as the Steam Controller.  Control of your character could be very sloppy in places, making certain timed jumps extremely difficult to execute.  On one section, I literally had to try to execute 6 consecutive jumps well over 50 times.  This particularly section was poorly designed and the fact that your avatar ""drifts"" was borderline unfair and marred the experience.  Although not consistently a problem, when your avatar is in a tight environment, the camera perspective is every bit as poor as the original Alone in the Dark from the early 90s.  Finally--and this is sort of inexcusable--there are a number of areas on maps where you can ""get stuck.""  If you happen to jump in some areas (e.g. between rocks or next to a structure) you can be stuck there and have to re-load from the last checkpoint.  I have no idea why some of these negative elements were not patched, but expect to encounter them and be annoyed.Verdict:I really liked the game and would highly recommend it to folks who enjoy slow, story-rich ""walking sims.""  The story, not the platformer elements, are what makes the game so watch the trailer and if you feel drawn in by the narrative, you'll probably really like Lifeless Planet.			"

												Picked up this game tonight on sale for just under $7. I played for 5 hours and completed it. I couldn't put it down! If I had to sum this up in one sentence: A jumping puzzle, platformer with minor puzzles to solve along the way and a fairly interesting story. The music accompanied the atmosphere perfectly, graphics aren't all that fancy but get the job done. Would love to see this game redone with better graphics and visuals! My only complaint is the controls can be hard to handle in certain situations (when you jump, you keep moving forward until you hit something; which means you need to plan each jump carefully). But there were only a few jumps where I needed more than one more try to make, and it never took me more than 3 tries. (hint: Sometimes there is an easier path to take). The story is rather strange. But, considering you're on another planet I guess anything is possible. But it was interesting enough to compell me to want more. There were 2 maybe 3 areas where I wasn't sure where to go and it took me a bit of running around to figure it out. (hint: In the volcanic area, look in every direction and make sure you've gone down every path... you'll get out eventually).All in all, this game was well worth the sale price I paid (probably not so much the regular price due to only being 5 hours (for me anyway) to complete. But definitely glad I bought it. Replay value is probably nil since once you've completed it and know the story, it won't interest you to go through it again - not immediately anyway.I'd give this 4 out of 5 stars. Grab it now if it's still on sale. It's worth the few bucks to kill 5 hours. :)			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game. The idea itself is brilliant, but the plot is all over the place. It's like they couldn't figure out which way they wanted the game to go and so they just mixed up a lot, which is a huge shame. The puzzle's are fine, but this game is super glitchy, and often the way to go around is all messed up and you end up wasting time trying to figure out exactly where to go.I think this game is what you make it to be. If you can see the story it's actually kinda good, but sadly it just doesn't shine through. I truly wish they'd take this game up and make a complete remake of it.With all that being said, I will still recommend it, BUT only if it's on sale and you don't have any better way to spend your money.

												The kind of game you play when you want to relax during a hot summer day, with the fan humming besides you and the cicadas singing outside. Or maybe during a cold evening, after a hard day at work and before going to bed.Anyway, this game is not about action, challenge or solving head-scratching puzzles. It's not even exploration per se. It's all about the atmosphere. You just wander on a mysterious planet (not as lifeless as it seems), admiring the landscapes and unravelling the story of the earthlings who lived here. This is not an open world, the puzzles are easy to solve and the platform sequences won't give you a hard time. It still feels rewarding as you're constantly progressing through the game and discovering new environments.However, the game is long enough to keep you entertained for several hours.The various environments are coherent and fascinating, even if the graphics are simplistic.The music is nice but could have played a greater role.The gameplay is simple and the character reacts smoothly.The background story is just oppressive enough to make you beg for more.A few bugs -like falling through the floor- but nothing serious.Loved it.

Games that looked cutting edge in the ear;y 2000's drive me crazy, and this is 100% that... and yet....It's a jumping game for people who hate jumping games, with more heart and soul than a lot of major production games you'll pick up these days...And the soundtrack!!!!!! If you think Fallout 3 & 4 were lacking in having that dark, spooky, etheral, long drawn out obo and bass and screeching violins from 1 & 2 and long streches of New Vegas...  Ugh this soundtrack is the greatest thing in ages.  It's worth full price, it's CERTAINLY not to be missed during Steam Sales...  I'll be gifting this fairly often.			"

												I've only played the game once through, at a casual pace.  My personal opinion on the game is that it kept me wanting to know what was going to happen next, or I have to see what's over the horizon.  The only thing that lightly got aggrivating was the camera but it didn't stop me from playing the game. There aren't any REAL jump scares (if you are wondering) in the game although the feeling of being alone may bother some and the musical score can be creepy at some points haha. Yes, you can die in this game, but the checkpoints are spaced out pretty good so you don't have to do a whole lot to get back to where you were. I completely recommend this game if you are looking for a casual adventure with some mazes, platforming and super light puzzles. I loved it and wished there was more to the story!			"

												I am enjoying the game and its narrative, but the puzzles aren't as challenging as I was hoping. I also got frustrated a few times by how much hand-holding in-game guidance there is! I understand it's a difficult needle to thread between losing players and over-explaining, so other users experience may be different! Still, I enjoyed the game, so I'll recommend it -- just don't expect Myst-level puzzles!			"

												I actually really enjoyed this game. At times I felt like I was doing a lot of running around. Some people had mentioned the plot was dull but I think if you actually take the time to read everything instead of just trying to get through the game it will make it more interesting. Highly recommend it for a single player game.			"

												You're an astronaut who crashlands on a supposed Earth like planet only to discover it's a wasteland, all rock and sand... and buildings? Your crew are gone, you need to find them and discover what is happening. Is this real or a dream?Lifeless Planet is a good game. It starts off slowly but once you figure out what you need to do it rolls along smoothly. There's no violence or shooting, just puzzle solving and an intriquing storyline that makes you want to find out what awaits you over the next hill.Someone wrote ""I don't recommend this game because there is a lot of running and jumping."" Sorry, did I not mention all the running and jumping? That's all part of the fun. The puzzles keep you thinking but rarely cause problems.A good story, well told, some decent puzzles with a good variety of landscapes. Shouldn't take much more than 10 hours even with some exploring thrown in.			"

												I've only played the game once through, at a casual pace.  My personal opinion on the game is that it kept me wanting to know what was going to happen next, or I have to see what's over the horizon.  The only thing that lightly got aggrivating was the camera but it didn't stop me from playing the game. There aren't any REAL jump scares (if you are wondering) in the game although the feeling of being alone may bother some and the musical score can be creepy at some points haha. Yes, you can die in this game, but the checkpoints are spaced out pretty good so you don't have to do a whole lot to get back to where you were. I completely recommend this game if you are looking for a casual adventure with some mazes, platforming and super light puzzles. I loved it and wished there was more to the story!			"

												There needs to be a way to change the default controls. The controls for keyboard users is irritatingly difficult.			"

												No enough environment variation and gameplay is a bit repetitive.			"
