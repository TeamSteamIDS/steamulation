Just a simple story about one man's plight in the face of fatherly duties and mundane tasks-- which he, of course, finds completely easy and by no means complicated in any way-- and his struggle with living in a world of judgmental peers who obviously harbor envious feeling in regards to his most gentlemanly fashion sense. So many ties! Such fancy hats. And many references to cultural icons that a man who lives on top of the land and never takes off his suit would definitely recognize. Not sure why everyone is so tickled by this video gamery. Maybe they should have called this Totally Human Motor Skills Simulator 2014?)			"

												Overall, I liked this game.  It was well-scripted and had some nice action scenes.  A few small issues though:1.  Animation.  The protagonist looks like an octopus.  I think this is a glitch.2.  Voice acting.  Overall, pretty good, but the main guy's words are always garbled and unintelligble.  I thought at first this was intentional as some sort of weird joke, but the other characters understand him!3.  Controls.  I press buttons and my legs and arms kind of just wind and wiggle all over.  Game is still beatable, but much harder than if I could just walk and jump like if it was working.It's good enough that I would still buy it with this issues, but fix these and it's a no-brainer!

												I feel like it's rare to find a video game that's funny. Not the kind of ""funny"" that Borderlands 2 tried to be, where the development team ham-fistedly shoved in as many internet memes and pop culture references as possible, devoid of any meaningful context. I'm also not talking about an ostentatious satire of modern Polish political dealings (though if you find one of those, let me know immediately). No, the kind of funny I'm talking about is just chaotic, goofball, slapstick comedy. Not a biting social commentary, no gritty world, and no over-abundance of the color brown. It makes you laugh because it's just straight-up silly.It's no surprise, then, that I adore Octodad: Dadliest Catch (what a great subtitle, by the way). Developed by a team of college students, the original Octodad was a humorous concept but something of a technical mess. That's okay, because it was just a school project that they decided to release to the world. Dadliest Catch is the full realization of the inherently comedic ideas: You're an octopus moonlighting as a human man, trying to hide from your human family the fact that you are an octopus. You go about mundane, inconspicuous human activites such as mowing the lawn, making coffee, and grilling hamburgers with the kind of stunning precision one would expect from an octopus. If you're not already sold, then I don't know what to tell you. The controls are loose and imprecise in a way that really feels like you're trying to control a bipedal octopus-man, but they're also consistant in a way that keeps the player from feeling any lack of agency over Octodad's actions. The ragdoll physics of Octodad's body only serve to add a level of awkwardness to everything you're trying to do. Within the first five minutes of gameplay, I accidentally found myself completely wrapped around a floor lamp, writhing on the floor like an octopus wrapped about a lamp. I tried to think of a better analogy, but I'm pretty sure you can imagine that situation. I was also laughing hysterically at the ridiculous situation Octodad had gotten himself into.Technicallly, this game is pretty impressive. It's very well optimised, with a consistantly high framerate on my admittedly below-average PC. The art style is cartoony and clean, and all of the colors pop like a Technicolor movie. It's a world totally suited to Octodad's wacky hijinks. The non-octopus characters are a pleasant surprise as well: they're caricatures of some modern personality tropes such as the overly cynical journalist or the too-smart-for-her-age daughter. One character I particularly enjoyed was the chef, but I'll refrain from spoiling those moments here.Now, normally I dislike reference-based humor. I feel like it's never done well, because it's just shoved in your face as if to say, ""Look as this! We know about that thing you know about! Aren't we timely/clever? LOOK AT OUR RELEVANCE!"" Octodad: Dadliest Catch makes some pretty direct references to other indie games. For example, in the supermarket level, there's a table at the back with a breakfast cereal that is a Minecraft reference. It's not right in your face, and you might even miss it if you look too fast. If you go up and try to grab the block modeled after Minecraft's Creeper enemies, it'll briefly flash and then explode in a small cloud of smoke. It's not subtle, per se, but it's not trying to rub its relevance in your face. I really appreciate that quality, and the entire game is sprinkled with similar little touches like that.Octodad: Dadliest Catch has been in the spotlight since its huge appearance on stage at the PlayStation 4 conference at E3 2013. Since then, the hype has been steadily growing, all culminating in a final release which absolutely delivers on everything I ever wanted Octodad to be. Young Horses makes an incredible debut with a technically solid, gut-bustingly funny video game. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with Octodad: Dadliest Catch, and I can't wait to see what's next.			"

												Octodad is a game about an octopus. But not just any octopus. He's married. He has children. He wears a stylin' suit. He's Octodad! The player will control Octodad as he goes about his ""normal"" life, undertaking seemingly mundane tasks for his family. Its sounds very simple, but the controls....the controls make it a huge challenge. And that's where this game shines! The controls make for some hilarious moments, and that's what this game is all about. It's not meant to be serious, but more of a fun, relaxing adventure full of laughs and mishaps. It has a very lighthearted story, and you come to love the brave, fatherly octopus. Don't ask how he had 2 human children though...The controls are...well, atrocious. You use the mouse to manipulate his arms and legs. Pressing Spacebar toggles between moving your arms or legs. You press and hold the right mouse button and move the mouse in the direction you want the arm/leg to move. It sounds easier than it really is because the mouse is very sensitive, so a slight move will send his arms/legs everywhere, toppling everything nearby over! Be careful how much commotion you cause, as a bar across the bottom of the screen fills up when you are nearby any people and they see you knocking stuff over. When the bar is full, that's it! Your disguise is blown, and you restart from your last checkpoint. After a little while the player should get used to the sensitivity of the mouse and be able to complete most tasks in a relatively short time...just expect several tries as you go!If you liked and enjoyed games such as Surgeon Simulator 2013, Probably Archery, or even Ampu-Tea, you owe it to yourself to give Octodad: Dadliest Catch a try. The antics you will get into is well worth the pricetag.Recommended! "

												Octodad: Dadliest Catch, also known as ""Being High In Public Simulator 2014"".Story is about an octopus, which is Octodad(Player) living life with her wife(Scarlet)and two kids named Tommy(son) and Stacy(daughter). Being an octopus isn't easy, because there is this person, a chef(Fujimoto) that wants to turn you into moderately priced sushies. You know like those 10 sushies stacked and sold for $2.99 per plate.Game is simple, you play as Octodad. Then you begin your adventure.Game is fun and the controls are great with cool story! A very fun destruction game with fun story and seriously good soundtracks and graphics.Very recommended for singleplayer or co-op, if you would like to play with your friends and pals, this game is very suitable. Really good game if you want some big laugh.You would never find any more foolish games in Steam.This game is the most unique game ever made...You SHOULD try it out, even for $14.99.Update: The developers updated the game with two mini-levels. They're both pretty fun and made me want to go back and replay the whole game again. Score:IT'S OVER 9000!			"

												Don't let the ""crappy goat simulator-type game with no redeeming qualities"" impression fool you, this is like, an actual legitimate video game. With a story, custscenes, controls and everything. No purposeful glitchiness, no pewdiepie-tier memeosity. It looks like just another crappy simulator fad that nobody will remember 2 weeks from now (I am bread, goat simulator i'm looking at you) but it's anything but. The community workshop allows you to make, share and download your own levels and skins to your heart's content. While the main story is admittedly really short, it's more than made up for with the endless community content, acheivements, extra shorts and even some cute easter eggs here and there. It's on sale for only $4 as of now, so I HIIIIIGHLYYYY reccomend you pick it up before the sale ends. 9.3/10			"

												One of the funniest games in the last couple of years! Yes, it's a 3D comic game. Yes, it's colourful. Yes, it's also funny for kids. Yes, the story is far fetched. Yes, the music is cool. Yes, it's not too easy but also not too hard. Yes, it's many hours of hilarious fun. Yes, the physics are good.But you know what? The control of Octodad is a blast! YOu have 2 control modes which you switch with the middle mouse button. One is walking ... sometimes sliding ... by pressing left/right mouse for the left/right leg ... erm ... arm. The other mode is just for controling your right arm ... errr ... just another arm. While in control of your legs/arm, you move the mouse to stear it in the 3D room. The controls are really intuitive after you get used to it. Much easier than e.g. in Surgeon SImulator 2013.Octodad is always in motion - well, it's not that easy to ""stay"" on 4 arms to somehow hide your appearance in a human trouser. It's a little slimy, slippery and jelly like movement. You can grab/hold things by usiong your vaccuum arm. The arms are also quite elastic and can stretch about twice it's size when holding unmovable things. You can also throw obstacles around. You also swim totally nacked just like a real octopus in the water. And have to solve lots of puzzles and quests.I bought this game for my children, but it's so much fun, that I had to play it, too. If you like to have a good time - palay Octodad! :-)			"

												This one is a hard ""No"" to give. At it's current price, for what it gives, Octodad: Dadliest Catch is NOT worth it. The game's about an hour and a half long, for $15? Now, if this price ever goes down to, say, $5 or so, this would be an absolute ""YES"". Octodad is a funny game, with chuckles throughout, the sheer obsurdity of what you can do is always worth a laugh, the silly theme song is great. However, the game feels like it's over before it even starts. The last 30 minutes or so of the game are some of the most annoying trial-and-error types of gameplay that I've ever seen. Yes, the controls are bad, I get it. Having to 'sneak' past people is annoying in this, having to walk across a narrow path as fast as you can is also annoying. Instant-death attacks that go through walls and physics objects are also not fun.But with that out of the way, everything else in Octodad is extremely fun! The writing is silly enough to work, the subtitled blubs that Octodad gives are rather funny at times. The objectives you're given are fun.But that's really all you can say about this. It's just so extremely short. Lower that price to $7.50 or even $10, and I'll change my review accordingly, but at $15 for a regular, non-launch purchase? Not worth it. Wait for a price drop, or sale.Edit: To people saying this review is not helpful, please let me know how it is not helpful, and I will work on adjusting it as such.			"

I picked this game up with no idea what to expect. I somehow missed the first version of the game (perhaps due to my complete lack of knowledge on the series as is apparent at the start of my video), but going into this game I found myself pleasantly surprised. With all the mentions of humour in this game I was kind expecting some hyped up world full of modern pop culture references where I'd need Know Your Meme open up on the other monitor or something, but thankfully we got something a whole lot better than that. This game is funny because it's stupid. Stupid in a good way. The way you control the character, the way he moves, the way he looks, the way you get caught up in a kitchen table and flying around the room in an attempt to make yourself a cup of coffee is most enjoyable. The story is great because it is so simple. Who knew outside the world of menial task simulators would you find yourself having fun in a game where you go to the supermarket or mow the lawn? Despite having the ability to take full control of your character, as you learn the ropes of the controls you find a complete unpredictability with how you're going to find yourself next, and it's hilarious. In fact because of the strange and unique way you control the character, I found a sense of achievement when I managed to complete something, then had to laugh at myself for feeling that sense of achievement because I managed to get my character out of a door properly. The graphics are lovely and of a very nice quality, it's definitely a nice game to look at. It's simple but cartoony. It performs great and feels well optimized. The controls take some time to get used to but that's half the fun.It's a charming and unique game with a hilariously strange character and well worth checking out. Would recommend!			"

												You are a family man, looking after your wife and kids, doing all sorts of every-day tasks such as mowing the lawn or going food shopping, and taking a trip to the aquarium. The only catch? you are an octopus. You can't let anyone find out so you must act as human and casual as possible.With fun and goofy controls to control Octodad's tentacles to get by without anyone knowing is definitely great fun, and mixed with a fun storyline with some great dialog, it was a real treat to play. What makes this game even more fantastic is the ability to play co-op with 2 to 4 people with each person controlling a limb or two! This makes for a great couch co-op experience, and greatly adds to the challenge of the game. Hidden ties help you to constantly search and explore, and the wonderful achievements give some extra challenges along the way. A thoroughly enjoyable experience, especially with a partner.Pros:+ Cute storyline+ Awesome dialogue (with pretty good voice acting too)+ Unique and goofy controls offer a fun and challenging gameplay experience+ Solo and co-op up to 4 people+ Controller support for a great couch co-op experience+ Challenging achievements+ Workshop support for player made levels and mods+ Well hidden ties to collect every level keep you exploringCons:- The achievement for dying 100 times in a playthrough can be a little tedious (pretty hard to die 100 times by accident)- Overall quite a short story (if you are good at the game), however co-op greatly extends the gameplay experience.My Score: 8/10 "

												Life as a family man is good. You have a lovely wife, two childrens and wounderful house. Life is easy!..or it should be, but it's not, because you're an Octopus, but no one suspects a thing!This game's controls for PC version, is wanky. That is why it's recomented to use ps3 or xbox controller, but sadly, I don't own one. So for the PC people, it's hard and frustrating sometimes to pick up coffe beans, pour some milk, or try to climb up slippery stairs. Some levels are easy, and some hard, but like every level in the game, has some difficulty spickes. And everytime when you just fail to do one simple thing more than 5 times, you just want to conteniue, and then you just randomly do it. The look is cartoonish, and it looks pretty. Also the humor is good. And the game has it's moments. So if you like fun cartoonish games with good story, I recomed to buy this. PLUS the DLCs are free, but a bit short. Still, it's worth of every penny.			"

												Octodad: Dadliest Catch is one of the fresh water finds out there. I am hooked. Shell I expplain? This 10 out of TEN tickles every adventure, stealth, satire bone in my body. It will have you kraken up. You won't need to cast a wide need to find something enjoyable in this game. Sure, it's not the most challenging treasure hunt out there, but that not the porpoise. Hilarity sails this title in the right direction. After few minutes of play, you will master the controls and you will never feel like a beach whaled. If I havn't made this clear enough, this game is fintastic. You won't feel gillty paying full price for this title.			"

												Don't get me wrong. The game is both fun mechanically, and funny in it's writing and story. Cute characters, funny situations, entertaining gameplay.However, it's short. Much too short. I personally finished in an hour, most people seem to be getting 90 minutes to two hours out of it. It has just four short and one kinda long level, and there's so many more situations they could have put our spineless protagonist in for more hilarity. How does he function at the office? What antics does the family get up to on holidays? How's his driving? What does other kids at school say when he comes to pick up his two lil' darlings? So many dadly situations they could've put him in, and they opt for just a wedding, a morning, grocery shopping and an aquarium trip.I'd wish I could recommend it, because I really did find it fun while it lasted. However, in the end, it's just the same feeling I got off Surgeon Simulator, a one-note game that relies on your own screw-ups for entertainment, and with much too little content to warrant it's price.

												There's something magic about this game!It's not only the ""dumb"" little indie game it looks like.The game is actually fun, and the main character is lovable.Everything is at the right place, the characters, the whole silliness, the comic factor, the slapstick, the challenges ecc...Octodad is fun and lighthearted, with a challenging, yet rewarding, control system.I'd say it's a littel gem, with its only problem being that is, unfortunately, a SMALL gem.The longevity, as a matter of fact, is the only downside of the game.When you think the game is going to reach the climax it ends, ...it can even be completed in less than 2 hours, by a skilled player.The very small price you can buy it for, though, highly compensates for the duration of the experience.Pros:- Charming, in every single way- Happy- A Billion Easter Eggs- Nice Control System (and quite precise)- Many things to do- Nice characters- Amazing level design, accomplished with a modest graphics engine- Fun Achievments- Really funny and comicCons:- There are occasional parts of levels which are too ""dry"" (talking about graphics)- Very Short (even though it encourages at least one replay for the achievments)In the end i would love to see a new, longer and complete chapter, with the same features, but an expanded gameplay.For now it's a well promoted experiment.

												Truely the best octopus disquised as a dad up to date. I don't have any experience being an octopus or what its like being one disquised as a human, but I would assume this is basicly how it would go. You simply go through the daily challanges of a average octopus father like grilling, shoping, running from a sushi chef, ect.Though if your a fan of the Deadleast Catch series then you will disapointed to see that this is a good game instead.

												Synopsis: Will you be able to successfully blend into the human world even though you are really an octopus?YEA!-Fun to play-Loveable characters-Controll Scheme is hard to use and master, but a blast anyhowMEH!-How they not know your a octopus!-Better yet how did they reproduce?-Some things are a pain to accomplishBLEH!-Too shortThe Lowdown:In octodad you play as as, well a octopus who must hide the fact that he is an octopus from his family. Yes, an octopus married a human and somehow had human kids! Doing so is not easy though as you must complete your every day chores and activities without raising suspicion. The control scheme involves you independantly moving your arms or feet to move accross the area and grab things. Sounds easy but ends up being difficulty to master. Neverless it is entertaining resulting in hillarious situations or screenshot moments.The story is quite short and only will take a few hours to complete, But it makes up for it in all likeable characters, from your reporter wife who is too dumb to know your a sea creature, the loveable daughter who is the only one with a brain who knows your a sea creature. Then you have the main villain the sushi chef who wants to make you into his main course! Oh yea there is a son in there but he is the lame forgetable one...Verdict: Will keep you entertained through its short playthrough that should be picked up at any sale price			"

 Octodad: Dadliest Catch  isn't just another silly casual game with purposely goofy controls and a gimmick that dies out after five minutes.  Octodad is more than that. There's a story behind it, and a pretty nice message too. I don't normally write reviews, but I felt like I had to for this game because I feel like I could personally relate to it in my own little way. Although this is purely subjective I believe that behind the story is possibly one of the most powerful messages about love and acceptance.If you want to hear my conclusion of the message behind the story then read the spoilers below.  Throughout the entire story Octodad is trying to hide his identity as an Octopus in his attempt to fit in with the humans and keep his happy family together. All through the game he messes up, he's a walking disaster, he can't do anything without destroying half of the things in his path, you can hear people talking about his ""sliminess"" and general negative comments, along with the chef constantly trying to kill him. I think we've all felt like this at times, and maybe even wondered if we're worthy of love if this is all we do and so many people dislike us.  but his family still love him. They still love this ""Slimy"" ""disgusting"" octopus-man even though nobody else, and possibly himself understood why. They saw the good in this kind and caring being that he most likely didn't and loved him despite his octo-flaws. I guess you could say they also gave him a reason to believe in himself, to defy the odds and ultimately reveal his true self to his family, to love himself exactly the way he is and live that happy life we're all searching for. Ultimately I believe that although many negative comments and hurt may be thrown our way by other people, it doesn't make the good we and others see in ourselves any less real.	I dedicate this review to my wonderful girlfriend, who saved me like Octodad's family saved Octodad.10/10			"

												I didn't want to buy and try Octodad Dadliest Catch when I first heard about it. It reminded me of the terrible Surgeon Simulator, which I absolutely hated because of the impossible controls. But after thinking about it, I decided to give it a try anyway. And it's one of the cutest, charming games on the market.The story is about an octopus who somehow manages to become a family man. It involves doing chores (missions) for and with your family and while that sounds lame, these missions fit right in because well, it all revolves about having a family. And the playable backstory shows you how you became a husband and father.It's short, lasting about 2 hours, but there are ties to collect in all the levels so there's some replay value. But most of you will, like me, probably just ignore it. The graphics are colorful and sharp, and the voice acting is great for a game of this caliber. The music is also very well done. There are some visual glitches here and there but they can be ignored because, you know, there are a lot of tentacles to move around. It doesn't detract from the experience if a tentacle doesn't properly connect with an object. Yes, it's noticeable but not weird and you probably won't even notice if after a few times because you're too busy controlling all these tentacles.Anyway, Octodad Dadliest Catch is awesome ! Give it some love ♥[Rating: 81/100]			"

												My only problem with Octodad: Dadliest Catch is how short it is. The rest is stupid fun but actually has an objective and doesn't get boring in 30 minutes like goat simulator (i should be shot for relating goat similator to this game, this game is so much better). The controls aren't that bad at all. Instead of making you rage, it makes you laugh and somehow makes you feel more accomplished with each level. It's not ""Press W to walk forwards"" it's ""manually move you're legs in that direction"" which makes you feel more involved in the game.It's worth 15 dollars but if it's on sale, GET IT.			"

												Videogames love dads.Whether it’s the new God of War’s less beleaguered, bearded Kratos taking a break from murdering literally everyone to care for his son (may the gods help that poor child), or The Last of Us’s Joel doing his best impression of a McCormack character as he begrudgingly slips back into the role of a father figure, the dads have officially infiltrated games. A lot of that is probably (cynically, though fairly) a result of many game developers being older and possibly fathers themselves, now looking to populate the games they make with characters that better reflect themselves (and are maybe just a little self-indulgent in that respect). Try as they might though, it seems fair to say that the videogame dad arms race has already been won, as it’s hard to imagine any game being quite as dadly as Octodad: Dadliest Catch. They even put dad in the name (twice!).As one would hope from the world’s preeminent dad simulator, Octodad is exactly what it says on its dad-joke adorned tin. You play as an octopus who has, through a chain of suitably wacky events, been married to a human woman and is now father to her two children (the less known about how this works the better). What ensues from this point onward is a sequence of absurd scenes in which you do your best dad impression and attempt to keep your true aquatic nature under wraps, a prospect made much easier given Octodad operates on a sort of Hitman-esq logic where as long as you look the part, nobody suspects a thing.Or at least that’s the idea, but when you’re an eight-armed octopus operating in a two-arm human world, things can get a little sticky. Octodad shares kin with absurd kinetic comedy games such as Surgeon Simulator and Goat Simulator, though it diverges from most of its peers by being far less obsessed with indiscriminate chaos. Indeed, though it shares a similarly unorthodox and intentionally uncooperative control scheme, Octodad’s is something on an inverse of the sort of game typically built around ridiculous physics based sandboxes, tasking you with making as little trouble as you can else your cover be blown. That’s both what makes Octodad so special, and also why it can never quite rise to its full potential.What I love about Octodad is how much it embodies the lovable awkwardness of the best kinds of dads. Though he’s clumsy and bad at communicating and, okay, an octopus posing as a human, Octodad legitimately cares about his family and shows his love in a way rarely explored in videogames: by just being there for his family. Roll your eyes if you will, but it is refreshing to play a game about a dad actually being a dad. Not brooding the loss of his daughter or being forced into a sketchy deal to save his wife. Just being a plain old regular dad, with all the social awkwardness, bad jokes, and hobbled together homemade solutions to everyday problems one could want in a father (plus a few extra tentacles). Octodad works because it touches on something so innate to the act of being a husband and father that underneath all the mayhem and hijinks, it is unexpectedly touching and authentic. All Octodad wants is to be accepted and do good by his family, and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t rooting for him all the way by the end.Octodad has heart to spare, but unfortunately its moment to moment play is not anywhere near as endearing. As I said before, Octodad is less interested in mass chaos than a lot of similar games, but that doesn’t mean it is in any way removed from the same sort of issues that plague its peers. While it is certainly far more forgiving than something like QWOP or Surgeon Simulator, Octodad is still an intentionally clumsy game to play, and as I find with all games of its ilk there came a point rather early on when I simply wished I could play the game without having to constantly wrestle with the controls. This moment may come even earlier than in similar games because Octodad is predominately focused on things beyond making a mess of your environment (though that will happen regardless), and as a result its unwieldy controls feel more superfluous than they otherwise might. Awkwardness is undeniably core to the Octodad experience, but I feel there were perhaps better ways to express it that would have been less abundantly tedious to work around.Octodad is the sort of game that is going to sell itself on absurdity alone. But by reducing it to just a joke, we miss what makes it so special. As humorous as it is to watch an octopus in a suit try to go grocery shopping, it’s how earnest Octodad is as a game and as a character that really stuck out to me. Tiny things like going down the kids slide at the museum (and barely fitting), or making dad jokes with your daughter, made me smile in a way I didn’t expect from a game that seems outwardly so purposely dumb. It’s unfortunate that its underlying mechanics are less endearing than the game they support, but even as I was cursing my inability to effectively climb stairs, I couldn’t help but give Octodad a break. Because, gosh darn it, he’s doing his best and we love him anyway.Note: Octodad: Dadliest Catch was reviewed playing exclusively with a controller.

												This game is totally hilarious. You control a Dad who is a octopus and your main goal is ""looks normal inside your family"". Objetives inside game are things like cut grass, make coffee, give milk to kids, go to grocery store and buy stuff, and more. Maybe you think, how difficult can be this game? Well, controlling this dad is very hard. In my honest opinion, if you don't have a controller, you will have a bad time. Even with controller you must do carefully movements. Any non-normal movement while people is near you will lead to a ""suspicious"" over you. If bar fills up, you are caught. Movements like rolling over a banana shell and falling is a suspicious movement. Also, while moving around, destroying everything near you will your arms or legs. Can't say more due to not finishing game yet. About graphics, being a indie game, is very well developed. It has that ""animated look"" everywhere, and is pleasant to my eyes. Sounds are very good, especially when Dad must talk. What I totally hate is camera. You can't move camera around, and that makes some situations a lot difficult. Also, camera changes while you are moving. That means, if you have sticks in controllers towards ""up"" position, and camera change, you could do something bad in game and get caught if you don't change instantly stick directions. But if you like challeges, this won't be a problem. Besides that, difficulty in game is translated in how fast is filled suspicious bar and how much precise should be your movements.In general, this game is very good. If you want to play something funny, pick it up for sure.			"

If you ever wanted to know the trials and tribulations of walking around on four legs when you should be on eight, or trying to keep from being made into Odori-dun by some psychopathic chef, this is the game for you. Whether Tiny Octopus is hurling apples at people's heads or dumping chocolate milk all over the carpet, this game is as accurate a presentation of what it's like to be a cephalopod out of water.Keep at it. You can do it. Soon, you'll understand what it is to be an octopus, and when we rise from the oceans, you will be ready to accept us as your cephalopodian overlords.

												Octodad is one of the finest indie games that I have ever played. It even has its own workshop! The workshop list is currently fairly short, but at the end of the day, game was released only few days ago.I absolutely loved the level of interaction you have with the surrounding environment. Missions are exciting and while being linearly story-driven, every major level has a certain sandbox zone where you can enjoyably mess around with everything you see.When I was playing the ‘fix-the-aquarium’ mission, one story from my past came to mind. I have a friend with whom we attended the same boarding school. One day we decided to play Titan Quest (2007), which was just released. So here we are, approaching the final boss, but as we will find out later, our game was somehow corrupted, which made that NPC immortal. After failing our tenth desperate attempt to slay that mob, my friend shuts his laptop and punches it with fist as hard as he can, which also “coincidently” results in brutal death of his laptop.What I am trying to say here is that people, who also get easily frustrated, may find this game difficult to enjoy due to complex controls and barriers towards getting hold of the hidden ties (collectibles). For the rest, if you do not mind closing a blind eye on a few bugs, you will find these 3-4 hours of gameplay absolutely pleasurable.			"

												Game is rather heart breaking/warming, You just play a life simulator as a father trying to hide his muscular dystorphy from his children to not burden them who is constantly bullied by an Asian person from his past threatening to destroy his family and let them know the dark secret of his medical diagnosis. They are really heavy handed with the octopus symbolism, but then again gamers aren't known for picking up on subtlety so I understand the design choice. Does your family still love you once you can no longer hide your affliction? Will your wife leave you? Will your children still look up to you as a super hero in their eyes or see you as a cripple?

To this day, I'm still not quite sure if whether Octodad had on the perfect human disguise or if everyone else was just blind.This game is so much fun. The cutscenes are cute and make you smile every now and then. Yes, Octodad is a ragdoll physics game, but unlike other ragdoll physics game, this one is story-driven, so you won't get bored within the first 30 minutes of playing it. In each scene, you are recquired to complete a set of tasks. As the game progresses, these tasks get a little harder to complete, but they're never impossible. I've seen some people complain about the controls. I use a mouse (don't have a controller), and while it was hard to move Octodad around at first, you do get used to it. However, if you want to play the local co-op mode, you'll need a controller.			"

												There is nothing quite like Octodad: Dadliest Catch. This is a game where the simple task of mowing the lawn can be utterly hilarious. The great writing and brilliant level design make it well worth buying, but the art design goes above and beyond to make it an unforgettable experience.			"

												A short yet quite humorous and creatively challenging game. Getting to grips with the limb control, even with a controller is no easy task, which can lead to some frustrating yet funny outcomes. The overall humor of the game takes away the frustration when you just can't quite get Octodad to control himself enough to perform a seemingly simple task without creating total chaos, sending objects flying while blubbering to himself or even getting his legs stuck through objects [and sending more objects flying because of it].It's a game that leaves you wanting to prevail and nail tasks given to you and is enjoyable to play solo or with a friend. It's still frustrating at times but the overall humor and challenge makes it worth it in the end.			"

												blurb blurb blurb blurb BLUUUURRRBBB!!!! octodad is one of my personal favourite indie games out there! its original and no other games have the same design. octodad is a game where you are an octopus (obviously) but no one knows that! they all think you are a normal human, but whats under the suit?? theres not alot of missions to do sadly, BUT there ate ALOT of things to do once the story has been accomplished. There are 3 ties in each level which you can collect and try get them all, and theres many achievements to earn! some may be challanging but still worth going for. alot of fun comes from this game and its well worth your money, but some sales bring the prices down sooo low!! to sum this up, octodad is unique, weird (in a good way) and loads of fun!!

												A very fun little game , i really really enjoyed it.the story is hilarious and does not make sense at all but that what makes it funny.A colorful world and great level designs.This game has a lot of great features, such a graphics , Soundtracks, gameplay , hidden features, level design, characters, story, Physics.You are the father of 2 children and with a lovely wife living a normal life ( No spoilers ) And then it gets complicated, and they tell you how it all started ( Kinda ... i am not really satisfied with the ending but whatever) I really enjoyed playing this game with a controller since it works probably on all controllers.NOTE : when they say Local coop , it does not mean a friend playing with a different character, ah no you just control a limb of the octopus , 2 legs 2 arms , 4 players each controlling on of those , or 2 players controlling 2 limbs at a time, it can all be configured and customized, i tried it and its really fun  Update , Octobor 17th , new update in the game adding 2 new levels one is a romantic dinner the other takes place in a hospital, both fun and takes about 1 hour to finish both, its good to see they are still adding stuff to the gameThis game outdone itself in a lot of aspects.Pros :1 - Colorful world and wonderful level designs, and characters and graphics.2 - Unlike most Physx game this is very light on the PC so no ""HELL FPS DROPS""3 - Great Physics, and fun gameplay trying to control the arms and move around doing stuff and quests4 - Funny story that makes no sense.5 - Great soundtracks , and character voicing.6 - Level editor AND Steamworkshop for some crazy more content by the steam community.7 - 3 hidden secrets in each level, and achievements and trading cards adds the toppings to the game : )8 - Game customization, such as Physics threads control, difficulty, Physics quality  ( reduce to increase game performance ) and many more visual/game features Cons : 1 - notice i said "" fun little game "" its great but finishes kinda quick... 3 hours and i finished it2 - I kinda hoped for an open world (Goat simulator style) in freeplay menu turns out it was just repeating levels to get the hidden items which is great but yeah i wanted open world :| hopefully i'd find it in workshop3 - Uh an octopus has 8 limbs and some ( 6 arms and 2 legs as scientists insisted on that ) but this character has 2 legs and 2 arms, dont get me wrong its great but more wouldv been funnier and harderOverall a wonderful calming gaming experience that is suitable for all ages, a game to play with your family and have a lot of ridiculous fun times 9/10			"

Physics-Based Story Driven Adventure Game


YouTube™ Video: Octodad: Dadliest Catch || Funny Physics-Based Story Driven Adventure Game 

			Views: 37		

			#Octodad http://store.steampowered.com/app/224480/ Add me on Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/id/desolater_iv/ Add me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/DESOLATER_IV		

+ The gameplay is ridiculous yet fun. You play as an Octopus who pretends to be human and disguise himself within society. The physics are all over the place as you don't have any bones so you essentially flop around all over the place making even simple tasks like mowing the yard a challenge.+ Story and characters are great and surprisingly emotional. You can almost feel sorry for Octodad as you know he's trying to so hard be a good father, but no one knows his struggles or what he's going through.+ Lots of interesting fun environments filled with loads of items to knock over or have a small bit of fun with. - At times certain levels can be pretty frustrating due to the controls. (One part near the beginning with the frozen pizza is oddly challenging to reach)			"

												Octodad is fantastically stupid. It earns its laughs with floppy physics and lots of broken props, but remains fun due to a control scheme that actually works. This isn't QWOP, though the comparison may seem apt. After 20 mins or so with Octodad (and a controller) you should be able to maneuver him pretty damn well.There's a decent length story (3 hours~ish if you move), but there's also a lot of side content and some pretty solid reasons to go back to levels. Add in Workshop support for levels and there's plenty of value here. I heartily recommend it.			"

												I started playing this game with expecting a stupid and edgy Youtube-bait experience, I was very wrong. While Goat Simulator is an unpolished mess, this one is far from it. It has lots of thought put into, very nice humor in dialogue, lots of references and the gameplay is just super fun. So surprised that this game is this good. Wow, everyone should try this out, it is amazing. But not a game I am able to binge through, it just gets too much for one sitting.			"

												I typically don't like games that seem gimmicky and have limited appeal for the player base. OCTODAD has interesting mechanics and couch side co-op is a blast. I haven't had this much fun flailing around solving puzzles and laughing in years. Great game definitely worth trying.Here is some gampley Footage I recorded earlier:

												This game was over hyped, over praised and given way too much exposure.  It just barely lasts an hour and a half.  You could probably boost an extra hour on to that if you want to find ties but that's only if you really feel like you need to.A lot of people say that this game is ""laugh out loud hilarious"" and while I understand that humor is subjective I didn't find myself laughing like everyone else.  Every now and then I'd crack a smile.Something I hear being thrown around a lot by Octodad fans and journalists is that this game is just so ""fresh"".  The controls are ""bad"".  It's hard to move Octodad, which of course as we all know it's designed to be this way.  Doing mundane tasks such as mowing the lawn or making coffee is now apparently ""hilarious"" because we can't control our character.  Don't get me wrong, I like this idea too and it's fun seeing Octodad flail all over the place but it gets stale fast.  So, sure, Octodad is ""fresh"", but that freshness lasts about as long as leaving a slice of bread on the counter (i.e not long).There's really not a lot to talk about when it comes to Octodad.  Heck, there's not even much of it to play.  If you've kept up with Octodad only in the media, it's safe to say you've probably seen at least half of the game already, it's that short.  The asking price for this game is $15.00.  $11.00 if you get it while its on sale.  However my advice is to wait until it goes on sale for 5 or lower. There's simply not enough content here to merit the 10 or 15 dollar asking price.			"

												This game is really cute and goofy and has a intresting story to it. Yet its a short game (I finished it in about 2-3 hours) so i recommend getting it when its on sale. Now just because the game is short there is still some extra things you can do. Like there is 2 extra maps (pretty short still though) and you can try to find all the ties. If you are a person who likes longer games then this is not for you. Personally this game is good to play if you are bored so i played it over and over a few times. Overall I give this game a 7/10			"

												This is an absolutely brilliant game.  Everything in the game works, the theme is brilliant, the story is wonderful, and the gameplay is fun.  The control scheme is interesting, you control two legs and one arm of a octopus in disguise.  Each is controlled by a different button (play it with a controller, it's worth it).  The controls at first feel a bit like QWOP in difficulty, but by the end of the game I was able to move at a full controlled run, and was having a blast.  After a level or two, the controls start to feel natural, and I was surprised at how much fun the game was. The game is a touch short, about 3 hours to play through the game the first time, however everything about those 3 hours is brilliant.  The story is that there's an octopus posing as a human (think ""Chicken Boo"" from Animaniacs).  While the game is short, the writing in the game is top notch, as the octopus has a family (starting with a marriage at the beginning level of the game and spontaneously having 2 kids after that point, feel free to question that).   Each character is brilliant, the wife is loving and caring, the octodad has a ton of emotion even without being able to say a word, and each kid is great, but the daughter steals the show with almost every line she delivers.  I couldn't stop laughing because she is piece of comic gold.  When ever I was working on a task and she started to talk I paused and listened.  Everything about the game is fun, and my family had a good time watching me play. Then there's the achievements.  Dear god.  I earned 8 achievements for playing the game, only a couple are not main game related, I still have 24 achievements to earn and the achievements range from challenging to silly.  There's a lot of replayability to the game outside of achievements but to ""perfect"" this game, you're going to have really challenge yourself.  There's a real desire to replay the game, because there's so much more you can do, but beyond that, you have steam workshops, extra levels (future stories), and more.  I have to go back and play the future stories, because I want to see what else the game can deliver.Overall I can highly recommend this game.  If you are still unsure, I would suggest it be purchased when it's on sale for those who aren't sure, but Young Horses is an amazing studio and I can't wait to see what they do next.			"

Best dad ever.An octopus desperately trying to go undercover as a human, has a sports-obsessed and possibly homicidal son, a reporter wife with two prior children who fails to see shes an octopus, and where every single mistake you make can get you caught. The controls are frustrating a lot of times, and the only reason i play this game is to read the increasingly disturbing narrative. Your nemesis is the chef hunting you, and he wants to turn you into meat to sell at the supermarket. A great game, although with dark humor and iffy controls, i wouldnt suggest buying it if it aint on sale. Will update more later!			"

												Great game, I wish it didn't end so quickly. Amazing story-line and really got my emotions going. Whenever I saw or heard that Chef I would flip my♥♥♥♥♥♥and run like crazy. The soundtrack is amazing and very intruiging. Such a charming and brilliant game. Please make a sequel. The ending was great and so were the cutscenes, I would recommened this game to everyone. Thanks for the amazing game and I hope you  make another sequel. <3Tread lightly, Octopus... It will not matter. You will fail.Determined blubbering			"

												Octodad: Dadliest Catch is a fun and fairly original game with a unique gameplay style not seen often at all in games. It manages to be fun, fresh and didn’t stop me laughing from start to finish with the only downside been that I completed it within 2hours, however this doesn’t mean I’m finished with the game I’m still ready to get the achievements and it also supports Workshop that could add hours of fun to the game.You take control of an Octopus, if you had not gathered that by now, you walk on landing using the two back buttons (controller) or the mouse buttons, I found the controller and Mouse/Keyboard to work just as well as the other and you are tasked with numerous goals per level such as making coffee, stealing cereal, playing mini games and sneaking around stereotypical groups of people.The graphics in the game are well presented, nothing to over the top and I doubt it would win any awards however it fits in well with the game and the game ran at a perfect 120fps even with 16xAA showing that the game is fairly well optimized to run on PC’s.The gameplay is mostly physics based, controlling the character though levels, cant really say much more than that, most of the charm is the game is from this and the characters themselves, dim-witted adults and keen children with a mature sense of humour helps you chuckle though the entire game on top of laughing at Octodads poop sense of footing.I completed the game in 2 hours however I feel for the entertainment value and the price I paid I feel like I already have my money’s worth but still expect me to be jumping back into the game to get the achievements and ties.I’d happily give OctoDad a 8/10, a very solid Indie game, id love to see a full featured sequel that maybe has more complex puzzles, longer story and more levels, besides that this is one of those games that takes you by surprise at how enjoyable it is. - Dean "

												This was a fun game but far too short to be worth the cash. I'd say it is an amazing $5 game but paying more than $10 for it will leave you feeling a little ripped off.Honestly it is so short that I honestly thought the entire game was the set up for the game. The description makes it seem like after the aquarium is when the game will start, but really it ends before it even feels like it really began. It's like paying for a George Carlin performance and only getting 4 jokes out of it. They are hilarious, but you feel ripped off anyways.			"

												You play as a loving father who cares much for his wife and kids. You wake up, do your chores, shop for groceries and take trip to the local aquarium. The thing is though, you have a secert life. Everyone doesn't know it, but you are a drug addict. Go about your day, trying to do everyday things while as high as the Empire State building. It is a very emotional game about a father trying to cope with his problems. Very fun game, but sadly a short one. Buy it when it is on sell. I don't know why it's called Octodad though, the main charater is completely human.9/10 "

Anyway I really like this game and I hope we could get some more levels or stories of octodad.			"

8/10""Perfectly for children (or drunken people)."" As Octodad you have to keep your disguise as good as possible, to live the life of an ordinary human family husband. It's definately a COOP game, as each player individually controls one/two tentacles. Especially when you're playing in a group of 4 the fun might get ridicioulus.Pros:+ definately funny + great gameplay+ good controls+ good ost&sounds+ good story+ okay graphics+ up to 4player offline coop  (each player is a tentacle)+ teaches coordination+ full x360 controller supportCons:- no online coopMust buy if you are a parent, your kids will love you!

												It's a neat story in a pretty short game.  Of course short would depend on your ability to figure out how to move Octodad effectively.  It's not terribly difficult but there's a learning curve.  Think of this game like a sitcom wherein you're an octopus pretending to be human and hijinks ensue.  That would be my best description of the game.  If you can pick it up for under $5 ($15 seems too high for me) I'd say you'll definitely get your money's worth.  Replay value to be had trying to collect all the ties and picking up achievements.  You can also try to get a decent time by doing the free play mode after the story ends but that would be for your own personal satisfaction.  Also a coop mode which I haven't tried but seems like some laughs could be had trying to work together.To sum up: It's a cool game, pick it up on the cheap and you won't be disappointed.			"

If you played the free version then you know what to expect, it's like that but way more.			"

												This game is a lot of fun. The story is fun and entertaining, even if a couple of hours. Also, there is the workshop to grant more hours. It is hard to control Octodad, but what would be fun about this game if there wasn't a octopus flubbing around the ground. This game is a must buy for people who want fun, entertainment, and a bit of a challenge.			"

												I bought 'Octodad: Dadliest Catch' in the Steam sales a while back. It was greatly reduced in price, and when I purchased it I admit not having much interest in playing it. A few months later, though, I completed whichever game I happened to be working my way through, and found myself browsing my Steam library for a new one to try. I decided to install 'Octodad', thinking that it may be a fun way to pass half an hour. I was wrong: it's a fun way of passing dozens of hours. Unlike 'Goat Simulator' and other similar games, 'Octodad' actually provides a ludicrously funny context; your floppy misadventures through a church, supermarket and fishing boat (amongst other things) are, believe it or not, plot-related. At times I found this game more challenging than I'd expected, and I was in a constant state of surprise at how amusing I found it. It isn't a great game, and it certainly won't make an appearance on a list of my favourite games, but 'Octodad' certainly makes for a pleasant experience. I'd recommend this game to fans of physics games, parents, and people who occasionally want a break from 'heavier' games.			"

8/10""Perfectly for children (or drunken people)."" As Octodad you have to keep your disguise as good as possible, to live the life of an ordinary human family husband. It's definately a COOP game, as each player individually controls one/two tentacles. Especially when you're playing in a group of 4 the fun might get ridicioulus.Pros:+ definately funny + great gameplay+ good controls+ good ost&sounds+ good story+ okay graphics+ up to 4player offline coop  (each player is a tentacle)+ teaches coordination+ full x360 controller supportCons:- no online coopMust buy if you are a parent, your kids will love you!

												Octodad is a short but sort of funny and somewhat odd take at the adventure theme, mixed with a fair lot of platforming. The plot isn't so noteworthy as the real matter in the game is the way you got to control the main character. Anyhow, the plot is the classic sort of ""run away from the bad guy"" kind of adventure.Visually it does have a sort of style, although quite a basic one at that, as the game mostly makes you destroy things or usually make a mess around yourself, so any place you might happen to visit can (potentially) literally become a wasteland a few minutes after you got into it ^^ and this is due to the controls. And this brings me to the controls: the game defaults the control settings to the left and right mouse buttons. This likely tries to mimic a sort of gamepad controller, in a way that you might alternate the ""leg"" movements to give Octodad a proper set (or nearly so) of movements. Which obviously doesn't always happen because Octodad's tentacles often get stuck into objects or walls, or even clip into them (getting both of the tentacles stuck requires a savegame reload, most of the time).Sound wise, the game once again is set with a wide variety of odd octopus sounds (or supposedly so) coming from Octodad, and that also serves to get a better idea of how you're controlling Octodad's tentacles, as each movement will produce some sound. The other characters instead do talk, but overall they won't have much to say, most of the time.The soundtrack doesn't have much variety at all, but in the latest scenarios you get to listen to a few very good tracks. The remaining part of the soundtrack isn't necessarily bad, it's simply...useful as a musical background, nothing more, it's a bit playful and maybe a bit too generic (perhaps it could've been nice if they were to put more enphasis on creating something with a bit more characterization for each different scenario).Overall, the game is fun, despite a few parts from some scenario being unnecessarily counter intuitive or frustrating. It is a short experience, imho not worth the Steam price (but you can likely find it at lower prices).			"

												A quirky and incredibly enjoyable game about trying to be a dad (but Spoiler: You're an Octopus). I highly recommend this is played with a controller.Octodad is a relatively short but very fun and challenging physics based game, whereby you control each of Octodad's hands and feet (or are they hands too? Or should they all be referred to as tentacles?) individually to accomplish tasks any loving and caring dad would do! Such as: Attending your own Wedding, grocery shopping, and visiting an aquarium! (but don't tell him it's an aquarium!)Octodad has a very catchy soundtrack, appealing art style (reminded me somewhat of some of the later Rayman Raving Rabbids games), and a funny yet gripping storyline.100% worth buying, I predict (and hope) this game will become a classic in years to come!

												(I should note that this was one of the first decent-looking games to hit Steam Greenlight back when it was first new, and I've had my eye on it for about a year and a half. I feel like this game would have had more of an impact if the whole Surgeon Simulator thing hadn't happened by the time it was finally released.)In short: it's a game about an octopus who knocks lots of things over while trying to do mundane things like a normal human would. And somehow it manages to be touching.The base game is only about 3 hours long, but there's so much polish and passion and humor packed into this game that I just can't help but say I enjoyed my time. There are several dozen clever references to other indie games and geek culture, and if that's not your kind of humor, there is also a constant stream of genuinely witty dialogue from the characters. There are some tough parts in later levels, but there is always a way to cheese past them easily if you're observant. And there are lots of extras to find that will easily boost the playtime to 10 hours and beyond.In all, an excellent entry into the ""Slapstick Physics"" genre, and I recommend it to anyone who hasn't given this genre a try yet. Though I probably wouldn't pay more than $10 for it, personally.			"

												Psst, ever wanted to be a perfectly normal dad? Now, before i bore you to death, it gets better.

With the new shorts having been added, there is even more reason to play this game.

 Octodad: Dadliest Catch  The Story The story for this game is that You are an Octopus that marry's you wife and has children and is trying to live out the rest of his life trying to act like a actual human.  But while even trying to do this a french chef is trying to expose to your family that you are a octopus, fore reasons that are explained in the story. And to advance in the story you must do normal day tasks like....- Go shopping - Going to a Aquatic museum - Mow the lawn, etc... Gameplay The gameplay in this game has you controlling octodad doing normal day thing's I has previously mentioned above. And the fun with this game is that you must do these things but being a octopus and having eight leg's, you will become very wobbly and difficult to control, but at the same time making it fun and have yourself laughing while playing. Workshop After/Before you complete the game you could always go to the steam workshop area to download some very funny mods/tweaks to the gameplay. There is not as much when it come's to the amount of mods like Skyrim or Garry's mod but atleast it give's you something else to the game. Overall The game is worth the price and could not recommend enough.			"

												This game is amazing. The humour is great, the gameplay is fun and the storyline has its cliches but is clever as is. It's like portal, it's short but it's amazing. If you're not a completionist then this game will take you about 1 hour 40 minutes - 2 hours using a mouse. I've heard a controller is much easier. Although if you're a completionist there's 3 ties in every level and you can try and beat the dev's times (have fun with that)... If you can't get enough even after all that there's some amazing stuff on the workshop to spice it up a bit. I highly recommend this game for anyone just wanting to get a break from the whole ""SHOOT THEM DOWN MOTHER******!"" business you get with most AAA games now. For those of you who just like to screw around, get this game. Now. Why are you still reading this? Get this game NOW!			"

												Octodad is a comedic adventure game that gives very hard controls where it's impossible to play with mouse and keyboard, yet easier, but still hard on a controller. Aside from the shortness and difficulty, the game is still fun.You are an octopus, with a wife and kids, hiding the fact that you are a Octopus in reality. So you must avoid the Chef Fujimoto,  Biologist, and run away from the annoyingly fast Hammerhead Shark.I've honestly never played a fun adventure game with no violence in years. Even without the fighting and killing, it's still fun. This also made me slowly adapt to stealth mechanics in games, which I have barely have patience for. The controls may be hard, but you'll eventually get used to, even with a short game, you can also play mods and workshop items for it!Overall, it's a great game and you guys should try and get it!

												Octodad is the second game in the series, and Young Horses has had some time to hammer out and polish the big stuff - constraint physics, visual style, story - all the things that make it an indie darling. It's a short game (longer than DLC Quest but shorter than Portal) and for $15 you might argue you're not getting a lot. This game is fueled by quirkiness, relies on it, really, and its replay value depends on how efficiently you can convert its brand of humor into your personal brand of fun.I got a few laughs out of it, but also a few frustrations. For the buildup to the final boss you're tossed into an irresponsibly designed level of precision platforming, bad camera, and a floor that falls under your feet with very little conveyance. This is a massive contrast to the rest of the game with its open environments and reliance of a more-or-less static world. I got stuck in the world geometry more than I'd care to admit there, but think of it less as a nitpick and more as indicative of the overall game - I feel the developers got a fun toy (constraint physics), decided to wrap a one-off around it, and ran out of ideas. I really do think this game was intended to be $15 worth of game-hours but they had to piece together what they had and sell it.Like I said, I'm hard pressed to find $15 of value here. I didn't try co-op nor go for some of ""advanced"" achievements but I don't think it would have rocketed this game to a glowing recommendation.			"

This game is just the right price for a game that will give you 3-5 hours (Depending on collectables and what not) of fun gameplay with very little bordom. Buy this game while its still on sale!!! And if you reading this after 2/6/14 then still buy it!!! I would give this game almost a 9/10 but since it is kinda short (Still very fun) I give it an 8/10... In Meta Score terms an 88.			"

												Octodad: Dadliest Catch is a hard hitting indie game I reccomend to everyone. This game features insane controls, goofy missions and a hard hitting storyline. This takes you back to how our octohero met his wife and why the insane chef wants him dead. The detail and emotional background to the game really hits home for many gamers and I look forward to it coming to PS4!			"

												Octodad is a hilarious game in which you control an octopus's tentacles in order to complete tasks and try to fit in and look like a normal human. Gameplay is very short (around 2hrs) but is enjoyable and very funny throughout. The only complaint is the camera angles can be a bit quirky sometimes which can be a little frustrating. Otherwise a very funny and original game, a little on the pricey side so wait for a sale! Otherwise, very enjoyable and can recommend.			"

												This game is ridiculous...and I love it. You play as an octopus disguised as a human, the name of which is never spoken, so we call him Octodad. Octodad: Dadliest Catch is a fun game about the problems of an octopus trying to pose as a human. You must try to be as inconspicuous as possible as you navigate many settings, such as a wedding, a grocery store, an aquarium, and so much more! The controls are nice, controller or not. I don't like that there is an achievement for playing with a controller, but what can you do. But this game is fun, and I highly recommend it.			"

												In Octodad, you play as an Octopus, impersonating himself as a human dad. Rather self-explanatory title. In the game, you can't move around normally, like any other third or first person game. Since you have tentacles instead of limbs, you have to move your ""legs"" one at a time, as well as your ""arms"" seperately. The game tasks you with rather dull tasks, such as getting items in a supermarket, mowing the backgarden, or putting burgers onto a barbeque. However, because your limbs are just so hard to move, as you have a habit of your body flinging itself around the place, knocking over everything in your path in your vain attempts to control your Octopus.In essence, the game is a 3 hour long slapstick adventure. That's not to say however that it's the only humour involved. The voice acting is surprisingly well done, with the long running gag of everyone not seeing through your disguise, to your kid's often insane requests and dreams, such as your daughter wanting to become a unicorn when she is older, not to mention a Supermarket PA who often makes mistakes on the job, to the marine biologists who constantly pick apart the plot of the game.However, the game has this real kind of Disney-esque humour and heart towards itself, Octodad truly loves his family, and his family loves him back, to his wife and himself actually having a real relationship, even if it is often consciously satarical of suburban family life. Likewise, even the villian is the mad, pamtomine nutcase simply called ""The Chef"", who hunts Octodad because he is the only one who recognises him, and even then, his motivation isn't really that evil either.There are a couple of issues with the game, somethings you're forced to go through vents to proceed, which can be very cumbersome, trying to shove all your tentacles into a tight space. Also, the game features marine biologists later on in the game, where if they spot you, they'll recognise you immedietly, but then later on, suddenly they're fooled by your disguise. Also, the game can be completed in just 3 hours, maybe 2 if you're very efficient about it.However, with it being on sale, and hopefully will return in a flash sale, which is how I got my copy of it, I whole heartily this, due to it's hilarity, it's heart, and just the sheer happiness this game just emulates onto one's self.

												A quirky and lovely looking game that has a lot to offer in the ways of challenge and humor. It's not a very long game, but the running gag of Octodad might have worn thin if it were any longer. Excellent writing and comedic timing, pleasing graphics and a strong style, some of the best voice acting I've ever heard for an indie game, controls that are easy to learn but take a while to master. It was an absolute pleasure to play and I would recommend it even at full price.			"

												Octodad was a complete surprise for me. I thought this game would be similar to the likes of Goat Simulator - but it's actually very well made. The dialogue is hilarious throughout the game, and the relationship between Octodad and his family as well as his mortal enemy - the chef - are very well done. This game must be played with a controller, and once you get used to the controls - the game works very well and is short enough that you'll have fun the whole time playing it.Highly recommended for a quirky and fun platforming game - definitely one of the better games on Steam. It's not a gimmick despite what it seems - this developer did a great job on a new concept!			"

As far as user generated comedy goes, this game tops everything I can think of from recent memory.The controls are crap but they're crap in a way that is just so amusing and ridiculous that it would feel stale if they were designed any other way.The game is short (took only about 3 hours to beat with 3 people on roulette mode) but there are a plethora of workshop items that I can't wait to try out!The story is touching; although ridiculous, it's rather intriguing that in the end I actually found I felt for this Octodad and his family.10/10 would play with friends over and over until our sides burst :D			"

												This game is hilarious! Although the game is easily beat, the interaction between main character and the what seems to be endless moveable objects makes it very enjoyable. It's a little hard to figure out the controls at 1st, but I guarantee you will be laughing every step of the way while figuring it out. The game is charming, and pretty to look at. Highly recommend this title to anyone who is looking for something on the quirky side of video games.			"

												FUNNY STUFFBefore I purchased Octodad: Dadliest Catch, I went and found the original Octodad. I was laughing my butt off playing it.  Trying to get Octodad's arms to perfom regular tasks and hoping to look human doing it or doing the best you can when no humans are looking is where the funny happens. YOU are the octopus in a suit. I felt just as awkward as Octodad trying to be human.This new version allows you to use a controller. It;s a pretty short main game but, for PC users, it comes with a level creator which can be uploaded to the Steam workshop and shared . So the game can continue with new feats that you can attempt.I bought it during the 20% sale and for $12.00( not a bad price by me) i'm happy to know that there wil be more content made by creainve players.( I'm thinking of making a resturant scene) .

												Why do I keep thinking of Portal? Is it the bright, clean aesthetic? The bevy of fun puzzles based around simple, easy to learn mechanics? The amazing quotability? The amount of character and personality squeezed from every last thing in the game? The incredibly catchy song? The short game-time with huge amounts of replayability?Oh yes, that's right.

												This game is ridiculous...and I love it. You play as an octopus disguised as a human, the name of which is never spoken, so we call him Octodad. Octodad: Dadliest Catch is a fun game about the problems of an octopus trying to pose as a human. You must try to be as inconspicuous as possible as you navigate many settings, such as a wedding, a grocery store, an aquarium, and so much more! The controls are nice, controller or not. I don't like that there is an achievement for playing with a controller, but what can you do. But this game is fun, and I highly recommend it.			"

												The first time I saw this game on the front page of Steam my thoughts went pretty much like this:""Okay, is this some sort of 'ironic' take on Octomom and Deadliest Catch? @#$%ing hipsters.""I don't even remember why I clicked on it. First impressions can make or break a game's selling potential and I know I can't be alone in this sort of off-the-shelf assessment. Such cynicism doesn't do this game justice.The control scheme makes it unique and is the true core of gameplay - the adventure game key puzzles would be the spokes on that particular wheel. Some people may allude to ""to walk forward you alternate between pressing L1 and R1"" (thank you Yahtzee) and... well, the trailer showcases exactly how chaotic this is. It works better than it sounds, a description which sums up this game quite well.It's a rare game that is actually funny in its own quirky way, and not by the usual use of 'ironic' references. The entire premise is preposterous but the characters are endearing and the developers included their message without having to shovel in hours of exposition. The length is just right for a game of its tyle in that it doesn't become tiresome or run out of steam halfway through. Overall it all blends together into a game is simultaneously one that I recommend but I can think of no good way to market to a developer. You could say it's an ideal example of how Steam is a great platform for the independent developer to put out quality material on the market.			"

A Paladin's Steam Review: Octodad: Dadliest Catch. Intentional Frustration Is Fun? Genre: Co-Op Physics Havok Simulator. OR Physics Frustration Engine. OR 3rd Person Light Hearted Adventure. Developed & Published by: Young Horses Platform: Windows, Mac, Linux, Xbox, Playstation and Mobile. Business Model: Base GameCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay ThoughtsI knew what I was getting into. I knew it and I still bought this game. Why did I buy this game? Why did I intentionally frustrate myself for three hours? Am I a masochist? All these questions and more will never be answered. Neither is the question about how your family has kids. Probably best that we dont' know. Or how no one can figure out who Octodad really is except for one guy. Octodad is a physics sandbox game with colorful, cartoony graphics and a very whimsical soundtrack. There are also plenty of references to other games and internet personalities which I found amusing. PhysicsIn Octodad, you control a standing octopus as he goes about a regular day in suburbia. It's rather difficult to do this as he flops around being unable to stand up straight. This lack of bones is quite the crutch but Octodad never complains. You control one arm and one leg (and an optional local co-op partner controls the other set. No, this doesn't make the game any easier but probably more hilarious.) and have to pull yourself around the world, picking up relevant items to solve a puzzle or get past a messy situation. The StoryYou control an octopus as he tries to be a good dad in suburbia. While hiding the fact that he is an Octopus. He talks in blurbs and squibbles which is apparently enough to get him by but the Wife seems to be having a major case of the denials. The day starts out ordinarily enough. The kids need to get ready for school and chores/errands need to be done. Which is far more challenging due to Octodad's unique biology. However, the only person in this world that seems to know Octodad for who he truly is, is out to stop his ""evil plans"", whatever those may be. He's quite tenacious and bent on exposing/defeating him but Octodad for the most part seems to be able to slip out out of trouble. What follows is a whacky adventure almost as whacky as the physics themselves. When really, all Octodad wants to be is a good dad. Yeah, the plot isn’t too serious but its quite cute and heartwarming.The story is about two to three hours long depending on how many times it takes you to accomplish a simple task such as putting on a hat or walking 10 feet forward. (It’s surprisingly difficult how mundane tasks can be for an octopus). While that may seem too short, honestly, I think that’s the perfect length for a game like this. Any longer and you'd start punching walls or breaking controllers. Really, the game is looking out for you. The only collectibles in this game are three ties on each level but they can be pretty tricky to locate. PC Settings & StoryPC settings are quite in depth. Resolutions options seem fully supported, fullscreen on/off, v-sync, shader quality slider, shadows, shadow quality and shadow distance settings are all here. The game is very well optimized, I never experienced any crashing or bugs. You know, outside of the physics wackiness. Bonus: they even give you an immediate preview of graphic changes while you're in the settings menu. I would like to see more games do this. Final ThoughtsDo I recommend this game? Only if you like intentionally frustrating yourself. You’ll only really get about 2-3 hours out of this game. A lot of that time will be frustration and anger as you try to control an octopus who can barely stand up straight. I'm not convinced by the Steam Workshop integration, I really don’t see what more could be done with this game. So far, what has been created there hasn't been worth writing home about. For a game that is a whacky physics adventure, I didn't expect it to have quite as much heart in its story though. I liked this game despite the frustration but only approach this if you can deal with it. Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com] "

												So, umm, I just spent nearly 15 hours being an Octopus... dad... Octodad. Uhhh, it was an interesting experience, that's for sure. I make a lot of squishy sounds and I'm pretty sticky - or suctiony (if that was a word). Blurbbb plurpbb mmpbrrp.But in all seriousness, I did really enjoy this game. The controls are really tough to use, I had watched a few minutes of gameplay a year or two ago thinking the people who played it were just exaggerating how difficult it was to do everything, but it really is. But unless you're trying to 100% the game, it's not so bad. I, however, wanted to, so collecting the ties, obtaining the achievements, going out of my way to do everything with a floppy squishy cephalopod that I could, did take some effort. I'd say the game is probably in the realm of 5 hours long, I played through it a few times. It's fun. Frustrating at times, but fun.			"

												Octodad: Dadliest Catch is a game that ended up being quite a bit more then it appeared on the surface. The main lure of this game is its controls, which are both frustrating and hilarious. Many times I would find myself at a difficult point of the game, but still be laughing my♥♥♥♥♥off and cracking jokes as I flailed about helplessly. What surprised me was the quality of the story and writing the game presented, creating a funny yet heartwarming story of a man who loves his family...who just so happens to be an octopus. I espically love when the game gets descriptive of Octodad's 'blurbs' or the often odd banter of background characters. While the game's story is 'short' by how much content it has, the game's difficulty, its replayability with speed runs and collectables, the Co-Op gameplay, and its custom levels with the Steam Workshop make sure that this game can entertain for a long time.Overall, this game is absolutely amazing for a simple indie title. The controls are as fun as they are frustrating, the story is impressive, creating well-written characters and a world that is both mundane and yet slightly off at the same time, and there are a lot of oppertunities for replayability. My only issue is with ONE section of the game which, while it progresses for the story's sake, is a change in the gameplay I wasn't too found of. But it's a minor thing at best and doesn't take anything away from this beautiful expierence in the life of a true family man (and not an octopus).

												I recommend Octodad, or at least, I recommend it for the £3/$5 it cost me. At full price, you'll feel a little cheated by the lack of content: it lasts about two hours, and it's replay value depends on how invested you are in finding collectibles, or satisfying bonus objectives to get achievements.What's here, though, is good. I found it very playable will both controller and keyboard/mouse playstyles. The game doesn't torture you with the difficulty in controlling Octodad: it presents amusing, fun environments for you to generally make a mess of. It demands very little to complete, but nicely ramps up the difficulty if you want to ""see everything"" - collecting ties, etc.Overall, Octodad is a light-hearted, fun diversion that I'd recommend easily at a reduced price. If you're desperate to play you won't mind paying full, but if this is a bit of a whim purchase for you, hold off for sales.As a word of caution, though, since I could not find this information anywhere before I bought it: it really doesn't work well with the Steam controller.

												It was fun, I was worried at the beginning I wouldn't get the hang of the controls but they're definitely manageable. It is a bit short, I played it one playthrough, but I like the sense of humour and it was better than I expected (I sort of thought it was just a major hype train but I was pleasantly surprised). My one complaint though besides it being short, is that one of the achievements says that you have to use a controller? Obviously this is just my opinion, but since it's a PC game it shouldn't force people to have a console controller in order to get all of the achievements. Once I saw that I was disappointed and knew right away there was no way I was going to get a ""perfect game"". Still a thumbs up and just a tip: don't watch spoilers online before playing!			"

												This game is perfectly goofy, but thankfully unlike many other goofy games it actually requires skill to play and is therefore a fairly rewarding experience when you succeed in tasks! Also, I throughly enjoy being in on Octodad's secret and helping him keep it - he's an endearing character and I was on his side from the get-go.Do not play this if you suffer from motion sickness. I can only play it in short bursts.			"

												Okay I've decided to revise my review. As you can see the Developer contacted me on this review saying they changed the later levek designs, the ones based on stealth. And let me say, they game is a thousand times better for it. Now it doesn't feel like a chore, it keeps its constant flow of hilarity and more motivation to continue playing it. It so so much better than what it was. I also noticed they changed the odd few things in other levels for example collecting the soda from the mall, they changed the layout of 'Soda City' and its much easier to navigate. I still think the price is a little steep for what you get, but now I can say if you don't mind shedding that extra buck, go for it.			"

												I enjoyed the humour and the story, some of the mucking around is hilarious but the controls are just too frustrating. By the end of the game I was still struggling to do basic tasks and fighting the camera. Trying to climb stairs or ladders where your legs get constatly wrapped around them and dont stick is super tiresome. It's a real shame because the mini-games were fun. Co-op is pretty funny for about 5-mins and if the person isn't used to games with wonky controls then it becomes a very daunting task.			"

												Sequels are always going to be compared to the original piece of media that came before it, and are thus subject to diminishing returns. Octodad: Dadliest Catch is a sequel to Octodad. It is just more Octodad, but with better levels and is pretty much an attempt to fill in the lore of Octodad. So for all of you Octodad slash fanfic writers out there, THIS GAME HAS ALL THE ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS.I can't talk further about how I feel about this game without spoilers, so here goes: At the end, Octodad is finally forced to reveal that he is an octopus to his family. The game ends with Octodad and the Chef making nice-nice and agreeing to leave each other alone. And the game ends with the full knowledge of the family knowing Octodad is an octopus. This is the approximate point where I was frustrated and tired of ♥♥♥♥ing Octodad, and I was ready to quit the game and slag it off if there was anything further to play. The gimmick wore off, the novelty is gone, and there was me and the crazy physics octopus trying to navigate a fire filled room and a very deflating final boss battle. The end feels like a finality to Octodad, the official THE END on the whole thing. And I think it's an absolutely perfect time to end the series.This is the last Octodad game. Octodad is done. As it is, Octodad is perfect and there is no need to make another Octodad game.I will take away my positive recommendation if there is another sequel.			"

												Octodad is basically about a dad/husband who is an Octopus. You are in different scenarios where you are given menial tasks which are difficult to perform due to your appendages. Through each scenario a butcher who wants to cook and eat you is chasing after you. I'm not recommending this because the game is simply not for me. That's not to say its a horrible game. It is actually humorous. I mean the octopus has two human kids, not to even mention if he has trouble getting cereal from the store how in the world did he manage to produce two offspring?! Anyway, it would be perfectly good for children as there is nothing that strikes me as adult content other than the annoying gameplay. Yes, I realize the controls on Octodad's hands are supposed to be difficult, but it is downright annoying to me. I'm an avid gamer and I can't imagine a young child controlling this game well. If they are, you really need to get that kid back in school because they're spending too much time playing games. Ok, that may have been a little harsh because I was one of those kids. But, I'm at the point where I want games to challenge me not my mouse capabilities. Tl;dr Might be better for children who have more patience with the irritating controls. Funny short game for those who want to kill time.			"

												Octodad deadliest catch is an exciting, humorous and funny casual game with a very unique gameplay controlling an octopus with your mouse, From going to your weeding  to waking up and drinking coffee, to yard work and shopping, and finally the  trip to the aquarium to spend time with your family facing off such simple tasks with great difficulty.  Beware of your enemy the CHIEF!This game is hilarious, the movements are created so that you are a clumsy character moving around, it might get some use to but once you get it you'll be slipping around. The hardest thing about this game would have to be the climbing ladders and stealth, YES THIS GAME DOES HAVE STEALTH LOL!+Funny gameplay, moving around and interacting with everyday things and having trouble with it+HAS VOICE ACTING, and they are Quite good too!+The music is very catchy+The humor is LOL+supports workship and has a coop mode to play with a friend on the same pc, let the hilarity ensue.-No multiplayer support-the price was ok for 11 dollars, but really short, can be beaten under 2 hours "

												defo reccomend you play this game! :D its really awesome! :) the concept may seem random at first (an octopus living with humans) but once you get use to that then you willl start having a good time on this game :) i won,t spoil the story to much but its basically about octodad living with a human family and having to do tasks along the way :) there is assigned missions but you can  throw everything to look for ties :) i would,nt say this is a downside but the game is short and its one of those games you want to play even more of as i really enjoyed it although i will defo be coming back to this game for many reasons: its really fun,time trials,free mode to look for ties and try to finish it on hard as i finished it on normal. i hope there will be another octodad as i recently bought this in sale and its been out for awhile so octodad 3 if that ever is announced i would defo get day 1 as this is so worth the money even at £11. I know the game is short but that dosen,t mean that you can,t go back to it right? :) im gonna play this a lot as its fun to explore the levels and replay the game oh and don't forget achievement hunting like 1 is throw the wedding ring on to scarlets finger rather then placing it on her. if you can you should defo buy this game as its something that you will want to go back to :)			"

												Octodad: Dadliest Catch is a unique game, to say the least. Let's cover the good, first.-It's controls are a special kind of awful, but that's the point of the game. The controls are made to be bad, as you control a boneless cephalopod. It makes the gameplay hectic and fun, while still being managable and controllable if you understand the system. -The humor and writing are great. If you like surrealist humor and snappy quotes, this game's writing will appeal to you. Also, the titular character is very likeable, for what he is.-Similarly to Valve's Portal series, the supply of quotes for each stage is full. You'll only run out of clever commentary if you're stuck on a level for longer than you should be.-For a game with about four voice actors, this game's acting is impressive.-The references are very nice, ranging from nods to other games (""MintCraft""), to even YouTubers (""Total Biscuits"")Now, let's go over the less good.-The graphics, while being charming and pleasantly cartoony, are very unimpressive. The human characters' eyes very rarely seem to move, and the textures are very simple.-The game is very, very brief. It can be beaten in one sitting, if you know how to play it. Workshop makes up for that, though.-The soundtrack leaves some room to be desired.If the issues don't overpower the positives of this game for you, then it's worth a play. However, do not buy this at full price. It is too short to warrent it's 15 dollar price tag. If you can catch it on sale, by all means, purchase it. It's still a fun game.			"

Within the first three or so minutes I was laughing hysterically and had to actually turn off the game within an hour because I was laughing too much and waking up my family.If you are into games with innovative gameplay this is a game you must try. Even with practice it's hard to control Octodad, often ending with very hilarious results (one such moment for me was chucking a lawnmower at my family who was enjoying a delicious dinner of hockey pucks... I mean, burgers.)The game isnt overly challenging but there are some moments that make you think but nothing ever made me quit the game in anger. I would definitely give this game 4/5 stars!			"

												I was very exicted for this game after seeing the trailer. Something about it just put a huge smile on my face. After playing it, I can easily recommend it, but only if it's on sale. I bought it for $10, and while I had a ton of fun, the game is simply far too short. I finished the game in only 2 hours.The game is fun, a great idea, has a lot of charm, and a very touching ending. I just wish that it had lasted a little longer.			"

												This game is really, truly great. The main story is quite short, 2-4 hours, but that's okay, because this game has steam workshop support. The devs promised to continue supporting it with new content as well. The gameplay is fun, and it's really cute and enjoyable for absolutely anyone. It's more funny than frustrating, and there are tons of things in each level to occupy your time. This is one of the best 'time-waster' games i've ever played!!!!			"

												Octodad is a wonderful premise; an octopus disguised as a human trying to live a normal life, yet failing to do the most basic of things due to the fact that, well, he's an octopus. It sounds like the premise of a great Saturday Morning Cartoon. The result the game delivers however feels a bit more like the 2-hour series finale to an Octodad cartoon, rather than a pilot to kickstart a great new IP.The mechanic of flailing around, switching between controlling Octodad's arm and his legs works well enough, making the puzzles difficult but not impossible (although some of the arcade games are a real pain to finish). Some of the puzzles toward the end can feel really, for lack of a better word, gamey. Climbing difficult platforms and even a boss fight. The big selling point for the gameplay was that the difficulty came from doing things normal people can suceed without a lot of difficulty but are substantially harder without proper control of your body. This game is like Surgeon Simulator 2013 in the sense that the main mechanic is frustration and like said game it works to the game's benefit.The added co-op feature also adds a bit to the replayability, having one player with the keyboard and mouse control one part of octodad while another player with a controller controls another part. The included ""roulette mode"" randomly switches which parts are controlled by which player after completing every objective. Both result in a frustratingly fun experience for two players. The game's main suffering point is its length; a non-completionist playthrough averaging in around 2 hours. Which is a shame, because the plot is interesting enough to carry you through it and the characters (particularly the titular dad himself) are all very endearing and well written (this is some of the most realistic child dialogue I can think of in a game). The game's humor, besides from the main mechanic, works well throughout the game from start to finish. From various references to generally funny dialogue between characters. It is also nice to see a family friendly game around. I can easily see a child laughing at Octodad's goofy antics and blubbing, or perhaps playing co-op with a sibling or parent. Octodad could have easily been done in an episodic format; a new episode, some new mundane situation made more challenging by being an octopus (jury duty, career day at school, chaperoning a field trip, etc.). The announcement of free levels being added later this summer does give me hope for Octodad. I could easilly see myself paying money for a big pack of levels in this style. In the end, Octodad is a short but sweet title. Enjoyable for children and adults, a good sense of humor, memorable characters, and gameplay unlike any other. Hopefully upcoming updates from Young Horses and content from the Steam Workshop will help make Octodad: Dadliest Catch a classic.			"

												Octodad: Dadliest Catch is straight out a true original. With polished graphics and a basic story it proves to be a delight to play. There was one part in the last level which did get pretty ridiculously hard as of precision walking needed. This part did get pretty frustrating and I only got through it by winging it by throwing his legs everywhere till I could reach the next checkpoint. Bar this, the game was just about flawless. Each level provides plenty silliness having you performing quite simple everday tasks.  There's usually no punishment for failing these tasks allowing you to laugh at♥♥♥♥♥♥ups. There are areas where you may be watched where making mistakes can add up to retrying. However, there's a freeplay mode to allow you to go back to levels and be as ridiculous as you can be. I was not disappointed with Octodad. I was even surprised by how much fun I've had with it. The end does do something that will probably surprise you all. It is a short game but its length fits it. With Steam workshop there's certainly much more nonsense to come. Well worth the full price, trust me.			"

												I'm glad that I decided to give this game a try because I absolutely loved it. It's very similar to Surgeon Simulator in the sense that it's boasting some wacky controls and a great sense of humour. I also enjoyed the clever references and the surprisingly entertaining storyline. Octodad ticks a lot more boxes than I first expected it to. The game is plagued by a huge problem, however, and it's an issue that I actually have with a lot of indie titles: It's too short. In fact, taking the price tag into account it's criminally short. I finished the whole game in just under 3 hours and I wasn't rushing. However, replay value can balance out a game's price:length ratio and this game is a very fun experience that definitely warrants multiple playthroughs. While I would recommend this game I really want to emphasise that the best move would be to buy it while it's on sale. Awesome game overall, though. Definitely consider giving it a go.			"

It takes some getting used to, but the game realizes you're and octpus and makes some things like putting on clothes or plugging something in automated and easy. The level design and sound design are very well polished too, especially for an indie game.This is the very first full realease game from Young Horses. With the Steam workshop and co-op (one person contols one arm or leg) there is some replay value to be found.I finished it in one sitting, but had a blast with every encounter and level.8/10			"

It took everything that I loved about the first game and made it better--the controls feel tighter, the music is EXCELLENT, and the ties are weirdly satisfying as a collectable. Aside from ONE UNNECESSARILY DIFFICULT PART AT THE END, lots of the tasks in the game are just challenging enough to feel rewarding upon completion, but never so tough that they're frustrating (aside from the aforementioned part).Whatever Young Horses does next, I'm on board.

The chef tries to kill octodad, and also tries to make hes family find out he is an octopus.The game is short, but the fun story and eastereggs along the game, makes the game worth it.

												Not Recommended. Doesn't make sense AT ALL! It's just a human dad going around everyday business.Okay, that overused joke aside, this is a great game. Yes it's silly, yes it can be kind of frustrating. Does the frustratingness keep you from having fun? Not at all. Is there replay value? Depends on what kind of person you are. I'm speedrunning it. Is it long enough? Not really that long :( I'm not that great with reviews, so I'll just put my ratings for the different things here.Story: 7/10Replay Value: 7/10Fun: 10/10Difficulty: 8/10Length: 6.5/10Result: 9/10			"

												This game is a great piece of work, it is a small game, but yet is full of details when we put time to explore every parts of the game, I played all levels many times and I will keep doing it because everytime the game is a bit different and it is always a real pleasure. Theres a lots of humor in the game that provide a great gameplay experience. The musics in the game are also great and add a good part of the gameplay atmosphere. The story itself is also a wonderful one, it mixes funny things, with deep meaning as the fear of being different, and how to deal with it. Overall, I greatly recommend this game, it really worth the time and the price and and the gameplay is good and fun to play. Enjoy it everyone.			"

												I came into this game expecting very little.  After all, the premise is that you're an octopus in a suit and ""nobody suspects a thing"".  The controls in the game are purposely frustrating, adding to the game's humorous tone.  Thankfully, it was never so frustrating that I felt compelled to throw things.  Some of the earlier tasks in the game were fun to complete.  Most later tasks, however, involved walking (if that's what you call it) from one side of a room to another and picking something up.  By this point in the game, the novelty of being an octopus has worn off.  I would like to say the game is too short, but it couldn't possibly keep itself going longer than it did.  Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a sense of humor.			"

												If you're looking for a long narrative in Octodad, don't expect one. It doesn't have a long storyline to it. But this, however surprisingly, isn't that deterring to the game's quality. Yes, it may be short, but in that short time, they were able to show an emotional story of fatherhood and fear of exposure that will probably get you in your soft spot. The game has so much replay value in it's Free Play mode (Fully unlocked after completing the story), even if it's simply flopping around and being silly. And while the collectables *could* have been expanded, the ties are still a great thing to hunt after.Where the game gets it true replay value, howeverm is in the Workshop. Young Horses has graciously given us access to the same level editor they used to make the story levels in Octodad. So now, in the future, you could potentially expect this game to be like Happy Wheels, the community banding together to make more great abnd original levels, and Young Horses giving new items and new physics to the game.All in all, Octodad isn't for everyone. But if you like a game that you can just relax and goof off with, I'd definetly reccomend this for you.			"

												Octodad is a hilariously fun game. It’s got some pretty fun controls. Think QWOP, Surgeon Simulator or Probably Archery, but unlike these, the controls actually make the frustration fun. The physics really make this game golden. It’s a bummer that there’s no co-op online, only local. You play as Octodad performing seemingly mindless tasks made difficult by the fact that your mouse controls your arms and legs. The dialogue is hilarious, and with a little patience and sheer determination you’re sure to have fun with this game. It’s a lot better than flailing around your keyboard trying to hop over the finish line, pecking at keys in hopes of not killing your patient, and a lot better than frustratingly trying to nock and arrow. Fresh and colorful with cheerful music and graphics, this game is a fun play. 7/10			"

												Nobody would ever suspect that a dumb physics game about an octopus could become popular.  Yet here we are with a sequel now full-blown with achievements, storyline and age-appropriate voice acting.  The continuing saga of everybody's new favourite cephalopod is an absolute blast to play and surprisingly not so difficult as some people claim it to be, once you've learnt how axis work again.Dadliest Catch is a much sharper, smoother and longer experience than the first game as well as most electric shaver commercials claim to be.  It is a paradigm of simplicity, in that trying to do simple actions while having the most obstructive controls should not be a popular game.  In fact that would be the very antithesis of a bad game.  Yet it's not.What really makes the game work is that there's a REASON for the odd control, you are an octopus pretending to be a human, and that makes it alright.  That makes it excusable, it's funny, it's dumb, it's brilliant and very appropriate.  The music is charming and very 1950s with the main theme rocking towards the 60s' style, the characters are all very charming people and you will never believe how much there is to know about Kelp.Like, seriously, there's a lot of kelp stuff you can learn in this game.But the point is, Octodad's second/full and proper game is an absolute blast to play if your PC can run smooth.  It's an adorable idealised world, the protagonist is one of the nicest guys in gaming and the concept is genuinely fun to play with the entirety of struggling to control him being actually really entertaining.  If you're the sort of person who can just fall back into the waters of enjoying a game for its absurdity, then Octodad is waiting for you.			"

I beat the main game in less than four hours, and that was with taking about an hour to get the achievment for dying a hundred times, which took a really long time, considering I did that while on the ship.

												Extremely fun, extremely goofy. Lots of ties. Lots of fun. The storyline is full with comedy. Sadly it's over rather fast and you can't really play it for long periods of time (Walking is rather confusing). It does contain SOME bugs (Getting thrown out of a map and then dieing instantly which makes you restart the level isn't cool.)			"

												I was a Kickstarter of the original Octodad, donating quite a bit after the ingenuity of the original game. I waited a couple of years for the release of Octodad 2: Dadliest Catch, and the wait was definitely worth it. Octodad 2 builds on the quirkiness of the original wonderfully, allowing us to continue on as a Normal Everyday Father who, plagued with incredibly awkward controls, tries to continue living a Normal Everyday Life, without his Secret Identity being revealed.The controls have to be mentioned. They're weird, and they're awesome. At first, the controls are cumbersome and incredibly difficult to use, but after 10 or 20 minutes, after you get to grips with it, it's almost like being in control of a flight simulator. You ""get it"", and using and perfecting the movement is very satisfying. The game itself is funny and original, and the perfect length for what it's trying to do, not too short, but not too long. The achievements are cool and add some extra replayability, with an option to time your run for speedrunners (one of the few games I've seen to ever do this!)So yeah, I thoroughly recommend this game, I am a very happy backer of this project.Nilesy			"

												This game is a great piece of work, it is a small game, but yet is full of details when we put time to explore every parts of the game, I played all levels many times and I will keep doing it because everytime the game is a bit different and it is always a real pleasure. Theres a lots of humor in the game that provide a great gameplay experience. The musics in the game are also great and add a good part of the gameplay atmosphere. The story itself is also a wonderful one, it mixes funny things, with deep meaning as the fear of being different, and how to deal with it. Overall, I greatly recommend this game, it really worth the time and the price and and the gameplay is good and fun to play. Enjoy it everyone.			"

												Octodad: Dadliest Catch is a game about destruction, deception, and fatherhood. The player controls Octodad, a dapper octopus masquerading as a human, as he goes about his life. Octodad's existence is a constant struggle, as he must master mundane tasks with his unwieldy boneless tentacles while simultaneously keeping his cephalopodan nature a secret from his human family.Octodad is a great example of a game that conveys a message through gameplay. In conjunction with its story, characters, and setting, the controls offer an empathetic look into the life of an extreme outsider trying to fit in and trying to do right by his family...I love that. Gaming is growing up, and Octodad is some of the best evidence of that.Smartly built, endlessly entertaining, and unexpectedly heartwarming, Dadliest Catch manages to turn an utterly ridiculous concept into one of the most surprising games in recent memory.Would recomend!

												Octodad is a hilariously fun game. It’s got some pretty fun controls. Think QWOP, Surgeon Simulator or Probably Archery, but unlike these, the controls actually make the frustration fun. The physics really make this game golden. It’s a bummer that there’s no co-op online, only local. You play as Octodad performing seemingly mindless tasks made difficult by the fact that your mouse controls your arms and legs. The dialogue is hilarious, and with a little patience and sheer determination you’re sure to have fun with this game. It’s a lot better than flailing around your keyboard trying to hop over the finish line, pecking at keys in hopes of not killing your patient, and a lot better than frustratingly trying to nock and arrow. Fresh and colorful with cheerful music and graphics, this game is a fun play. 7/10			"

												defo reccomend you play this game! :D its really awesome! :) the concept may seem random at first (an octopus living with humans) but once you get use to that then you willl start having a good time on this game :) i won,t spoil the story to much but its basically about octodad living with a human family and having to do tasks along the way :) there is assigned missions but you can  throw everything to look for ties :) i would,nt say this is a downside but the game is short and its one of those games you want to play even more of as i really enjoyed it although i will defo be coming back to this game for many reasons: its really fun,time trials,free mode to look for ties and try to finish it on hard as i finished it on normal. i hope there will be another octodad as i recently bought this in sale and its been out for awhile so octodad 3 if that ever is announced i would defo get day 1 as this is so worth the money even at £11. I know the game is short but that dosen,t mean that you can,t go back to it right? :) im gonna play this a lot as its fun to explore the levels and replay the game oh and don't forget achievement hunting like 1 is throw the wedding ring on to scarlets finger rather then placing it on her. if you can you should defo buy this game as its something that you will want to go back to :)			"

												Octodad is a wonderful 3D Adventure Game. While the puzzles are mostly very easy, you will spend quite some time controling Octodad. As being an Octopus on land is quite a struggle, the game recreates this wonderfully with the well designed complex controlsystem and the fact that people will get suspicious if you go all Octo and no Dad. The humor is delightful and even though the whole thing only takes about 3 hours it was a magical time, helping a cute Octopus to be a good father and Husband too his slighty delusional family, that does not seem to take notice of you being clearly no human. The Steam Workshop hopefully grants us many more great levels.			"

A fantastic game, but please fix the lag.I have just tried the latest update and there a huge decrease in lag. Instead of huge lag spikes, there is just the tiniest bit of freezing up, there is room for improvement, but a big thank you to the Young Horses team!			"

												I absolutely adore this game. It's fun to play, and it's extremely fun to watch. We've begun playing ""OctoShots"" where one person plays the game and has to take a drink every time they complete an objective. This game drunk is just as fun, if not more fun than when sober.			"

												This is a cute game in the spirit of QWOP (but easier) where you control an octopus pretending to be a human. The story is short and has lots of variety, and I didn't get bored at all. The times when you're struggling with the controls (which are ""good"" but of course the point is trying to navigate this world using absurd octopus legs, which is inherently hard) can be a little frustrating, but that is the point, and the frustration usually leads to a chuckle at how ridiculous the premise is. I had a great time.			"

												This is what an indie game should be: Fun, imaginative, and something that you actually want to play. The controls are awkward, but that's the whole point! Learn to navigate as Octodad while completely trashing the room and knocking everything over is a bunch of fun. Some parts are a little frustrating as you try to master the controls, but the goofy sense of humor and gameplay overall more than make up for it. If I have one complaint, it's that the game isn't long enough. I want more flopping, flailing Octodad!			"

												If you're looking for a long narrative in Octodad, don't expect one. It doesn't have a long storyline to it. But this, however surprisingly, isn't that deterring to the game's quality. Yes, it may be short, but in that short time, they were able to show an emotional story of fatherhood and fear of exposure that will probably get you in your soft spot. The game has so much replay value in it's Free Play mode (Fully unlocked after completing the story), even if it's simply flopping around and being silly. And while the collectables *could* have been expanded, the ties are still a great thing to hunt after.Where the game gets it true replay value, howeverm is in the Workshop. Young Horses has graciously given us access to the same level editor they used to make the story levels in Octodad. So now, in the future, you could potentially expect this game to be like Happy Wheels, the community banding together to make more great abnd original levels, and Young Horses giving new items and new physics to the game.All in all, Octodad isn't for everyone. But if you like a game that you can just relax and goof off with, I'd definetly reccomend this for you.			"

												defo reccomend you play this game! :D its really awesome! :) the concept may seem random at first (an octopus living with humans) but once you get use to that then you willl start having a good time on this game :) i won,t spoil the story to much but its basically about octodad living with a human family and having to do tasks along the way :) there is assigned missions but you can  throw everything to look for ties :) i would,nt say this is a downside but the game is short and its one of those games you want to play even more of as i really enjoyed it although i will defo be coming back to this game for many reasons: its really fun,time trials,free mode to look for ties and try to finish it on hard as i finished it on normal. i hope there will be another octodad as i recently bought this in sale and its been out for awhile so octodad 3 if that ever is announced i would defo get day 1 as this is so worth the money even at £11. I know the game is short but that dosen,t mean that you can,t go back to it right? :) im gonna play this a lot as its fun to explore the levels and replay the game oh and don't forget achievement hunting like 1 is throw the wedding ring on to scarlets finger rather then placing it on her. if you can you should defo buy this game as its something that you will want to go back to :)			"

												Octodad is a very silly slapstick game with a boatload of charm. The main draw of the game is controlling Octodad through various human environments to accomplish certain objectives. The ""octocontrols"", which are very sensitive and slippery much like an octopus would be, look complicated at first, but are actually a lot of fun to play with and they never feel too cheap, but more like a learning curve that takes a while to adjust to. Octodad thankfully isn't a hard game either, save for a few parts where you need to be rather accurate with your tentacles. The characters range from the main squid himself who's a likable, determined, but nervous ball of ink, to well written family stereotypes, to having a pun-riddled chef as the main bad guy, to the various annoyed or eccentric human npcs that drive the satire home. The satire is part of the reason I consider Octodad's flaw to be it's length. The game has a great sense of humor, and even with all the achievements and the workshop support and the tie collecting it felt like a sample of something that could have been even bigger and funnier. I wanted more, and maybe I expected too much, but that in itself is evidence of how lovable this game can be.As a drawn out example, my favorite part of the game is the silly hats and outfits you can wear or put on as disguises, but it was heavily underutilized and not even necessary to progress in the game, besides the ones the game forces you to wear for the plot. You're an octopus pretending to be a human, that's what this game is about, so having an optional hitman-like disguise system would have added a lot of fun. If it ever gets a sequel I hope this is perhaps expanded upon. Despite my moaning about what could have been, I'm still going to recommend Octodad, though, because for what it's worth it's still enjoyable, humerous, slapsticky fun with a great sense of wit and enough extra content for replayability.

												This game is hilarious and fun to play. The controls are very awkward and lead to a messy play, which is certainly intended. There's even an intruging little story, carrying you from one area to the next as you attempt to blend in with the other humans. It's really rather forgiving, and makes for a casual playthrough. My only real complaint is the length. It is incredbly short, even for a game under 20 bucks. I imagine the replability will come through the workshop.			"

It takes some getting used to, but the game realizes you're and octpus and makes some things like putting on clothes or plugging something in automated and easy. The level design and sound design are very well polished too, especially for an indie game.This is the very first full realease game from Young Horses.

												This game is just so much fun. I love everything from its music to it creative gamplay to just the cool little refences shoved into it. The game took about three hours to beat, amd those hours were well spent. I mean this game made me go crazy trying to collect the ties and getting some of the achievements took a little more than effort to get, but it was worth. You play as and octopus in a suit, who cooks hamburgers, can disguise as anyone, and can fight sushi chefs off with just a bit of finesse. I would say this game is a must for all Indie game players. 9.5/10 (**** Please note this my OPINION and if you don't agree with me, that is fine. ****)			"

												Octodad is  a funny, quirky and unique experience, that I think everyone should try! I don't remember when was the last time a game has made me laugh and rage so much at the same time. The main mechanic is the frustrating controlls, which makes perfect sense, as you are trying to maneuver a boneless jelly blob around multiple areas full of stuff to break by ""accident"". The levels never overstay their welcome and there seems to be something new and fun stuff to do all the time.The game is a bit on the short side, but that's kind of expected, as there really is just one big mechanic to work with. I blazed through the game in couple of sittings and once you've finished, there's a slowly growing Steam workshop library stuff to mess around with. I may play through it again pretty soon and try to complete every achievement I missed on the first playthrough. I can wholeheartedly recommed Octodad to anyone who want's to laugh, cry and spot half a billion of pop culture references.			"

												Octodad is a wonderful 3D Adventure Game. While the puzzles are mostly very easy, you will spend quite some time controling Octodad. As being an Octopus on land is quite a struggle, the game recreates this wonderfully with the well designed complex controlsystem and the fact that people will get suspicious if you go all Octo and no Dad. The humor is delightful and even though the whole thing only takes about 3 hours it was a magical time, helping a cute Octopus to be a good father and Husband too his slighty delusional family, that does not seem to take notice of you being clearly no human. The Steam Workshop hopefully grants us many more great levels.			"

												It's damn good, and certainly something you need to at least try. You may have heard complaints that it's too short, but all of those complaints are completely misguided. Yeah, it's short, but it's not too short. In fact, I'd argue that the length is pretty much perfect.It's nicely structured too. The first few levels are spent trying to perform ordinary tasks with the clumsy controls, the next few are spent performing a series of challenges to see if you've been paying attention, with the last few focused on wrapping up the story, while also experimenting with the gameplay a little.And to be honest that's all they can do, really. There's nowhere else they could've taken the concept. They could've made a few more levels but I much prefer the huge amount of attention paid to the current levels. It's short yeah, but that's because any unnecessary fluff has been cut off. I suspect I'll enjoy the game more than most people do, although I'm not sure why. I just find everything about Octodad himself endlessly entertaining. I haven't played any other game where even the act of moving your character is hilarious. I've seen some pretty dark comparisons to the story, relating it to alcoholisms and whatnot, but I think it's actually pretty lovely how he just tries to get on with his life despite being, y'know, an octopus.Okay I should probably stop rambling now.

												Octodad is a funny and almost brilliant concept, combining slapstick comedy with fatherhood. But, it has some serious lag issues that need adressing. I can play the wedding prologue without any problems what so ever, but on the 'Home, sweet, home' level, I can barely get him out of bed without my computer freezing up! A fantastic game, but please fix the lag.I have just tried the latest update and there a huge decrease in lag. Instead of huge lag spikes, there is just the tiniest bit of freezing up, there is room for improvement, but a big thank you to the Young Horses team!			"

Posted: October 17, 2014
												Where do I start?  Octodad is a simulator that involves achieving basic human tasks, as a ""basic human"".  The charm of this game isn't the initially hilarious crazy physics engine (where destroying a room is a perfectly acceptable way to walk through it), but that it provides a brilliant parody to both itself, and the entire video game condition.  So much so, that the *explanatory blubber* provides a perfect reflection of exactly how we expect video games to respond to the circumstances of the scene, and go so far to illustrate the vast levels suspension of disbelief can take us.  So much so that the *game review blubber* isn't just a suitable shortcut for the dialogue, but is seemless and efficiently integrated into the game world.  Octodad is a near perfect parody of the essence of video games, but perhaps it goes a few steps too far.While Octodad certainly has its charm, it does fall short in a few areas.  Firstly, the narrative is far too short (given the price tag).  That's not to say it's not fulfilling, but it is noticeably tiny for how much it costs.  This is offset by the workshop, where a single Miley Cyrus mod alone makes the purchase worth it (if hilarious parodies are what you're into).  Unfortunately, the devs also decided that despite being a walking simulator, it needed to have increasing difficulty as the story progresses.  Some will find this acceptable, but I do not.  Given the small scope of the game (wrestling with walking and arm action physics), the artificial difficulty quickly goes from hilarious to frustrating.  You successfully scaled the mountain of hell?  Well, don't fall off trying to wrestle the physics engine through a tiny hole, or you'll be back to the start.  Finally succeeded in navigating a tiny plank with the most awkward of controls?  Well the devs thought it'd be a great idea to put breakable structures at the end of said path, and make you start again if you fail.Unfortunately, while the idea is admirable, being able to walk in this game only gets to the point of management, not mastery.  So you'll find yourself constantly wrestling with the game in an attempt to progress what would take you ten seconds in any other game (I was stuck in one room for about twenty minutes).  The novelty quickly wears off, and turns to frustration (intuitiveness is not this game's strength).  The tasks in the game are not so difficult, however wrestling with the game to do the task is.  A perfect example is trying to fill two wine glasses with wine.  Pray to god that you don't accidentally knock a glass over, because without rotational input, it's an absolute nightmare trying to reposition a glass back to it's proper orientation.  This is not a game you play to 'cool off' after a frustrating day.Still, Octodad scratches an itch that other games just can't.  While, as I mentioned earlier, the novelty wears off quick, the charm never does.  Even when you reach the point of despair, ready to hurl your computer against the wall, you'll find yourself firing it up a few hours or a few days or a few weeks later, just out of its uniqueness.  This game will test your patience, but it'll do so in a 'frustratingly ignorant puppy' kind of way.  My advice, if you do reach the point of despair (and alt-f4 just isn't an option), is to walk under a hand dryer.  You just can't stay mad at this game.The pros:Brilliant insight to the levels of suspension of disbelief a game can provide.Fantastic novelty item, with a decent framework hilarious moments and situations (biologists KNOW when they see a fish).Solid accompanying soundtrack, where even just a timed mouse click scene can get the adrenaline pumping.A few scenes that are far deeper than they appear on the surface.  My example for this is the *contented blubber* of a 'man' who has returned to something he loves, followed quickly by a *gameface* when remembering why he gave it up in the first place.Scratches a unique itch.The cons:Artificial and frustrating difficulty (do not play this game on a bad day!)A short and shallow storyShort-lived noveltyThe verdict?  Definitely pick this up if you're a novelty gamer.  Avoid if you like depth or intuitiveness.			"

												The game is short (approx. 2 hours), with sometimes very frustrating gameplay (controlling Octodad's limbs to climb up ladders or stacks of boxes over and over again), etc. But also fun, filled with humour and an excellent party-game with two or more players (the ensueing chaos with four players is magnificent).Good buy when it's on sale ; not entirely recommended when full priced due to how short and repetitive it is.

What lovely graphics.3. BLRBLRBBLLLRB4. Dawww. He's got a family!CONS:1. I WANT MORE. The game's a little short, but still good.2. I need a controller to get an achivement? Guess what I'm busting 50 bucks on to go 100%. Oh well. Number 1 dad.3. THE DLC. GIMME GIMME. NOW. PLEASE. EDIT: Oh come on, I know this takes a long time but IT'S NOT EVEN SUMMER ANYMORE. :(4. The full asking price is outrageous when you can get through it AND get a lot of achivements and ties in about 2-2 1/2 hours of playing.Anyways, I like this game but I want more.

												Where do I start?  Octodad is a simulator that involves achieving basic human tasks, as a ""basic human"".  The charm of this game isn't the initially hilarious crazy physics engine (where destroying a room is a perfectly acceptable way to walk through it), but that it provides a brilliant parody to both itself, and the entire video game condition.  So much so, that the *explanatory blubber* provides a perfect reflection of exactly how we expect video games to respond to the circumstances of the scene, and go so far to illustrate the vast levels suspension of disbelief can take us.  So much so that the *game review blubber* isn't just a suitable shortcut for the dialogue, but is seemless and efficiently integrated into the game world.  Octodad is a near perfect parody of the essence of video games, but perhaps it goes a few steps too far.While Octodad certainly has its charm, it does fall short in a few areas.  Firstly, the narrative is far too short (given the price tag).  That's not to say it's not fulfilling, but it is noticeably tiny for how much it costs.  This is offset by the workshop, where a single Miley Cyrus mod alone makes the purchase worth it (if hilarious parodies are what you're into).  Unfortunately, the devs also decided that despite being a walking simulator, it needed to have increasing difficulty as the story progresses.  Some will find this acceptable, but I do not.  Given the small scope of the game (wrestling with walking and arm action physics), the artificial difficulty quickly goes from hilarious to frustrating.  You successfully scaled the mountain of hell?  Well, don't fall off trying to wrestle the physics engine through a tiny hole, or you'll be back to the start.  Finally succeeded in navigating a tiny plank with the most awkward of controls?  Well the devs thought it'd be a great idea to put breakable structures at the end of said path, and make you start again if you fail.Unfortunately, while the idea is admirable, being able to walk in this game only gets to the point of management, not mastery.  So you'll find yourself constantly wrestling with the game in an attempt to progress what would take you ten seconds in any other game (I was stuck in one room for about twenty minutes).  The novelty quickly wears off, and turns to frustration (intuitiveness is not this game's strength).  The tasks in the game are not so difficult, however wrestling with the game to do the task is.  A perfect example is trying to fill two wine glasses with wine.  Pray to god that you don't accidentally knock a glass over, because without rotational input, it's an absolute nightmare trying to reposition a glass back to it's proper orientation.  This is not a game you play to 'cool off' after a frustrating day.Still, Octodad scratches an itch that other games just can't.  While, as I mentioned earlier, the novelty wears off quick, the charm never does.  Even when you reach the point of despair, ready to hurl your computer against the wall, you'll find yourself firing it up a few hours or a few days or a few weeks later, just out of its uniqueness.  This game will test your patience, but it'll do so in a 'frustratingly ignorant puppy' kind of way.  My advice, if you do reach the point of despair (and alt-f4 just isn't an option), is to walk under a hand dryer.  You just can't stay mad at this game.The pros:Brilliant insight to the levels of suspension of disbelief a game can provide.Fantastic novelty item, with a decent framework hilarious moments and situations (biologists KNOW when they see a fish).Solid accompanying soundtrack, where even just a timed mouse click scene can get the adrenaline pumping.A few scenes that are far deeper than they appear on the surface.  My example for this is the *contented blubber* of a 'man' who has returned to something he loves, followed quickly by a *gameface* when remembering why he gave it up in the first place.Scratches a unique itch.The cons:Artificial and frustrating difficulty (do not play this game on a bad day!)A short and shallow storyShort-lived noveltyThe verdict?  Definitely pick this up if you're a novelty gamer.  Avoid if you like depth or intuitiveness.			"

												The best Octopus physics simulator out there. Its main game mechanic is player frustration so I wouldn't bother picking this up if you don't have a sense of humour and don't mind failing at simple tasks.The aim of the game is to control an octopus, pretending to be a normal dad as he does day to day tasks, without letting anyone realise you're actually an octopus, you can control each limb and have to move around the levels as best as you can, the controls can be a little awkward to say the least.Best played in co-op no doubt, roulette mode just adds that extra level of irritation as just when you think you and your friend have got the controls down and are starting to move well, control of each limb switches and you're back to square one.

												Yes; I recommend this game but with a GIANT sidenote.The game is hilariously put together; many ifnot all the words spoken are a laugh and the many hidden jokes and gags make for an entertaining playthrough.The controls are fun to mess around with and even more chaotic once you get multiple people involved.It is however...way too short.In about 2 hours with faffing about you can complete the game; leaving only achievements, hidden ties and some other side things to do which is an incredible shame.I was surprised and sat in my chair waiting for the credits to stop rolling and take me further into the story ... but alas that was it.So take it as you will; Want a game that makes you laugh for an hour or two with friends then by all means go and get it.If you expect to be entertained longer then you're sadly mistaken.

												So first thing I'm gonna say is that this game is just absolutely stupid. It's funny, it's great, but if you're not a fan of slapstick humour, you won't find half of the humour in this game funny.Octodad: Dadliest Catch is an... interesting game just to say the least. You play an octopus disguised as a human with a family. It's like, what? But, miraculously, it still makes a great game. The co-op feature in this game is absolutely hilarious. That's where most of my 4 hours of this game have went so far with friends. Characters are great, level design is great, and it's quite hard to hate. There are quite a few glitches too, but nothing that breaks the game. I finished the story with a very satisfied feeling, apart from the fact they don't explain at all where Tommy and Stacy come from...The only thing about this game is that it's very, very short. Unlike a huge title game, the campaign is very short. You can finish it in about an hour and a half, and, if you know what you're doing, probably under an hour.  Imagine all the other situations Octodad could get into! Imagine if he had to drive his kids to school? Imagine if he needed to go to a meeting? There are so many things that could have happened, but didn't. Really, my opinion is, if you're willing to pay $15 for a game that will provide with some humour, tortorus co-op and some Community Workshop items, buy this game. You won't regret, and there'll be at least one reference you didn't see in the first time playing. (e.g. In the shopping level, there's a type of pie that's called ""Pewdie Pie."" Genius.) But, if you're buying to get hours and hours out of the campaign, online multiplayer and other things from a big budget game, don't buy this game, because you'll be disappointed. I'm just a sort of person that likes creative games, and this is pretty creative, considering you have to do daily dad stuff as an octopus. Find me another game like that and you'll get $100.Workshop levels are also insane fun, like making zero gravity Octodad and 'Wrecking Blub.' Not sure if you wanna know but find out for yourself.In short, Octodad: Dadliest Catch is worth the money if it's your sort of game, but if you hate short campaigns and what not, but you still want to get the game, wait for a Steam sales to rob your wallet to buy this game.I'm going to give this game a 8/10			"

												Comedy is a rare thing in games. Some developers manage it with a witty script, others with outrageous characters that help lighten the mood, but few hit that holy grail of slapstick laugh out loud guffawing like Young Horses do in Octodad: Dadliest Catch.Octodad is just a typical guy, trying to make his way through life with his wife and two children, except that he is an octopus and he has the additional burden of keeping that a secret. Dressed in his snazzy suit, most people are none the wiser about his true identity, but suspicions rise when he is spotted acting strange.In addition to mouse and keyboard control, full game pad support is in place. I ended up preferring playing with a controller, but both work on the same principles. By default, players control three of Octodad's limbs: two legs and one arm. By manipulating their positions in space, Octodad can walk, run, climb, grab objects, and do all of the things a normal human being does. The kicker is that each limb is generally controlled one at a time, and they are all held together with an elasticity that often sends them off in unintended directions.The result is almost like handing a non-gamer a controller and putting him in the thick of a first-person shooter; there is a lot of flailing around and looking at the ground. It takes a certain amount of brain rewiring to be able to make Octodad move as intended, even when the necessary sequence of actions is cognitively clear.In any other game, these would be complaints, but Octodad is specifically about being uncomfortable and learning how to function in a body that is almost alien. For some, it may be frustrating, but for those willing to put in the effort, it is ultimately rewarding to learn how to function as an octopus in society. By the end, players should be able to walk competently without knocking things over or punching kids in the face too often.Being an octopus also affords Octodad some benefits that humans cannot reap, like the ability to squeeze into tight spots or to stretch out over large gaps. Young Horses built this awkward, difficult control scheme, and then crafted environments that take full advantage of its physics.Where the previous title was more of a proof of concept on the control scheme, Dadliest Catch delves a bit more deeply into Octodad lore. Revealed over the course of the campaign are how Octodad and his wife Scarlett met, when he decided to start masquerading as a human, and why the neighbourhood sushi chef wants to kill him so badly. Of course, how he and Scarlett managed to have two human children is jokingly brought up but never seriously addressed.You can't fault its originality, though. It's a game bursting with colour and personality, although the chirpy music does begin to grate after a while. It's hard not to love Octodad as he stumbles through life, and the levels are filled with cute references to indie games and developers, YouTubers such as SeaNanners and PewDiePie, and many more.Truly, Dadliest Catch realises how silly its concept is, and never takes itself too seriously. The writing fits the mood perfectly. Some of the off-hand remarks and terrible marine biology puns are worthy of a few laughs, but the general absurdity of the situation in its entirety is the biggest source of humor throughout the game.The silliness is conveyed well through the graphics and sound as well. Octodad lives in a colorful cartoon world that serves as a welcome contrast to the muted palettes of more realistic games. The soundtrack is similarly upbeat and peppy, and it features a main theme that will be stuck in my head for years.Another potential sticking point for some might be the relatively short length of the story. Clocking in at about three hours, it ends before the central conceit starts to wear thin. Dadliest Catch does about as much as it can with its octopus limb control scheme, but it (ironically) would not have the legs to last much longer. I personally had no issue with the length, but those who like to calculate hours of entertainment per dollar may take exception that the main story finishes not very long after it begins.Alleviating that a bit are some optional objectives for those who want to keep playing. Each level hides three custom neckties for Octodad to wear, each requiring thorough exploration, tricky climbing, or some interaction with the environment. Additionally, each level has a par time to beat, opening it up for potential speed running.Also included is Steam Workshop support, so users can create their own levels, and a hilarious cooperative mode that allows up to four players to control one or more limbs, requiring an unusual form of teamwork and resulting in an even more awkward octopus than usual. Despite the short length of the campaign, there is enough in place for diehard enthusiasts to keep going for as long as they want.In the end, I would not be surprised to hear that the Octodad community is thriving years down the road. It exudes a certain weirdness and charm that makes it stand out from a lot of other titles out there, and there are tools in place for it to live on past the point when the credits start to roll. Though it has some issues with frame rate drops and its approach to control is definitely not for everybody, Dadliest Catch kept a smile on my face for most of its duration.TL;DR: The long-awaited video game adaptation of The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife.

												Should you buy Octodad: Dadliest Catch?Being a dad is hard, and if your a octopus its even harder! So can you, Octodad, take on the challenges that face your everyday family life? Will that crazy sushi chef stop following you?The game has really wonky controls, but that what makes the game fun! Its like Surgeon Simulator 2013 but with walking. The game has many intresting levels, all with clever challenges. Do you think you are ""Dad"" enough to handle a trip to the aquarium? Many suprises await for Octodad. And you will be along for the ride.So: Final Oppinion, if you have some money, deffientally don't pass this up. Bail out your wallet right now and buy it. For Young Horses first game (Not counting their first octodad) this is a ""Splash"" hit! Ha, am I clever or what?Hello?Anyway, I rate this as a yes. And if Young Horses reads this, you guys should totally plan a sequal to this game.			"

												The game is short (approx. 2 hours), with sometimes very frustrating gameplay (controlling Octodad's limbs to climb up ladders or stacks of boxes over and over again), etc. But also fun, filled with humour and an excellent party-game with two or more players (the ensueing chaos with four players is magnificent).Good buy when it's on sale ; not entirely recommended when full priced due to how short and repetitive it is.

												Should you buy Octodad: Dadliest Catch?Being a dad is hard, and if your a octopus its even harder! So can you, Octodad, take on the challenges that face your everyday family life? Will that crazy sushi chef stop following you?The game has really wonky controls, but that what makes the game fun! Its like Surgeon Simulator 2013 but with walking. The game has many intresting levels, all with clever challenges. Do you think you are ""Dad"" enough to handle a trip to the aquarium? Many suprises await for Octodad. And you will be along for the ride.So: Final Oppinion, if you have some money, deffientally don't pass this up. Bail out your wallet right now and buy it. For Young Horses first game (Not counting their first octodad) this is a ""Splash"" hit! Ha, am I clever or what?Hello?Anyway, I rate this as a yes. And if Young Horses reads this, you guys should totally plan a sequal to this game.			"

												The best Octopus physics simulator out there. Its main game mechanic is player frustration so I wouldn't bother picking this up if you don't have a sense of humour and don't mind failing at simple tasks.The aim of the game is to control an octopus, pretending to be a normal dad as he does day to day tasks, without letting anyone realise you're actually an octopus, you can control each limb and have to move around the levels as best as you can, the controls can be a little awkward to say the least.Best played in co-op no doubt, roulette mode just adds that extra level of irritation as just when you think you and your friend have got the controls down and are starting to move well, control of each limb switches and you're back to square one.

												Indescribably much fun. Although the game is not really big, I completed it in 5 to 6 hours, it's definitely worth the time. Matter of fact, in those 5 hours I laughed for about ten hours, cried in tears for two whole years and I only ragequitted for about a million times.This game is so dumb, my IQ is probably halved right now. The storyline doesn't make any sense whatever, and the characters are really hilarious. So are the chats they have during the game.One downside to the game is the fact that I completed it. It just should go endlessly.When I bought this game the only thing I knew about it was it was about an octopus and it was dumb. For the rest I had no idea what to expect, but this experience really blew my mind. 10/10I need more of this. RIGHT NOW! GIVE ME, GIVE ME MORE!			"

												I think that ths is a good game. It needs to be longer, but it's very polished and there have been no bugs that I have been able to find. I liked the ending. It was, without spoiling it, a traditional boss fight. The boss fight was hard which I, at the time found frustrating, but I am glad it was hard as it would have been an anticlimax otherwise. The implamentation of collectable ties was a good idea. In the future, it would be great to see some implamentation of a multiplayer. That would be quirky and cool though im unsure how it would work. A possibility for custom ties would be a nice addition, possibly adopting the tf2 ideology where you can obtain 'special' ties or hats etc, though I feel that this would only work well with a multiplayer version of the game. I think that the price of £15 may have been slightly too high seeing as the play-time was probably between 4 hours, though I understand that the quality of the game may have dropped if the business's costs were't covered. And besides, if they can produce a game this polished then they probably deserve to earn a good chunk of profit. After getting used to the controls, they were easy to use for what they were - this is obviously a well designed game. I would recomend this game to anyone who's looking for a casual, fun and creative game. Out of 10, I would rate this an 8/10, very good.			"

Easily something you can play more than once, especially if you want to try getting as many achievements as you can.

												I was expecting a Goat Simulator clone with this game but was pleasantly surprised that this ended up being a fun game. You play an octupus who is pretending to be human,who also has a family somehow. The levels in the game sees you trying to do simple everyday tasks while trying to avoid drawing to much attention so you aren't outed as being an octupus. This sounds easy enough but the catch is that each of Octodads limbs is controlled seperately and you have to co-ordinate each limb to complete your tasks. This is actually quite fun and trying to do things like mow the lawn while your falling about swinging a lawnmower as you go is a memorable experience. This game is surprisingly structured with a story and levels with various goals which is something i hadn't expected,as i had anticipated a sandbox type game similar to Goat Simulator. What really lets the game down is how short it is. You could easily finish this in a couple of hours which is a shame as it feels like they could have maybe packed in a few more levels. There is a range of mods that give limited replay value but the ones i did try i didn't play for very long.The Good:- fun light hearted casual game- levels are enjoyable and so is trying co-ordinate Octodad through seemingly simple tasksThe Bad:- very short  Overall this is a decent game and though it seems a silly premise i enjoyed it more than i thought. It's let down by how short it is and i really can't recommend buying this game at full price for that reason. If you like casual silly games then pick this up when it's on sales. If you hated games like Goat Simulator or Surgeon Simulator give this a miss. 6.5/10			"

												Its not easy being a father. Or an octopus. So when you put that together? Whacky waving limbs fun time! This game is a tad on the short side. I beat it in around 3 hours but they have added the addition of Steam Workshop so that will add more playtime. Worth the price? Eh. When it gets down to $7.50 I would say yes but as of right now no. If you love the idea and the premise however, go ahead. I bought it on that alone and had a blast.			"

												Picked this game up on sale and it was a fun, if incredibly brief experience. It's qwop with aquatic life. Well, sort of anyway. Playing with a controller (which is recommended) the movement is controlled by the triggers acting as your legs and the sticks manuvering your right arm in order to solve various tasks. The issue that comes up with this control scheme though is that there's no reliable way to control the camera. You can use the d-pad to glance the camera in the direction you press, but it's not helpful. In fact the camera is probably one of the biggest reasons there's some conveyence problems with certain levels when trying to figure out what to do next. The movement in itself isn't as hard as it looks. There's a reasonable amount of lock on when picking up objects so that you don't have to be pinpoint accurate when picking up or placing objects and walking is fine if you just alternate the triggers. Where it gets annoying is when you have to make your way up stairs, ladders, or catwalks. The imprecise gangliness of your legs is one of the main jokes of the game, but it quickly becomes a pain when you have fallen off the ledge for the umpteenth time or move your legs too much and fall all the way down the ladder to where you started.The story is lacking in some explanation and real buildup resulting in a hasty conclusion. Octodad is a surprisingly emotive character though, and a joy to see blurb and react to situations. Though this is somewhat of a nitpick. This is a story in a game where an octopus is a father of a human family.TLDR: Very short, premise can get annoying in certain situations, but it's a cute and enjoyable game nonetheless. Pick it up on a sale.			"

A little bit challenging to play on a keyboard on the faster moments, but definitely far from impossible. Easily something you can play more than once, especially if you want to try getting as many achievements as you can. Despite it  being a physics game, very rarely did I actually get frustrated with the controls. Maybe it's just too dang cute to get mad at. The main character is, in any case.			"

												Octodad is perhaps ten times crazier than initial looks would suggest. The movement feels more like controlling slithering slimy tentacles and less like controlling an arm made of beanbags from the original game so hilarity falls naturally as a result of your efforts to perform both the mundane and the whacky. Might be a little on the pricey side, but with Workshop support you can't go wrong.			"

												At first, i just couldn't see what it was people seemed to like about this game, it's just seemed to odd in it's whole concept and plot but first after completing it i realized why.You play as a normal everyday human dad, doing choores and taking care of his family, doing things like buy groceries, clean up the house, take care of your kids, mow the lawn. Just normal everyday stuff, and some weird chef which seems to want to get you for some reason, which was a really confusing choice for a villain to be after a normal caring husband and father of 2 children. At first i thought this was some sort of weird 'life of a father' simulator game, it was first at the end of the game that the real twist got to me and revealed a plot-twist that is easily put there with legendary twists in games like Bioshock and Spec Ops the Line.Even though it feels weird just playing as a completely normal dad who isn't strange or different in any manner just stick with it until the end, and it will be worth it.

												Score: 7.5 / 10Price/Value: $5Time: 3 HoursDifficulty: HardThis turned out to be a lot better than I had initially expected. Octodad has you playing as an octopus masquerading as an everyday human being. Comedy is what this title is all about as you aternate between tentacles for feet and arms to perform everyday tasks. The trick is to be as smooth and precise as possible so your family and other humans don't discover your horrifying secret. With only three hours of content I can't recommend this for higher than $5; but considering how often this title goes on sale it shouldn't be too difficult to nab it cheap.			"

												I'm torn on whether to rate the game up or down. Up because it IS a good game - it's fun, funny and fantastic co-op. Lots of physics based silliness, wobbling around and throwing things at people. Down because it's a very (VERY) short game. You're looking at a few hours tops to complete the entire game from start to end.So with that in mind, I would recommend the game but only if you can get it cheap (£5 or less).			"

												A very amusing and cute ragdoll physics game, in which you control a very wiggly octopus--er, I mean, NORMAL HUMAN BEING. The controls are very bizarre at first, but I found myself getting fairly comfortable with them after playing the game for a bit. While the main story and characters are funny and well done, some of the most amusing parts of the game are in the details; the game is peppered with witty references (seen in many of the products at the grocery store) and amusing details (the stained glass window in the church, and the identity of the ""Best Man"" at the wedding). For me, the game has two flaws to it. The first is that it's fairly short. I finished the main story the same day I bought the game. It does have some replay value through co-op and achievements, but it would have been nice if the game was a bit longer (or had bonus chapters, etc.). The second is that the camera angles get a little awkward. The camera adjusts itself based on where it is you are in a level, but I found it didn't always adjust accordingly if I tried to go back to an area (for example, I tried to go back into the kitchen in the second level once, but the camera refused to move past the doorway, so essentially couldn't go back inside without being completely blind). You can use the WASD keys to alter the camera slightly, but I didn't find this to be very helpful. Overall, I would recommend the game. Considering how short it is, however, I would recommend getting it while it's on sale instead of paying full price..Edit: I nominated this game for the Steam awards. Partially because I wanted to give it a shout-out, but mostly because I was too lazy to write a review for any of the other games I nominated.			"

Makes up for it if you download maps in the workshop though- The last boss fight was a bit too easy. I found some of the 'normal' play harderAll in all, I think it's a pretty good game that can frustrate you a little with the walking (In a fun way), and in my opinion, it's worth the money.10/10			"

												I Totally recommend this game! The only bad thing it is that the story mode is short, BUT steam workshop and level edit tools compensate it (Can't wait to have some more free time to mess with the map tool).I think my review is biased in some sort, as I'm fanboy of workshop & user created content. But that isn't a bad thing, at least for me it is incredible when devs give players the power to create things for the game.Controls: Top! I love how you use to control the octodad, it is easy to learn but hard to dominate, making the whole game experience good to play. I've played on a controller and so I recommend you to play it.Music: Great! I loved the main theme, the audio fits very well throught the game.Plot: Man, I loved it, I wished there was more routine situations involving Octodad. If it was a saturday morning cartoon I would watch EVERY SINGLE EPISODE! Seriously, this kind of plot fits very well in a animated cartoon.Now translated in Bloblobs for Octopus gamers:Blosbloboblosblo, blohbloloblosblo... blosh bloblobl.

												Octodad looked like a very silly and unnecessary concept, and didn't seem like it'd be a game that you would get your money worth out of. I am here to say that I was surprisingly proven wrong when I decided to purchase Octodad. The original game was quirky and seemed to be just a joke...until they actually turned it into a full game. Octodad: Dadliest Catch is very much of a sleeper hit as was Papers, Please last year.Gameplay: Everything you do and interact with is physics based, which also includes walking around (or how others would call it, fumbling around.) It's a weird concept that turned out to be a fun-filled romp of slapping around into everything in the world plus stretching your appendages past the limits into other objects. All of what this game is rounded out to quite a bit of fun and laughs for others who watched me play it.Graphics: This game looks like something out of a Unity game that was made during Game Jam, with some other elements that would be in a AAA game. Some spots looked bland and boring, while others looked unique and dynamic. Don't pass the graphics up as a bad thing though, since it doesn't detract from the experience itself.Sound: Constant slapping around and sloshing of Octodad's tentacles reacting with objects as well as the world itself made for some laughs as it does sound rather inappropriate in nature. Nothing sounded out of place however, though there were rare times when sound clips did repeat a few times in succession.Story: Octodad starts out with him marrying the love of his life. As it progressed, the game introduced mystery elements that were left either empty or unanswered at the end. Lots of plot holes and never ended story parts made the story felt unfinished, but it did have its charming moments. If the story did have more of the questions I had answered, then it would have felt like more of a complete story after the last cutscene ended and the credits started rolling.Multiplayer: Local co-op consists of giving the other player(s) control of either the legs or arms of Octodad, depending of what is chosen in the menu. Up to four players can play, having one person use either one arm or one leg. If I ever do get to try out the co-op, then I will update my review with my thoughts on this gameplay option.Overall, Octodad will most likely be in my Top 10 for 2014 due to the charming nature of the story plus the fun and addicting nature of fumbling around trying to control the character. Pick it up if you want several hours of fun and laughs, or a time waster.			"

												What an interesting little game. When I say ""little"" game, though, I do mean that. If you are relatively decent at the game, then you can probably beat it in 2 hours, or even less. The only thing that really extends the game time is collecting the Ties, which are hidden collectibles, and that becomes more annoying than fun in the later levels.Octodad is simply an extended mini-game. Technically, I've played it 3 times in order to collect all of the achievements. I actually was able to run through all of the levels on my 3rd playthrough in less than 40 minutes. Most of the levels in the game are short, though the first time playing the game will extend that time because of the amount of work that is needed to get used to the game's controls.Certainly, if you are someone to get mad over small things in video games, you might not find this game fun. The game is intentionally annoying and difficult with its controls. It will take you a while to get used to them, and even then, you're never really going to be perfect with them. Besides the controls themselves, the gameplay is nothing too special. Most of the ""puzzles"" are simply to run or climb somewhere, grabbing items along the way. Only a few places have unique puzzles, which are essentially the three sub-areas inside of the aquarium that you visit.But the game still holds onto its fun style of gameplay because it isn't too long. In fact, I think the shortness of the game is good. Otherwise, if the game was several hours of the same types of puzzles, it would lose its appeal.Besides the gameplay, the graphics are pretty colorful, and the humor of the game certainly is silly but funny. I enjoy Octodad's ""conversations"" and it is hilarious how people don't see him for what he is. In some senses, the hilarity of that is the entire game, but I also think there is validity to people's claims that there is a more serious undertone to the game. Octodad certainly feels out of place, as if his being an octopus is something that is ruining his life. And some people have brought up relevance to people with certain disorders or illnesses that alienate them in society, and it is definitely something similar in sadness. Whether the developers were thinking in an analagous manner or not, I don't know.I did not pay full price for Octodad, and I probably suggest not to, because it really annoys me when I buy games and finish them really quickly. There's nothing exactly groundbreaking about Octodad, but it is something fresh. At the same time, it is short-lived, and as I said, it would have lost its appeal if they made it much longer without adding something new.			"

												It's hard to explain exactly what this game is. You're a dad in a (mostly) normal American suburb, trying to live your life and help your family. Also you're an octopus, so that makes things a bit more complicated.I guess it's a third-person puzzle game? Maybe? But it's less figuring out what you need to do, and more figuring out how to use the abilities you have to do what you know you need to. It's difficult to explain. It requires the same sort of brain-rewriting and mechanics-unlearning that you went through when you started to get the hang of Surgeon Simulator.It's weird. It's funny. Most importantly, it's different. I really think anyone and everyone should try it out. It's worth it.			"

												This game, is probably the most realistic simulator I've seen in my life.Seriously, I got emotional because of realistic this was, I thought my life was in danger when they found out I was not an ordinary person, especially the part where the chef was being realistic with his butchering skills trying to cut me up I was frightened for my life, I had to have a two year break from this game, just so I could appreciate being alive in this current generation of amazing simulator games.Unfortunately I was quite annoyed at the part where I could not slaughter my children with a kitchen knife, as it would seem realistic if I could do so, but I suppose pushing the game to its limits, forcing it to be as realistic as possible is not exactly fair on the games part,200/10 ♥♥♥♥♥iest game ever what the ♥♥♥♥ why did I buy this piece of♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Here is the main just of this game:It is about a young man who joins the army in search for fame and glory and then BOOM he hits the fan and pretty much gets shot up and takin as a prisoner in war. His old war buddy Jonny soap is like ""yo"" and shoots the nazis in the face and then boom another shot goes off and hitler is bye bye. The young man comes back home as a grown man. He finds that the world around him is not what it seems, it changed very much very. So. This. Is. His. Story. He then tries to find his friend Soap but ends up only finding his left leg limb infront of hitlers house. So he then devotes his life to killing people with his left limb. later that day he found a bullet in the ground from digging for gold to pay his rent. he takes that bullet to the CIA department of bullet tracing technology and finds taht it was hitlers bullet all along. this means... hitler killed himself. So he finds out johnny is actually allive. this stuns him and makes him go in acoma. he wakes up in a zombie apocolypse alone. he makes his way out of the bloody horrifying hospital to only find that his wife and son went to atlanta to survive. he makes it there after meeting tyrone jamalkins and his son donavinn. he then sees soap.. his old partner in war and soap took his wife, clarise. so he then kills soap on a farm and the zombies like die. he then goes back to his life but doesnt make any more money. so then he sees that his brother-in-law busts meth dealers that make fat stacks of cheese (implying $$$). so then he becomes a meth cook and changes his name to heisenpus. from then he goes on meeting drug lords and like having a really good story and all. from there he then kills like a ton of people with a gun and is sent to the shadow deef. he then is there for 12 years and has to live off of pooping in a bucket and some soup. a priest helps him escape but dies in the process so it kinda sucks. once he makes it out he gets his revenge on everyone who betrays him. He then leads the scottish army against the british to save his humanity but then is almost dead. Now from here he then gets invited to join the 'Thield' and be part of the 'Bavengers'. He then falls down into a nuclear reacted tank of lemonade that turns him into an octopus. This is very tragic in his life. very.very.trangic. from then he becomes an octopus taking on his old name as a meth cook heisenpus. He seeks to remarry his old wife who thinks he is like long gone because he was really cool. this is where it leaves off and know you play an octopus who acts like a human to get his old life back.

												I've sunk to a whole new low. I bought Octodad, and am not completely dissapointed. Do I regret paying $5 for it? Of course, but I have to say, this game had some good things going for it. The main theme song was actually very funny. It was made to sound like a very cheap, very bad song, and I thought it fit very well into the game. Sadly, besides that song, the rest of the soundtrack was awful. Another really funny thing in the game was the opening credits. You got to destroy things, fall from the sky, and listen to the great theme song, obviously a great combination. Another pretty good thing about the game was the fact that its jokes usually made me laugh a bit. While that may sound really good, you need to know t hat none of the jokes were really funny, they were just pretty good. Still, the funny video game and youtuber easter eggs, along with a lot of the conversations you are a part of and overhear (your kids are the funniest) make for some good laughs. Speaking of conversations, the voice acting was better than expected. The kids sound like, well, kids, and what they say and do remind me of some I know. Also, your wife does a pretty good job of conveying emotions when she talks. One more thing that I think you could call good would have to be the story. There were a lot of plot holes, but I get the feeling some of them were there to enhance the silliness. Also, I must say, this game had a decent story, and that was WAY better than what I thought. Still, the chef (antagonist) had no real motive, he just starts being a jerk the first time you meet him. Also, there was a flashback that seemed like the present to me, and it took until the ending cutscene of that level for me to realize that it was in the past. If you are basing your purchase entirely from this review, so far it would probably look like a good buy, and that's because I haven't said the negatives. The game is VERY short, 5 hours in total, and although you can play community levels, it still seems like we aren't really getting enough meat on the bone. Last but not least, the gameplay was AWFUL! I know the controls were meant to be funny, but it got in the way a lot and caused me to die or get caught quite a few times. It turned a lot of fun parts into a grind, and kind of ruined the last half of the game in my opinion. Would I recommend this? I am honestly on the fence, because I think it is something worth experiencing, but it's something that you can get the full experience from by watching a let's play. Still, if you're like me and would never watch a full let's play, it might be worth getting on sale like I did. I think this series has potential to be a lot better, but for now, this is what we get. If I had to give it a score, I'd give it a 6/10. Pretty much a lot of fun and games ruined by terrible gameplay, and cut abruptly short.			"

												This game by far is what Indie games should be made of. A funny yet touching story, interesting characters (Even the minor ones), Unique gameplay, this game has it all. A bit short, but thats to be expected. Would love to see a episodic adventure to this.			"

												Reasons why you should get this game? 1.Gravity doesn't really apply to this game.                                                                2.Just ramdomness                                                                3.It's awesome.                                                                4.YOU CAN'T DIE!                                                                5.How the hell does a octo become a dad...

												What can I say about Octodad? Well, if anything, it is a little wacky. Okay, it's VERY wacky. But thats what makes the slapstick humor all the more enjoyable. Octodad has some pretty good moments, and a story that at least I'll never forget. The multiplayer is fun, with multiple players controlling his limbs at once, and the Steam community is brimming with user generated content, so that'll keep you coming back. I reccomend this game to anyone that likes a little humor, and enjoys a hearwarming story. I give this a 9/10			"

												In octodad, you're an octopus smashing in a wacky physics simulator, while trying to do something as hard as serving tea or buying stuff. Yeah, that's stupid. Yes you're the only octpus married to a whomen, and no one know it. Yeah you have kids and you'll nevever want to see how you get them. That's stupid and you'll definitively need a bad sense of humour to like this game, but if you have it, it's terribly fun.The best part of this game is the 2 players mode, that makes octodad the best drunken-party game ever. Each player controls random tentacles and they have to cooperate to do things. It never works, you'll want to kill your partner, and that's the purpose of this game. You'll probably never finish the 1st level but you'll laugh so much that you'll never care.And of course... controls are horrible!The should I buy algorithm.if(serious)then{don't buy it}if(not stupid) then {don't buy it}if(high)then{buy it, then ridde a unicorn}if(sober and have friends)then{buy it, have fun}if(sober and alone){buy it, smile, then be desperate, go out, meet friends, play octodad, goto previous line}			"

												If you wanna' be a dad, then this is Great for you. Counting that I'm Female but... nevermind. In this game, I think it's obvious what's happening, by the Title?.You are playing as an Octopus who is about to get married to a Human. What's funny, is that None of them notice that you are an Octopus? Ridicilous.You have 2 children, and a wife. You have to do chores, clean up, Play with children, make coffee (xD) ...It is very fun because you control the Octopus with your mouse and your keyboard [Duh] but it's different than any other game. Because you use your mouse to control one part of his body, and keyboard for another.Or either you can use joysticks, and also there is Co Op where you can play with a friend!I recommend this because I recommend this xDRate: 11/10			"

They played with xbox one controllers and were thrilled to start.One had one arm and one leg, the other child had the other arm and leg.They made it about 1/2 hour before the physical violence began.

												Some people might find this game too short for this price (normal run completed in 2 hours). But they fail to notice the steam workshop that this game has, For now it only contains few items. But after a while I'm sure people will bring HOURS of new and fun content to the game. Trying to find and collect all the different ties (without a walkthrough) will probably add another hour to the game.The game's worth shouldn't also be calculated by length, It has a nice story and some cool mechanics. Of course the controls are sometimes a pain to handle (but you're an octopus, that's what it's all about).			"

												A game where the humor comes from both the mechanics and storytelling. On the surface, this game may seem like a classic piece YouTuber bait, with it's quirky control scheme, unusual characters, abundance of physics items, and an unbelievable plot  to top it all off, but deeper down, this game tells the story of love, loss, and acceptance. It is the classic tale of the perfect suburban family with a deep dark secret.Is Octodad an octupus?Will Scarlet ever learn true inter-species love?How were the children concieved?This game, with its fun mechaincs and hilarious stories, strives to answer those questions and with them, attempts to reconcile for man's most primordial fear: calamari.

												I was inspired to buy this game, after watching TotalBiscuit and his wife play the game. When they played it, they had a blast and it was hilarious to watch.After buying the game myself and playing it with a friend as local co-op I have to say that I did not enjoy it. The gameworld and its humor are adorable and the concept of chaotic controls are very interesting, but in co-op it needs to persons who are able to roleplay and immerse themselves in the role of the Octodad. Without this the game is bland and the gameplay repetitive for menial tasks. Another huge disappointment for me was how the co-op was implemented.Without a controller no co-op is possible at all! Even if you have one available, like I did, the controls are unevenly distributed, with one player controlling three limbs with the controller and the other using the mouse to control only one single arm.This takes away the most fun of the control scheme, as there is no chaos ensuing between the two players.I am severely dissatisfied that this was not communicated.So unless you own a controller for each person who wants to play, who are all willing to immerse themselves in roleplay and you really don't care about the money you will spend on this game, I will say not recommended.

												Octodad: Dadliest CatchA Charming Game About a Normal Human Man.Developer: Young HorsesYear: 2014Genre: Indie, Comedy, AdventureFranchise: OctodadEngine: IrrlichtTL;DROctodad: DC is a thoroughly charming, well polished sequel to the thoroughly charming but far less polished 2010 student project Octodad. It retains the same goofy sense of humour and varied gameplay of the original but with a freshly revamped 50s art style and a more ambitious story. Play the original- available for free- before making the investment in this one. If you like that, you'll like this.REVIEWStory:When I first saw this game I thought that it would be more of the same Goat Sim/Amazing Frog/I am Bread♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  I avoided the purchase until I found it in an already inticing Humble Bundle. I booted it up to see if I could get a few chuckles out of it. What I found was a tight bundle of sharp writing, smart jokes and funny performances, with the ""lol so floppy"" humour serving as a anchor for some genuinely clever humour, rather than an obstacle to it. A particularly nice touch is the inclusion of two free DLC missions; one set in a hospital and one set in a restaurant. The former is delightfully narrated by Octodad's kids. The writing's no masterwork, but it's fun. A lot of it. 7.5/10Graphics:The janky,♥♥♥♥♥♥coloured visuals of the previous game are replaced with a slick, fluid colourful 50s soapbox style that give delightful motion to Octodad's suspiciously tentacle-like limbs. The environments feel authentic as you venture out of the house into the Everytown, USA town in which Octodad dwells. From the Edu-tainment utopia of the World of Kelp to the reference-packed Gervason's grocery store (Anyone for a rousing game of Sturgeon Simulator?) everywhere feels complete and fun to explore. 8/10Gameplay:You may have noticed my distaste for Surgeon Simulator and it's ilk. However, I am a huge fan of Octodad, Overcooked and even Who's Your Daddy. This is because the latter games know how to handle the funny dynamic of normal problems with weird solutions. Surgeon Simulator is a weird problem with a weird solution. No contrast, no humour. If I were to purchase juice or make soup in real life it would be easy. Seeing all the steps required for Octodad to do this sort of simple task is funny. Having to climb up a tower of soda to get juice is the normal mixed with the absurd, not just the absurd. This, in tandem with the smart writing elevates this game from the typical surrealist ""xD he is octopus"" fare that can be found for a dime a dozen on Steam. The gameplay is varied, challenging and, once again, fun. The only point where the game fell apart was at the end, where the normality was removed and replaced with a boss fight so generic and unsatisfying that it may as well be picked off of a store shelf. With that said, it's easy to do, so it's short. 8/10Overall:While this game may be short and a tad pricey, don't be fooled by it's outward appearance. Great visuals, funny writing and solid gameplay meld with a charming soundtrack to make a game that's certainly worth your time. 7.5/10Check out my profile for my review policy and thanks for reading.Til my next review!

												One of the first games I got on my steam account, and definitely one of the great ones. This is another one of the gimick-based indie games that were popular around that time and still are, except this one really does something that makes it feel very unique. Something I seemed to notice with gimmick-y games are that they're pretty much revolved around a couple of achievements and experiencing all the fun, wacky zany gameplay it has to offer; now, this game does have that, but it's so refined and well done it's consistently interesting the whole game. It has a silly but somewhat emotional storyline that really is a lot of fun to play, and is consistantly interesting. Along with that 5 hour story, you have about 30 achievements that make this game even more fun and replayable, and gives the game a good exit.Verdict: A really good game, going beyond gimmicks and actually making a fun story. There's not reason not to get it, so why not do it?			"

												The premise is what makes the game stick out most: you play as an octopus who is disguised as your stereotypical suburban dad. Remaining unsuspected is the point of the whole game, but of course that goal is complicated by the control scheme. In some ways it is reminiscent of Surgeon Simulator 2013, but with more ragdoll physics. When you are controlling one of Octodad's limbs you really only have control over the tip of that limb; the rest of the limb and the rest of his body will flop around wherever they feel like. The only exception is that his feet remain planted most of the time.Much of the game involves Octodad attempting to carry out everyday tasks, such as making breakfast, mowing the lawn, and shopping for groceries. There is a ""suspicion meter"" that goes up when people witness you do particularly clumsy things. It is extremely difficult to lose this way though, which makes the game even more absurd.The larger threat is a sushi chef who appears to be the only person around who realises that Octodad is not what he pretends to be. He appears from time to time to try to expose or kill Octodad. When you consider that every other character is white and the chef is a pretty terrible caricature of a Japanese chef, the game seems incredibly racist.Polygon had an interesting article[www.polygon.com] about how Octodad can be considered a metaphor for those of us who live our lives concealing something from even those who are closest to us. Most people wouldn't think of this though, especially kids like my sister who would just be delighted by the slapstick comedy.There were some extremely frustrating segments, such as going up some down escalators and running away from the chef while trying to perform other tasks. If you are easily frustrated, I wouldn't recommend Octodad.The game was short, coming in at about two hours for my first playthrough. The only reason I can think of to replay it would be to try the coop mode, where up to four people control his various limbs. They also wisely included support for user-created maps. I've pretty much had my fill of the game though, so I probably won't try many of those.My recommendation would be that you go and play the original student project[www.octodadgame.com] and if you really want more Octodad then you can go and get Dadliest Catch. I still wouldn't pay more than $10 on it though.			"

												Great co-op game! It takes maybe a minute or so for all players to get an idea of the controls, but a drunken slugfest of arguing over direction, grabbing items we don't need, and generally flailing about the place, is always fun for any game night. I recommend playing with Roulette Mode on, so no one is too stuck into one role.(Co-op requires a controller for each extra player)			"

												I'm not quite sure how to review this so:Pros:* The humor is quite well done (IMHO).* The concept is certainly unique* It can, at times, even be fun.Cons:* The game is basically a one-trick pony: try to control Octodad and fail repeatedly.So far, I have gotten to the aquarium and have spent way more time than I'd like to admit trying to maneuver Octodad up 2 sets of wrong-way escalators. It was amusing for about 5 minutes, then anger and frustration set in. 30 minutes later, I was finally past this, where I promptly quit the game.If you can handle a game whose main conceit is intentially making you rage with crap controls, and you like the style of humor they provide, then sure: recommended.To be honest though, I can't recommend this in general - it's too much of a one trick pony for my taste. Buy it for $5 and you'll probably get your money's worth - any more might feel like too much. "

												The gameplay is fun. It's basically what if ""Surgeon Simulator 2013"" were an actual game where its utterly broken mechanics were featured in a way that makes sense in universe - you being an octopus and all. Of course the controls are the reason why you're here so complaining that they suck is missing the point. This does however not take away from the fact that certain sections are just needlessly annoying to traverse. And I really have to say that 2 hours for $15 is just too short. I get that this joke would've become old quite quickly, so instead of demanding more I demand a price reduction. I'm not even sure the $5 I spent during the last summer sale were justified for those 2 hours, but I would've felt ripped off at three times that.If you can find it on sale it's definitely worth checking out, insofar as you haven't watched any of the oh so funny youtube personalities play it for the lulz. If you have, don't bother, the humor is spoiled for you. You may find enjoyment out of the controls but honestly I'm not sure I can recommend it, it's just a bit too unsubstantial.			"

												This is one of the few times I'm happy a game was super short. Took me two hours to beat the game and at one point I went to make and eat lunch for about fifteen minutes. The controls are the most frustrating thing ever created, I understand this is the gimmick of the game but it's completely uncontrolable. The last mission was terrible, constantly falling into fire because the beam has no foot room, only to be brought back to the other side of the room. The final fight was terrible as well, the fish balloons that you need to use are half the time impossible to pick up. The character would pick up any object but the balloon, just because of this it took me fifteen tries too many.The game is cute and the music is good but it falls flat almost everywhere else. Not worth a fifteen dollar price tag, nor the summer sale price I got it for.			"

												I really, really want to like this game, but for a few reasons I cannot.As many others have said, the game is simply too short. Granted I screwed around a lot in it and managed to squeeze out out 4 hours, it just doesn't justify me spending 12 EUR on it. 5 EUr perhaps I could understand.Over the past week, I have seen many updates for the game. However, I fell over many bugs. Such as legs not moving when you click whatever button you're supposed to click and drag - leg was stuck on the ground without anything blocking it.And that was just one of the bugs.Makes you wonder what state the game was in when first released, and with that many updates why it still got so many bugs. Makes the company look really unprofessional - again, doesn't justify me spending THAT much money on it.I wish I could recommend this game to people, but I simply can't.			"

I expected so much more from this game storywise, there are only 6 levels and would only take up to half an hour to finish each one if you're good at them. I'm fine with the game itself but my main concern is the price $15!!! There are a lot of games that are too short and cost $15. If the game was $5-$7 I would be okay with this but it's not.So basically my final verdict is: I would recommend getting the game, but I wouldn't recommend getting it with a price like that!			"

												Octodad... it's very debatable, let's say that. In my honest-to-God opinion that I am very entitled to for having played it even this much, I will tell you that it is quite... different. Pros: Very unique and never-before-seen concept with a charming though short plot with lots of laughs and goofy gameplay. Cons: Awful controls, lack of inspiration and devotion in the workshop, difficult to play, not enjoyable in general due to the extremely repetitive nature of the game and lack of much additional content and very little likelihood to replay after the first playthrough, assuming you just don't uninstall the game. It's frustrating and funny, but overall this is actually the only game I can ever recall buying and not liking, and I do not have a high standard for games in any way shape or form. Buy it at your own discretion.			"

												Fun but quickly gets tedious in certain levels, also way too short. I bought this in the sale so not too disappointed but I would never pay full price for this, it was over so quickly. It's a novelty when you begin playing but that about sums it up - a novelty. Was kind of expecting more from it. Never mind.			"

												I played a few levels before I gave up on the frustrating controls and mechanics of moving around. You're an octopus, and the challenge is to move around using your tentacles, while pretending to be a normal human dad. It's fun for about 10 minutes, and then it's like, you got the joke, and it was funny at first, but now you just wish they would move on from the joke.			"

												Octodad: Dadliest Catch is a wonderful game in my opinion for a handful of reasons and I will cover all of them in this review Storyline length and quality: a common complaint is that the story is short, while i agree with this I also don't really mind the game takes about 2 hours to run through if you don't waste time and run through the game but if you take your time to do what you feel like doing and explore every bit of floppy chaos in a level the game's play time can go up to at least 5 hours. The story itself feels like a movie or a book it's really just wonderful and sort of unique but extremely cliche at the same time without spoiling anything here's the jist of it: you play as octodad an octopus whose family and the rest of humankind (except for a single sushi chef) thinks he's a man just carrying out his daily life.Gameplay/Controls:The gameplay is great and by that i mean the physics are generally pretty good i haven't had anything get stuck in a wall or under a table or whatever. the controls on the other hand are different at first they are kind of hard but after some practice you'll be jiggling around like a pro. it really only took me about 10 minutes to get the controls down but after that it was smooth sailing.Maps:The maps are great they have plenty of props to play with but also AREN'T overflowing with props because that would make it hard to move. most maps have secret areas where you can collect ties which i will get to later.Collectibles:the one thing that annoys me the MOST in games is upgradable skill systems that you need to use to beat the game, octodad on the other hand doesn't have one which makes me VERY happy you can play through without having to spend EXP to get new skills because there are no skill points in-game anyway. the only collectible is ties which are just new ties to wear and look cool.graphics:I have a toaster and can run this at 100 FPS. 'nuff said.Workshop support/Replay value:IMMENSE REPLAY VALUE the game has SO MUCH to do in every level that you really need to replay it at least twice to get all the content in. not to mention this game has workshop support and my overall experience with it: walked into a supermarket naked and stole cereal from a lady.          10/10 for workshop.OVERALL GRADE: 9.5/10 reason for not a perfect 10: workshop has skins for octodad but they have to be installed manually but it's not a big deal.

												Octodad: Dadliest Catch is a wonderful game in my opinion for a handful of reasons and I will cover all of them in this review Storyline length and quality: a common complaint is that the story is short, while i agree with this I also don't really mind the game takes about 2 hours to run through if you don't waste time and run through the game but if you take your time to do what you feel like doing and explore every bit of floppy chaos in a level the game's play time can go up to at least 5 hours. The story itself feels like a movie or a book it's really just wonderful and sort of unique but extremely cliche at the same time without spoiling anything here's the jist of it: you play as octodad an octopus whose family and the rest of humankind (except for a single sushi chef) thinks he's a man just carrying out his daily life.Gameplay/Controls:The gameplay is great and by that i mean the physics are generally pretty good i haven't had anything get stuck in a wall or under a table or whatever. the controls on the other hand are different at first they are kind of hard but after some practice you'll be jiggling around like a pro. it really only took me about 10 minutes to get the controls down but after that it was smooth sailing.Maps:The maps are great they have plenty of props to play with but also AREN'T overflowing with props because that would make it hard to move. most maps have secret areas where you can collect ties which i will get to later.Collectibles:the one thing that annoys me the MOST in games is upgradable skill systems that you need to use to beat the game, octodad on the other hand doesn't have one which makes me VERY happy you can play through without having to spend EXP to get new skills because there are no skill points in-game anyway. the only collectible is ties which are just new ties to wear and look cool.graphics:I have a toaster and can run this at 100 FPS. 'nuff said.Workshop support/Replay value:IMMENSE REPLAY VALUE the game has SO MUCH to do in every level that you really need to replay it at least twice to get all the content in. not to mention this game has workshop support and my overall experience with it: walked into a supermarket naked and stole cereal from a lady.          10/10 for workshop.OVERALL GRADE: 9.5/10 reason for not a perfect 10: workshop has skins for octodad but they have to be installed manually but it's not a big deal.

												Definitely a unique experience.  The game is a bit on the short side, but that is not always a bad thing.  The controls are unlike anything else you will find on here.  The story is a heart warming tale.  There were plenty of moments that had me laughing, which does not happen too often.  If you are  looking for something fun, different, and satisfying, this game is for you.  If a games length is directly purportionate to how much you think it should cost I would say wait or just pass on this one.			"

												I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this game, good lord. It's so cute and funny and has a lot of love to it, it's just everything a video game should be. My only complaints are some of the dumb memes in the supermarket level and that the final section felt a little janky and badly designed to me. It's also a pretty short game, which might turn you off, but it's a perfect length in my eyes--it doesn't overstay its welcome and does just about everything it could with its gameplay. It lasts just lost enough to be satisfying.Basically Octodad made me really happy. I'm amazed at how this comedy octopus man is a better dad than most real dads I know.			"

												If you're looking for a totally unique game experience, look no further than Octodad: Dadliest Catch. The game mostly resolves around trying to complete everyday tasks, but with a twist - you're an octopus pretending to be a human dad! There are many hilarious and frustrating in-game moments, hell, even walking can be a chore at times. All in all, this is definitely a game worth playing if you're looking for something new.			"

												Octodad is a one of a kind.  It is witty, charming, funny, and most importanly unique.  Although controls can be difficult at times, that is kind of the point.  It is not suppose to be easy to handle.  Your objective is to act like a human while having tentacles as legs and arms, thus making it difficult to navigate.  After about thirty minutes or so, you should have a grasp of your character and will be able to handle the more difficult objectives.       Young Horses does a great job at making everyday situations into a comedy.  If you are looking for something new, check this game out.			"

												""Octodad, nobody suspects a thing"" sums things up pretty well. This game is very short (about an hour long) so you should probably wait for the price to go down to around $7.49. Other than that this game was loads of fun. It puts you in different areas with different tasks to complete with the Aquarium being the largest. It has lots of activities to do and almost all of them are challenging. The ending of the game is funny and the rest of the game is very enjoyable. 8/10			"

												Octodad is silly, fun, and annoying at the same time. The controls are wacky, but it adds to the enjoyment of going around as an octopus. However, when the game gets more challenging later on, the controls start to get annoying, especially in the boss battle. If you can master the controls (unlikely), this game is going to be short for you. However, the real gems here are the costum courses in the Steam Workshop. That feature is the games redeeming factor. There's enjoyment to be found here, but for the main price of $15, you're probably better off waiting for this to go on sale.			"

												Octodad: Dadliest Catch is a fun game, there isn't much to be said about it that hasn't been said already.  This game is advertized as single player, but it's the co-op that makes the game, alone it just isn't as fun, I would reccomend this game to anyone who has a friend they hang out with a lot, you can finnish this game in an evening, making it a fun speedrunning game alone, but still co-op is, in my opinion, the best way to play this game.

												This game is probably the funniest one I have played. The fact that you have tentacles for hands and the trouble that causes is probably why it is so fun. It can be hard to master at first but once you get the hang of it, this game is really fun. I give this game an 8/10, would rate higher only if it was longer.			"

												Awesome game. Buy it while it's on sale. Even though it's somewhat short. It's fun to play, and after you beat it you can go back and find all the ties. It gets frustrating at times but it would be way to easy without those parts; they make the game a challenge. Buy it now, you won't regret it (unless you hate everything).			"

												The gameplay is great if you're into messing around with physics, it's got a nice story with good family-friendly humor, and it's got Steam workshop support if you really like mods.But it's not worth $15. It took me only two hours to finish the game's story and the entirety of extra official content. There's so little to actually play that I could actually still get a refund on the game, and I've completed it.			"

												This game. This game is extremely fun and is one of the funniest games i have played! i would highly recomend it. (only if its on sale it is worth 15 bucks if you have monny to spare but if you can pick it up for 8 go ahead jump on that deal) the only problem is the games is very short you can beat it in an afternoon. if you play an hour a night it might last you 3-4 days but chances are your going to love it so much you'll end up playing it till 2am. the game is coming out with a free dlc that contains 2 new areas with multiple puzzles wich will add a couple hours to the game. their is 3 neck ties on every level you can collect to add extra life to the game. if you enjoyed this game id really reccomend battle block theater really funny to esspecially if you and a few buds team up. Thanks for reading if you did and feel free to message me if you beat the game to trade cards. :)			"

												Octodad: Dadliest Catch is a fun game, there isn't much to be said about it that hasn't been said already.  This game is advertized as single player, but it's the co-op that makes the game, alone it just isn't as fun, I would reccomend this game to anyone who has a friend they hang out with a lot, you can finnish this game in an evening, making it a fun speedrunning game alone, but still co-op is, in my opinion, the best way to play this game.

												Octodad manages to turn what would seem like infuriating, clumsy control mechanics into a remarkably hilarious game with its dialog, aesthetic and silly premise.Trying to execute the simplest tasks often results in a calamity of fail that you can't help but laugh your way through. Unlike other games with purposefully difficult controls, this game pulls it off without the player feeling completely frustrated by turning the gimmick into half the fun.The animations are fluid and the overall design gels well with the story and characters to create the vibrant world Octodad struggles with so hard each day.Definitely worth the buy. Support creative games like these so we'll see more of them :)			"

												This game is freaking amazing and is super fun. Had to get used to the controls but after the ending I got used to the controls and was able to put that to the test with playing the workshop levels. What I mean by this is that the game is too short. I only spent 4 hours going as slow as I possibly could around the levels and it was still too short. Besides the workshop that has a lack of levels at this moment in time and will have me very busy when more levels come out, there needs to be more stuff coming from the developers for the story or maybe something new entirely other than the story. I still think it was worth the $12 but being that the game is so short, I am starting to think otherwise.			"

												Its a fun little experience with some pretty funny humour and some hilarious situations you can get octodad into.  While the game is only about 3 hours long, there are ties to collect which adds some replayability and there are also people creating levels in the steam worskshop and some of them are pretty cool.  It may not be the greatest or funniest game on steam, but I still think that its worth your attention and money, especially if you like to laugh.  And if you don't get frustrated too easily or you are going to pay alot more money than this game costs.			"

												Octodad manages to turn what would seem like infuriating, clumsy control mechanics into a remarkably hilarious game with its dialog, aesthetic and silly premise.Trying to execute the simplest tasks often results in a calamity of fail that you can't help but laugh your way through. Unlike other games with purposefully difficult controls, this game pulls it off without the player feeling completely frustrated by turning the gimmick into half the fun.The animations are fluid and the overall design gels well with the story and characters to create the vibrant world Octodad struggles with so hard each day.Definitely worth the buy. Support creative games like these so we'll see more of them :)			"

												So much fun!  I had a blast playing this one and it's even more fun to watch when you're not struggling with the controls.You will struggle with the controls, especially with a controller -- which is the only way to play it.  It's a marvelous challenge, and unbelievably satisfying once you get him to do what you want, in some semblance of the way you intend.  The side-effects of the controls is an incredibly silly experience.  You will spill things, flip tables, and bonk unsuspectings. I recommend this game to everyone and anyone who wants something different.			"

The mechanics of the games character are awesome, I just wish they would have done more with it. By the time you start to enjoy the game it's over and there isn't much replay value to be had. The levels and puzzles are really simple and require next to no thought.Don't get me wrong I love the game, but I can't recommend it at the current price. For a game that can be completed in less than an hour, $15 is a little steep. The least they could have done to make it worth while is package the original Octodad project with it, or add in those levels in with the new character mechanics.			"

WTF! People who say it's part of the charm are crazy, the game is purposely holding you back, which isn't why I bought it, I liked the struggling movements of the console version, but this? No, just no. It's a rip off, if you get it for a quid, fine, but anything above that? Nah, save it. 1/6 (haha, get it? Octodad's only got 6 tentacles, I think)			"

The controls are intentionally awful, and while it's funny to watch at first, the joke gets old after the first couple of minutes.

												Pros: The wonky controls are back from the original. The story and characters are funny enough. Steam Workshop support.Cons: The game is far too short, the story can be completed in 2 hours. Introduces some annoying mechanics like stealth and segments where you have to run for your dear life. Octodad's limbs can get stuck sometimes by clipping into objects.Honestly, 2 hours for $15 is a bit too much to ask. I feel like the  devs could have made a much bigger game, but then ran out of ideas midway and cut things short. The modders could potentially revitalize the game if there's enough interest. This game had so much potential but fell short.			"

												All in all Octodad is a pretty fun game, although I wouldn't really recommend it. The gameplay is fun and refreshing at first, but quickly becomes repetitive and daunting. If your like me and watched YouTuber's or other gamers play this before its final release, you'll be dissapointed, because the game isn't as fun to play as it is to watch.

												One of the most-fun games I've ever played. Why did I thumbs down? Short. WAAAAAY to short. I spent 3 hours on this game before beating it, and I sucked at it, as it takes most people 1.5 hours or so to beat it. *sighs* You brilliant developers need to give us a free dlc for atleast 4 more hours I'd think (or more, please more, this is an amazing game). It's fun to watch Octodad flail around and fail, but it CAN get old for some people quiet quickly. I haven't played Co-op mode much, and I wish not to because I failed terribly at the original game, and co-op is about 300x harder. I think this game would be good for a 5-10 dollar game but 15 dollars is abit much. I also think the game has abit more potentail because of workshop, but it seems the developers got lazy and just begged you to accept the player-made parts of the game. Really great game guys... just make it longer. Please			"

												Pros: It's charming as all get-out, the controls work pretty well, and it's well optimized and unified in its design and compatibility.Cons: It's an hour and a half long, and the last couple levels are a bunch of forced instant-fail stealth and action sequences that demand a somewhat unreasonable level of precision from a game deliberately designed around wonky controls and physics.I liked it overall, it's hard not to. It's just kind of short and flawed.			"

												If you are into absurd humor this is your game.  It is quite delightful and places you as a regular suburban dad doing regular things only you are secretly an Octopus.  Just be prepared going into it that many of the things that give it charm and comedic value can also cause frustration.  Controls are intentionally awkward because you are an Octopus trying to be human.  You will not be able to navigate yourself in a dignified way and you will knock over just about everything in your way.   This wouldn't be such a big deal if this were an adventure game but the controls are so non-intuitive and strange the traditional ""gamier"" parts of it can easily become frustrating.  It is short but its just the right length to not get overly tired with the mechanics.  It's a few hour experience not an epic open world rpg and I was glad it was over when I saw the credits roll.

												This game is really, really good, but it isn't for everyone. The first thing to address here is the movement and controls. It's awkward, but calling it 'deliberately bad' is IMO not really true. It's responsive and precise, but the difficulty comes from the fact that you are an invertebrate rather than that the controls suck. The plot is nothing special, though it did carry more emotional weight than I thought it would. Graphics and voice acting is nothing special, but where the game really shines is it's sense of humour. Most of the reference based jokes are delivered via background objects so as not to confuse people who don't get them, and the chatter from passersby is something I genuinely want to listen to, as it always brings out a smile on my face. However, the gameplay is where this thing really shines. While it doesn't have that much replay value (the game's around 5 hours long assuming you don't rush through all the levels), there are decently hidden secrets to find and loads of little trinkets to grab and mess around with in your environment or just extra stuff to do, though there could potentially be more. Still, this game is just about having stupid fun and messing around, as the gameplay perfectly demonstrates. It composes of you doing ordinary mundane things at the start extremely awkwardly, and ends with you doing out of the ordinary things in ways you couldn't imagine. If you have low amounts of patience or are short on cash and therefore want a timesink, this isn't your game, but this is a nice diversion of a game. It also has Workshop support and a decent supply of nice quality user created levels (as well as some stuff done by the devs demonstrating what can be done in the engine). If you have your doubts you can always download the original Octodad for free and see if the control scheme agrees with you, and honestly, you probably know already if this is a game that you're going to enjoy.In conclusion, this is a game that is designed for people who just like doing stupid things in a game and laughing at it. It doesn't just rely on it's physics engine or controls as some reviews might imply, as it also has an fantastic sense of humour, good music and just an all-round good feel to it. Like I said, you should know if you will enjoy this or hate it. Also, they changed the stealth segments significantly and they now barely involve stealth at all, so you needn't worry about that. And if that isn't enough for you, the devs are planning to port the game to the PS4 with new levels and features and then update the PC version with said bonus goodies! My advice is get your tentacles on this game as soon as possible!			"

												Whos that man with the 3p suit? Pretty much every buisiness man. Never mind that. Whos that man with the 8 strong legs? *facepalm*. Every octopus does, anyway, the point, where is it? Octodad Dadliest Catch is a game where you flop around as the  main hero, Octodad. He struggles to have a perfectly normal life as he can barely walk without anyone knowing hes not human. But its a fun game so get it.Also, ITS HILARIOUS			"

												Really wanted to like this game. Lots of charm but unfortunately it does not live up to it's whimsey. There's a good 45 minutes of fun to be had (of nearly hour and a half play time.)The game concentrates a bit too much on ""being a game"" when the real fun is the mayham caused by its control scheme. However, the game never realizes this and instead forces you into frusterating stealth missions and platforming that is more irrtating than enjoyable. The most fun is trying to perform daily 'dad tasks' with the control scheme but that parts end way to early.The humor is also more miss than hit.			"

												Don't get me wrong this game has potential, but it needs to be fixed. This game lags, and it gets boring, it is just a test to see how long you can put up with the controls and the annoying objectives you have. There was an update just to fix the bugs right when it was released, which is pathetic, because I had to wait until the update was released just to get past the second level. I was looking forward to this game not knowing that it would be this bad. I put everything on the lowest setting, and it still lagged (keep in mind i have a great computer that doesn't lag at all, and also i don't have a bunch of games that would slow down my computer). I do not reccomend this game until it is fixed!			"

												Octodad Dadliest Catch is an odd game: Octodad is about an octopus desperately trying to keep it together while he galumphs out the American Dream and be the best father that he can be. Every attempt to accomplish his role within the nuclear family drips with slapstick, pathos and even an unbearably affecting bravery in spots which smartly breaks up the comedy. In game terms, it’s little more than a tech demo fully realized. But on those same terms it’s a game which is feel-good throughout. The game’s controls has you controlling six cephalopod limbs of Octodad’s to walk and fill our your suit while the other two are used to interact with objects in the environment. As you seek to make yourself seem normal to your family and the outside world you do so typically by failing in comically abnormal ways. That’s the beauty of the game, even when you fail it’s more often than not more hilarious than when you succeed. The game also performs well as a cooperative game with children and adults alike. My niece particularly loved every moment she had with the game, and you can tell with how the game was structured that children were an aim more of the developers than most independent games currently on the market.That said the back third of the game is inconsistent with the gameplay of the rest of the game. While true, I much prefer the switch in difficulty and objectives. Through it’s rise in difficulty and reliance on mechanics, these previously trifle aspects of the game were now poignant to the story. The game gives you a reason to have skin in the game, which makes the inevitable compassionate ending that much more meaningful. I never stopped smiling throughout the four hours I played this game. I'll conclude by saying enjoy this game level by level, since there are definite pleasures along the way.			"

												Short 3-Hour game, you're an octopus with a family, everyone thinks you're human because of the suit you wear - game has some funnies in it, but I didn't find it hilarious as some claim it to be. Controls are a bit more better than QWERTY's, but still a bit difficult to maintain. **SPOILER** In the end, for some reason, no one knew you were an octopus except for your daughter and the chef - there was no explaination to that at all. What seemed to be a super happy family, with a super happy wife - when she becomes upset with you for not ever having an adult-adult conversation, it just seems out of place.Out of all the games I didn't pirate before I bought - I wish I had done that for this one. Honestly, I think the game was just hyped up by the indie gaming community. I want my money back!			"

												I beat this game in less than 2 hours. Done. Over. Finshed. $16CAN!? No, thanks.This game is really fun, but it's like a book. You buy it and finish it. Done. Over. You can read it over again, but usually it's not that much fun or worth your while after the first time. You get to plop around as an octopus and do everyday things, which is nice. My only problem is a big one: you pay so much money for 2-4 hours of gameplay that gets old once you beat this game. Only buy it on a ~75% off sale.			"

												Slapstick funny for the first half hour, then a bit tedious as the story kind of dissolves and ends WAY too quickly.  It's too expensive for a game that can be beaten in about an hour and a half.  You can go back and mess around collecting achievements if you want to, but at that point the shine was off the wonky controls and things got tedious.  If you dislike challenging game controls, definitely pass this up.			"

												**EDIT**Ok all the stuff below is what I wrote about halfway thro the game. I'm now at the end level. And here's the edit. The controls kill the game! The last level is a STUPIDLY long chase on a small narrow path with DEATH behind you and to the sides. Add a TIMER and crappy controls, I've been at it for almost an hour! And I die within 2 minutes of restart. Do youself a favor, just go to youtube. ~~~~~~~~~~~~Old stuffIt's cute and all, but I really cannot recommend it. The humor and graphics are ok, but the bullcrap controls had me ripping my hair out. I once got stuck for 20-30 minutes just trying to untangle myself from a mess of plugs you use in a puzzle. If I hadn't spent money on this, I wouldn't finish it. You're better off just going on youtube and looking up a walkthrough to save youself the frustration.			"

												The game was generally ok, but I was extremely disappointed when I never saw an octopus the entire game. You play as a generic american father with an insane canniballistic cook after you, but with a title like Octodad, I expected some sort of epic battle between an octopus and your character. Needless to say, the aforementioned octopus never shows up through the entire game.			"

												The controls are very loose and clunky, eliminating most of the fun I thought I was having  early on. It's a frustrating game that, with better controls, could have been a big success.

												First, I laughed like crazy because the game was so ridiculous. Then, after playing for a while, I got really sad, because I drew an analogy with feelings of inadequacy, not fitting, being awkward at everything you doing, and even depression. And everyone around you thinks that everything is fine with you, you just not trying hard enough, or being silly. No understanding or compassion whatsoever. I thought ""wow, the game is deep"". But then, after spending some precious time in the aquarium, I got mad at the game, because hey, they a bit overdid this ""life is hard"" thing. Was I, as a player, supposed to start hating the game and every single stupid character in it?.. Well, anyway, I did.			"

It even has QWOP references, yes I hated QWOP.--Yes it's like surgeon sim and I'am bread etc.. except for the nice octopus it just wasnt fun as I thought it would be, It almost made me throw the mouse away.

												This game reminds me of The Last of Us.Great story full of pathos.Great atmosphere that pulls you in.TERRIBLE gameplay.This game's controls are ""meant"" to be terrible.  It is all about controlling an object in 3D space with only a 2D control method.It is all a joke.  A joke that lasts 2 the hour runtime of the game.  Of course, the game maybe only has about an hour to an hour and a half of actual gamplay, but you will be constantly having to repeat sections due to the poor controls so that gets inflated slightly.Workshop support is fine and dandy, but the ONLY pull of this game is the charming story and characters.  Sure there is the joke of the controls, but that novelty ends right around the time you get to your Kitchen in the first level.  The reason you stick through the game past the first 10 minutes is because you actually end up feeling for the protagonist and his family.  There is no such story in the workshop missions so it is doubtful they will have the same impact as the rest of the game.This game is a definite pass at $15A ""maybe"" purchase at $10 because you basically get a nice, quirky, feature-length, semi-playable movie.Go for it at any price lower than $5Then again, what do you care what I have to say?  I know for a fact that you are just looking for games to pad out your backlog and this game will do just fine sitting unplayed in your Steam library.I would strongly suggest for Young Horses to fire their programers and move into making animated shorts full time.   Storytelling is what they are good at, making games is something they are not built for.			"

												I bought this game thinking it would be fun. Don't get me wrong - it was! For around 40 minutes. That's the problem. The gimmick grow tiresome just as the game starts introducing stealth and precision levels which with the controls that you are given are pure trial and error. Furthermore, it's all over in a pinch, with no replay value whatsoever (you can collect Octodad's ties in each level). For £10 I excpected a bit more. Do not recommend.			"

												The concept of this game is just amazing, funny and touching. However, as the game progresses from funny and easygoing to precise and stealthy, frustration comes rocking in. I'm not regretting the purchase, because the gaming community needs more titles like this, but if you're stripped on cash keep it in mind: you're going to have more fun watching a Let's Play.			"

			Octodad REVIEW!! http://youtu.be/GdpYBzVv8QA Part 1 of my lets play for Octodad! http://youtu.be/Wm4vMWhC95Q Like us on Facebook! its the number one way to contact me!		

GameplayBasically is an adventure game with its grossly stupidity to pick a tool, to jump. to pick up thing feels more complicated than everything. the game itself is so dumb, easily the dumbest game i've ever played in years, dumbest than Surgery Simulator.reminds me with ""how to laugh"".Why is Octodad: Dadliest Catch one of the very humoristic games?Ok, it shows weather you're stupid or smart but mainly shows you as a stupid person, like what it did to me! I was trying to pick something CAN'T CAN'T, after 10 mins, I picked it up. It will 100% happen to everyone even the smartest person in the world. Is the controlers so annoying in Octodad: Dadliest Catch or not?Super annoying, I'll say it's the most annoying thing I've seen in a game! Do you love to be in an angry situation? so Octodad is the appropriate game.The VerdictOctodad is a poor experince of gameplay, but a perfect experience of humors. All I can say it's almost nothing.Story: 6/10 (Doesn't has that big story)Gameplay: 3/10Graphics: 6.5/10Sounds: 7/10Music: 8/10+ PositivesMore than comedy+Reminds+great environment- NegativesLack of buttons-Annoying controllersAlthough, not bad but lack of things doesn't push it up.6/10 Still Considered Good

												If you like the original, or think this one looks good, I'd recommend torrenting it. The main game was super fun, and then all of a sudden it went way downhill. The stealth parts sucked, but were fine and doable and everthing. But where the game utterly fails is the final chase sequence. In a game that rejoices in its own terrible controls, having a timed accuracy section was completely unreasonable. The final chase of this game is more inappropriate than the forced boss fights in Deus Ex: Human Revolution. The story was awesome though, and I definitely recommend trying it, but I don't recommend spending money on it. Let's just say I had less than thirty ""deaths"" before the final sequence, and I ended at an even 330 after it. And I've played the original all the way through, including the challenge stuff, so I don't think I'm that bad at these controls.			"

												This is my favorite game. Octodad is absolutely wonderful. I thought I would just do a playthrough and be done with it, but not really. I ended up trying to get tons of achievements and ties. Octodad will constantly make you want to do better, go faster, and try things. It's funny, it's hard, it's just really a delight to play. Definitely worth the 15 dollars.			"

Also I got stuck on the  mini game room as I won all the prizes yet I couldnt complete the goal cause the danm wife wouldn't drop the prize she was holding.I didn't like this game and will be getting a refund but you might enjoy its comady (Thats one good thing about it)			"
