												Shadow Warrior took me by surprise and completely blew me away.Excellent visuals, amazing & visceral combat.The sword play is the real strong suit in this title, it's probably the best melee has ever been in first person and it's incredibly satisfying to chop enemies into pieces. The guns tend to be left forgotten because of this, but the rest of the arsenal does hold it's own.The story and voice acting is surprisingly good, with large amounts of crude humor. There's also a good tale to be told and they did a good job combining the laughs with the more serious tones.It combines new and old in a great fashion.With skillpoints, weapon upgrades and powers gained by progression yet maintaining the arcade style combat and leveldesign.There are a couple of bossfights, which are pretty middle of the road. The bosses look amazing but they tend to overstay their welcome and the battles drag out for too long. This is especially true on the higher difficulties.It's a great reimagining of a classic title and I wholeheartedly recommend picking this up if you enjoy the faster First person shooter titles of the days of old.Flying Wild Hog has done an excellent job with this one.Shadow Warrior has proven to truly belong alongside the greats of the genre.

You play as Lo Wang - A katana wielding, one-liner cracking, demon decimator.Killing is your business and cousin, business is a-boomin'.The gameplay is simply brilliant. Slicing demons never gets old. It's probably the best melee first-person game out there (suck it Skyrim).But katana isn't your only weapon. You find new weapons as you progress in the game and there is no two gun limit like in most nowadays shooters. No ""primary"" or ""secondary"" weapons like in CoD or BF. - Double the gun, double the fun!You can carry ALL the weapons with you and you can upgrade them at any time. Yes, upgrading weapons is a thing and we're not talking about dumb camos or silencers.We are talking about upgrades that make you an unstoppable killing machine! - I like big guns, and i cannot lie.""This is my katana, this is my gun. One for killing, the other's for... OK the other's also for killing.""There are lots of references to other video games and movies and TONS of secrets for you to discover so check every corner and leave no stone unturned 'cus there's always something to find.It's just plain and simple, none stop mayhem, one-liner packed, demon slaying old-school fun.Just go in there and get Wanged! - Guns don't kill demons, Wang kills demons.One of the best games of 2013!The game is Wangerful!So go ahead, make my day...and buy this game!

												Damn, I didn't expect such a lenghty game. Shadow Warrior is a brilliant and (literally) funny reboot (let's just call if that) of the 1997 game of the same name. The graphics are colorful, with just enough detail in them. Animations are a bit hit and miss, especially for the human(-like) characters. But still very good. The sword attacks are awesome and just as satisfying as other first person games with the same sort of melee combat, like Dead Island and Zeno Clash. Near the end of the game I was mostly using the sword; before that I used the weapons. But the game is just so much cooler with a sword. Boss fights all come down to firefights, however, so it's a bit disappointing that you aren't given a choice there. Gave me a bit of a Deus Ex Human Revolution vibe, even though it can't really be compared.Some of the weapons lack power, by the way, but maybe it's because the game tries to force you to use your sword. Killing enemies will earn you points and once you earn enough of them you can spend them on your skill tree(s). There are several trees; one for weapons, one for sword attacks and one for magic like shields and healing.And like I said, it's a long game. Finishing the 17 chapters will take you at least 15 hours. That's about 2-3 times longer than most of the other first person shooters. Great stuff right there.The story is also surprisingly good and the voice acting is mostly top notch.All in all I enjoyed Shadow Warrior way more than I thought I would. It's a solid, fun game that is definitely worth the price, and time.[Rating: 88/100]			"

												Excellent, meaty, visceral melee and gunplay. Great one liners, great story, excellent humour, collectables, secret areas, boss battles, great level variety, and upgradable weapons and abilities which are meaningful and satisfying. If you ever wanted to feel like you were back in the classic 90s era of FPSs like Wolf3D, Doom, or Duke Nukem 3D but upgraded and perfected for the modern era, this is it.What Duke Nukem Forever should have been like. Can't get enough of that Wang.			"

												Shadow Warrior is a retro-inspired reboot of the original Shadow Warrior classic from 1997.Story is pretty well-written for a game of this type.  The humor is light-hearted and witty and avoids being overly immature.  The banter between Lo Wang and Hoji is excellent and the game has enough great ""Wang"" jokes to fill a book.The game has a lot of content.  There are 17 large, but linear levels with a good amount of secrets and easter eggs to discover.  The campaign took me roughly 20 hours to complete on normal difficulty.  Once you get through the campaign there are options that open up for an EX playthrough where you get to playthrough again and keep all of your upgrades as well as an Expert playthrough where you start from scratch and get no savepoints mid-level.  There was also a free Survival Mode added in by the developers post-release so there is definitely a lot of value here for the money.Combat flowed very smooth and was nicely varied.  Shadow Warrior follows a Serious Sam style gameplay where enemies can come in large groups and cover is largely irrelevant.  You get a good number of weapons added to your arsenal as you progress through the game and can carry all of them with you.  The combat also has a fantastic melee element with the katana that you start the game with.  I found the katana to be the main weapon of choice throughout the game, as it seemed a bit overpowered compared to the guns, and the ""Kill Bill"" style dismemberments and decapitations were very satisfying.There is also a nice progression and upgrade system that adds even more to the combat system.  You can train skills and obtain KI powers that allow Lo Wang to move faster, heal himself better and gain special combat abilities and special combos.  You can also upgrade each of the games weapons to make them even more effective.Overall I was surprised at how good this game was.  It managed to sufficiently modernize the classic Shadow Warrior while keeping true to the old-school FPS style gameplay.  In this regard Shadow Warrior was able to accomplish what Duke Nukem Forever was not able to.  If you are a fan of old-school, fast paced FPS action with a satirical sense of humor then I highly recommend this game.			"

												Welcome, this is my first serious review and I hope you have fun reading it! Shadow Warrior isn't what you would consider to be a reboot or a remake of an older title. The best term to consider it as would be to call it a 'Re-Imagining'. Everything in Shadow Warrior pays homage to the 1997 version, ranging from the deliberately cheesy humour to the bombastic and downright ridiculous arsenal of weapons.This game is developed by 'Flying Wild Hog', whom of which are known for creating 'Hard Reset'.You are Lo Wang a presumably mid thirties agent of Zilla enterprises, who is tasked with finding the fabled katana known only as the Nobitsura Kage. However as one may expect, things do not go to plan. You are immediately introduced to the smooth, fast and visceral combat in the form of the katana. The hit registration feels perfect as you begin slicing your way through hordes of foes. I won't say much about the story anymore, with the exception of the fact that you are quickly introduced to a magical being who gives you awesome flashing abilities.The special powers you recieve allow for some stylish ways to decapitate your enemies, whether it be by flinging a blade of energy at their pathetic head or whether you prefer to do a 360 degree spin to destroy multiple enemies at once. The sword play feels so great and as a result you'll be spending most of your time using the katana whilst also trying to achieve the best possible score in a segment of each level. The gunplay however, starts of relatively weak due to the lack weight when firing certain types of weapons. This is especailly prevalent in the revolver because of the lackluster sound and uninspired concept. But as the game drip feeds you more and more weapons, the more and more awesome they become. Thanks to weapon upgrading system, you can add absurd alternate firing modes to certain weapons. Ever wanted to launch all of your rocket launcher ammo at once? Well now you can!The game for the most part looks absolutely beautiful, and I believe that is due to the vibrant colour palette that the developers decided to use. The textures looks high res and the lighting effects can cause you to lose yourself in the environment. My only concern in terms of the graphics is that they tend to over-use warm colours a lot, and that can cause some difficulty in navigating your way around the level due to the objective flashing orange.Speaking of levels...The level design is for the most part average, the segments of the level don't feel like they connect together to form one cohesive environment. Instead it feels like a mish mash of rooms filled with enemies to fight with the occassional area that branches out and allows you to explore. Despite the well thought out concepts and aesthetics, the levels are generally not very interesting.Now to my final gripe, the boss battles.They essentially feel like a larger more powerful version of the games beefier enemies that take a substantially longer time to kill. These battles aren't all that engaging to participate in as they feel repetitive and downright boring. The boss battles goes as follows. Wear down boss-> Shoot Important Part-> Wear down Boss-> Rinse and repeat.Do I think that this game is worth a purchase?Heck yes, this game puts AAA first person release titles to shame! The combat is absolutely amazing and I never tired of it (With the exception of the boss battles) and there's enough snarky and crude humour to please everybody. So, if you enjoy good FPS games with a fantastic feel of badass, Shadow Warrior is definitely one to pick up.Feedback and criticism is welcome!			"

												Shadow Warrior is a reboot of the popular cult classic of the same name. Being developed by a different studio, it’s obviously a different experience. But the core gameplay and twisted humour are still present for hardcore fans to enjoy. The story is where Shadow Warrior falls flat, but the gameplay and graphics of Shadow Warrior are where it really shines. Fans of the original will feel right at home. The various weapons and upgrades keep the gameplay interesting and the new addition of “special abilities”, adds further customization to each confrontation. Although a minor weapon in the original game, swordplay is a big part of the new Shadow Warrior. The sword is so much fun to use, with different combos and powerful attacks you can chain together. I found myself preferring the sword instead of the guns (which are still very fun to use).Something I didn't like about the game was the secrets. In the original game they were usually very well hidden and in some cases, quite extravagant. This reboot had plenty of secrets, but they were very basic, usually just hidden doors that led to small rooms with a few supplies.On the whole, I really enjoyed Shadow Warrior. The length of the campaign is decent and the game has enough diversity with enemies and weapons to keep things from getting too repetitive. The story was shallow and almost non-existent, but I was too busy killing things to worry about it too much.      "

												Shadow Warrior is an ultra-fast hack 'n slash FPS game propelled forward in a blinding pace with action packed combat using guns, explosives, magic and a deadly katana in an incredibly varied setting with some of the most stunning visuals I have seen to date. Add on top of that a deep and compelling story garnished with tons of humor and cliché catch-phrases that could make you wonder if the game was not taking itself very serious; an assumption you will soon come to realize is as false as false can be.The new Shadow Warrior is not so much a remake of the original, but rather a re-envisioning of the old 1997 release. The zaney humor, the slice-and-dice gamplay and Lo Wang the protagonist is still the main drive of the game, but the experience  of this latest incarnation as a whole is a much more greater, better and more enthralling undertaking.You still play as the not-so-subtle Lo Wang, a martial arts expert with an ego of some considerable size. Very early on, due to some minor complications with a powerful japanese entrepreneur (or mafia boss, basically), you get hitched up with a demonic spirit named Hoji, who gifts you with magical powers and guides you through a trail-blazing adventure to collect 3 pieces of an ancient and powerful sword - the Nobitsura Kage. Your agenda for this undertaking is to retrieve the sword for your boss, who will pay a handsome reward for the blade. Hoji's agenda, however, is an entirely different one, and you are getting more and more involved in it with every (quick) step.Shadow Warrior is one of the rare FPS games with an actual story worth listening to. In fact, it tells a story that one would have expected from a grand role playing game, or an adventure game. Every level brings gives you a little extra story and background lore, and every bit of information you uncover about Hoji's story and the legend of the Nobitsura Kage makes you realize that this game is something special. I can tell you this much; the number of FPS games that have moved me so deeply that I was in tears and goosebumps at the end are few and far inbetween. But Shadow Warrior is one such.The gameplay features a decent arsenal of deadly weapons, from handguns and shotguns, dual uzis to flame throwers, a high-powered crossbow and even a rocket launcher. Each weapon can be upgraded for extra functionality or alternate fire modes through an upgrade menu that is accessible ay any time. Purchasing an upgrade costs money, which can be found throughout the games by looting chests and cabinets or simply lying around the environment. As such, exploring each level is recommended.But the staple weapon of the game is no doubt the Katana. The melee combat in Shadow Warrior is eminent. It it fast, fun, spectacular and very skill-based. You can perform fast and precise dodges while chaining multiple different slashes and powerful magical attacks to create devastating combos on your opponents who you will literally be slicing and dicing into little bits. Heads, arms, legs and even torsos will fly in sprays of blood. Killing enemies in specatular and varied ways will reward you with Karma (and you can dispatch of them in truly varied ways once you unlock and master the many different attacks) which you can spend in the upgrade menu to improve Lo Wang's many different attributes. Deal more damage, move faster, increased health, chance of finding more and better loot and so on and so forth.Again, exploration is a key word. The more you explore, the more currency for your various upgrades you will find. Not to mention many funny and wacky easter eggs, such as hidden rooms created in the old 1997 style graphics with flat and boxy textures. The game is packed with secrets and hidden areas, usually containing extra Karma points. By use of Ki Crystals, which are found throughout the game, you unlock new special powers and magical abilities, which will not only make combat more crazy and fun, but also enhance your options of creating rewarding combos for added Karma rewards. This does, however, mean that if you do not perform too well in combat and don't explore much, the game will get increasingly difficult since you will be missing out on many of those vital upgrades.Another strong point of Shadow Warrior are the visuals. They are positively mind blowing! It is, without a doubt, one of the visually most stunningly beautiful games I have ever played. The game takes you through a multitude of different environments, from pink cherry blossom gardens to great bamboo forests, to underground caverns littered with stalagmites and stalagtites and even into the Shadow Realm, a strange and mysterious plane of existence that is arguably even more gorgeous than the afore mentioned areas. Through and through the game is sugary-sweet eye candy that actually leaves you time and opportunity to walk around and enjoy it to the fullest.Do not be mislead by the story, exploration and RPG-like upgrades though, Shadow Warrior is still a true arcade ""twitch"" FPS game at heart. It is fast, relentless and brutal. There is no emphasis on realism or tactics what-so-ever. More often than not you are swarmed by 10, 15 or even 20 enemies all at once. It is a pure-breed hack 'n slash, shoot 'n scoot powerhouse based on a completely liniar level progression, and nearly all combat scenarios are triggered events. You walk into a designated area, and portals will spawn to spill forth throngs of enemies. Chop them up and move to the next area, then rinse and repeat. Luckily, doing this is SO MUCH FUN! I really am struggling to think of any downsides to this game. It has just been an enjoyment from start to finish.Synopsis:+ Excellent arcade FPS action with many weapons and superb controls+ Some of the best melee sword combat I've experienced+ Rewards exploration; easter eggs and  secrets aplenty+ Lots of humor and nods to the old 1997 game+ Incredible graphics and varied level design+ Deep and enthralling story+ Hoji- Dodging often gets you killed in stupid ways- Needs a fairly strong computer to run well with graphics on high- Sword attacks are sometimes unresponsive if chained together too quickly- Certain weapons sometimes ""lock up"" and don't fire if you just switched to them- The game can be quite punishing if you do not explore or score good karma during combat- Bossfights; they are challenging yes, but all of them use the exact same mechanic.

												Shadow Warrior is a FPS developed by Flying Wild Hog and published by Devolver Digital and it is based on the classic Shadow Warrior from 1997This is a very underrated game as it's not very popular among the Internet which is a shame for such a polished gameThe StoryThe Story is pretty straightforward , it is set in Japan and you are the baddass Katana-wielding Lo-Wang. You are sent by your boss to retrieve the Legendary Sword ""Nobitsura-Kage"" from a Japanese Mafia Leader. After you slice some of his henchman's heads , he and his demon companion Hoji capture you. After a few hours you wake up in a tapped in a cage. A demon aids you by giving you a sword which you use to escape with , but nothing seems to be alright as a Demon Invasion has just begun. Now You and Hoji make an unusual alliance together in order to find the Nobitsura Kage and bring an end to the Demon Invasion.GameplayShadow Warrior's gameplay is Solid.There are 7 weapons to choose from with each having 3 upgrades to buyThe most unique of them is the Katana. It is like your usual melee weapon tho in this game it is one of the most useful. You can learn diffrent skills for your Katana giving it some special moves whcih are rly useful in battle.There is the ""skills"" section where you can learn new skills for the exchange of ""karma points"" which give you some sweet enchancements to your character that will aid you throughout your adventure.There are 4 diffrent Powers you can learn with each one having 4 upgradeThey are very useful in combat as by using them you can easily turn the tide of battle in your favorFor example: There is a power which can heal you , a power which can shield you from enemy attacks and the 2 others can stun enemies.Every single battle of the game consists of diffrent waves of enemies and after each one you get a score from 1 to 5 stars of how well you've done. The score is based on the variety of weapons and powers used , enviromental damage and how quick you've killed them. The more variety the bigger the score!GraphicsThe artstyle of the game is just breathtaking! It is based around the Japanese culture which makes it look unique compared to other FPS games. It is indeed a nice game to take screenshots of :)

												When I was a very small kid I used to run mad for swords. Feeling like a knight and slashing my plastic sword left and right to kill hordes of imaginary orcs around me and so on...Then I grow up and I discovered that Japanese people exist!And with the Japanese the katana!That sword...absolutely beautiful and incredible.And here in this game is the most powerful weapon ever....even than the BFG9000 that you can find in DooM!Yeah ok you have a cool pistol that will make you feel like in the old far west...Yeah you have a flamethrower that will make the monsters scream and run all over the place like boiled chickens...Yeah you will even have a rocket launcher that you can use to paint ""modern art"" on the walls with the pieces of the monsters...AND YEAH OBVIOUSLY you can even cut off the head of one of the monsters and use it like a laser gun....shot by its eyes....you know like Cyclops or Superman...What other game don't have this stuff...uh?But that katana...so shining, so pointy, so powerful, so awesome....aaaahh an ♥♥♥♥♥♥!Anyway what I think of this game?...this game is magnificent...from the old Shadow Warrior this is a very well made remake/reboot of the original one.Lot of action, few jokes around found inside the cookies or between you and your companion (yes you will have a companion with you for almost the whole game) and an absolute brilliant graphic. Games of light, shadow and smoke will give you shivers in some situations.  Even the plot is well made with several cutscenes (with manga like draws or with the in game graphic)...but still...is Shadow Warrior...there is no time to talk...in fact some parts are pretty challenging and you will sweat on your mouse and keyboard to keep up.This game will engage you so much that...well...it will make you happy, it will make you angry, it will make you satisfied and it will make you sad too...Enjoy this wonderful game in every part of it.Overall:Graphic 9/10Sounds 8/10Gameplay 8/10Longevity 8/10			"

												I'll start off by saying I really enjoyed this game. If you like to play by yourself, and with a Wang, this game is for you. This game captures the old school feel well, without trying too hard. Unless you're impatient, this should last you about 15-20 hours minimum. Lo Wang is a likeable lead character, and his buddy Hoji, while annoying at first, becomes very charming. You may roll your eyes at the start when you meet the two of them, but they quickly grew on me. The combat in this game is very fluid and full of action. The pacing is simplistic, and straight forward, with lots of secrets to explore if that's what you're interested in. You can upgrade Lo Wang himself, his abilites, and his weapons as well. The guns give you all the basics with a few extras. All the guns can be upgraded with bonus abilities, which adds a little spice to the arsenal, but none of them felt very satisfying to use. Not to say they were bad, just rather plain. The Crossbow is the exception, which I felt was most enjoyable once you upgraded it. The sword play and health system are notably good IMO. Sword combat is strong and mixes well with the guns, with neither one being obviously better than the other. The health system allows you to regenrate a percentage of your total health using a healing ability, which doesn't stop you from firing your guns or swinging your sword. You can also upgrade your max health, and med kits allow you to heal above your max health giving you some bonus HP. The difficulty is something I took issue with though. I played on Hard for 99% of the game, and most of it was fairly manageable. It felt like I was playing something that would be considered ""Normal"" most of the time. Every now and then however, I found myself facing a part that had a huge spike in difficulty. It's not that the game is too hard, it just gets wildly inconsistent in difficulty throughout. I'd give it a solid 8/10. $40 is a bit much for this game ($20 being my ideal price), especially since it has no multiplayer, no co-op, and it lacks notable replay value. To their credit, they did later put in a free mode called Survival, where you fight endless monsters. Though, without co-op, or any real point to it, it's more of a time waster when you don't have enough time to commit to something else. Still, they added free content, and gives a little more life blood to the game. That all said, they did a good job with this one, and because of that I am going to check out Hard Reset, and hope they continue to make games.			"

												I paied for it less than 3 euros, I have played more than 18 hours so... It worth.Beside that, lets see...Do you like blood? There is a lot of blood, oceans of blood would be more correct. Action? Yep, you won't rest.Graphics? Japanese ambient, cherry trees, temples... Are good the graphics? Yep.Story? Well, there are 17 chapters. You will get lost for about 4 of them because you will only kill, dismember, burn etc but the story is good and you will get shocked at the end.Controls? Easy, you will feel powerfull!!So, If you want to enjoy killing a lot, a lot... a lot!!! of demons, play it. :D

It adds some character progression, secrets and balanced bad guys, weapons and abilities. Boss Fights are fairly challenging without being overly irratating. The game will take a while to play through but with a few breaks at reasonable intervals it should easily keep your interest, The one liners will have you chuckling occasionally.

Praise Flying Hog Wild for remaking this 3D Realms classic. If you're an old-school gamer with a love for FPS games, then this is a must-have for your collection.			"

												Without a doubt, the best FPS I've ever played. Now, I'm not very good at FPS games and don't play them too much, so take that with a grain of salt. I'm more of a hack-n'-slash fan. And when using the katana, this game honestly feels like a first-person hack-n'-slash. The melee combat is that good. You will likely find yourself using the katana in 90% of scenarios, only switching to guns for large enemies, flying enemies, and mobs, because it's just that fun to use.However, the gunplay is nothing to sneeze at. The aiming feels incredibly precise, and each weapon has two methods of firing. There's not many things more satisfying than mowing down a group of demons with dual SMGs, and bullets feel like they have weight behind them.The RPG elements add a nice flair to the game. From looking at the forums, it seems like everyone has a different idea of what's important to upgrade, which means the RPG elements are doing their job of building Lo Wang around your playstyle.The story is pretty nice, as well. Lo Wang is simply a middleman for his boss, and tries to buy a katana from a martial artist. When he refuses to sell, Wang attempts to take it by force, and soon gets in over his head.My only real criticism that dampened the experience was that some of the mini-bosses were incredibly annoying. There is a particular type of enemy with a weak spot on their back that drove me insane...you'll know which one I'm talking about when you reach it.Outside of that, I doubt any FPS will top this one in my book anytime soon.

Teal DeerDevelopers: Flying Wild Hog Publishers: Devolver DigitalInitial release: Sept 2013Genre: Action, FPS, Swordplay#Worth/NotWorth: #WorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationThis one came out of nowhere for me. I never played the original back in 1997 as I was busy saving the world from nuclear destruction during the Shadow Moses incident. ….One of the things that threw me was the game in steam is tagged as being funny. Which it is but not at first. The characters start to grow on you as you progress through the game. Then become actually funny though admittedly some of the things are timely references. Also the main character is named Lo Wang. So think of anything that can be supplanted by Wang. Its in there. (There is even a George Carlin quote on a fortune cookie, which is a collectible) The plot of the game is pretty much a bunch of demons try to get a sword called the Nobitsura Kage. Which, for what it is, remains fairly interesting throughout. It also seems rather serious at times which is part of what threw me off from the funny tag. THE GAMEPLAYHoly crap, I will honestly miss the gameplay here. Its so smooth, fast and fun. Swordplay mixed with gunplay but lets be honest you came here to cut♥♥♥♥♥♥up. And it feels great. As you gain more powers and abilities. Firing your weapon while healing or shielding, switching back to your sword while shielding to withstand a barrage to get in close. You truly feel like you have control over both hands. You totally get to be a badass ninja. Though on the downside, the guns feel little underpowered rather they sound underpowered. But that's a very minor complaint. You gain Karma points which are used to upgrade things like stats, how much healing and stamina recovery is gained on pickups. Ki crystals which correlate to abilities such as shockwave and flux which stun enemies and similar effects. And all the money you find goes into buying upgrades for the weapons themselves. There really is nothing quite as satisfying as watching a demon jump through a portal, rushing in on him and cutting its head off in one fell swoop with a well placed swing. My only complaint about the movement is be vary weary of stairs, dashing down them seems to make you accelerate and instantly kill you. It seems to have you dash horizontally along the X axis then drop you rather than just move quickly up and down them. Which tapping L.Shift makes you dash, holding makes you sprint. So plan your descent down the stairs. I'll end by saying one of the more memorable funny bits during the game. After killing one of the bosses Wang says “Weak as a babies fart” I'm not sure why but it made me laugh out loud. I think it was the timing.Follow my curation for more "

												It starts of as a mindless & brutal hack/slash action first person shooter, which you don't expect much to differ. The colourful graphic engine and well crafted level designing architecture may cloud your appetite for a more complex adventure. You don't really seem to desire more, as you start the mission blindly.You are perfectly contented in the physics of severing limbs of your enemies. To break and annihilate things seem like a fun, careless freedom, all the while being guided on a ""fixed route"" to 'heroic righteousness',but as you dwelve into deeper levels you find yourself in tuned with a deeper cinematic journey, that isn't written by Serious Sam although the action may suggest so.You find yourself gripped with a story that makes sense albeit being an action game, a story exist. Characters that have some development to actually make you feel like you care for what seemed to be a senseless beginning.The adventure is well crafted, I praise it highly for the level designing to always make you feel as being on a journey. It leads nearer to something larger and larger, the past which you feel was large wasn't anymore. What's ahead or over the next mountain excites you as with an adnveture. This pace of adventure exists to give you a sense of progression, like a scale that tells you at which point you are. As with, the journey is always the fun, not the destination.I remember as battles lead to the next, steps to go higher and higher, it dawned upon me the backdrop scenery of the initial stages eventually becomes the actual expanse of a fortress I am about to enter.It tells me, I have finally arrived from the treacherous climb, but it also tells me something, ... an epic battle awaits, inside those huge, ancient temple doors. You know what your climb have led to.You are rewarded throughout your journey, to great picturesque amounts of flora or ancient temples / buildings with an exhausted past of turmoil that never seem to bore. All levels have something of a signature touch. This is such an important aesthetic for gaming, just as how memorable the music were in Final Fantasy 7 & 8, so is the level designing of this game that is actually more of a mindless hack & slash arena, it has a soul.As much as you think the battles are repetitive, it is not. Not only because of the environment but as the journey progresses, so will your weapons. Having the freedom of a large arsenal invigorates the activities, choices on how you plan to take on the enemy.It is satisfying, nonetheless, upon completing hordes of enemies, each one seemed larger than the last, but you are able to cope. Only time will tell how much you can cope, as the journey will eventually lead not only to tougher enemies but incredible swarms of them.Oh, yes, bosses are well designed too, perhaps not at the level of Dark Souls but you will appreciate the arena and that they do not look like wimps.The simple idea of using the right weapons at the right time and yet being creative at your mobility and usage of these weapons is how skilled of a warrior you are, that is a good action game.The core battle mechanics do not fail, you acquire new weapons and also divinitive powers. Nothing too complicating for an action game, you shoot and slash but try to be creative. Think on your feet.Enemies vary in sizes and also in swarms,All the while in beautiful crafted environments. It surprises me for a slasher game to provide so much amusement in art, architecture, it certainly does not fail there to disillusion you to a mystic world.I like being rewarded in a journey, I like when developers and designers themselves are passionate to create something beautiful after a simple gaming engine. Requirements are not that high.I prefer this to the sequel. And yess... i wrote this to complete the badge achievement. and yes, I really thought this game was cool before the sequel became popular. Thanks to [NPC]Sensei for gifting this game to me.Enjoy the game, I hope I can convince you to try it.			"

Impossible to beat if you turn Item Flashing off, since a lot of doors/buttons/whatever are identical to the other 20 doors/buttons/whatever and the only way you would know to go that way is to have item flashing on. Other than that slight annoyance, good game. I give this 2 Wangs up.			"

												Shadow Warrior is one of the best FPS games that I've ever played in my life! You take control over Lo Wang, a cocky guy who has to do some exchange for his boss. Things are going sour, you're getting ambushed and you end up teaming up with equally cocky demon (sic!). That's the beginning of really interesting story that I'm not going to spoil here.Let's just say that your first (and main) weapon is a katana. And boy, did they make this weapon enjoyable to use :) You also have guns. Lots of guns. Machine gun, flamethrower, crossbow, ninja stars, freaking disembodied demon's head... And you can hold all of them, which is rare for games released nowadays.You also have 3 types of upgrades (and 3 'currencies' so to speak to use for said upgrades). Weapon enchancements, powers and skills. You can unlock special attacks, healing boost, defensive moves, special powerful katana attacks, variety is stunning.The game encourages exploration. There are a lot of secrets scattered through the game there's also few easter eggs (for example: try to disturb two bunnies which have intimate moment together ;)Controls are nice and responsive. Your special moves are done by pressing certain combination of buttons. It's fluent and simple. You also have dash move, which comes in handy suprisingly often. Graphics and aesthetic are great.Enemies are crazy and satisfying to kill. There are also 3 big boss battles, and I mean big. Like you are fighting an enemy who's like 50 meters high :PI have only two pet peeves with this game: First - at a certain point you can clearly see the 'ambush' sort of gameplay that they tried to use. Like you find some important object and bam, it's an ambush, enemies swarming you left and right. It's not Call of Duty bad, where if you don't move the enemies will respawn infinetely (well, disregard :P they will until you kill the spawner :P). Nah, it's obvious what they tried to do. It's not horrible, but pretty transparent and somewhat annoying at times. Good that killing enemies is so fun :PSecond - there's no map. The game is quite linear, but there are still some parts of the game where I just got lost and didn't know what to do next (usually it had something to do with finding a certain spot to plant explosives or press a button on the wall somwhere)All in all - Shadow Warrior is really great game and it saddens me that crap like Call of Duty sells millions of copies and enjoyable gems like Shadow Warrior are neglected.9/10!

												Launched the game, played 5 hours straight, here is the review.Positives:-The combat. What makes this game worth it, what makes it insanely fun is its combat. You use a variety of weapons, spells in the form of ki powers, special attacks and a lot more. -Skill, weapon and ki customization.The game has a very nice skill customization system that lets you alter the flow of the combat but unlike other games the customization doesn't make you regret that you didn't choose the other path of skills. You get points to upgrade by performing well in combat or finding secrets. You can upgrade your katana skills to unlock amazing and very useful skills like doing a spin that cuts all enemies around you or charging your sword to send a travelling wave that cuts anything in its path. And you can get other skills such as increasing your stamina to dash more often in battle. I never felt I was in a shortage of points and never felt underpowered and that was very nice.The weapons. You pick up lots of weapons through the game. Your first weapon is a Japanese revolver and you can pick up things like shotguns, crossbows, etc. I am a fan of Japan so the game sticking to a Japanese style made me very happy. The weapons stick to the Japanese style as well (The smg has a rising sun painted on its side and other things) so no need to worry about guns feeling out of space when your sword is sheathed. There aren't many customization options but the ones avalaible are sufficient enough because they upgrade the weapons a lot such as dual wielding for smg.You don't need to upgrade the katana's damage with money because you pick up the upgrades by playing the game, that way the game doesn't force you to decide between katana or weapon. You use them both. ♥♥♥♥ing Samurai Hitman.There are also Ki powers that you unlock through the game. You get the points for these not very often so you got to spend your points right. They are extremely fun and essential to combat. There is one I use all the time and upgraded to its max potential that creates a shockwave that travels where you cast it and makes the enemies float for a period of time and let you murder them.-Graphics and style.The game has a style that mixes Japanese and Chinese cultures but the Japanese side is a lot more dominant. Seeing The Great Wave off Kanagawa while looting houses makes me very happy :D The combat and everything else sticks to this Japanese theme very well. But there are Chinese things mixed in as well, such as Lo Wang or how some places are designed.The game looks great but I think its more because of the map and enemy design than graphics. Graphics are nice but not great. They are not at the point of hurting your eyes but they are certainly not the best.-Story The concealed build up, the rainy ending. It was a lot more than I expected. This is the best example how a story is made.Negatives:-Can be repetitive or underwhelming at times.The game is certainly filled with combat, amazing map design and amazing encounters that do not let you take a break but sometimes the going can be underwhelming. Even Lo Wang comments on this once, says Oh another massacre, what a nice change of pace. I cannot stress this enough,the pace is absolutely fast and the envirnoments, encounters are breathtaking. But this very fast pace can be underwhelming after a time.-I haven't finished the game but I imagine the longevity of the game will be a problem. The price tag is not very low if you do not catch a discount, and the game is not that long. I am probably close to the middle of the game with 5 hours of gameplay so consider that wihle buying.----That was the only negative that affected me, the next two negatives will be just trying my hardest to find something bad in the game since finding something bad in this game is not an easy task.----Graphics The graphics felt a little bit off at the start but its nothing to block the game at all. -More skills maybe ?------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Suprisingly amazing, buy it.

												Shadow Warrior brought me, what I would consider, a lot of good gameplay hours. The sword combat may start off slow, but it definitely gets a lot better as you learn demonic powers and different styles of sword techniques. The guns in the game also have a Bioshock upgrade system. Each gun comes with the ability to be upgraded 3 times and gives them new abilities along with making it easier to blow stuff up.If you like massive carnage, blowing up just about every object in the world and katana sword play, Shadow Warrior doesn't disappoint. It is only single player, but I feel like that's a positive thing since all their time was focused into the main story. Also easily one of the most challenging games if played on the hardest difficulty. Definitely snag this one during a sale if you are looking for a nice game to tear♥♥♥♥♥♥up in.			"

												Bringing swordplay and dismemberment into the 21st century! It’s scary how fun it is chopping Yakuza and demons into small chunks. Killing things in this game is incredibly satisfying, even using the other weapons like the shotgun or rocket launcher make the demons explode apart in a nice squishy crunchy wayFor most of the game you are fighting an army of angry demons, there’s about 10 or so different enemy types which all have certain weapons that are more effective at taking them out. Once you upgrade Lo Wang’s abilities you are able to use powers that for example hold demons in the air, so you are free to cut them up or shoot them in the face.I will say I would have liked to fight more humans like the Yakuza. It’s much more fun killing people than demons I find. There’s even a line Wang says at one point after you cut up a demon that is something like “ all the fun, none of the moral uncertainty” I dunno Wang, the morality or lack of it is what makes killing people fun (in video games).The game ran really well for me, I was getting up to 180fps at some points, it dropped to 100ish when there were a lot of enemies. It felt really fluid playing this and using the dash mechanic while cutting demons up. That’s playing at 1440p as well which is pretty impressive to me, for how good this looks and with all the explosions and such.If you like fps games or you know, just like cutting sh*t up then you should definitely play this, it will make your Wang go from Lo to Hi.

„Over 5000 hitmen in the country and I still have to get a nerd. Where do you keep your porn?“-HojiAfter finishing the game, I have to say it was great. I bought it because of it's concept - Japanese man killing demons using katana and other weapons. But I got a great story, which was unexpected. For it's price, it is more satisfiing than 60€ games.Lo Wang, japanese hitman, is hired for a job. He has to get a sword at any cost. It's not a easy task and...let's say demons appear. He makes a deal with one of them and gets super inhuman powers. Lo Wang continues in his task and uncovers demon's story.As you continue through game, you can upgrade weapons, powers and skills: Weapons - Each weapon has 3 upgrades, making the weapon more deadly (Akimbo, Laser targeting, Damage increase...) Powers - you collect ""Ki crystals"" that unlock you new moves and combos. I really like ""Powers"" system. When obtaining power, you will get a tatto. Each tatto symbolizes unique power(Dragon scales=defense and etc...). After obtaining all tatoos, you will have your chest and hands copletely tatooed. Looks nice. Skills - you obtain ""Karma points"", which can be exchanged for skill. Skill system is nice too. You have old japan artworks that you will make with each skill colorful. (Increases stamina, health, damage to enemies, luck, resistance...)Pros++Great combat system+Long, good story+Weapon, Power and Skill system+Challenging enemies+Jokes (Titsubishi cars...)Cons--Graphics-Annoying suiciding enemies8/10			"

Posted: December 27, 2014
												Back in 1997, there was Shadow Warrior, a first person shooter from the makers of Duke Nukem 3D. Some 17 years later comes the prequel starring a young Lo Wang. Shadow Warrior 2013 is a unique first person shooter. This is more than a first person shooter. It melds button combination presses of Mortal Kombat into the first person action. Right, right, and alt attack for a health spell that will slowly heal yourself. Forward forward, attack when your sword is drawn for a strong slash. Back, back and alt attack for a ground pound that sends enemies flying into the air. There is a dash move to instantly dart yourself in any direction. It is helpful for staying alive against a flood of enemies. If you hold the button you run with limited stamina. There is a sense of speed and maneuverability that modern first person shooters lack. All these things make Shadow Warrior 2013 different and fresh.The basis of the game is travel and combat. You go to different parts of a level, push buttons, break seals and so on. There are no puzzles. Then you find yourself in rooms or arenas that get flooded with enemies. Once the enemies get defeated, the doors unlock. The sheer amount of enemies, the variety of enemies and the chaos that ensues is where the game shines. After killing a cluster of enemies, the game rates you. How does it judge you? Efficiency or weapon variety? I have no idea.There isn't much enemy variety in those first two hours. Demons that melee and support demons that shoot. The demons have diverse looks, they can even crawl on walls and swing from lights. If any demon is left alive for too long it can buff itself and become more difficult to kill. Its a nice system. Humans and skeletons are also in the game, but both are really just there for fodder. Humans are easily killed, but at least they have swords or guns. Skeletons are strictly melee. When some enemies die they leave behind their souls that are health instead of needing to find health kits or use your health spell.After the first two hours, the game really begins to flourish. Different enemies needing different tactics. Tall and short shield demons need to have their shields broken. The tall ones launch projectiles and open up their defenses as they do. There are little holes in the tops of their shield if you aim just right. Dreadlocked, dual sword swinging demons that can turn invisible and teleport to or from you. Far away they throw shurikens. Acid balls like mines explode when you get near. Not just that, but acid demons that explode when killed or roll into a ball and shriek as they bowl toward you! Winged demons that spit fireballs at you. When you kill them, they will kamikaze after you!Big mini bosses, like a minotaur  that will energy whip and then pull you in. He can send a ring of fire out that you need to jump. Finally, he can charge nearby demons. A tall shaman that will rise green flaming skeletons out of the ground. After he summons skeletons, he will create a giant force field until you kill those skeletons. There are hulking chargers that like all games, they charge forward and you need to shoot them in the back. They are smart enough to turn when charging and only charge when you're in an area open enough for them to hit you. At first, these are only mini bosses, but then they become uncommon enemies.These are the chess pieces you get stuck in arenas with. Any number of different combinations of enemies. These are more than just square arenas. There are walls and pillars to hide behind, dead ends to get stuck in. Each one is beautiful. Some could be in a horror movie. Lights flickering, chargers breaking through walls hunting you with their eyes glowing lit on fire from your last rocket. Even if you think you're done with one wave, other enemies could continue to flood in. All topped off with winged demons shooting down at you.The three mega bosses are colossal and you need to take out their parts. This requires more than aim, it needs dedication, because these battles can be 15 minutes in a 17 hour game. I can't say they're fun or difficult, just a struggle in your endurance.So how do you take all these creatures out? You have a katana for melee. This is a fun weapon. Slashes through enemies with buckets of blood. Beheads them, chops off arms and legs. You can see enemies trying to crawl away with no legs or walk away holding a missing limb.  The developers brag about a clean sword button, its a reload button for a weapon that has no ammunition. With the katana, you can also throw shurikens that stun enemies for half a second, but seem laughably useless.For guns, there's a pistol, an oozy, a crossbow that feels like a sniper rifle, a giant double barreled shotgun that you can upgrade into a quad barreled shotgun. There is a flame thrower that feels useful against winged demons, a giant rocket launcher and a demon heart. The demon heart can be squeezed to kill lesser demons in a short radius. There are a hand full of turret sections that you can back out of and fight as normal even if using a turret is mandatory to make something happen.Not just that, but there are ki crystals and statues that let you unlock attacks and perks in a sort of skill tree. The strong attack I mentioned, a whirlwind attack, and a wide slash. Even a force push sort of spell and a soul drain that lets you cheat death by killing an enemy within X number of seconds to revive yourself. There are even perks to find 10% extra money or ammo. Increase your health spell or maximum health in general. The weapons are upgradeable too. Mostly with more damage or accuracy. Some have alt fires.Shadow Warrior 2013 is a gorgeous game even on its lowest settings. Everything seems to glow. Its very colorful and vibrant. The game starts in a sort of tranquil, beautiful Asia, before moving to industrial docks and then to ice mountains. Its all gorgeous to look at. There are plenty of details, graveyards, amazing weather effects, bamboo mazes, and homes to raid. There are things to break, cars and barrels to explode. Even bunnies you can watch hop on each other with pink hearts over their heads.You can open up chests and cabinets to find ammo, health packs, money and even armor. There are plenty of secrets off the beaten path. Looking for loot really breaks up the action and enemies don't just leave ammo, so you need to scavenge. The game has an exploration element without getting lost. In fact the game highlights where you should go with glowing doors. That doesn't mean it'll give you an arrow to the doors. You can even turn off the glowing effect if you really want to get lost in where to go next. A lot of times the game will seal off previous parts of a level to limit your back tracking.The game plays very old school. You'll need to find keys to unlock doors. Luckily one key unlocks all doors. There are red, blue and green seals you'll need to break before you can enter certain doors.Let me quickly discuss deal breakers. If anyone out there hates 'head bob' where you noticeably see the camera bob around. There is no way to turn it off. The game can be a beast on your hardware, but there are a lot of settings. There is an error that can crash the game on start up to a dump file. I assume its from the settings and resolution problems. There is a safe mode, but I had to restart my PC to fix it. Finally, Lo Wang's last game was in 1997, his 90s attitude hasn't changed since then. A lot of games have banter and one liners, but some of these seem awful. The sidekick voice in your head throughout the game seems to be channeling Heath Ledger's Joker voice (not character). He is a very sniveling character there to make Lo Wang look cool by comparison.Shadow Warrior 2013's combat depth will make it difficult for any other first person shooter. It is engaging to do button combos and have so much control with dash buttons. Thanks Ryb for the game!			"

												Why buy Shadow Warrior? Because it's a 1st person shooter with demonic creatures in it, like Doom - and who doesn't like Doom? Zombies have for long now overcrowded most of the shooting games, pushing all kinds of hellspawn out of the picture. So, when I came across Shadow Warrior, it felt refreshing and old school at the same time.I'd say, that the game starts out rather weak. The first few level designs are not that great, for example objects you can interact with look very similar to objects you can't interact with. Also the arenas where the action takes place feel clumsy and uncomfortable to traverse. On top of that, before you haven't unlocked any abilities the fighting is extremely linear and boils down to how fast you can click the mouse button. I can imagine, that it's easy to consider giving up at this point. But it get's better, way better. Once you start unlocking all kinds of cool abilities and level up your character, the fighting becomes very diverse. The weapons are cool and new upgrades completely alter their behavior. The level design miraculously catches up and the game becomes prettier with every new chapter. The arenas in the second half of the game are havens of bloodbath and massacre and truly carry the essence of good 1st person shooters.As you advance, new types of monsters come and try to get the best of you - this is where the fighting actually becomes tactical, since it's best to take out certain types of enemies first while saving others to harvest them for extra health. Bullets are plentiful in this game, but you want to share them accordingly.The dialogues are heavy on humor, but focused on one-liners and below-the-waist jokes, which in it's own way helps to paint a picture of the protagonist as of a straightforward, no-bs, shoot-first-ask-later type of guy and as such has it's role to play. But, behind all the crackers and punchlines, there's actually a really deep and beautiful story with an oriental understanding of relationships, honour and revenge.As a con, I have to point out, that the major boss battles were copies of each other and really didn't put up much of a challenge once you knew what you had to do.Verdict:If you were into games like Quake, Serious Sam and Duke Nukem, chances are, that you'll like Shadow Warrior. However, the flipside of this is, that it feels like an oldie, a game from decades bygone, with all the bells and whistles of a modern game, but an old-timer nevertheless.			"

												Shadow Warrior is a remake of the classic Shadow Warrior from the 90's. Played on an i5 4460 and a gtx 1060 I was able to run the game +60fps on Ultra using a 1080p resolution. Mouse and Keyboard are preferred however the game is programmed for gamepads as well. On a technical level this game is very well optimized. You play as Lo Wang, an assassin who works for a Japanese millionaire business owner named Orochi Zilla. The setup is Zilla gives Wang a briefcase with 2 million dollars in it and sends him to go purchase a very special Katana called the Nobitsura Kage from a man named Mizayaki. Mizayaki refuses and knocks Wang out with the help of mysterious ghost-like entity. When Wang wakes up he discovers demons are roaming everywhere and this is where the game truly begins.This is a first person shooter with arena encounters much like those in the Serious Sam and Painkiller games. Which means you go through the stage until you get locked in a big room and can't leave until you've defeated waves of enemies. Not just that but there are plenty of hidden secrets that can be found throughout the game by exploring each area. The rewards do make a difference in Lo Wangs power by being able to purchase upgrades earlier. Speaking of upgrades...There's an upgrade system that lets you upgrade 3 different types of abilities; Weapons, which costs money. Skills, which costs Karma points and Powers which costs Ki Crystals. Weapons will be found at specific parts of the game and include things like a revolver, sub machine gun, shotgun, crossbow, flame thrower and rocket launcher. The money it takes to upgrade these things can be found in lootable containers or randomly on the ground or from hidden gold statue thingies. Skills enhance many things such as maximum hit points, stamina, the amount of money and bullets you find, extra damage to demons and stuff along those lines. You can also learn different Katana techniques which I talk a bit more about below. Skills are strictly upgraded through Karma Points which can be found from Karma Chalices placed throughout the game and also killing demons with combos & clearing full demon enounters quickly. Lastly, Powers are created through the use of Ki (pronounced chi in this game). There's no Ki meter or anything so Powers can be used infinitely. With Ki Powers you can do things such as heal yourself up to 60% of you main health (80% fully upgraded) or defend yourself with a Ki Shield. Ki Powers can only be upgraded using Ki Crystals which are hard to miss and found through natural game progression. Certain skills and powers can used with the Katana by double clicking a movement direction and pressing attack or alternate attack keys/buttons provided you've purchased them via upgrade system. Guns can be upgraded to have an exceptionally powerful alternate fire but it'll cost you some major dosh. There's a stamina meter in this game and it is limited so you can not run and dash out of harm's way indefinitely. Don't fret just yet though, stamina automatically recharges! The recharge speed and maximum amount can be increased via upgrades, so there is that. There's an acceptable amount of enemy variety that includes lesser demons such the obligatory cannon fodder enemies. Ranged ones that shoot fireballs. Some flyers that shoot fireballs. Some annoying ones that teleport. Then you have greater demons which you may as well consider mini-bosses. Greater Demon Warlords have huge health pools, can pull you towards them or shoot beams at you (they do more than that, don't worry ;). With a specific skill upgrade you can actually turn their decapitated head into a devastating, room clearing weapon. There are a few very satisfying Boss fight encounters that I found fun, each with their own gimmick.There are 17 chapters/stages and each stage is HUGE with lots to explore. There isn't a lot in the way of puzzle variety. It's usually press these switches or find this key or destroy those statues to break a seal on a door. The main focus is on combat, obviously, with some puzzles I've mentioned thrown in there along with the occasional cutscene. The game can take 10+ hours on average to complete. There are multiple levels of difficulty and even a New Game Plus mode they call EX mode.The music and sound design are decent. The sound effects of the Katana were great however I did find the sound effects used for the guns kind of lackluster. They didn't feel like they had a lot of punch. As for the graphics, beautiful. They hold up very well and each stage looks like it was designed with a lot of care and thought. The bamboo forests and pagodas are great looking and some of the more industrial locations later on do too.I was a big fan of the classic Shadow Warrior and I can say that Flying Wild Hog did a great job creating a similar theme as the original even if the tone might be a bit lighter. The story is a lot better than what you would expect from a limb filled gorefest like this. I quite enjoyed it and had a blast playing. The pacing seemed pretty dang good. The only time it seemed to really slow down and falter was in the last couple of chapters but by then the game is almost over. So by the time it got old I was about to finish anyway.Highly recommend it, I'd put it right up there with modern remakes of other old FPS games like DOOM 2016 and Wolfenstein: The New Order. Great stuff here, we got a gem.			"

												Probably the most fun you could get out of a FPS game. Shadow Warrior goes back to the roots of the genre and forgets all about modern dynamics such as cover, fake realism and the dreadful cinematic handholding a lot of recent games introduced. It's shooting at its core and its fun.I'm not even going to attempt to explain the story because I was too busy slashing my way through demons to make any sense of it. It honestly did not mater to me. They could have pinned any generic story to the game and my experience with it would have been the same.I absolutely loved the gameplay in the title. You have your katana, which you will probably end up using the most because its just fun to use it - Pro tip: press R to clean the blood off of it. There's also your typical revolver, uzi, shotgun, flamethrower, demon heart, crossbow, rocket launcher and demon head. All weapons are upgradeable and each have their own special abilities. I found explosive arrows on crossbow to be particularly useful, or dual wielding uzi's for maximum shredding power felt satisfying. Of course squeezing a demon heart to kill all lesser demons around you is always fun... or grabbing a large demon head and shooting a laser from its eyes is effective as well.There is an upgrade system which gives passive and active abilities, both offensive and defensive. The active ones in particular act a larger role when it comes to katana swordplay as using them while slashing enemies feels very fluid.The technical aspects of the title are satisfactory. Graphically I found the game beautiful. I've encountered minor bugs which did not let me progress to the next chapter so the last autosave had to be reloaded but in the 15 hours of gameplay there is to be had here, that occurred on very few occasions.It is nice to see some devs wanting to make shooters that generally feel great and are fun to play. There are no boring cinematics here, extremely linear maps, unneeded handholding. There are cheesy 80's references, fortune cookies that, while also reference a lot of other very fine work, are funny and the developers paid homage to the 90's classic FPS Shadow Warrior. There are bunnies one finds in the act of coitus, which upon gunfire engagement turn into dark demons from hell and attack you. The developers know they made a game, not a movie or a piece of art one hangs on walls and critiques for what its message is.			"

												When I picked up this game, I didn't know what to expect.  Never heard of the publisher, the developer, no knowledge of the original, just grabbed it because it was on sale and the peer reviews were outstanding.  I was hooked after the first fifteen minutes.13 hours later, after the completion of my journey through the game, I am left grasping at thoughts, and expatiating at my adventure.  Everything about this game is beautiful, in so many ways.  This game is a time sucking quest that is so addictive it should be a schedule 1 drug.The environments you visit, the incredible journey you go through, is unforgettable.  By the end of the game I truly felt that you, the player, and the protagonist went through an arduous, heart-wrenching, happy, sad, tragic, hopeful, glorious journey.  And the ending to the journey...breathtaking.There are those games that are fun, and you can play it and play it, but after you're done, you're done.  You don't remember anything significant, you don't feel any different, you just traded your time for entertainment.  Shadow Warrior is an experience that will change you.  It's one of those games that ten years from now you will crave it.  You will remember the feels and the incredible adventure that it put you through and it will always bring up the emotions thus evoked.I have a Steam filter labeled ""Gems.""  Of my 648 games that I own, I have 17 gems, this is one of them.  Buy it, play it, love it, recommend it.  Great games and good developers/publishers need our support in this video game era of annual production cycles, copy-paste games, and money-grabbing DLC.-Monstar			"

												Really fun, and a far better homage to the original Shadow Warrior than I was expecting it to be. If you're familiar with the Holy Trinity of Build Engine games (Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior, and Blood) then there's going to be a lot in this game that hits your nostalgia strings in all the right places. It ""gets it"" in all the ways Duke Nukem Forever didn't; the guys at Flying Wild Hog know what made those games fun. Levels are big, twisty, and covered in secrets and interactive bits. There's a strong attempt to avoid the ""boxes and corridors"" design aesthetic that mostly succeeds, and the game flows at a fairly languid pace (when not in combat) that encourages exploration and messing about with your surroundings, only pressing on when *you* feel like doing it, not because the game is herding you forward.When you do get into combat, everything gets fast paced and very spatially aware. You're expected to dance around and use the entire space you're given in order to play the game, not take cover and wait for enemies to pop up so you can shoot at them. There's zero attempt made at realism and the game is brilliantly playable for it, most evident in the fact that your primary -- and really, if you feel like it, ONLY -- weapon in the game is a katana. You do get guns, sure, but it's made evident early on that really you're mostly here to re-enact the House of Blue Leaves scene from Kill Bill vol. 1 and just hack stuff apart with gleeful abandon until it gets boring. Which it never does.There's also a host of RPG-lite upgrades you can purchase using a somewhat alarmingly involved upgrade system. Every weapon can be upgraded in several different ways, there's magic spells to obtain and upgrade as well, and there's an entire subsystem of passive upgrades that can either shore up your weaknesses, specialize in a specific area, or just give you generic boosts like upping your ammo count or increasing the amount of money you can find from pickups. It's a nice carrot to dangle on the end of the exploration stick, and the rewards trickle down at a pleasant pace as you play.Graphics are far better than they really have any right to be. Everything is done up in a kind of Magical-Realism Japan style. Style takes top billing over practicality, and you'll be a bit terrified at how ridiculously *expensive* all these nice house interiors you're splattering with blood look, but it fits great with the game's warped sense of reality and adds a vaguely surreal, Tarantino-film kind of lens filter to the whole thing. Voice acting is also surprisingly good, with Hoji the Wisecracking Spirit Guide winning as one of the more amusing smartass sidekick/plot mcguffin elements ever seen in a non-Nintendo game.This game also updates the parody and plot along with the graphics and gameplay but doesn't forget what made everything in the original work. The humor in the original was a lowbrow (but hilarious) sendup of asian wushu/action movie stereotypes. Kinda like the films it was making fun of though, the humor in the original seems painfully dated if you go back and play it today. It was one of those things you could get away with back in the day when it was originally made, but trying it these days would fall flat. Flying Wild Hog knew this, and the update modernizes the humor without sanitizing it. Lo Wang is still named Lo Wang, and he's still cocky as all hell (if anything it's even worse now), but he's gotten an age shift to about 40 years younger and about 3 orders of magnitude less offensively stereotyped in every single thing he says. The jokes about his name come almost entirely from himself, and even then there's relatively few of them (and they tend to be better written). Mostly it's the banter between Wang and Hoji that paints the game's humor, and their love/hate relationship works out a lot better than original Wang spouting off one-liners in a horrible accent to himself for the entirety of the original game. tl;dr Flying Wild Hog pulled it off, and made a Shadow Warrior game that looks and plays exactly like the original game had been released in 2013 instead of 1997. Worth the full-price money if you like first person action games, and especially if you played the original. Consider it a must-buy if it goes on sale.Oh right, forgot to mention: Everything explodes when you shoot it. EVERYTHING. Cars? Explode. Motorcycles? Explode. Lampposts? Explode. Neon signs? Explode, somehow. Arcade machines? Boom. Air conditioners? Will kill everything in a 100 foot radius if you sneeze on them funny. Wood stoves? Shoot fire, then explode. Little pots full of coals with no discernable combustion method except they're vaguely fire-related as a stage prop? ♥♥♥♥ it, they also explode. Why not.			"

												Shadow Warrior is a type of game that the grey and brown, hand holding first person shooter genre needs more of.  It wins major points right off the bat for having an actual health meter, multiple weapon inventory and a satisfying combat system with tons of level secrets.  It also has some wonderful snarky humor in it that will give some decent chuckles here and there, playing of course as Lo Wang, the wisecracking samurai badass.  It seems like a game from the heavens compared to what's out there nowadays, but it's not without faults.The game is pretty easy on normal mode.  Your katana, while being the most satisfying weapon in the game to use, it's also quite overpowered right out of the gate.  You soak tons of hits, you have an unlimited healing ability right after the tutorial stage and the RPG elements can make an already hard to kill player into an unstoppable death machine, making most of the defensive upgrades feel like you really don't need them.  Personally the only real parts I got stuck on was getting lost in a few levels, but after all the hand holding games are doing these days, it was kind of refreshing not to have the game treat me like an idiot, allowing me to get lost here and there and navigate my own way around.In a nutshell, the game is fun and satisfying, but a little too easy, so if you do buy the game, you might consider cranking the difficulty up.

												I bought this game on discount because it struck me as looking like fun.  At the time I hadn't known that it was developed by the same team that created Hard Reset (A stellar title).  This game shares the same design philosophy that Flying Wild Hog used for its other amazing game.  Shadow Warrior is great on a lot of levels.  Combat feels better than a run of the mill hack and slash or FPS in that tearing through enemies and ripping their corpses to ribbons never gets old.  I've blown up demons, torn them from stem to stern with my sword, and riddled them with bullets and it feels just as fresh as the first time doing so.  The game looks and sounds incredible as well.  The graphics are stunning when set to max and the soundtrack fits the game perfectly.  Not to mention the voice acting and characters are perfect for this sort of game.  So far I've played through a majority of the title and once complete I'll more than likely replay it on a higher difficulty; something I did with Hard Reset.  These guys make quality games and this is no exception.  Fun as hell.			"

												Okay I have to say, this was one of the most frustrating games I've played. First let me highlight the good bits:* Lots of humor, lots of swearing, totally doesn't take itself seriously. Shadow warrior makes fun of itself just as much as it makes fun of other games, and that's great. Lots of callbacks to pop culture and other games.* The boss fights are really, really cool and on a huge, epic scale, they're very reminiscent of the ""classic"" boss experience and it's fantastic.* Lots of variety in weapons.* Interesting level design.* The design and graphics, and the style, seem to work as long as you don't look too hard at any particular thing. Which you can't anyway because it's really fast paced and I like that.* SWORD COMBAT!!!! (there's no blocking but you kind of don't need to)* The little details, like chopping up demons into little bits after they're dead and seeing how the devs carefully managed to make the models separate in a realistic way with plenty of gore and blood, and I think that sort of thing is really fun.Okay. This is all my personal opinion, I've read lots of reviews and heaps of people did like it. My main, big big issue with this game is how annoying it was. It dragged on and on and on and kept making me repeat bits of the same level over and over, fighting the same enemies again and again. It's not fun when it's so repetitive! It felt like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ chore to keep playing but I really wanted to see the ending. You fight through a level only to find your path blocked and you need the key, so you go back, find it, go back towards the gate and whoops, there are the same enemies again. I felt myself asking every time I killed them all ""are we done yet?"" Apparently not because they come in identical waves and waves, and they throw more and more minibosses at you like they're regular enemies.It is not fun to make players do the same thing over and over again with very little variety. There are some enemies (particuarly the minibosses) that are really tricky to kill and apparently the devs' idea of fun is to toss you in a small room with multiple of these like ""here, try this!"" and when you win it's like ""okay, now do it again!"" It's so frustrating! And every now and then it's like they remembered, ""oh they haven't seen this particular enemy in a while, let's just like, flood an entire room with them, that's fun right?"" And it just gets boring after a while, and that boredom leads to frustration when it's so relentlessly repeated over and over.There were some really cool unique bits, and I was totally hooked from the very beginning, it was cheesy and hilarious but about halfway through I just felt like I was going through the motions. It really takes you out of the immersion and reminds you that you're pressing buttons on a keyboard and clicking a mouse over and over. I reckon the best kind of game lets you forget what you're doing and really engrosses you in the whole setting and story, but I didn't feel it here. Maybe if it were shorter, or if there were more variety, then it would have been totally terrific.			"

												Honestly, this is the game Duke Nukem Forever wanted to be. The one liners are coated with cheese, the gameplay is fast and the campaign is rather long. Using the katana is fun and viable even on the hardest difficulty. One of the better single player FPS games I've played in a long time.			"

												I don't recall the last time I've ever had so much fun on an SP only game. I want to start this review off by saying that the developers released a patch for the game to use DirectX11 and better support for 64-bit systems, about two years after it's release. These guys deserve your money.Now, like many fans of the old Shadow Warrior, I was a little worried because I heard about all the changes from the gameplay to Wang's character himself, but the game still does have some ""old-school"" elements. While the levels are much more linear than the original, exploring and going off trail is still worth it as there are many secrets to be found and the gameplay is still very fast, intense and immersive. You can still find hentai chicks bathing themselves and singing, and even find secrets taking you back to levels from the old-school Shadow Warrior.You're gonna use that katana a LOT. It's just so damn fun to use! Throughout the game, you'll be upgrading your katana and learning new attacks for it which will keep the sword feeling fresh. If you want to try out something new, in the pause menu you can change what kind of Katana you can use, including some laser/lightsaber thing and even the Excalibat from Rise of the Triad!The guns are a lot of fun to use as well and you'll be upgrading those too. It has some of the same weapons from the original, such as the demon heart, demon head, rocket launcher (which freakin' kicks♥♥♥♥♥in this game), Uzi's (and dual wielding of course), a tearing♥♥♥♥♥shotgun (which gets a 4-shot chamber just like the original) as well as some added ones like a sexy and powerful Revolver, a big crossbow that can be upgraded to detonate explosions at will, and more.Aside from weapons, you can also upgrade Wang himself and gain some other special powers that you will find out for yourself.And obviously, there's Lo Wang. Duke Nukem's bother from another mother. I don't think this was intended, but I like to think of this as Lo Wang when he was younger and how he became so wise and powerful. The way he shaves his head and gets tattoos later on in the game makes him look like the classic Wang we know, so that was pretty sweet too.Lo Wang is still an♥♥♥♥♥(he even claims to be in the game) and he's still full of awesome one-liners that you'll want to remember and use on people later on in real life because it's cliche. His voice acting is just great, from the cutscenes, to his trash-talking enemies, to his occasional scream from swinging the Katana so hard, to his screams and cursing when taking damage. It makes you feel like you're Wang almost. Oh yeah, the cutscenes. I'm never a fan of cutscenes, or even stories in video games in general, but I did not skip a single cutscene in this game. The story is solid and will suck you in! (the cutscenes are skippable if you don't want to watch them.) Lastly, the graphics in this game may be the best I've seen yet. The normals, bumpmaps and lighting in this game is insane, very impressed on how it keeps the framerate so fluid especially with hordes of enemies attacking you in these overwhelmingly beautiful worlds.There's so much I want to say, but so much that I don't want to spoil for you. You must try this game for yourself. If it means waiting for a sale, fine - but this game is worth more than it's usual $9.99 when it's 75% off (which is usually the discount it has). So if you want a modernized throwback of one of your favorite old-school games, grab this, you won't be disappointed. If you want a throwback to an old-school game that still keeps the old-school non-linear fast gameplay but with modern and pretty graphics, then grab Rise of the Triad. Wang is there too!			"

												More of a sequel to Hard Reset than Shadow Warrior, and it's all good.People who played Hard Reset might remember that the basic abilities you started with were stale, but by the end of the game you'd have expanded your arsenal to a wide variety of unique weaponry. Shadow Warrior wisely starts Lo Wang out with just about everything the player needs to have fun from the word GO and brings back the odd blend of monster kiting so that you can blow up environmental hazards, like cars, explosive barrels or electrified objects, to create a cascade of explosions and bloody chunks.Lo Wang is a big idiot, but that's what makes him fun. The dialogue is surprisingly casual and made me laugh plenty of times in the midst of the demonic invasion. The voice acting is great and his cluelessness and comic book fantasies are both endearing and hilarious. The end of the story took a tonal one-eighty that was too heavy handed after the casually kitchy tone, but it sure beat the utter cliffhanger that Hard Reset ended on and resolved the story of the vengeful spirit and constant companion, Hoji, and Lo Wang.Probably my favorite bits of dialogue were the set of whiny, pained lines tied to taking too much damage... A constant reminder that Lo Wang is still comedically human despite becoming his own original character.The game still has some similar UI pitfalls retained from Hard Reset by allowing the player to craft their game into a boring one... A quick recap on Hard Reset: You started out with practically nothing, and you were presented with an upgrade tree that could route the player into using very boring weaponry for a very long time if they didn't experiment with unlocking alternate-fire-modes that vastly changed the behavior of the weapons.There's an unintuitive paradox between picking what I think are important passives, and the immediate reward of unlocking the ability to use all the Sword Arts and Ki Powers. For example, FIND MORE MONEY is critical to feeding into your ability to unlock more fun weapon upgrades... Especially their ALTERNATE FIRE, which is tantamount to unlocking a new basic ability... Otherwise, you're left with a passively powered-up toolset that would probably get stale.All in all though, it's a fun game that has some odd quirks (Lo Wang can't swim, some checkpoints are poorly placed later in the game, and dashing off of a ledge can apply deadly fall damage).I spent my time dashing around hordes of demons to corral them up into the largest groups, jump in the middle and then cut them all down in the midst of an explosive firestorm.

The sales they have on it (right now it's 3.99!!!) are crazy, too.  If you like FPS at all, get it.  If you are a Japanophile, get it.  If you like the 80s.

												Is a series of first-person shooter video games that focuses on the exploits of a modern ninja warrior Lo Wang who fights through hordes of demons, in search of the Nobitsura Kage ninja sword. It was originally developed by 3D Realms and published by GT Interactive until Flying Wild Hog took over developing the franchise as well as Devolver Digital taking over to publish the franchise.The game itself is cool. The story is actually very good, I like it. The gameplay is awesome, and the graphics are okay, it's not like I wanted realistic graphics, but I've expected more, but the way the characters and the environment looks like, it's okay. 9/10			"

												Simply the best FPS shooter I have ever played... Awesome weapons, awesome enemies, awesome environments, awesome story/dialogues, awesome ending (you will be surprised). Go any buy it!I recommend playing this game on casual or normal difficulty for the first time... Mini-boss enemies (lieutenants) you will come accross during second half of the game are quite hard to kill even on these difficulties and you will be seeing them quite often.The only downside of this game is its engine/textures maybe? You gonna need pretty good GPU and CPU (probably both) to run this game smoothly with the best experience possible.... I mean you can run it pretty well even with low-end set up  (as I did) but there is something (don't know what it is) that makes you feel as if the game was not well optimized - even though you'll get this feeling only at certain spots in the game.Tip: Katana is not the best weapon in the game (not on higher difficulties that is) even though it is the coolest one... :DUpgraded Crossbow/Shotgun/Rocket launcher is a combo that can deal with anything anytime... Don't invest overly into pistol, fire launcher and SMG upgrades.			"

Summary Shadow Warrior is a action packed single player that offers the best katana gameplay I experienced. Wang is the protagonist, a bodyguard of Zilla Enterprises, looking to collect parts of a sword and assemble it to create a very powerful weapon. Unravel the mystery of the demons who are invading the human world. The sirens who protect the sword from the demons, and the guardians who protect the sword pieces from being gathered.HumorThe companion that follows you around is actually pretty amusing and the dynamic between him and Wang work well. Constantly making jabs at you throughout the game really adds humor that actually works with the game rather than against since it doesn’t feel out of place. An example of this is on chapter 12, you teleport into a new area, nearly fell off the mountain and lived by grasping onto a broken bridge. Wang: You suck!Wang: Do you enjoy dropping me like that?Companion: Just trying to land you in the air, it beats materializing a couple of feet undergroundWang: Your logic is soundWeaponsThe katana and powers are far more effective against enemies than guns except in some instances where having distance between you and a mini-boss is beneficial. Guns are mostly used for bosses even though they could be used for interesting combos to get a higher score during fights for more karma and better position in the leaderboard. I highly recommend using the crossbow, rocket launcher, and shotgun throughout the game.MovementBe constantly on the move or you are going to take quite a bit of damage. The game has enough enemy variations and threats to make you constantly have to be on the move to avoid being hit.The jumping in this game is pretty average which in case you're wondering means its bad. The dashing is far superior in this game which you will always use in combat since its far more effective for getting away from enemy attacks. The jumping I found was only useful when i used explosives near me to blow up groups of enemies i threw down when using the tiger skill. Overall movement in this game is a big step up from the previous game this engine was used for Hard Reset.Level DesignThe level design itself is not as complex as others would like however there are many areas to explore which rewards you with money. There are also secrets that have a retro graphic theme style to it which pays tribute to the game the remake is based on. The only issue I have with the level design itself is that certain maps have elements which can be incredibly annoying like the platforming level where you can fall if you are not precise about where you jump.EnemiesThe variety of enemies mixes up the gameplay and allows the player to come up with interesting ways to deal with multiple enemies at once or certain types that would otherwise kill you. What makes the enemies really stick out is their ability to rage. Their rage ability makes them go much faster and hit for more which means you need to either take them out fast or calm them down before they strike you down.  People tend to use the Divider of Heaven for most enemies seeing as how you can kill enemies in a row with its  piercing effects while being in constant movement. BossesThe bosses are towering impressive looking monsters of death with nice animations and environments that you fight them in. Ultimately the bosses feel boring as a result of their ability to regenerate armor back on the weakness spots exposed. It really becomes a chore to constantly take down the armor off bosses just to hit the crystal which has a iffy hitbox. DifficultyHeroic mode offered a great challenge of having to clear a whole level without dying once, or you would be reset to the start of that level. It was quite hard at times considering that the staircases could kill you if you dashed down them too fast. The chapter 12 was particularly bad since there were many gimmicks like limiting your vision and spamming tons of suicidal monsters to attempt to kill you while you were limited in movement since you were stuck on a train.ConclusionIf you are a fan of games that are like quake,painkiller,serious sam, look no further for another dose of crazy action just don't expect the bosses to be climatic...

												Shadow Warrior of a sample of 1997 was, in fact, Duke Nukem 3D clone (even from the same developers), but with east bias. The reckless guy by the name of Lo Wang ran on bamboo groves and turned off the heads to demons and the ninjia, flavoring action by grease jokes and using foul language with characteristic accent of the Japanese villain from the American fighters. All known stereotypes about Japan and even Duke were in passing derided. But to hearts of admirers game laid a way not only firm mood, but also opportunity heating soul of the true maniac to cut any turned-up enemy of the rolled. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours).			"

												What can I say? This game is pretty great. You’ve got a lighthearted protagonist, his wisecracking Demon sidekick, a badass sword, Jedi powers, and an arsenal of diverse weapons to combat all manner of demons and Yakuza types in various beautiful locations around this world and the demons’ realm. The swordplay is top notch, easily the best in a first person shooter outside of possibly Dark Messiah of Might and Magic. It’s really rewarding to run into a crowd of goons, dispatching a few with throwing stars before deftly detaching one guy’s head from his body while whirling about like a dervish.  Entrails fly, heads roll, dopamine is released, and fun is had. If you want a fast paced, funny single player FPS then pick this up.  "

												If you like killing with katanas, gore, the original doom or quake games or serious sam you might be enjoying this stylish game. You'll be frantically cutting limbs off, blasting demons with pistols or flame throwers, blowing up cars and explosive barrels while collecting keys or opening seals to access the next area. Tried and true fun formula. After each scene your character makes a lame joke which you may like or not. Game is pretty in details and you can smash books, vases or windows if you want. Like always there are a bunch of secret pickups and easter eggs. Also the story is neat for an all-out action game - you make speculations about the characters and want to know the plot.You can't really go wrong with this one. "

												Why should you buy Shadow Warrior?Two words: level design.I know that sounds like an odd reason, but for me it's the games greatest strength. Visit my profile page and go through my screenshots. The game is GORGEOUS.So what about the rest of the game? Well from a long time and avid player of the FPS genera, it's a mixed bag. I played the game twice all the way through. Once on ""normal"" difficulty and then again on ""insane"". On normal I used the Katana the entire time. That was probably stupid, but the melee combat felt extremely satisfying. The Ki powers were also a blast to use. That wore off about 8 hours into the game. Little did I know there's 8 more hours to grind through. I got that feeling of: ""Is this over yet?""Well after some consideration I felt like I should give the game another try. My inner achievement hunter had something to do with it too! :-)The second time I went with insane mode and used all the weapons. With the inclusion of the 1.5 optimization patch the game looked and ran better than ever. However, the weapons felt weak. Extremely weak. Even the bad♥♥♥♥♥looking quad barreled shotgun. Once I got my hands on the crossbow and the its chargeable shot upgrade, the game became cake. With fully upgraded healing powers and the one shot crossbow, yet again I got that feeling of boredom.So why am I recommending this game after calling it boring? Because it's like a really pretty bowl of oatmeal. There really isn't anything ""wrong"" with the game. It just middle of the road with a great number of sights to see.My main gripe with Shadow Warrior is it tries to please everyone at the same time. The attempt of fusing old school and new doesn't seem to work for me. The game contains the Bioshock ""Look everywhere for cash"" loot system. It also has RPG elements, unlockables, and a low assortment of opponent's to kill. My opinion is if you going to make a FPS, choose a school and stick with it.Pro's ++ Level Design + A huge range of environment's and aesthetics to enjoy! So many sights to behold! + Optimized + Looks great and runs really well!+ Characters + The chemistry between Low Wang and his demon friend is quite entertaining.+ Story + Easy to follow and keeps your interest.+ Arsenal + Large variety of weapons and powers to make combat interesting - for a time...+ Melee Combat + The Katana is really fun to play with!+ Secrets + A must for any FPS.+ EX Mode + Allows you to keep all your upgrades after you beat the game.Con's - - Enemies - Offers a limited amount of baddies to slay.- Unbalanced Weapons - On the highest difficulty some of the weapons are pretty weak.- Loot - If you want your weapons to have additional features, you better look EVERYWHERE for cash.- Game Length - Game progression is entirely ""gated"". Everything is locked until you kill each wave of enemies.Shadow Warrior goes on sale frequently at 75% off. Well worth it at that price. If your playing for the first time, play the game on either easy or normal. Don't do what I did, use all the weapon's in the game!			"

												This is easily the greatest shooter I've played this year and I don't mean that ligthly since this year was amazing for shooters. First there was the wonderful homage to the 80s known as Blood Dragon and then there was the very faithful Rise of the Triad reboot, but Shadow Warrior rose above even those great games. As a HUGE fan of the original 3D Realms classic, this new Shadow Warrior filled me with so much delight. Never before has melee combat been more satisfying in a FPS. The guns were badass, but the real star of the show was your trusty blade. Shadow Warrior rose the bar (or katana) when it comes to getting close and personal. The katana is just so incredibly fun to use. I was even suprised by this game's story in how it actually managed to grab me. I was expecting some kind of silly excuse plot which is par for the course for retro style shooters, but Shadow Warrior actually had a very well-told story that made me care for what was happening. Instead of just having a reason to kill some demons you've got this wonderful tale that's both tragic and beautiful. Instead of just being a walking sterotype, Lo Wang this time around is an actual character. During the course of his adventure he develops and goes through a character arc. He's both witty and badass. Also there's his demon friend Hoji. Hoji was just wonderful. This new Shadow Warrior not only manages to do the original justice, but might actually be superior to it. Much thanks to Flying Wild Hog for delivering this amazing game. I'm really looking forward to seeing what else they deliver in the future, Whether it be more Shadow Warrior or something else. They're defintely on my list of favorite developers.Last thing I'd like to mention is the game's satisfying length.  The game is a nice solid 14 hours long and has a lot of replay value. The RPG-style upgrade system makes for a lot of replay value.			"

 ""Who wants some Wang?""Shadow Warrior is a first-person shooter video game developed by Flying Wild Hog and published by Devolver Digital. It is a Reboot of the old Shadow Warrior that was released back in 1997.  Lo Wang's Bizarre Adventure	The story is simple and straightforward, You play as Lo Wang, A Modern Assassin who works for a powerful guy named Zilla. Lo Wang is sent to purchase a legendary Katana, The Nobitsura Kage, From a guy who collects Japanese antiques called Miziyaki. Unfortunately, Miziyaki refuse's the offer, So the only choice Lo Wang had was trying to take the sword by force, Everything goes wrong and Demons from Hell has invaded The Earth. Join Lo Wang's adventure as he tries to claim The Nobitsura Kage and save mankind! Gameplay This is an old-school shooter, It's amazing and It's very Challenging, The Katana action is great, And there are a lot of Skills and Powers that you can obtain. The weapon upgrades are really useful. It's a solid old-school shooter. The easter eggs are also a nice touch to the game. Graphics Superb, Fantastic level design, Runs very smooth and really great visuals. Soundtrack Krzysztof Wierzynkiewicz, Michal Cielecki and Adam Skorupa did an astonishing job with the soundtrack, It really fits the game. VERDICT This is a hidden gem, I enjoyed this game and I recommend it. A very solid FPS.8.7 out of 10.PS. Lo Wang's cheesy quotes are really hilarious.			"

												In 1997, Shadow Warrior released for PC as a spiritual successor to Duke Nukem 3D, and starred a terribly racist Asian caricature named Lo Wang. This isn’t a premise that sounds like it would be able to endure nearly twenty years later, and yet developer Flying Wild Hog revived Shadow Warrior last year on the PC, which has now made its way to the Xbox One and PS4. Lo Wang’s return is a successful one, with all of the purposely-offensive humor and over-the-top gameplay you’d expect from it.Amazingly, Shadow Warrior’s plot is not to be overlooked, as it is engaging and becomes more serious and grounded as the game goes on. This is tempered by the silly combat and hilarious dialogue throughout the game. The player takes on the role of Lo Wang, a gun-toting, sword-wielding, ninja mercenary working for the mysterious Orochi Zilla, a powerful Japanese businessman. What starts off as a routine mafia transaction quickly spirals out of control into a demon-filled murderfest wherein Lo Wang uses his last name to reference his♥♥♥♥♥♥on a regular basis. Accompanying Wang is the smart-mouthed demon Hoji, who serves as Lo Wang’s guide through the world of pseudo-Japanese culture and mysticism. The plot works perfectly with the insane gameplay and general silliness that Shadow Warrior provides.The combat in Shadow Warrior can be described as fast, bloody, and insane. The player is given ninja stars, a samurai sword, and a lot of guns to blast through hordes of ninjas, police officers and demons in one of the messiest first-person hack-and-slash experiences I’ve ever played. The guns can be a little difficult to use, as the aiming system can be a little unwieldy and some guns feel underpowered, but the swordplay is a lot of fun and is intended to be Wang’s tool of destruction for the majority of the time.Lo Wang also gains magical abilities to aid him, which include healing spells and telekinetic push abilities. My personal favorite is an ability that allows Wang to spin in a whirlwind attack that decapitates everyone around him. These abilities help to round out the combat and give players a multitude of ways to go about any given combat scenario, although I was mostly content just slashing enemies to bits.Lo Wang has many upgrade opportunities at his disposal as well, which are cleverly broken into different categories that can be upgraded by different means. Karma, for example, will allow the player to purchase certain modifiers, while money allows the player to upgrade their equipment. The options for how the player can evolve and upgrade Wang are pretty vast, meaning that the each person can upgrade according to their play style. I like to run in swinging a sword, so I need to be able to take a lot of damage, so I upgraded healing spells, damage resistant perks, and maximum health modifiers. This upgrade system can be a little complicated, but is well-worth taking the time to learn, as it’ll make Lo Wang an even bigger badass according to each player’s personal style.Shadow Warrior looks great on the Xbox One, for the most part. Slicing a demon into multiple pieces has never felt more rewarding, but some elements, like human characters are low-res and a bit fuzzy. The sound, however, is great. The music is fast-paced and has an Eastern flair to it, and the sound effects are top-notch. The voice acting is also surprisingly good, especially from Wang’s sidekick Hoji who helps out with a lot of the exposition and banter.The combat is awesome, the dialogue is hilarious, and the excessive gore is a guilty pleasure that never gets old. Shadow Warrior is one of those games that reminds us that gaming, at its core, should be fun, and it delivers fun times in a big way.			"

This is a game I'd been meaning to get my hands on for a long, long time now, and the wait has definitely paid off. Shadow Warrior is a game that was revamped from its original 1997 counterpart (which you may download for free on Steam) featuring the main protagonist, Lo Wang, and was originally produced to test improvements on the same game engine used to create Duke Nukem; this game shares the same studio that created Duke Nukem. This game takes a slightly different turn of events from the original, in which Wang takes on demons that are pouring in through portals while trying to retrieve the Nobitsura Kage: an ancient katana of immense power that can be used to strike down Gods. Lo Wang is aided by a masked demon named Hoji, who also requires this ancient katana.There are several points of interest in this game:The Upgrade Systems - There are several things in which you can upgrade, and several subcatagories within each. The upgrade system is pretty immerse, as you have several versions of currency to go into each; for instance, Money is used to upgrade your Weapons, while Karma Points are used to Upgrade your Skills. Within this upgrade system-which, unlike most games, doesn't make you feel under-powered if you 'specked yourself wrong'-allows the player to create the way they want to play. This menu can be accessed any time, so feel free to pour all your points into a needed skill during a boss battle!Swordplay - At first, you gain the basic abilities of quick slices (LMB) a charged heavy strike (hold RMB.) However, as you purchase upgrades through the menu, you gain more combinations and bonuses. Most of the combos you learn involve double-tapping a direction key and holding LMB (for instance, a jabbing strike that is later used to break specific statues is mapped as W,W+LMB) on the keyboard, but I have not yet tried it for controller. Also, you can throw shurikens (which are unlimited in amount) while wielding the katana so that the enemy can feel the pain before arriving to your blade.Gunplay - Since Wang moves really quick-as do the enemies in this game-the gunplay is very reminiscent of a classic shooter, which involves a lot of strafing. However, you may hold as many weapons as you want. and each one has such an interesting and unique playstyle that I will guarantee you Will revisit weapons you thought were outdated due to a new pickup. Plus, you receive weapons as somewhat of a store theme; for instance, you pick up a submach that was just sitting in a police car.Humor - Think Duke Nukem in this one, except without Jon St. John's voice-acting and an Asian themed character that blatantly points out his name is Wang. Though childish at times, the humor in this game is...well....funny.Story - I really do not want to post up too many spoilers on this one, but the story in Shadow Warrior is actually pretty good, which decent backing to the original.Graphics & Gore - Though my computer can only do so much due to its 'graphical hindrances,' I was not able to fully appreciate the full potential of this title when it comes to the looks while trying to play it smoothly; that is not to say that I didn't crank up the graphics for a brief time to enjoy the beautiful rendering of this hardcore world. Everything in the world (though it launches you in a single direction at times) looks great, from the trees, to the bamboo, to the creature designs. Also, this game is clearly not for kids due to the amount of gore, and is believed by some to be the bloodiest game of all time due to this. However, if you press 'R' while wielding your Katana you can wipe the blood off, so there's a bright side to these grim features.TL:DR -There are so many other things I'd like to recommend about Shadow Warrior, but you should honestly just play it for yourself. I bought it with a bundle from another site for $10 and regret nothing. Shadow Warrior is a great game, with some of the most interesting mechanics you will ever find in a title. Do not think about Duke Nukem Forever if considering the purchase of this title, because this reboot does right by nearly everything. Thanks for reading.Do you enjoy these reviews?

""Would you like cake or death? I should probably mention we are out of cake.""The game has only 2 cons, so I mention them first:- Ugly shiny liquids (like blood or green goo). Look like plastic.- Levels get longer towards the end of the game for no good reason. Become repetitive and kinda boring.Pros:+ Funniest main character one-liners of the last decade.+ Fantastic katana action (you'll love it even if you're a gun ho)+ Oldschool secrets with oldschool graphics+ Half-Life parody train+ Gun and skill upgrades+ Hardcore boss fights+ NO b*llsh*t health regen and cover system+ Fortune cookies filled with quotes of all-time universal wisdomIf you for some tragic reason missed this game - go get it. Now. ""The Wang abides.""			"

												I came to Shadow Warrior with no knowledge of the original, buying it purely because it's made by Flying Wild Hog who made one of my fave shooters, Hard Reset. And they've done it again. Shadow Warrior is a visually excellent first-person shooter that encourages you to utilise all the various skills at your disposal. Swordplay, shurikens, and magical attacks and defences as well as the usual arsenal of impressive guns. Take it from a fat-fingered gamer, the combat is elegant and easy to use. As other reviewers have noted, the voice acting is of a decent standard, with humour that is often crude but (most of the time) manages to avoid immaturity. Cutscenes are short and can be skipped if you're impatient, and there is excellent replay value in the form of EX Mode, which means you can replay the game with all the upgrades and weapons you earned in the first playthrough. And trust me, you will want to play it again. Once will not be enough.			"

												I recommend this game to anyone who's tired of modern shooters. It takes a step back towards the golden age of FPS when its predecessor was released. It doesn't take itself too seriously which I found refreshing and it's packed with immature humour and one-liners that make you giggle every time you hear them. In contrast it is also unbelievably bloody at times which mature gamers might appreciate. The levels are still mostly linear but they are rarely interrupted by scripted events and cutscenes. Level variety is good and the environments are gorgeous. Enemy and weapon variety is average but the game has a nice melee combat system and you'll probably end up using the sword more than any other weapon. The graphics are solid and work really well with the overall design. The story is what you'd expect from a shooter but it doesn't disappoint. The price is also quite reasonable considering the length of the game. I'd recommend getting it even at full price but if you're patient you might want to wait. It seems to go on sale fairly regularly.			"

												Level design is in the Painkiller or Serious Sam style instead of the original Shadow Warrior or Duke Nukem 3D's. So you're locked in arenas with waves of enemies instead of having freedom to explore and approach situations as you see fit. It can be ok in the right mood when you want to slice and dice a few enemies with your katana, but I expected much, much more from a Shadow Warrior reboot.			"

Posted: July 10, 2016
												Almost brilliant.Shadow Warrior is, of course, a remake of the 1997 3D Realms shooter, and after doing their 90s-styled shooter, Hard Reset, Flying Wild Hog was a natural pick for the task. And at its heart, Shadow Warrior does the most important part best, presenting first-person katana antics well. You can unlock different moves, each with a double-tap and a left-or-right click, that allow you to do spin attacks, wave attacks, or just do more damage. In addition, you can unlock various spells that can stun your enemies, heal you, or put up a shield. And when you're using all that to slice through hordes of soft, squishy enemies is where Shadow Warrior finds itself most satisifying. There are various guns, and though effective, they don't feel nearly as satisfying as applying your blade. Still, mixing up the two can be fun and this game has you constantly switching gears.A fact the game doesn't really point out but that you need to know, and badly: tapping shift while holding a direction does a quick dash in that direction. Crucial, but if was in the opening tips, I missed it.It really does the feel of a 90s shooter well with innovation on the side, blood gushing from delimbed enemies with no guilt or introspection, just more enemies to cut down. But it does have notable issues. Switching between special moves and quick-dashes cramped my hand badly. Maybe it works better with a controller, but to me the controls were a literal handache, something I don't feel often. Furthermore, it throws a lot of what I term ""stop sign"" enemies - enemies with shields, enemies with a weak spot in their back, enemies who teleport in and out, enemies that turn invisible,  bosses with weak spots to reveal - and those aren't very fun. Though you've given the tools, it constantly feels like having to unlock doors to have my sword fun. ""Okay, yeah, I'll launch you in the air, now can I kill you?"" ""Can you reappear so I can kill you?"" The bosses in particular become exercises in tedium - I can excuse having to repeat a process three times (Zelda, for its many weaknesses, taught games this golden number), but having to do it 4-8 times is no good. The game overall is longer than it probably should be, having shown its hand by about 2/3rds of the way through the game and then just pretty much serving up the same fights, but with increasing numbers of big guys as you get towards the end. Having the middle of the game be a slog through grey industrial environments doesn't help it feel any shorter, either.That being said, it does bring a lot of new elements to the shooter genre. At times I almost wish it had been more of a third-person brawler akin to a Platinum game, but it does do the melee work aptly and throwing a wave of murderous chi energy through a wave of onrushing enemies and seeing multiple decapitations go flying doesn't stop being satisfying. The story is serviceable, but the length of the game meant I had trouble keeping track of who certain characters were or where the plot was when it stopped after hours of play to barf up a story animation. Thankfully, though, it avoids a lot of the Orientalist racism of its forbear. While it doesn't avoid it entirely - the ""Wang"" jokes certainly seem here to stay, and the mythology seems to be a confused mashup of Japanese and Chinese elements - it works internally and there was only a few throwaway jokes that got a cringe out of me. Speaking of which, the humor is pretty hit or miss, with the fortune cookie gags serving up the worst of the misses. The game is best when it's just wryly sarcastic, and Lo Wang thankfully ends up being a pretty likeable guy whose identity isn't just solely hung on ""Asian"".Overall, it's worth a playthrough if you want a strong hit of nostalgia, or if you really liked Serious Sam, Painkiller, and their ilk. While it doesn't quite transcend its roots, it translates them well into the modern era and does enough that's innovative to be worth a whirl - just bear in mind it's very much a diamond in the rough.

												Sometimes every now and then a game comes along that surprises you - renewing faith in a genre and reminding you exactly why you liked it in the first place.With expectations low thanks to the prolific consolization and emphasis on creating cinematic experiences to the detriment of the game-play, Shadow Warrior benefits greatly from being a game that understands, first and foremost, a first person shooter is about combat.A reboot of the 1997 game of the same name, aside from a few references, it's decidedly different style shooter. While the original had no story to speak of, with protagonist Low Wang, much in same vain as Duke Nukem acting as a pop culture spouting archetypes of 80's and early 90's action heroes, Lo Wang in the reboot, while retaining much of this is more fleshed out by virtue of having a personality - and a sense of purpose.The story motivation itself is relatively simple. Low Wang must recover several blade parts, while a mystical story of demons from another realm unravels around it. Comparative to another FPS revival such as the New Order, with continual interruptions to game-play, long monotonous mumbling of self-important up it's own♥♥♥♥♥♥nonsense, Shadow Warriors story-telling never feels like it's a detriment to the gameplay or taking itself too seriously, remaining concise with an appropriate tonal shift towards the end the game - that sort of becomes poetic, without being Bioshock Infinite levels of pretentious, it's surprisingly moving considering the game is about a man who repeatedly makes♥♥♥♥♥♥jokes.The story is there, if you want it - never over stepping the mark into obnoxious.Much like Kurt Russell in Big Trouble In little China, (which was a clear inspiration for the first game), Low Wang is a goof, a legend in his own mind while paradoxically tripping over himself on a continued basis. An avid collectors of comic books, at one point the player will enter his weapon laden Batman cave, as he shaves his head in a self aware reference of the alpha male figures he aspires towards - it's both a reverential acknowledgment to the genres influence, while directly relating to the player, who probably isn't the coolest dude in the world.Expecting old school shooting may lead to a huge disappointment for fans of the original, gone are maze like levels, replaced by Painkiller style arena battles. While old school elements are retained, such as rewarding exploration, simultaneously carrying a multitude of weapons, item pickup's in the form of health and armor and minimum plot, it carried over elements from Flying Wild Hogs previous game, while expanding upon it with action RPG elements - in many ways, it shares more in common with a game like Diablo or Devil May Cry than the original Shadow Warrior.Essentially, player enters area, kills creatures, progresses, rinse and repeat.This may sound repetitive, and towards the end of the game it can be - much like Diablo it's alleviated with a constant stream of crums in the form of upgrades, new enemies and sporadic bursts of narrative as well a changes of scenery to give the player just enough momentum to continue playing.It doesn't seem hyperbole, to call the combat, sublime. On the lower difficult, spamming a few shots, or a few sword swings will quickly led to redundancy. On the higher ""insane"" difficulty, the context changes entirely.In a similar games like Serous Sam - it uses huge environments with much of the combat at a distance, when enemies reach the player, it's almost entirely a case of pushing the backward key with largely inept weapons, Shadow Warrior on the other hand uses tighter environments to minimize downtime - implementing a dodge keys to make any direction viable, encouraging the player not to retreat but to actively move around mitigating crowds using their head on the fly. Very rarely will the player be still, or monotonously pushing the backward key, even healing itself can be done while going on the offensive, simultaneously shooting at the same or upgrading KI attacks to act as direct healing - respectfully limited .Much like Kurt Russell in Big Trouble In little China, (which was a clear inspiration for the first game), Low Wang is a goof, a legend in his own mind while paradoxically tripping over himself on a continued basis. An avid collectors of comic books, at one point the player will enter his weapon laden Batman cave, as he shaves his head in a self aware reference of the alpha male figures he aspires towards - it's both a reverential acknowledgment to the genres influence, while directly relating to the player, who probably isn't the coolest dude in the world.Expecting old school shooting may lead to a huge disappointment for fans of the original, gone are maze like levels, replaced by Painkiller style arena battles.

Great!			"

												The keyword to describe this game is ""Love"". I couldn't tell you where exactly the love is going towards, be it the old Shadow Warrior, the old shooter genre in general, martial art action/drama films, Eastern pop fiction or just good game development practice. But one thing is certain: this has got to be one of the most surprisingly high quality games I've ever encountered. While initially excited about Shadow Warrior making a comeback, I had my doubts about this game, I had thought that Devolver was going to try and ride on the success it was getting with Croteam's Serious Sam 3 and milk games of similar genre for all its worth in the style of Activision's usual workings, and after playing Hard Reset I had once thought Flying Wild Hog a group similar to The Farm 51 in that they were a studio no longer in the glory days of People Can Fly, and while trying their hardest weren't quite yet at that standard of quality people like me would be paying attention to.I was wrong. I was wrong on every front. Not only has Devolver proved me wrong and established its a publisher willing to put time and money into a product as absurd and obscure as Shadow Warrior, but Flying Wild Hog has also proven to me that they were the studio that cleary are the best of the people that fled People Can Fly, and have managed to take an old magic to soaring new heights.This game is something of a small miracle; its the video game equivilant of The Lego Movie. It is baffling just how polished and sophisticated this game's mechanics are. The sword combat is sharp and absolutely sublime, so much that it feels alien, like it should belong in another genre, in a game that would play like Devil May Cry or something from the works of Platinum Games. The moves and powers you can pull off with the sword are visercal and satisfying, and enemies will dismember like paper mache origami made from blood and internals. The guns meanwhile feel like the best parts of Painkiller and Bulletstorm with the visercal satisfaction of the former and the stragetic rewarding of the latter. There's no gun that's a giant stakegun or a weapon that'll let you steer sniper rounds up the taints of enemies, but there's a gun that'll shoot high-velocity, explosive crossbow bolts, and baby, I couldn't ask for anything more delightfully enjoyable.And its all because of that keyword: love. There was no reason this game should have been this good, or even good at all, but because of the love from a small American publisher and an even smaller Polish developer, this game has hit completely out of the park in every possible way.I cannot stress this enough: you need to try this game. Its a perfect 10/10, and its forever put Devolver and Flying Wild Hog on my radar.			"

												Much like the new Wolfenstein games, Shadow Warrior is a modern reimagining of older FPS games (with health/armor pick ups and non-regenerating health. You play as Lo Wang, a master of the katana and dirty jokes. After a business transaction goes awry, a demon apocalypse ensues. Pros:+Great melee combat. With all of the different special katana moves, it feels like playing a fighting game. +Good variety of weapons and upgrades. +Hoji and Lo Wang have some hilarious dialogue. +Levels are pretty big and have a lot of secrets hidden within them (such as extra currency for upgrading your weapons/skills/powers).+The power/skills system is pretty in depth. You can unlock different abilities, such as the ability to trap enemies or heal yourself.+Good variety of enemies. +The animated story scenes are awesome.Cons:-Game feels like a shooting gallery. Complete a task and enemies spawn. Rinse and repeat. I know this is a homage to older games that threw tons of enemies at you, but this formula just gets old. I never felt this way in the new Wolfenstein games.-The boss fights. All of them except for one play out the exact same way. Shoot a weak point in the armor until they are crippled. Then you shoot the exposed weak point to damage it. Rinse and repeat. I wasn't expecting Dark Souls-caliber boss fights, but I wish they would have been more varied than this. -The level where you have to wear the gas mask is terrible (it obscures your vision). Overall, Shadow Warrior is a fun FPS. It has some rough edges, but the pros definitely outweigh the cons.			"

												Started out strong: funny protagonist, the awesome recoiless submachine gun, big chunky enemies for you to pump your lead into, and last but not least, wang cookies.And then midway through the game, you will find that the game's initial charms start to wear off. The game never deviates from its initial path: the same 'wang' jokes are told time and again, the new jokes err more on the side of cringe-worthy instead of funny. The cool weapons become underpowered as the game starts to pile more and more fatties at you at any single point in time. The level design is dreadfully uninspired and boring. You run from point to point triggering the game's setpieces in order to spawn the various over-used enemies which the game throws at you in every chapter. In between the points, you will almost never find any enemies lurking or patrolling. The katana is the game's saving point, severing limbs and decapitating heads never gets old. However, the hit boxes for the larger sized enemies are a little wonky, so you might find yourself supposedly slashing at the back of the bugger, only to be disappointed that none of the hits registered. Final rating: 4/10 "

Devolver Digital needs to get the Blood and Duke IP's so they can make a remake of Blood and an actual Duke Nukem 3D sequel.Melee combat is absolutely awesome to use. Mixture of double presses of the w a s d keys and left and right clicks. It feels fluid and is tight and responsive.Guns are just as fun too, and you can upgrade every single thing you come across throughout the game.The story is nothing special, but they actually did real well with it. Don't wanna spoil anything, but it revolves around Lo Wang attempting to stop evil (obviously).Rise of the Triad and Shadow Warrior are perhaps the BEST ""modern"" FPS games I have played in around a good six years.BUY SHADOW WARRIOR NOW AND GET SOME WANG.

												This game is simply wangtastic! Seriously though, this is one of the best FPS I've ever played. It has fantastic visuals, awesome gameplay, funny dialogue and a surprisingly good story. I specially have to mention the katana. Oh my, the katana in this game is awesome. It actually feels like a katana instead of a stick. You can cut your enemies into pieces with it. It is so satisfying and never got boring for me. I've finished the game 3 times and 2 of them were katana-only.I strongly recommend giving this game a go, specially considering it has been ridiculously discounted many times.

												This game kicks♥♥♥♥♥ I was actually surprised how much♥♥♥♥♥it kicks. The combat mixes up those traditional elements of first person shooters to weave in the sword seamlessly, and when you play on harder difficulties, you really are going to be using every tool on your belt. On top of the sharp combat, it's got witty dialog and a pretty engaging plot, not to mention a fantastic choice of characters. Possibly my favorite aspect is the sheer number of secrets nestled cleverly in the game. If I had to be critical, the combat can get a bit grindy toward the end, and I do kind of wish some of the weapons were more creative  (like flamethrower? Really?). Still, for the price, this game is a steal. It's a pretty long game, and looks beautiful, so don't pass this one up.			"

												Let's compare 3 FPS games with their reboot, remake, spiritual successor, pseudo-sequel or whatever you'd like to call them.First there was Duke Nukem 3D, which led to Duke Nukem Forever, which took forever to be released. Somewhat a failure and received widespread panning.And then there's the classic Doom, which led to the new DOOM (2016) released recently. Not bad, but plays entirely differently from the FPS pioneer.Now look at Shadow Warrior, which claims to be a, say, ""re-imagination"" of the classic Shadow Warrior. However, it is not much different than Duke Nukem Forever or DOOM (2016). See, by ""re-imagination"" it always means better graphics, more interesting gameplay mechanics and etc., but you have to remember, if you're expecting the same experience as the classic version of the game, you will not get it.But that does not mean it's not a good game. It's a great game, in fact it's great if you had never played the original classic Shadow Warrior. You'll just have some difficulties adjusting to the new mechanics if you are playing this because you played the original.Did I also mention there were not many games in the market where you can graphically dismember demons? ""Were"", because that was before DOOM (2016) came out.SW/10.			"

												Well, I finally finished this one.  Shadow Warrior is f**king great. <walks off stage>---Okay, fine... Shadow Warrior is the reboot of Duke Nukem 3D's companion game, Shadow Warrior, a Build Engine FPS from the Doom-clone era of shooters.  This game was overlooked back in its time with Quake literally rendering 2.5D engines outdated and only Duke Nukem survived to become a fan favorite, but as Gearbox bought the rights to Duke Nukem and sold it out for Borderlands 2 funds, it seems that the tides have turned with Shadow Warrior coming out on top.Lo Wang is as stereotypical as it gets.  While it may be quite toned down in comparison to the BuildEngine classic, Wang is a parody of Eastern films and action flicks alike, with a sword and ego to match.  As an origins story and precursor to the original, this game also introduces a mix of Chinese and Japanese mythos, and with it a companion character that grants you magic powers.  This undead character also happens to be a snark, and the dialogue between the two characters is priceless.The combat features 7 guns with upgrades, 2 consumable weapons, 1 badass katana with three combos and two swing types, and 4 magic powers, as well as a shuriken or quick-stab key.  As many of the guns have alternate fires and the sword or magic powers can be used in your left hand with any gun, there's plenty of room for diversity.  The enemies themselves range from wallrunning to tankish, exactly as you should see, and the combat keeps fresh for the duration of the game.  Every aspect of the game is incredibly well thought out and the game never feels artificially difficult.As a retro shooter, there are also countless secrets and easter eggs throughout the levels, including fortune cookies that generally read out to something incredibly immature or stereotypical in proper 3DRealms fashion.  These give you progression points for your magic powers, extra perks, or even just money to upgrade weapons.  By the end of the game, you'll most likely have a good 70% of the weapon upgrades and will be missing around nine power/perks, assuming you aren't a completionist whp needs to find every single secret before being satisfied.  It plays very similarly to Hard Reset, minus the strange machine interfaces.As for the story, it's very well-written, though a bit hard to follow, especially with the sub-plot of Hoji's relatives and the Whisperers' memories.  It's definitely worth listening into, but you're not looking into Dark Souls levels of deep lore.  The story is also very well-acted and full of dark but silly over-the-top action.  FWH nailed the 3DRealms style of this game in every way.  It'll take you about 13-15 hours to complete on average; a replay may be closer to 11-12, but a worst-case scenario with loads of screwups will probably be around 14-17 should you get horribly lost.  It doesn't happen often, but occasionally the placement of the door seals combined with some areas' mazelike design can get annoying.Overall, there are certainly flaws you can nitpick out of the game, but what's important is that it's a fantastic game that definitely is worth a look.  It's like a retro shooter the way you wish you remembered them, and doesn't disappoint in the slightest.  There isn't too much for replay value-- singleplayer with survival and new-game+-- but the main campaign is great enough to justify the price of admission alone.  Devolver is a great publisher and often has excellent sales on this game, but I wouldn't wait that long, especially with Shadow Warrior 2 coming soon.			"

												Shadow Warrior is as much a 90's throwback as it is a modern game, and the hybrid of styles results in an immensely fun experience!Wang’s story takes a backseat to the action for the majority of the game but is still interesting enough to keep you moving along. You start off on a quest to obtain a piece of a rare sword, which eventually escalates into an all-out war between the demon and human worlds. Early on you obtain a companion in the form of a demonic spirit named Hoji who provides some great humor and exposition during the slower parts of the game. The gameplay is exactly what you hope for in a retro remake like this. You have a nice (and upgradable) health bar and can heal up with health packs and armor pickups. You won’t find yourself hiding behind a dumpster waiting for regen after taking three hits in this game! The weapons feel equally awesome, from your trusty and versatile katana to the classic rocket launcher, they all feel like they pack a nice punch and give good feedback when used. The weapons also include a very nice upgrade system that does a lot more than just add more damage or ammo to your clip. Want your shotgun to have 4 barrels? How about upgrading your rocket launcher to fire three rockets at once, or a crossbow with explosive bolts? Done, done and done!On top of your equipment, you will obtain passive and active skills to further customize your experience. The skills are a lifesaver in the more intense areas of the game, with the ability to heal on the fly, or knockback a group of enemies; and the passive abilities such as more health or improved critical rate help you to feel progressively stronger as the game gets tougher.At the end of the day, Shadow Warrior scratches that itch of being powerful in an FPS while fighting equally powerful enemies. You won’t be taking cover, you won’t be playing wack-a-mole with enemies who are also in cover, and I wouldn’t want this game to play any other way! "

												Shadow Warrior is one hell of a good Single Player game! The plot: You (a high ranked... assassin-type of guy) have the mission to find a sword. You find it, bring it to your boss, and suddenly hell brakes loose. Demons, skeletons, mafia [...] there are countless enemies to fight. The story develops very nicely and keeps you entertained - not only because of the sarcastic spirit that is following you around. You will want to know what happens next after each chapter! The gameplay is more or less always the same. Different areas, different enemies, different ways to beat them. But, your arsenal of skills and weapons, plus the various enviromental extras do make each fight different. It kept me entertained for 10 hours straight! (excluded sleeping pause). By defeating enemies you will be able to learn new skills, upgrade existing ones, upgrade weapons and buy bonuses such as extra money, the ability to pick up specific demon heads as weapons etc. There were only 2 level were i felt annoyed, but that was only because they were incredibly long and had repetetive fights. Overall the gameplay is very good! Music & graphics are nice as well, i didn't have any complaints whatsoever.  After completing the game you will be offered to restart with all your existing upgrades - a good thing, but it also has a downside. You will have to play the game again. Which is, at least for me, a nono right now, because i do not think i would enjoy slaughtering all those demons again, just for the sake of completing all achievements. Overall? Recommended! It is a very fun fps shooter / sword fighting game that can keep you very busy. The countless secrets and various easter eggs just add to the fun. Beware the bunny of doom.			"

												This game seduced me first because of katana (one of my favorite weapons for melee in L4D2, Killing Floor, Hotline Miami, etc etc.). Then I fell in love with the asian settings. And that game got me in the core with the katana again. Because hey, I'm bad with melee weapons and yet, with Shadow Warrior, I'm mastering the art of slicing demons. Shadow Warrior is a sort of remake of Shadow Warrior... the 90's game, that was a FPS with ninja weapons and demons or aliens or I never identified the race of the enemies. Here, in the remake, it's clearly creatures from the Asian mythology, from the other world.Lo Wang, the hero, is somewhat macho, very sure of himself and very dedicated to his task. He acquires some powers and he has companion, Hoji, whose story is revealed during the game.Like I've said, it's the first time that I feel great with melee. While Lo Wang has nice guns (necessary when you're swarmed by enemies), the katana is still very useful and deadly.Shadow Warrior is a very good game.... and could have been perfect if it didn't feel like an arena game. You can't advance in the story if you don't clean the area. And after a moment, seeing always the same is kinda irritating. Some passages are really hard even in the easiest difficulty. Yet, you find yourself wanting to push through.And Shadow Warrior kept his humour. I played the Shadow Warrior Classic Redux and the original version and that remake is keeping the tradition of fortune cookies with silly sentences. And the rabbits are also there. And the anime girls too.The graphics are beautiful. Some landscapes are really good. Besides, they're diversified: from Zilla fortress to his docks to the other world to the city...I loved the soundtrack. I really enjoyed it.I recommend that game. You have to try it.			"

												Im not going to re-write what everyone else has already written. In short its awesome. Heres few reasons why---More Fun than Doom 2016...(Yes Really)-Better First Person Melee than Skyrim (ok thats not that hard to do, but still I got this game on sale for like 10 bucks, so what does this say about Bethesda?)-Cool Looking Weapons. You can tell that time was really taken to make each weapon really nice looking.-Great Gore, and damage location recognition/reactions from the AI: Shoot em in the arm, and they stagger and hold their arm in pain, shoot em in the leg, and they fall and then drag the bloody stump behind them. Slice at the head for decaps, or go low and take out their movement. Shielded Demons require quick reflexes and waiting for the right moment to strike or a hell of a lot of fire power.-The graphics are amazing, I run it at 4K at 60fps with no drops, and Ultra settings. Its a beautiful thing.-I love the Weapons upgrade system, and the RPG Character Growth which for a NINJA based FPS is pretty great.-A Character Upgrade System thats actually useful, with skills that make or break your ability to survive in battle.-I am playing on Normal and its still challenging at times and you will die if your not careful. (Yes really)-Awesome Powers and Skills which allow you to  customize your character and play, dare I say ""strategically.""-A pretty good story... Actually really good for a FPS... Way better than no Story..( I'm looking at you DOOM 2016)-Using the Katana and Shuriken feels natural with the mouse and Keyboard.-NO Crashes, not a single one. Game is ROCK SOLID STABLE, which is way more than I can say for (most other supposedly ""AAA"" titles being released these days.-Quick Save anywhere and Load Anywhere.....(I know its like a common sense feature, yet for some reason most Devs are not including it in games... WHY?)I really have already written way more than I planned. I gotta get back to playing. Buy it, you will be happy you did. :) "

												A ""reboot"" done right. An old-schoolish game in the age of copy-paste shooters with flashy Katana and gun combat , varied and easy to use combos and upgradeable skills and weapons make this shooter one of the best of its kind. The Story is basically ""go there kill things"" but its definitely working here , the comedy is cheesy but its on-point. Sounds , graphics and gore is also fantastic , works really well with the game atmosphere. The game is also highly replayable due to its various difficulty mods and its secrets scattered through the levels. - Recommended			"

												I can't say enough good things about this game. Let's take a look at it piece by piece. Characters The main character is Lo Wang. He's a wisecracking super-hero fan that views himself as a badass. Although that seems somewhat cliched, he IS a badass and can hold his own from the very first fight. His one-liners get better as his personality evolves which is also pretty badass. He's a hitman working for Zilla who is essentially the most evil, most powerful, deadliest man on the planet. Zilla makes an agreement with some demons that starts the demon apocalypse, though both sides intend to double cross each other. Lo Wang meets and becomes partners with a demon named Hoji. Hoji has been banished from the Shadow Realm for unknown reasons. Lo Wang and Hoji journey across Asia assembling pieces of the only sword that can harm the demon leaders. On their journey they discover more about who Hoji is, and the story becomes more about Wang and Hoji each trying to redeem themselves in their own ways and distance themselves from the somewhat nefarious villains they each started as. You can genuinely see their attitudes and morals evolve over the course of the game and it's awesome. Hoji: You have a cave with a suit of battle armor under your house? Glad you're keeping your superhero complex in check.Lo Wang: It's a demon apocalypse out. Not a bad time to be a superhero.  Gameplay The game at first seems like a hack n' slash with guns swapped in, but is actually really deep and diverse in gameplay. By the end of the game there are six guns in your belt along with your katana, and you can also use demon body parts against them if you upgrade your skills properly. On top of that there are seven super powers at your disposal. Weapons, skills, and super powers all use different systems with a variety of different upgrades trees. There's a huge variety of enemy types which keep you mixing all your abilities frequently to tackle them all. Nothing is overpowered because everything has a factor that keeps it from fighting uncontrollably. The game is mostly linear, though the side paths are there for those that want to explore and find collectibles, which are key to the uprade system. This game is a blast through and through.			"

												One heck of a good time. Crude (and funny), but not mean-spirited. Combat is an interesting mix of ranged and melee. There's a nice variety/progression to the enemies, some of which require different tactics, which keeps things fresh. Some of the levels get a bit long and samey/mazelike, so I would have appreciated a map (regular or mini). All in all, a great 21st century update to a 90's classic.			"

												As much fun as Hard Reset in its own way, way better than any Pain Killer game. Fantastically gory game, and for those with a love for the almighty katana. For all you Eye Cybermancy gamers and Killing Floor zerkers this might be right up your ally, it sure is for me. I love this game, the visuals are fantastic, the gameplay is smooth, fast, relentless and quite tricky when it comes to the large number of secrets hidden throughout the game.The game has good humour, over the top gore, and personally, I think this game is fantastic on PC. Max out the settings and you're good to go for hours of merciless mouse torture. Shadow Warrior does what it should do, it's an ode to the authentic shooter genre like we've known it from Duke Nukem, Serious Sam or the original Shadow Warrior. This game is fantastic from the beginning, right through 'till the credits begin to roll. I highly recommend this game, it is a must-buy.			"

Then this might be a game for you. With one liners worth a fortune cookie, katana play with intuitive demonic powers system, and loads of slaughtered body parts this game is a Christmas hit worth buying and playing!If you want a sophisticated gun play, serious and gritty setting or a tear inducing story... you need to look the other way.

												Awesome FPS game with tons of humor like the old shadow warrior from 1997. You can have up to 20 hours of fun with its campaign alone, searching for all the retro secrets and stuff too. With a patch that came yesterday a new survival mode and a crossover to ROTT trough a new melee sword was introduced which gives you even more playtime. Especially the melee combat in this game feels so fantastic, you can slice your enemys into pieces cutting off their limbs and heads and stuff. It's not the level of detail like you can cut stuff in Metal Gear Rising but it just feels sooo good and satisfying.My number 1 FPS-game of 2013!			"

												Shadow Warrior took me by surprise. I bought it thinking it was going to be an okay game, shameless dirty fun for a few hours. But what I got was something much better. The campaign is quite lenghty, the combat is a lot of fun, I liked the upgrade system, the story and voice acting were surprisingly good and the 'chemistry' between Lo Wang and Hoji is great. The game feels complete, no shady DLC bussines or the like, and you can really feel the passion of the developers throughout the game. All in all, I really enjoyed this game and strongly recommend it.			"

If you want to be transported back to the glory days of absolutely frantic FPS play, this is the game for you.  This game was a blast, I don't know if I would have shelled out the full price for it, but on a Steam sale, it was absolutely worth the money.  I enjoyed the old school Shadow Warrior and this incarnation managed to be a ton of fun as well.			"

												Shadow Warrior is a modern reboot of a 3D Realms 1997 classic of the same name by Polish developer Flying Wild Hog which was founded by former employees of People Can Fly, creators of Painkiller. Shadow Warrior is set in modern day Japan and tells a rather convoluted story about a demon invasion. The players assume the role of assassin Lo Wang who works for a powerful Japanese industrial magnate Orochi Zilla who is tasked with retrieving a legendary katana called Nobitsura Kage. Things start to go very wrong very soon and Wang will have to fight his way through hordes of hired assassins and demons.The storytelling is mostly a miss because the game can’t decide whether it wants to be a parody or not. Lo Wang himself is a walking parody who will make fun of familiar gaming tropes, but on the other hand you have these prolonged and wholly uninteresting cutscenes about some demon family and their issues. It’s an awkward mish-mash that just doesn’t work and the writing is pretty weak in both cases. The serious story is just boring and while the jokes will make you chuckle here and there, they will also sometimes fall flat.The real reason to play this game is its setting and gameplay, both of which make Shadow Warrior stand out from most modern action games. The graphics are colorful and vibrant, the wonderful game world makes both the combat and the exploration a joy. You start off with an ordinary katana and a pistol, but you will acquire more and more weapons as you go along and you get to keep them all, there’s no weapon limit here. All weapons can be upgraded not only to become more powerful, but also to gain an alternate firing mode which is usually just completely over the top. For example, you can upgrade your two-barrel shotgun to a four-barrel shotgun and the alternate firing mode will enable shooting all four barrels at the same time resulting in complete carnage.While the shooting is great and wholly satisfying, the best part of the combat is slicing up your enemies with your trusted katana. You will have the opportunity to unlock a wide variety of different moves which will make the combat even more visceral and exhilarating. You’ll actually do pretty well just by button mashing, but if you want to get a better performance score and additional karma points, then you will have to use these special moves. They’re actually rewarding to use in and of themselves because they just make you feel like a total badass. And that is something that Shadow Warrior does extremely well.Shadow Warrior provides a nice selection of different enemies ranging from hired assassins, low level demons to bigger and badder demons and huge bosses. The bosses actually don’t represent the highlight as they use the tried and true expose-and-hit-weakpoint type of design. They’re pretty good, but the best part is fighting droves of different enemies in big environments where you have melee enemies charging at you, ranged enemies throwing fireballs at you and flying enemies wreaking havoc from overhead. Managing these huge battles is just incredibly exciting and trying out all the different moves and weapons that are at your disposal is just unbelievably satisfying. The combat system is simply excellent.I found the pacing to be awesome. The game doesn’t constantly drown you in enemies which I often tend to find exhausting. After you clear an area, you are free to explore it and there’s a reason to do so as the world is littered not only with necessities such as health and ammo, but also secrets and easter eggs. However, if you’re only in it for the combat, you can just head on forward and you will be fighting non-stop. The game world is not consistently delightful, about halfway through you will have to trudge through several brown and bleak sewers, shipyards and some sort of a science facility. However, the design and the combat remain strong throughout making this a relatively minor gripe. Shadow Warrior is also quite a lengthy game, unlike most modern action and FPS games, it took me 16 hours to finish it on the normal difficulty setting.Flying Wild Hog simply understand action game design and Shadow Warrior is a truly great action game with a fantastic and visceral melee combat system, satisfying shooting mechanics and a wonderful game world.8 OUT OF 10 (GREAT)			"

												Everything that ""Duke Nukem Forever"" tried/wanted to be and failed, ""Shadow Warrior"" is. It's both interesting and ironic, because the hype for ""DNF"" was so extremely high after all those years, last being seen as the height that was ""Duke Nukem 3D"", in the so called golden age of the FPS. And then everyone was dissapointed by the release, not mainly because it was a severely bad game, but because the hype was so exagerated. It was an okay game, but with a bad taste of out of date & misogynistic jokes & not fully realised or embraced gameplay which had too few highlights.No one expected anything from ""Shadow Warrior"" though, and it turned out to be everything we wanted (more or less). It has both a fresh updated feel to the graphics, while at the same time staying true to the roots and being honest about what it is. Nothing more nothing less. Which makes it so succesful!Though I liked Lo Wang as an elder man in the original, that he's a younger version here isn't a hinderence, merely a less original concept. After all, the story isn't the important thing. We want to kill hordes of demons & big bosses with cool and fun weapons within exotic settings. And that's exactly what we get to do!The weapons and powerups are a delight, the settings & maps are varied enough, picking up items when you've allready interacted by opening something is a matter of just moving your mouse over them which is a superb mechanic that I wish all games would implement, the controls are responsive, voice acting good, humour spot on. Ironically this game filled with♥♥♥♥♥♥jokes & splatter is also one the most scenically beautiful games around. Extra plus for being able to replay the game with all power ups gained enabled!The only complaints I have are that it does drag on a bit too long, especially if you're going for all secrets like I was, and the music is repetitive and boring. And the little ""drama"" there is is really hard to get in to. My companion didn't do anything for me personally as a gamer, once I'd realised his healing ability stayed even after he was gone, I couldn't care less about his fate tbh. Which didn't bother me in the slightest, but of course it would have elevated the experience if it had. If my complaints had been met, this would have easily been a contender for game of the year!

												There are so many things I want to say about this game. So many things. I won't though. All I will say is, you HAVE to play this game. If you enjoyed the shooters and actions games from the mid 90's that loved to also poke humour at anything they could, this game will keep you very entertained, and with a great story as well that includes some top notch voice acting, humour, and an ending you don't see coming.This is definitely my favourite FPS of the last decade, and it has a ton of replay value as well.Play this game. You won't regret it.Seriously, stop reading and play the damn game!			"

												The shooty-stabby was ok for the first few battles but then got old, but because I hate leaving things unfinished I dragged through the game and beat it. Spoiler alert kiddos, after you get all the parts of the katana you only kill one horde of baddies and that only takes about three swings. Oh there is the final boss battle but your katana is useless because its the same as all the other boss battles. So if you are looking forward to having fun with a fully upgraded katana you are S.o.L. If Shadow Warrior 2 is anything like this one ( and I foresee it will be because all developers do these days are copy and paste) then I know I will not buy it or any other game from FWH or devolver.I hope you guys have fun making more crap games. <^>			"

												A very fun, very gruesome fps. If you have ever wanted to play with a sword in an fps game this is probably your best choice.I primarily enjoyed using my sword whenever possible, there are a variety of attacks you can do with it including a ranged one so you can almost always complete an entire fight with it without much trouble.   The guns are all upgrade-able with a variety of improvements and utility upgrades,  the ability to dual wield on the smg or explosive bolts for the crossbow are two of my favorites.  It has very satisfying though not overly difficult combat, that managed to keep me engaged throughout the 10 hour campaign.The artstyle and graphics are good.  Nothing really sticks out about them besides the fact that you can slash anything that can explode with your sword and see the results.  There are enough different enemies to prevent you from feeling like you are doing the same fight over and over.  You can blow limbs or cut your enemies in half, which results in blood everywhere and is one of the most enjoyable parts of the game.The story is coherent and entertaining, while the player cracks jokes at every opportunity he can, usually about his name.  Overall I had a lot of fun with this game and would love to see more games like this.  The campaign didn't feel too long or too short, and I think it would be re-playable enough for another run.  It's very hard these days to find a satisfying fps these days, but at least we have this one.			"

												This is a review coming from someone who has never heard of Shadow Warrior or it's series.The story first and fore most seemed completely ridiculous and off the hook at first, but the more I played the game I found myself liking the game play but was really into the story line. The main character is ridiculous and if you like corny jokes turn up your speaker and listen to some classic Wang huehuehuehue type jokes. The game works as so. It's a first person smash em' up type game where your main weapon of choice will be your sword and as well as guns that are acquired throughout the game (launchers, pistols, machine guns, crossbows, demon heads you know the usual). The game play is addicting to those who like mindless violence and like seeing how well they are rated on their violent tendencies. There are three type of upgrade categories : one which uses money to upgrade physical weapons (dual pistols, dual machine guns, crossbow tips with explosive bolts, mini nukes as your rocket launcher), the second which uses ki to upgrade luck and mental factors of the protagonist, and the third which uses karma to upgrade sword abilities or stamina. Thanks to this upgrade system the mindless violence isn't so mindless as you actually have to use your mind to think which perks would actually benefit you. Enemies vary in shapes and sizes (small and big demons) but are all kill-able. Sometimes it's annoying as heck as some parts can become quite hard, but there's always a way to win.The graphics are as best as they come. They do not hinder, stall, or skip in any way. Cinematics are just as good. Don't expect any graphical errors here unless you have a problem with your computer.What happens after your done this game though? Well not much. You can run through it again but I had my fun with it and my friends are now enjoying it off my library. It was a fun game nothing against it, just wish I had more reason to go back to it. I may get some heat for my rating but even though this is a good and recommended game, I feel it's a honest rating :RATING : 7.5/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability C+ Overall  B-FYI - I got this game on sale.

												I must say, this game was pretty unique when it came to gameplay. At least to ME it was. Shadow Warrior is definitely a game that keeps you playing and can be a lot of fun! After about 3-5 hours though, the game can get pretty repetitive and boring, but once it jumps off the train, it jumps right back on for some more fun and♥♥♥♥♥kicking!      It took me a good 10-15 hours to beat this game, and I wouldn't call it ""holy grounds"" but I definitely give it a thumbs up 4x. Now, some people may come to the conclusion that I just gave this game a 4/5 or a 4/10. Both of which are WRONG. The game starts with Lo Wang, protaganist with a clearly phallic name and almost blatantly racist background, walking up to an even more blatantly racist background while making a joke at it's expense. (""Hmm, I was expecting a more cliche setting, but I guess Koy ponds and Cherry Blossoms will have to do."")Then Wang procedes into the huge dojo filled with momentos and valuables that serve no purpose but to brighten the atmosphere. Then he walks into a room where he meets a man who has a pretty cool sword that Wang's master, Zilla wants for his sword fetish (Or so it seems...), and Lo Wang will stop at nothing to get it for him. Only to have his plans thwarted by a demon pest named ""Hoji"" who ends up killing the man and taking his sword, and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Zilla off in a Skype conference call. Long story short, stuff happens... blah blah blah... very important storyline... blah blah... Sword hacky slashy... blah... Boss battles... blah... explosive weapons... blah. That's pretty much the storyline!Well, aside from all of that, the game has quite a few Boss battles like the original Shadow Warrior (1996) had, and many secrets that also pay respects to the classic game like pixelated babes showering and pixelated secret rooms, that resemble certain areas from the original game. This game is in NO WAY a remake of the old one, it's a reboot. It takes Lo Wang and makes him more serious than funny, but it's not TOO serious, he's still able to crack a few unnecessary jokes now and then, but not like the original where everything was a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. But all jokes aside, the Story telling is very deep, the atmosphere is warm to the touch (great), and the gun play is fun and funny! The voice acting... Eh, not up to par with most games, but it still gives you a feeling that you're there. The game includes Single Player and Survival modes. None of which incorporate multiplayer into them. This a 1 player game, and this was the big downer for me. After you beat the game, the replay value is there, but it's not very fun to go through again without a friend to enjoy it with you. The game is worth the buy, but not the $40 price tag. Wait for a sale and THEN get it. OVERALL: I'd say this game is a 4/5. HA HA! You thought I wasn't hinting at the final verdict, but I was! I got you sucker! Anyway, the storyline for Shadow Warrior was an enjoyable one and it made me want to beat it. The guns made for excellent hack/slash or bullet riddling fun and the explosives was just the icing on the cake! Voice acting could have been better, but it doesn't kill the score. What DOES is the lack of multiplayer. This game feels like it needed a multiplayer mode like Co-op or maybe a Deathmatch mode and that would've probably given this game a 4.5/5 or even a perfect score in my book. This is my opinion on the game. Some opinions may vary, but this is why I like Shadow Warrior. A must buy, but only when it's on sale.			"

After about 3-5 hours though, the game can get pretty repetitive and boring, but once it jumps off the train, it jumps right back on for some more fun and♥♥♥♥♥kicking!      It took me a good 10-15 hours to beat this game, and I wouldn't call it ""holy grounds"" but I definitely give it a thumbs up 4x. Now, some people may come to the conclusion that I just gave this game a 4/5 or a 4/10. Both of which are WRONG. The game starts with Lo Wang, protaganist with a clearly phallic name and almost blatantly racist background, walking up to an even more blatantly racist background while making a joke at it's expense. (""Hmm, I was expecting a more cliche setting, but I guess Koy ponds and Cherry Blossoms will have to do."")Then Wang procedes into the huge dojo filled with momentos and valuables that serve no purpose but to brighten the atmosphere. Then he walks into a room where he meets a man who has a pretty cool sword that Wang's master, Zilla wants for his sword fetish (Or so it seems...), and Lo Wang will stop at nothing to get it for him. Only to have his plans thwarted by a demon pest named ""Hoji"" who ends up killing the man and taking his sword, and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Zilla off in a Skype conference call. Long story short, stuff happens... blah blah blah... very important storyline... blah blah... Sword hacky slashy... blah... Boss battles... blah... explosive weapons... blah. That's pretty much the storyline!Well, aside from all of that, the game has quite a few Boss battles like the original Shadow Warrior (1996) had, and many secrets that also pay respects to the classic game like pixelated babes showering and pixelated secret rooms, that resemble certain areas from the original game. This game is in NO WAY a remake of the old one, it's a reboot. It takes Lo Wang and makes him more serious than funny, but it's not TOO serious, he's still able to crack a few unnecessary jokes now and then, but not like the original where everything was a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. But all jokes aside, the Story telling is very deep, the atmosphere is warm to the touch (great), and the gun play is fun and funny! The voice acting... Eh, not up to par with most games, but it still gives you a feeling that you're there. The game includes Single Player and Survival modes. None of which incorporate multiplayer into them. This a 1 player game, and this was the big downer for me. After you beat the game, the replay value is there, but it's not very fun to go through again without a friend to enjoy it with you. The game is worth the buy, but not the $40 price tag. Wait for a sale and THEN get it. OVERALL: I'd say this game is a 4/5. HA HA! You thought I wasn't hinting at the final verdict, but I was! I got you sucker! Anyway, the storyline for Shadow Warrior was an enjoyable one and it made me want to beat it. The guns made for excellent hack/slash or bullet riddling fun and the explosives was just the icing on the cake! Voice acting could have been better, but it doesn't kill the score. What DOES is the lack of multiplayer. This game feels like it needed a multiplayer mode like Co-op or maybe a Deathmatch mode and that would've probably given this game a 4.5/5 or even a perfect score in my book. This is my opinion on the game. Some opinions may vary, but this is why I like Shadow Warrior. A must buy, but only when it's on sale.			"

												This is an excellent revision of an old, dated and rather socially awkward game. In many ways, Shadow Warrior seems to have learned all of the lessons from the failed Duke Nukem Forever in updating a classic game for a new audience. For one thing, Shadow Warrior takes everything that was great about the original, like the over the top violence, large sprawling level design, hitting things with swords and drops the things that were rather not good: Like the blatant racism. There are still plenty of puns and other ridiculous jokes, after all the protagonist is still called ""Lo Wang"" but it's clearly laughing with the protagonist - not at him because of his race. By far the greatest thing about Shadow Warrior is the intuitive, fun to use and well implemented sword plus magic system. While there ARE guns in Shadow Warrior, I kept consistently forgetting they existed by hacking demons apart with magic and the sword was just incredible fun. The sword strikes depending on how you're moving, allowing you to very precisely dismember various demons, police or yakuza once you become skilled with it. Add to that a series of magical ki abilities for your sword, plus magic spells that let you heal, stun enemies, float them in the air and so forth. This adds a tremendous amount of depth and strategy to the games combat, which is so much fun to use I - as mentioned - forgot there was actually firearms in the game. I easily just got through 90% of the game using only the sword and various ki abilities.This isn't to imply the guns are bad in any way, because there are numerous upgrades available to make them more effective, gain interesting secondary firing modes and so forth. I just found the sword so much fun to use and so effective, that I never felt the need to use the guns outside of a handful of specific sections where they are useful. Unfortunately, this might also be a comment on the general lack of enemy variety present in Shadow Warrior. There aren't a lot of enemy types in the game, so you will be facing the same combinations of demons and mini-boss demons a lot. This is especially vexing, because while there are armed human enemies in corrupt police and yakuza, they aren't used very frequently in the game at all. Minding, there is one particular section near the end, where it throws a huge amount of ordinary human fellows at you while you have a fully powered up sword. That was quite satisfying, especially after some of the difficult previous encounters.What I found interesting was that while the gameplay is fantastic, what surprised me and pulled me through the game in the end was the extremely well crafted story. Lo Wang has an actual character arc, with proper growth and some really great dialog with his demonic companion Hoji. There is actually a pretty compelling plot underneath all of the hacking people away with Katanas, with some great and genuinely emotive moments towards the end especially. It's especially rewarding getting some artistic cutscenes after finishing each of the long chapters, then facing off against some particularly well designed and fun to fight bosses (none of which felt frustrating, which is a genuine compliment). Overall this is a great update to an old game, which is also packed with great secrets (including sections designed to look like the original Shadow Warrior). Definitely recommend, especially if you like first person melee combat in a game.			"

												This is a highly recommended and fun game, though it is very gory. If lots of blood is not your thing, then you should probably avoid this title. That aside, Shadow Warrior ticks many boxes and has impressed me. First of all is the story. While many FPS games do not necessarily require a good story in order to give you some enemies to shoot or melee for a few hours, Shadow Warrior includes a very nice campaign, with some quite memorable characters and dialogue fleshing out the surprisingly high quality plot. With your protagonist named Lo Wang, one should expect some crude humour, and Flying Wild Hog do not disappoint. The cutscenes are also very nice,while also giving you the option to skip them if you so desire.The art style, particularly the basic enemies you fight, may look a little... crude? That's fine though, the dismemberment or other assorted violence will soon put that out of your mind. But the graphics of this game are quite brilliant, and the environments are truly spectacular - be they urban, forest, or snow. This also extends to the design of the weapons, which you can get a close up view of when you upgrade them with in-game cash you can find scattered all over the various levels. With a large variety, all of which you can carry at the same time if you are up to that point of the story, the weapons all look incredibly interesting, and play well too - bonuses for the visible changes in the weapons as you upgrade them, be it a laser pointer, or a larger tank, or the ability to fire multiple missiles at the same time...The levels all look impressive, and are very vast, although they are essentially linear. Not all of the secrets are incredibly well hidden, but they can be challenging to find them all. And the nod back to the original game and other old-school shooters in the form of secret retro areas is a very nice touch. Especially when Lo Wang breaks the fourth wall. One of the few complaints I have with this game is that the large nature of the maps means that sometimes you will be forced to double back, and sometimes it can become quite difficult to find out where you actually have to go to progress.That said, where this game truly shines is in the combat. Visceral, brutal, and with a variety of enemies to keep you on your toes, from standard humans with weapons, to demons with claws, wings, enemies who can teleport or turn invisible, to mention nothing of the mini-bosses or bosses in the game. This is not a truly realistic game, where cover is irrelevant, and you can tank damage by just healing it up again with one of your abilities, but it's fine and fun because you can just smash face first into enemies.The game revolves around finding a legendary katana, and so swordplay is a central point of the game, with skills to improve your character and the ability to hack and slash quite satisfying - dismemberment and decapitations galore. The ability to acquire both skills and other passive bonuses, as well as upgrading your weapons also gets a tick. The guns are also quite special, from more standard revolver and shotgun to the more esoteric quad-barrel shotgun and crossbow, each with 3 upgrades, and the ability to purchase extra ammo if you're in a pinch. This is complemented by the completely insane, but incredibly fun possibilities of using demon parts as one of your demon extermination tools...EDIT: The other problem I've found with this game is the boss fights: they become quite repetitive, and the same strategy is used to beat all 3. In addition, some of the ""mini-bosses"", especially the Berserker, can be annoying and time consuming to kill.Huge fun, with good replayability too. +1 recommendation.			"

												Shadow warrior by 3D Realms was the first game i ever bought back in 1997, i expected this to be banking on peoples nostalgia and it would fall short of anyone's expectations.This remake holds its own, and its one of the first games in ages i have just sat down and played from start to finish.Screw open world games where you get bored and unfocused, this is just a linear campaign shooter done really REALLY well.Also pre ordered SW2 without hesitation.

 Shadow Warrior  This is a remake of the 1997 game of the same title. The main character is Lo Wang who is hired to find the legendary blade, but the situation gets out of control and our reality is attacked by demons that we have to send them back. But frankly who cares about story in this production, it's time to slaughter. To massacring demons will use different weapons and most often our sword. Our hero will be able to improve their skills and he is going to throw some lame jokes when he murdering opponents. What is quite funny. Visuals, sound and gameplay are standing on a very high level. The game is intense battleground between our hero and demons. Personally, I had a lot fun while playing this game, slicing demons in half can be entertaining.  "

												Normally I like to go into as much detail about games as possible but all you need to know is this. You are an Asian stereotype named Lo Wang. Your goal is murderlize any and all that is different from you. You get a sword that can slice and dice the minions of Hades in several bloody and gory ways. On top of that you get a bunch of guns that make me question the♥♥♥♥♥♥size of the Wang. To quote the game, ""this sh*t is my porn.""			"

 Rating: 9/10, better than Bioshock Infinite. Good gameplayBadass swordplaySolid StoryGood graphics and art directionFunny dialogueThe makers of Hard Rest (Flying Wild Hog) are responsible for this excellent re imagining of Shadow Warrior. I played very little of the original Shadow Warrior, but it is basically an asian duke-nukem. Maze like level layouts, funny one liners, puzzles, culture references, all that sorta♥♥♥♥♥♥ Now the reboot here is a lot different. The levels are less maze like and more straight forward, like newer fps games. There is some backtracking once and awhile, but in my opinion I didn't mind it. You can carry all of the guns you get and there are secrets and you fight hordes of enemies, no cover shooting at all. Health packs and everything too. Some minor character elements are still there but with a lot that was added to it. There is still some funny one liners and such, dont worry. Also they added a good story with good writing. Now the first part to cover is the gameplay. The gameplay consists of navigating Japenese inspired levels, doing small objects, and shooting and slicing up hordes of enemies. You have your health and stamina bar. Sprinting and a sort of ninja/dodge/dash with a press of the shift key and either (w a s d). The main focus in this game is the melee combat, which is amazing. A mix of light and heavy attacks, with double presses of either (w a s d). It is a very fluid and satisfying combat system all the way to the end. The enemies also slice up into little gibs, its cool as hell! The guns in the start are a tad underwhelming in the beginning, but it takes upgrades for those guns to make them more enjoyable. There is an upgrade system as well. One tier for powers, another for guns, and a last one for skills. The powers are a double tap (w a s d) right mouse button mechanic, for example self healing or using a force push ability. These use Ki crystals to upgrade by the way. Guns are for what you expect, upgrading your pistol, machine gun, cross bow and other guns with money. Skills are a mix of katana abilities and buffs for health, and killing demons and such, skills upgrade with karma, which you get by fighting enemies and secret karma stashes.The graphics are also amazing in this. I am using a Nivida GeForce GTX 770 with this game, Ultra, FXAA on, and it is nice looking. From vast mountains, bamboo trees, ponds, old Japanese architecture, huge temples, and towns. Nice lighting, textures and overall design. Only thing that could have had a bit more work is the faces of the people, they look sorta bad but they work. There is also some amazing cinematics, sort of like a visual moving novel. They tie into the story with the characters in it.The last part I want to go over is the story, its good. Its about a Japanese man named Lo Wang, a bodyguard for a corporation called Zilla Enterprises. Lo Wang is tasked to retrieve a sword called the Nobistura Kage for his boss Orochi Zilla. All hell breaks loose and the sword is taken by a demon like ghost. And demons rain all through Japan and murder everyone. You then are met with a demon entity named Hoji. Which he tells you the end of the world is because of the Nobistura Kage. There is a mix of Japanese spirit world lore in this too, and surprisingly an interesting and captivating story for a shooter like this.Now should you buy this game? Yeah, if you like hack and slash games with an old/new school fps twist with a good story. There are not very many games that are fps and have hack and slash elements: and its solid. I would even say I enjoyed this game more than a triple A title like Bioshock Infinite.			"

A truly fun experience to people who prefer Mob FPS games (e.g. Serious Sam), mowing down rows of demons and enemies in a way that will stick in your head for long after the game is set aside.You will sit at work, and not think of that report you are trying to print. Instead, you are bound to reminescene that one moment, when you sliced and diced your way through a dozen enemies, only to watch the last one bow down in terror, so hard and low, that his head hits the ground, scattering his brain on the holy ground you walk on.However, do not, I repeat, do NOT take this game to be easy.

												On sale for 1€, this was probably the best deal I've ever made. One of the most fun FPS I've ever played (especially in the recent flood of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ CoD clones). Imagine the classic Shadow Warrior mixed with Bulletstorm and some simple character development. Fun melee combat + great visuals + tons of humour!The only problem is optimization, in some areas the performance will drop, a lot - especially with reflections turned on.

												I'll be honest, this is a great game. But as far as being a Shadow Warrior rehaul, well, they should've put a bit more effort in recreating the real Lo Wang instead of putting this new Eddie Murphy style dude. That's my only complaint. All in all, a great effort. And if these developers were the same behind Duke Nukem Forever, it wouldn't have gotten all the bashing it did.			"

This is a long review so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend Shadow Warrior skip to Results and read from there.Flying Wild Hog makes a beautiful continuation of the Shadow Warrior saga brining the story and gameplay to heights unseen. Shadow Warrior brings so much that could not have been imagined from the original series to life.Story:If you have played the original Shadow Warrior games you will feel a large sense of nostalgia as well awe when you play this brilliant rendition of the series. You of course play as the great Lo Wang who is a guns for hire working for Zilla Enterprises. It is your quest to retrieve the fabled Nobitsura Kage, to you a simple task, but in reality something much more. After agreeing to purchase part of the sword from a rival group you figure out that what you have done is unlocked the gates to another realm. It is up to you and your companion Hogi to push through and retrieve all the pieces of the Nobitsura Kage and end the daemon onslaught. The brilliantly articulated story starts the game as a rather playful action-comedy then drifts into a deep action-drama. Campaign:Shadow Warrior was by no means a short game; it took me about 12-hours to beat the entire campaign. In actuality the campaign was incredibly easy (even on Hard), but in part this made the game entertaining. You could play this game a lot quicker by avoiding secrets and not exploring the surrounding area, but some of the secrets provide XP boosts which are handy for leveling up your skills. There are seventeen chapters and a prologue which start off in Japan and take you all over the place as you travel through time and space. Some of the chapters are relatively short, while others are incredibly long. I could imagine that even on Insane this game wouldn’t have been difficult because you can make so many saves. Although I didn’t figure this out till the end of the game, you can even save in the heat of battle meaning if you mess up you don’t have to start all over again. This may come in handy with the boss fights, but most of the other battles are simple enough. Gameplay:The game was challenging in that it kept you pressed into combat, but easy in that you could manipulate yourself to make any battle rather simple. I played the entire campaign using almost exclusively the Nobitsura Kage. In fact with certain upgrades you could make it so the Katana can heal you allowing you to destroy enemies without having to worry about health limitations. This game was clearly mapped for PC as the controls are so fluid with a keyboard and mouse. I would imagine using a controller for this game to be a terrible handicap. Each of the commands is mapped around your movement and you have complete control of which way you swing the sword by how you manipulate your mouse. This makes melee combat incredibly intense and rather skillful. The only time I found myself using weapons was to fight the bosses who were designed so that you could not use the Katana. The boss fights were incredibly entertaining, but they were rather similar in how you defeated them. Find the weak-point in the armor, destroy the weak-point, and finally shoot the crystals under the armor. Character Customization:The campaign offers you a player tree which allows you to buff yourself with the following: Skills, Weapons, and Powers. Skills offer Katana Mastery, Knowledge, Movement, Luck, and Mind. These allow you to enhance yourself by increasing weapon/money finding, stamina regrowth, maximum health, katana abilities, and so on. Powers include: Shockwave, Protection, Healing, and Flux. These allow you to essentially cast spells either on yourself or enemies. Weapons offer Katana (Nobitsura Kage), Tosainu Type 13 Revolver, Zi-Type 23 PDW, Mamushi Type-14 Crossbow, ZICS-C Shotgun, Onibi Flamethrower, YARI Type-24 Rocket Launcher. These can be upgraded with money you find in the game making them more powerful and versatile. By the end of the campaign I had only found enough money to upgrade the Shotgun, Rocket Launcher, and Zi-Type-23 PDW to maximum without putting any other upgrades in weapons. This means you may want to be careful what you spend your money on as you don’t get it by killing enemies you have to find it. Two additional weapons are Daemon Heads and Daemon Hearts, which you can only carry one of at a time and cannot be upgraded. Results:Shadow Warrior is a brilliant game that offers so much that I couldn’t see how anyone could dislike it. I never played the original Shadow Warriors when I was younger, but only recently had I purchased and beat them on steam. All the Shadow Warrior games are entertaining and I would recommend this game even if it wasn’t on sale. The campaign is fantastically well written, the level design is amazing, the combat is flawless, the puzzles are riveting, and the story is phenomenal. All in all Shadow Warrior is a great game where you can either hack your way through, burn up, shoot holes through, and even blow up thousands of enemies. Pros:+Beautiful scenery and level design.+Fantastic combat system which is incredibly fast paced.+Great graphics and visualizations.+Character customization, which allows you to really mix up how you play.+Amazing story, dialogue, and cinematics.+Good length campaign which has great replay value.+Puzzles, secrets, and mysteries around every corner.+Large variety of weapons which allow you to destroy enemies in all sorts of ways.+Boss fights and arena battles which keep you on your toes and constantly striving for greatness.+Battle scoring, each battle is rated out of five shuriken and bonus XP is offered based on your score.  Cons:-Sadly you must dash before you can sprint which sometimes results in flying off a slant in the ground and dying, which normally you would just run down. -You may want to have a keyboard than offers high level multi-key press support, because the combat can be very pressing (haha) and can result in a lot of commands being sent from your keyboard at one time.

												Easily a top contender for GotY.A very bold reimagining of a classic shooter, Shadow Warrior accomplishes what it sets out to achieve with spot-on accuracy. Fast paced retro action, a good story, great humor, a solid upgrade system, encouragement for world exploration and possibly the most dynamic dismemberment system I've seen. What's not so great I'd have to say would be hit-detection, you can unload an entire magazine on somebodies face but sometimes the game won't register the hits, so you do no damage, waste ammo and look like an idiot. Thankfully this isn't a frequent occurance so when it does happen it doesn't ruin too much.So until I play more of it and get more information in order to write a proper review let me say this: Shadow Warrior is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, get it.

Main tune playing throughout the game is too dramatic for this nonstop-meatgrinder-explosion-shoot-everything-that-moves gameplay to my liking.There's some nasty gamedesign flaws like annoying flying monsters which are too difficult to shoot and death after dashing from stairs (apparently, game kills you after you fly for longer than a second).Okay. 7/10.

												I just finished my first playthrough on this game. Took me around 16h with cutscenes (no skipping) and the occassional secret here and there on insane difficulty.There's another difficulty available that i didn't try, don't know if it was available at the start or after first playthrough. It's more difficult then insane and removes checkpoints and quicksaving. You have to beat each level on one playthrough which takes about 1 hour per chapter and might really be difficult on certain levels.Total of 17 Chapters.It's a pretty bloody game with lots and lots of dismemberment. The story is actually good and enjoyable. Artwork and Artstyle are good looking and it's a very good looking game too, considering it's age. Performance on my a10-7850k with 8 gb ram, ssd and 270x 2gb vram configuration was absolutely good. no framedrops or slowdowns, not a single crash. nice and fluid 60 fps all the time (i capped it there).Pros:- good visual style- bloody and gory- good story- very fluid gameplay- fun- lots of difficulty settings- new game+ mode (ex mode, you keep your skills and weapons except for the absolutely uber katana you get before the last boss)- killer, heavy metal rabbits from hellCons:- chaotic and messy near the end (lots of enemies etc)- a bit repetitive, especially at the end- boss fights work all the same (shoot shiny spot to expose weakness, shoot spot)- last boss was a chore. not difficult or anything but annoying and taking longer then i enjoyed fighting it.If you like bloody and gory katana/weapon carnage with a good story and nice artstyle. Get it, play it, enjoy it.			"

												""Killing is easy, giving a♥♥♥♥♥♥is hard"" - Lo WangShadow warrior is an FPS game with very dynamic, fast and action packed gameplay, First of all, what you really may enjoy in this product is unique and fresh katana combat: there are plenty of moves and special abilities, that can be utilize while wielding this weapon. Plus, additional powers and skills, that can help you in your stylish crusade against demons. Secondly, the plot and characters. Protagonist is a hitman with good sense of humour, that must redeem his honour and save the world at the same time. Nothing new here, actually, but the story makes up because of main hero and his comments on what happens throughout the game. And finally, the bad thing. Combat getting repetitive and boring at second part of the game. The problem is, that there are 18 chapters, if I remember correctly, and, surprisingly, this whole massacre that you will be doing at first with smile on your face and that I praised before gets annoying with time. You see, a game with such insane and action packed gameplay cannot be entertaining and long at the same time without any cool stuff reserved for late game. And Shadow Warrior, unfortunately, lacks that stuff for second part of your journey.Conclusion:If you like good and fast FPS - buy it, but better on sale. If you play that kind of genre occasionally, you should pass this  one by.Gameplay and katana combat +Characters and plot +Graphics +Game is too long for that kind of genre- Combat may get repetitive and boring with time for someone -In the end, I would give that game 7/10 on the Wang meter.

												You no mess with Lo Wang!Seems like Flying Wild Hog did their best. I don't think we could play something more closer to the original in 2014, so I liked the game. I kinda felt like I was playing Duke Nukem Forever and Hard Reset but that's not a bad thing. Lo Wang's humor (which has a bit changed) and crazy action are still there. BTW I wouldn't ever think that Shadow Warrior would have a dramatic ending, but the story was decent. It was well worth the $10 I paid on the winter sales. Highly recommended to Lo Wang fans.Do you want to wash Wang or do you want to watch Wang wash Wang?			"

												What a solid product we have here. Pretty much loved it from start to finish. *Some of the best first person melee combat out there*Extremely vivid visuals the entire campaign*Honestly funny, yet immature dialog. Hoji cracks me up.*The devs recently updated the game with 64bit and DX11 support, which made the game run like a dream for me.*Very lengthy campaign with a good variety of environments, enemies, equipment, abilities, etc.*Retro FPS sensibilities that are sorely lacking in today's genre.*A ninja star to a semi-truck's windshield makes the whole damn thing explode.*Easily satiates anyone's Wang quotient.I can't think of many gripes. I suppose some basic multiplayer or coop modes would have been nice. It does have a New Game + mode, should you want to earn every upgrade for Wang that you couldnt afford the first time through. After the new patch, the only technical issue I had was the cutscenes, which are rare, all played only from my center speaker on my 5.1 setup.Considering how insanely cheap this game is on sale, I insist that every steam user own it. The devs deserve more attention for this one.			"

The seamless change from fire arm to melee combat coupled with the rewarding levelling up system which allows you to personalize your play style leaves you feeling satisfied. I was never familiar of the original Shadow Warrior however I think long-time fans will appreciate its subtly nods to its past. The voice work is also of high quality. If you are looking for a fun single player FPS action oriented campaign. I implore you to check this game out, I am already looking forward to the sequel which will feature co op. Have fun slaying demons and otherworldly horrors in the silly game.Make peace before Lo Wang cuts you to pieces ~			"

												This game is an absolute blast!  I'll admit I've never been the biggest fan of the original Shadow Warrior (Though it had some fun moments) but truly this game is barely related to the original Shadow Warrior outside of the fact that the protagonist is a wisecracking sword wielding badass named Lo Wang (Who is thankfully much, much less annoying and racist than his 90s counterpart), there's a corporation named Zilla, and it's an FPS.  I do hesitate calling it a true ""Old school"" shooter as I kind of take issue with modern games thinking that old school FPS games were all horde based games where you'd progress to another horde that spawns in legions before moving on.  I suppose you could call it old school in attitude though, but otherwise it's more of a modern arcadey-horde shooter in the vein of Serious Sam or Painkiller, but either way it doesn't matter - all that matters is that this game is good, gory fun.  If you want a great looking, hard hitting, bloody, nasty, violent and challenging shooter that doesn't take itself serious then get this game!			"

												This game is fun to play...for a short while.  After the first few chapters, you'll realize that you've seen just about everything the game has to offer.  The combat is boring once you come to understand that you'll be fighting the same enemies over and over and over.  It's difficult to take a strategic approach to the combat as most foes simply materialize out of thin air.  The time and place for encounters are also predictable.  If you find a large, unoccupied room, expect the enemies to start materializing any second.  The developers could have knocked this one out of the park.  The weapons are fun to use and the special powers are nice also.  It's just the variation that is lacking.If the price was around $5, it would be worth a look.			"

												Let me just add my positive review to the pile...Frankly I'm surprised the metacritic rating is so low for Shadow Warrior. It's a well-polished game with very nice graphics, good game-play, interesting combat that rewards not spamming the same technique all the time, has a really nice and emotionally involving story (that ending!), includes Easter eggs referring to the original game for nostalgia (and refers to other popular games too), and it somehow balances a line between being ludicrously cheesy (try to keep count of how many Wang puns there are, or better yet: take a drink every time there is a Wang joke!) and being somewhat self-deprecating because they know how stupid it is, but for Shadow Warrior to not have Wang jokes and over the top cliche'd settings would just not be Shadow Warrior.This is how you breathe new life into a game franchise. Other devs should take notes on this game, because there's a lot of childhood favourites that I would like to see get this kind of treatment.Edit: I bought the special edition because I love Hotline Miami, and really it wasn't worth the extra money, even on sale. I'm not sure what I expected with that promo sword, but it's just not worth it. Definitely buy the standard edition.10/10 would play with Wang again (hur hur hur).			"

												So many great memories with the first shadow warrior, many years ago, heh.Well, putting my nostalgia away i will try to make a short review on this one.They wanted to create something modern, but not very modern.They wanted to create something classic, but not that classic.Did they achieve their goal? Hell YeaThis wasn't meant to be something very unique, not at all, they wanted to make a modern sequel to the original game, they've done it well.Graphics, damn good.Gameplay, even more damn good.Combat system, awesome.You have a katana, and you have lots of weapons (just like in the old one), but to be honest, who would play with fire weapons in a game where you have a melee weapon? Heh. But it's nice they've added them. I didn't use them too much, only to fight bosses. I didn't use fire weapons to kill flying demons, i was just throwing my katana.The feeling when you slice a demon.. is priceless.It has around 10 hours of gameplay, Actually, i even forgot that i had the sledgehammer from Serious Sam 3, and other nice melee weapons, since i've got the special edition, aaaand, i've finished the game. I really got caught up by it.I really recommend this to any Shadow Warrior 3D Fan, or to any nostalgic guy. This game is really worth the money. I am very happy with this one, and i am waiting for future sequels.			"

												The further and further I get into the game, recommending it gets harder. The combat is fantastic, combining swordplay and faceshooting by rewarding the player for killing groups of enemies in convoluted, awesome fashions. Lighting a group of enemies on fire and then decapitating them all is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome! However, around hour five is when things start sliding into ♥♥♥♥♥ville, because that's when the enemies with glowing weak spots appear to destroy the momentum by being a trope of gaming that sucks. Hour ten is when the writing shines, and by that I mean the game overstays its welcome while trying to wrap up its overwritten, boring story with nothing new to offer.

												Oh God, what a disappointment. The original Shadow Warrior is one of my most favourite games and hearing all them people masturbating each other with the 2013 Shadow Warrior by Flying Wild Hog being a ""true iteration"", ""real old-school"" shooter, I thought that it's a sure bet to get it. Jesus Christ, this game is so disappointing it gave me the biggest blue balls ever. From trailers and quick glimpses at some short gameplay videos I thought I will indeed get a somewhat classic shooter. Hardly. It's a game trying to be a classic shooter, but not doing the most basic thing required from the 1st gen fps game - a proper level design. It's a Painkiller of 2013, which had the same problem.The level design in this game and everything involved (weapon pacing, resource management, combat) sucks. It sucks so much, that there's no reason at all to play this game more than the first few levels, because every single level in the game is the same. A corridor - an arena that limits you in space, where a fight accurs - a dialogue and tedious looting for cash. Rinse and repeat. Yawn. It has nothing to do with anything that made the original a classic game. I've played, like 8 hours now, and every single level (except the Gozu fight) was exactly the same. Run in circles and shoot HP bloats (and I do mean HP BLOATS). After the few first arenas it grew old to me. I can't push myself to finish it, although I really wanted to like this game.The terrible gun-play and wild design decisions don't help, either. For the first few hours we're stuck with a powerful katana sword and an useless revolver, a weak♥♥♥♥♥handling smg you have no reason at all to use. Later you get a crossbow that covers half of the screen, and much, much later you get a shotgun that's basically useless against hordes of enemies you encounter. I've just put my hand on a rocket launcher that covers, like, 2/3 of the screen. What? I didn't even use it in the fight that took place right after I had picked it. Ah, there's a flamethrower you won't ever use. Every weapon except the katana with its combos feels underpowered, because every single enemy is a massive HP bloat. You will put many, many, many magazines and rockets into a single warlord. There're no tactics, no resource management, no real level play involved due to combat pattern that follows a simple ""lock a player in an arena and spawn enemies"". Secrets are mostly useless cash bonuses and Karma bonuses (in-game currency for passive and active skills) with occasional cheap nostalgia gimmicks. They don't benefit you in a way original's secrets used to (you can get a granade launcher 30 seconds into the first level). In 2013 version you have nothing.And there are your Ki powers. A simple katana combos are pretty neat. For first three times you use them. But the healing power is just a game-breaking issue. You can heal up yourself up to above 100 HP after investing karma into passive HP skills. You can get second winds, enrages after getting below 30 HP, etc. There's no suspense, no challange at all in this game. Only tedious gunplay versus HP bloated enemies.I don't think you could miss more with making a true Shadow Warrior game than Flying Wild Hog did with their game.			"

												Shadow Warrior stands as a testament to the fps genre that just because a series is old doesnt mean a person cant fill it with nice things and make a damn respectable game. this isnt your big brothers shaodw warrior, or your daddies. this is a modern take on what shadow warrior can be if given the tools and accessibility we have available in current era fps's and its the nail in the coffin for mainstream fps sp experiences. i shudder to think about picking up another call of duty or battlefield for their singleplayer or any other franchise that gets totted around a lot.you play lo wang. a comic book collector hired by a rich buisnessman to claim an old sword from another collector. however things quickly fall apart as the demons from another plane of existence start spilling through the gaps in soace and time. and very quickly you are left to pickup the pieces, complete the sword, defeat those who would use the blade for evil, and close their path to the human worldvisually the game is done well enough that their is little to complain, though i felt that at times lighting was relatively poor and your flashlight was not suited well for the task of illuminating anything. shadows on water, and destructible environments and enemies are awesome. other things like cloth and glass are also good. simply put flying wild hogs have made an above average visual game considering this is an old cryengine revision they are dealing with here.the audio is also good. this feels lively and banter between the main characters can be funny or make u stop and comment yourself at times. but there are some parts where it falls a little flat or dull and their are some cliche moments but for everyone one of those their is normally a stereotype breaker and those often elft me feeling that maybe those down moments werent so bad after all. i can look past these faults, you might not.combat.. where should i start. to put an analogy out there if CoD and battlefield are considered the pinnacle of fps combat; this is a cut above. simply put their is few games released on pc that have the other qualities this game does that do combat as well or slightly worse. the list is small i could probably riddle them off with one hand after thinking about it. the katana is your melee weapon and you have a variety of ranged weapons as well. all of which feel fun and exciting and encourage experimentation and have something for everyone. i myself found a lot to like in the sub machine guns and flamethrower. but others may enjoy the shotgun or rocket launcher more. to each their own and their is enough to spread the love.level design is flawless, this is where shadow warrior feels the msot true to self with homages and references to the origional game by 3d realms, and lots of multi-pathing around areas, this makes the corridor shooter aspects of the game feel less confined and encourage you to go back and grab extra ammo or search for secret rooms or collectibles. and for this it gets an applause.no for some downsides. at launch this game had lots of crash bugs. these have since been msotly rectified and for that the developers have my thanks, made the game more enjoyable. the games weapons also feel very udnerpowered at times. you will be left wanting more from your guns relying more on your sword to kill foes and this after a while takes the fun out of using what is perhaps its most novel weapon. furthermore some may see their use of rooms again and again in alter levels as lazy or poor taste. i dont see it that way but your welcome to think what you want.all in all i highly recommend this game and strongly suggest that if you want to feel like your playing a first person shooter again and not having your hand held through a corridor while you grip an M4 with tired franchise one liners and cliche fight sequences passing by you. BUY THIS GAME, dont wait for a sale BUY IT NOW! lo wang reaches out and touches 5 hearts.. out of 5 XXXXX/XXXXX			"

												A blast from the past. The team behind Hard Reset managed to recreate what make Shadow Warrior such a fun FPS. It delivers a great shooter and stands out by being different form the rest of the pack. The single player is more that enough to keep you playing this game, something that most shooters now days can't do. The game is hard, but gaves you the toolsl to feel like a badass warrior.  If you haven't play this game, I don't know what you are waiting for, on sale or not, this game deserves to  be play.			"

												Action based, ultimate fun! Somehow this game combines old-school action and humor with modern style gameplay elements (skill and weapon upgrades). Forget about Serious Sam or Painkiller; This is as close to old-school shooter as posible in modern gameing. Exploration, stylish melle and gunplay combat system, simple but fun story and of course Lo Wang charisma.For every arcade shooter fan out there. BUY THIS GAME without second thought, and get ready to have some Wang!Wangtastic. (c)			"

												A incredible fun game, with a lot of focus on Sword fighting and just gernerally murdering stuff. You get a Katana as your first weapon, and i personally found it to be the most fun to use. You get a lot of the normal old-school FPS weapons (SMG, Pistol, Rocket launcher, Crossbow etc.) But they all felt very stiff. But they're not the interesting part of this gime.You have 3 things you can upgrade, your skills, powers, and weapons. Skils are for stuf like more health, faster run speed, new katana abilities, Something that a normal person would be able to develop generally. Then there is the powers. 4 different in total. They are all executed by doing a movement key twice then right-click (Movement key twice + left click is for the katana skills). This might seem difficult at first, but it actually works really well, and gives you easy access to all your abilities. My favorite personally, was the flux. By Pressing S twice, and then right-click, you would charge up your first. When you released right-click, it would throw a long line into the ground, that would lift enemies up in the air for several seconds. Its amazing using the flux, then blowing someones head off with a shotgun.The enemies are a bit weird though.They're mostly Demons.Not a concept i enjoyed too much, but you find a few human enemies in some sections too. The demons all have specific abilities, and there are major and minor.The minor are the ones you might be able to slash to pieces in one or few hits, while the major can take a while to kill.Of the minor demons, we have your usual run and hit you zombie. The radioactive that explode when you get near or shoot them. The shielders and the invisibles.The shielders has to be the enemy i dreaded the most, not only do they block your attacks, they keep looking in your direction and you have to either throw them down, or hit the shield until it breaks. It can take a while and really breaks the flow of the game, when you're spinning around and killing litearlly everybody around you, except for them.Of the major enemies, there are 3: The Warlord, The Charger, and the Shaman. The major are a bit more interesting, so i'll talk about them.The shaman will summon and resurrect nearby enemies, and just keep doing this until you kill him. After hes around halfway dead, he will create a green unbreakable barrier, and summon some skeletons that flash with green colors. After you kill the skeletons, the shield breaks and you can finish him off.The Warlord will enrage nearby eneies (Which is, make them darker, and make them more powerful. Enemies can also be enraged if you use abilities or powers near them, even if there isin't a warlord there) He will also try to smash you, a lot. So every few seconds, he will throw a really fast red line, and if you touch it, he will pull you to him, and he will smash the ground.The final one is the charger. Hes simple, and kind of boring to be honest. He will charge you, you evade it near a wall. He hits the wall. You slice his back a few times. Rinse and repeat. It just takes so long to kill these guys, that the fun quickly dies from fighting them.But of all enemies, the most interesting one is the bosses. There are a total of 3 Demon bosses, and they're all amazing to fight. They're HUGE, and the shadow realm is just right-out eyecandy. They are all very Zelda-ish, and its very fun.All in all, if you have ever played Red steel 1 or 2, and enjoyed it. Or just want to enjoy a throwback to the old FPS with a mix of very interesting sword fighting, you should pick this game up.9/10			"

												A remake for 1990s classic Shadow Warrior. This game came out of the bushes and all that I  thought about it was going to be no more than more or less okey made successor for some game fossil, but after reading couple of reviews and watching gameplays, I decided to add this to my collection.Shadow Warrior showed me how these prejudices can be anything but right. The game is absolutly magnificent!! The easily mastered mixture of melee and long ranged fighting works better than any game I've played and numerous fighting moves picked from different skill trees quarantee the most entertaining fast, upbeat battles. So, the fighting is smooth and there is a lot of it: tens, even hundreds of enemies fall during one map, filled with several secret places to search for, just like in the original Shadow Warriror, where the game keeps refering to. As for the plot and characters, they are well written - the storyline though is quite typical, but they are the characters which in my opinion hit into the jackpot! Player playes Long Wang, who is an exceptional anti-hero, followed by a companion and sidekick: the demon Hoji, and these two rascals form a couple whose epic conversations I used to crack up so many times.Shadow Warrior is not only one of the biggest surprices of 2013, but also one of the best games in 2013. In addition IMO it's one of the best games ever! So whether you were or not a fan of last milleniums Shadow Warrior, I'm definitely going to recommend to check this out!			"

												A shining example of a First Person Shooter done right.No wee-wee-spunk-gargle here.All the weapons feel diferent, and no one of them seems ultimately better than another. They all have a good impact as well. And the sword? I pretty much used the sword 99% of the time my first playthrough. It's fantastic. Slice through enemy demons spraying their blood and body parts everywhere. I hear demon blood is good for your skin, so don't feel bad being covered in it.Great game. If you're not willing to pay full price, get it on sale. Not only is the action good but it's funny, and upholds the inappropriateness of the original. The level designs are good as well.I enjoyed it from start to finish.			"

												This game is a really hard to explain... It is a sort of hack'n'slash / first person shooter. All the levels are way more beautiful then I thought they would be. The gameplay feels solid, the tone is serious while keeping it comedic. It has a bunch of references to the first shadow warrior that I played a bit back when I was younger such as almost naked pixel girls bathing  scattered through the land and rabbits that wont stop ****ing. They give you a lot of options to customize the game, Almost everything in the environment is intractable and can be destroyed and I have yet to find any problems or bugs other than the frame rate problem that is noted below.Before buying this game there are some things you should note: 1. The game somewhat makes fun of chinese culture. Not as much as the first one though. 2. It is somewhat of a gore fest as you chop people in half with your katana. 3. MOST IMPORTANT this game has frame rate issues. I tend to think my PC is fairly good. It can run most games at a solid 60fps and if not turning of shadows or vsync would help. But no matter what I do I cant get this game to run any higher than 30~45fps. After looking around it seems you need a somewhat beast computer to make it run smoothly due to some issue I didn't look into much. So if you have a Xbone or PS4 I would recommend buying it on one or the other, But if you have a good PC go for it.			"

												Maybe one of the biggest surprises in the year 2013. Most people didn't had this on their plan. Shadow Warrior is a complete breath of fresh air in the shooter genre and thank god it proves that the shooter genre on the PC is not dead yet, but let's start from the beginning. What is good: Shadow Warrior is Flying Wild Hogs interpretation of the original Shadow Warrior. I must admit those guys are perfect when it comes to shooters on PC (they proved their awesome work with Hard Reset earlier). Just when you think there is no more hope for shooters FWH releases the second piece of software to show the world what shooters are made of. Positive to mention is that the difficulty is more moderate than in Hard Reset which was really challenging. The dialogs are very good and fun to listen to. Maybe not everyone's taste but definitely funny. Secrets are placed across the levels which are fun to find since they are kept in retro look. What is great: - The engine is amazing. Playing this game on ultra settings making the game a blast. IMO the engine seems to be scaleable and seems pretty good optimized since I'm able to run the game on lower settings on an older PC. - It's the first game where a melee weapon can be so much fun to fight with. While in other games melee weapons have a limited range and low damage values. the Katana in Shadow Warrior is very powerfull and fun to fight with and gets upgraded with special abilities which makes it a blast to use. What is awesome: the complete game is very well balanced. Sometimes I have the feeling that the Katana is a bit too powerfull compared with the other weapons what makes the game more fun to play instead of destroying anything. The great engine, the funny character(s) with its amusing dialogs, the very good level design and non-stop action make this game a great FPS in a genre where ""looking through an irogn sight"" dominate.

												I have enjoyed this game WAY more than any other single player FPS I have played. The sheer amount of power you feel while playing as Lo Wang is just great.There's a lot of nuance to its experience that most reviewers fail to mention. Now maybe it's better if you are surprised by them once you play the game;however...IF you're on the fence and want to know what makes this game STAND OUT..., THEN keep reading.**ONE story-related SPOILER AHEAD, but it is something you find out in the first chapter**(it's the 3rd '+')*******************************************************************+GREAT for relieving stress+can chop off enemy's leg just to watch him hop around and grab his leg in pain (each enemy is sliced n' diced exactly how it should be, with directional slices)+have this 'spirit' ally with you & it talks to you throughout the game (with comedic results)+/- it's an arena shooter, meaning you will kill a group of enemies, then explore/relax until you run into the next batch+can heal yourself with a magical skill (heals up to 60% of your max hp, but can be upgraded to more)- a few of the chapters are too long IMO (3 or 4 chapters took ≈2 hrs to complete)- no co-op or multi-player+are secret items to collect in every level+well balanced enemies/combat+can simultaneously do magic in one hand and use weapon in the other. oh yeah!20-23 hours to complete (story mode)for most people, but took me 25 hrs. in-game timeEdit 1:fixed typosEdit 2: After beating the game, I edited the line about ""a few of the chapters [being] too long...""Edit 3: added approx. time to complete campaignEdit 4: took out ""I love this game!"" so you don't think I'm totally biased. & added more explanation of the 'slicing and dicing' mechanics of this game under the pros & cons section			"

												Despite its old-school aspect Shadow Warrior manage to add something different to the FPS genre: swordplay! Drop your gun and draw your katana! A real warrior should rely on his melee weapon and not on his long range weapons. The humor in Shadow Warrior is full of pop culture content! Don't take this game too seriously! This game was made for pure enjoyment! If you want more old-school action FPS after Serious Sam BFE pick this one up! The game doesn't include multiplayer but don't worry. For 40$ you will get at least 15 hours of gameplay if you crank up the difficulty to the maximum. In the FPS field this game lenght is almost inexistant. Boss fights are memorable as they are humongous. Don't forget to add up replayability as you can unlock more skills more powers!Rating:9.0			"

												A extremely fun game with beautiful graphics, atmosphere and detailed world. One of the best games I have played in a long time. The combat is so much fun, slashing and destroying with your katana and powers, you have the ability to destroy almost everything around you. I prefer mostly using the katana, I find it much more fun than using guns which almost feel pointless as they don't seem as strong, effective or fun as the katana.  It has quite a good story line with amusing dialogue from Wang, upgradable weapons, powers and skills and hidden things to find for those who take the time to explore thoroughly.The only thing I didn't like is that you have to double tap a direction then hold and release lmb or rmb to use a katana ability or power which makes it feel a bit slow to execute.This game is a definite must play  I give it a rating of 8/10.

												Probably the most enjoyable first person action game (not saying shooter, because it has fantastic katana) of 2013.It's not just that it has incredibly satisfying both melee (with kombos and amazing enemy dismemberment) and shooting mechanics, full of upgrades, or that it has a KI magic moves as well, and plenty of character progression. No, what surprised me the most, is that this silly, crazy looking (and playing) game also has a wonderfully funny (and at proper times touching) story, with some of the best ""buddy movie"" style banter I have ever seen in a game.Oh and don't get me started on the shotgun. Oh, the shotgun. After you upgrade it, it is the most satisfying shotgun you will ever shoot.As far as technical stuff is concerned - I played entire game on GTX560Ti with x360pad, connected to 55"" TV, and it was a grand experience. Played perfectly and suffered zero bugs or crashes.Click on that buy icon, now.			"

 Positive + The sword gameplay is simply a blast; the gore effects especially make sure that chopping up enemies is always satisfying+ The upgrade system enhances both sword and gun gameplay, as well as giving a large variety of ways to give slight improvements to your character+ Graphics are very well detailed, including both gorgeous backgrounds and high quality textures, without a single drop in frame rate+ Manages to effectively capture the charm of the original game and Lo Wang himself (minus the racism), including many comedic references to the original game and pop-culture in general+ Lengthy campaign for a modern first-person shooter (approximately 10 hours on Normal difficulty), with interesting characters and a neat little story making sure to keep you entertained until the end. Negative - The guns seem lacking in firepower for the most part (especially the submachine gun); the sword gameplay completely overshadows it. Verdict “Easily the best FPS from 2013, and one of my all-time favourites. The extensive swordplay alone makes the game fun and memorable enough, as well as the character Lo Wang reinstating his place in the modern era of gaming. If you’re a fan of first-person shooters or games in general, I’d highly recommend it.” 8.5/10 TJBs  "

												Just finished playing and I have to say the game was great!  9/10.  There was only 1 or 2 areas that felt like a bad case of plot-itus driving Lo Wang to do something that I thought was off.  But otherwise it was a fantastic FPS kill/slash/maim experience.  The backdrop storyline and 8 bit Easter eggs were an appreciated extra.  If you played and beat the 1st game then this is going to knock your socks off, if you didn't then this might entice you play the first one.  As for level design and graphics I thought they were solid, it wasn't one of those hey lets update an 80's / 90's game with cool graphics so you spend 100 years going through endlessly huge levels that compensated for bad graphics back in the day.  There were a couple environmental's that were a little weak in design or rendering but the lighting is the best hands down I have seen for a FPS (Splinter Cell does not count in that genre).Get the game you will enjoy it!

												Despite its old-school aspect Shadow Warrior manage to add something different to the FPS genre: swordplay! Drop your gun and draw your katana! A real warrior should rely on his melee weapon and not on his long range weapons. The humor in Shadow Warrior is full of pop culture content! Don't take this game too seriously! This game was made for pure enjoyment! If you want more old-school action FPS after Serious Sam BFE pick this one up! The game doesn't include multiplayer but don't worry. For 40$ you will get at least 15 hours of gameplay if you crank up the difficulty to the maximum. In the FPS field this game lenght is almost inexistant. Boss fights are memorable as they are humongous. Don't forget to add up replayability as you can unlock more skills more powers!Rating:9.0			"

												This game is a legitimately cool FPS in the style of old. Linear level design, but great design with loads of secrets hidden inside them. Loads of snarks and one-liners that make you grin broadly, but the story offers some actual depth to it. Ten different weapons, their handling feeling just right. Easy to access, but offering a challenge for people that want it. Not that many different types of enemies, but killing them never gets old. And then there is Lo Wang. And if you want to clean up the mess you left... there comes a free copy of the ""Shadow Warrior: Viscera Clean Up Detail"".10 / 10 Fortune cookies. If you're still uncertain, try out the demo.			"

												26 Apr 2015 (21h):It's been a while since I added something to this review. In the meantime I've finished the game on normal, and have started over on Insane up to and including the first boss battle.I think they could've made the skills a little more interesting, but it's only really starting to bother me a third into my second playthrough ... so that's just a replayability issue. I fully intend to finish on Insane (maybe even give Heroic - no checkpoints - a try), I still haven't grown tired of the humor, nor slashing my way through hordes of enemies with a katana.18 Apr 2015 (6h):The killing is fun, the story is fine, the humour is excellent - though silly and it's aestetically pleasing.Unfortunately the screen wobble when running is a bit nauseating, so I've got to take breaks from playing often.Those fortune cookies are hilarious!17 Apr 2015 (1h):Just started and damn, this game is such fun. And funny. Really looking forward to playing more in the future!(2h)I found some references to old Shadow Warrior (secret areas), ^^Also: the upgrade menu is so pretty!			"

The graphics are great and the optimisation is on point. I played on hard, presumably more demons on screen at a time and never saw any slow downs or hitches.

												This game has so much to offer.  I will point out the only thing that could have made it better for me is a few additional monster types, however, the way the game is setup, you can dispose of them in many different ways and I can see where each enemy would involve a lot of animations and coding.  The enemies exhibit a good of moves that change the pace around and are very detailed, as is the whole game really.  I took as many screenshots in this game as I did with games like STALKER and METRO because I was just in awe.  It also features a very unique to FPS system of being able to upgrade your weapons as well as passive and active abilities and sword attacks that all have there own relation to dispatching various enemies.  The story is fun but features a great skip scene option for those of us that don't wish to watch it all.  The developers put their heart and soul into this game, it is fun, exciting, beautiful and unique.  A rare combination to find these days.  I rate it a 95%.			"

												Shadow Warrior is a really smart game. The writing is geniunely well done, groan inducing when it wants to be, funny when it wants to be, and awesome when it wants to be. Lo Wang is a character that I didn't expect to have any kind of growth, but the story and character arcs in this game were surprisingly big hooks for me as I played further in.Of course, the big draw is how well it does combat. SW paces the introduction of new mechanics and weapons at a steady enough rate that just when you've gotten a pretty good understanding of how one works, and maybe even sunk an upgrade or two into one, you'll have a new toy to play with. These toys range from new sword attacks you personally choose from your Karma based skill tree, Chi based abilities, not all of which are offensve, from your Dark Ki Crystal (Collectible items found in the world) based skill tree, or new parts and alternate fire modes for you guns that you flat out purchase from the gun menu. All these menus and trees are accessed at any time  by just pressing U, so quickly adding to your arsenal is never an issue.The Katana is powerful, but not to the point where it renders other weapons obsolete right out the gate. That being said, players who take advantage of the games skill and abilitiys being mapped as they are will find they can probably play through SW without firing a shot, if they so desire. Sword skills are performed by hitting two direction keys and then holding M1 to charge the attack, where as Chi abilities are done the same, but with M2. Keeping in mind just how good the swordplay feels, and those systems interact with each other beautifully.If the idea of Bulletstorm with traditional old-school FPS weapons (and a crossbow, katana, and magic), with character progression that immediately affects the gameplay sounds appealing to you, Shadow Warrior is your game.

												A game that re-imagines 90’s classic, and though it changed the angle in humour a bit, it is a great successor. Gameplay-wise it is FPS with added fairly developed swordplay mechanics (but don’t expect much, it is a roller coaster not instructional course), some RPG elements allowing you to develop skills of your character, ki powers, and weapons.Level design is quite OK, neither linear nor too free to roam. Though some of the secrets are just “walk around the corner” and others are “know where to turn back or door behind you closes and you can never get secret that only became available when you stopped through it”, both of which aren’t too much fun.Enemies AI is sufficiently complex, but I am easily satisfied with just the amount of them, though there were couple of battles with ridiculously many waves of enemies and insufficient ammunition.Story has some strength, meaningfulness and depth, overall look is painting-like good, music is quite OK. So, while having some flaws here and there, the game gave me some 20 fun hours.P.S. And also thanks to this one the original “Shadow Warrior” got re-released on Steam. Go get it, too.			"

												This Re-interpretation of the classic 1997 shooter actually pleasantly suprised me in several ways in just how good it is.The combat system for a start is immensely satisfying, The sword combat is implemented so well that along with chivalry it's the most fun i've had doing first person melee combat.Guns are also really fun to use thanks to the dismemberment of all enemy limbs in the game as well as some of the more unique weapons from the original game such as the enemy heart and head.The graphics are relatively eye pleasing featuring a lot of colour, rich texture quality and a nice variety of environments to explore in, although monotony does set in at times through either the same type of environment repeating themselves too many times (Enough of the damn Bamboo Forests) or a level going on for too long.The plot was also somewhat suprising in how intriguing it was and the characters are funny/interesting enough to not be annoying, it's also a decent sized game at around a dozen hours and you can get plenty of replay value maxing out all of the characters abilites and unlocking all of his skills.So in summary as long as you don't expect a true remake of the original shooter you should have a blast playing this and for me this was one of the best shooters of 2013.

The combat is viceral, bloody, and rewarding, the upgrades are good and worthwhile.  Bulletstorm's rewarding-stylish killing mechanism makes a partial return, giving you more karma to upgrade for combat mastery.The main and support character are both well written for what they are, and this is geniuinely one of the funniest games I've played in a long time.The only downsides are that there is something of a lack of enemy variety after a certain point, but the game more than stands up for itself regardless.Also I wouldn't recommend playing on a difficulty higher than normal, it kind of makes enemies into bullet sponges.  I'd have preferred a difficulty that made enemies do more damage than take a shitzillion bullets to kill, but regardless, it's not really a problem.All in all, if you're a fan of the FPS genre, you owe it to yourself to play this unique gem of a game.

												“You’ve got Wang!”That’s right folks, Lo Wang returns in Shadow Warrior, a reimagining of 3D Realms’ classic FPS. Flying Wild Hogs has re-created another old-school shooter in a generation where many AAA shooters have evolved to eschew health packs for health regeneration while focusing on big, grandiose set pieces. Shadow Warrior bucks the current trend by having health packs, linear gameplay, and smaller scripted events.As Wang, a corporate agent for Zilla Enterprises, I was sent to broker a deal for the Nobitsura Kage – an ancient sword. However the deal went south and I suddenly found myself enfolded into a story filled with dark and mystical forces while trying to recover the sword. No longer was I fighting just human thugs, but demonic minions too; all with a spirit sidekick. And while the story might start out simply enough, by the end the scope broadens.But don’t let me fool you into thinking that this is a completely somber story. True to the classic game the re-make contains a lot of humor that kept me smiling and laughing as I played. From the dialogue, quips from Wang, and even the fortune cookies I picked up, I had a lot of fun from beginning to end. I’d have to agree with a particular cookie that read, “A Wang in the hand is worth two in the bush.”To read the rest of my review visit Press2Reset: http://press2reset.com/reviews/review-shadow-warrior/ "

I'd have preferred a difficulty that made enemies do more damage than take a shitzillion bullets to kill, but regardless, it's not really a problem.All in all, if you're a fan of the FPS genre, you owe it to yourself to play this unique gem of a game.

												This Re-interpretation of the classic 1997 shooter actually pleasantly suprised me in several ways in just how good it is.The combat system for a start is immensely satisfying, The sword combat is implemented so well that along with chivalry it's the most fun i've had doing first person melee combat.Guns are also really fun to use thanks to the dismemberment of all enemy limbs in the game as well as some of the more unique weapons from the original game such as the enemy heart and head.The graphics are relatively eye pleasing featuring a lot of colour, rich texture quality and a nice variety of environments to explore in, although monotony does set in at times through either the same type of environment repeating themselves too many times (Enough of the damn Bamboo Forests) or a level going on for too long.The plot was also somewhat suprising in how intriguing it was and the characters are funny/interesting enough to not be annoying, it's also a decent sized game at around a dozen hours and you can get plenty of replay value maxing out all of the characters abilites and unlocking all of his skills.So in summary as long as you don't expect a true remake of the original shooter you should have a blast playing this and for me this was one of the best shooters of 2013.

												Fantastic game. I didn't like Hard Reset all that much (it had good ideas, but overall gameplay was really badly put together) and did not expect Shadow Warrior 2013 to be any good. I expected it to be way too ""modern"" or misunderstanding why mid-90s FPS games were good. But the game turned out to be a pleasant surprise.It is, probably, the best modern reinterpretation of the oldschool FPS, as I liked it. Not just a linear gorefest with arenas, but a much more diverse, fantastically looking FPS with pretty huge levels and one of the best first person blade combat systems ever. Genuinly fun humor, good old one-liners, fantatic mix of the old health pack and manual regenaration healing systems, unexpectedly good storyline, fun to find secrets... In many ways, this is what should have been done with Duke Nukem Forever, if developers of that game wanted to ""modernise"" it.Wang out of wang. Would wang again.			"

												This game is a face-paced, very true to life sword-fighting physics, and just a whole lot of fun to rip through and find the secrets you miss and get the accomplishments. You'll WANT to re-play this over and over. It's truly a hit! The weapon/sword use is way too much fun. Think Serious Sam but 100x better!! Also to note the use of powers and skills you gain throughout the game makes things more interesting as you play on. So try it, i dare you!!!			"

												I really enjoyed this game quite a bit. I've played some of the original Shadow Warrior, which I have mixed feelings about (the main downsides to it, for me, were the incredibly immature humor and the sometimes cheap level/enemy design). This game however, I think is in a league of its own. Story-wise, I actually thought this was pretty enjoyable for what it is. At times it felt sort of like a Suda 51 game, with regard to how crazy the story/combat could get, and the massive number of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥jokes. The humor is still irreverent and silly, but for the most part I found it much more clever and amusing than the original's. I also loved the old-school over-the-top action of this game's combat; there's a lot of projectile-dodging, and combat in general is focused on being very agile and getting into the fray, rather than hanging back behind cover and taking pot-shots at enemies. I also like the way regenerating health is handled; it's not automatic, so you have to initiate it yourself, and it never fully heals your health meter, so there is an incentive to not get hurt, and to find med packs around the level.One thing I... didn't necessarily dislike, but wish could have been handled a little differently, is the integration of combat into the game's levels; most levels fall into a formula of moving through an unpopulated area, finding chests filled with money and ammo and the like (with some secrets if you take the time to explore, though it's never essential), then getting into what is essentially a combat arena, where you fight hordes of enemies. I personally would have liked to see more opportunities to engage in combat that wasn't arena-focused; perhaps having enemies sneak up on you from behind as you're exploring, or having to fight enemies while traversing platforms? It also would have been nice to have some traps to maneuver around, as well as more mazelike environments/puzzles; I feel those aspects of old-school design would have been nice to see. As it is, this game feels sort of like an arcadey beat-em-up in first-person, with sections clearly marked for combat standing in sharp contrast to sections marked for exploration; which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I wish more variety with regard to level design could have been done. Some of the environments look amazing, but for the most part the actions you do when traversing them don't really switch themselves up much.Overall, I do think of this as being a great game, though it's worth noting this is not exactly a classic-style FPS, despite definitely taking some influence from them. If you can accept that, then this is definitely worth playing.			"

												Shadow Warrior is a modernized retelling of the classic 3DRealms shooter from 1997. It features the ninja protagonist ""Lo Wang"" on his journey to retrieve an ancient sword after hell breaks loose in the city. It features beautiful asian landscapes, plenty of demons to kill and first person swordplay that is actually incredibly fun and innovative. Oh, and there are guns, but who wants to use those? The raunchy humor and blatant stereotypes of the original have been significantly toned down for this remake which might be disappointing to some hardcore fans such as myself.THE GOOD+Swordplay is fantastic+Secrets are fun to find+Upgradable Weapons & skills+Enviroments are beautiful & amazingly detailed+Cute little references to the original game+The soundtrack is actually really good+Campaign is a satisfying lengthTHE BAD-Unless the jokes are coming from a fortune cookie, they usually fall flat.-Guns dont really have much kick to them.-Story was kind of hard to follow (at least for me)-Protagonist seems bland compared to the original-Objectives and enemys become repetitive after a whileTHE UGLYBunnies ♥♥♥♥ing eachother (Don't ask)BOTTOM LINEShadow Warrior does a damn good job at what it aims to do, from the superb sword fighting to the amazing enviroments. Despite the fact the game can become repetitive at times, it dosent subtract from the fun you can have here.PROTIP: I recommend playing with the HUD and Crosshairs off for maximum immersion. :)Recommended: 7/10			"

												I did not expect a remake for a classic such as Shadow Warrior. But after their cyberpunk FPS, Hard Reset, Flying Wild Hog decided to keep the old school shooter formula and use a more recognisable name. I like how the game does not take itself seriously - while the story is somewhat serious (suddenly demons appear out of nowhere) it does not stop our protagonist, Lo Wang, from delivering one-liners here and there (usually, after a successful slicing up of an enemy). Even the conversations he has with his companion make you smile and some of the references to other products of the entertainment industry can be hilarious. In the golden era of FPS games melee combat was uninteresting. In fact, after a level or two the melee weapon was never used again. Shadow Warrior used an equally weak weapon in the form of a katana and this is what the remake keeps; in fact, with the abilities and upgrades the player can acquire later on this weapon becomes even more useful. Also, while the rest of the arsenal consists of the usual firearms (submachine guns, shotgun, grenade launcher etc.) this array of weapons is also upgradable so here you also have some nice surprises - in order to have all upgrades and skills in place you need to finish the game once more in new game plus mode.Hard Reset was rather repetitive. Both the environment and the tasks you needed to carry out remained pretty much the same throughout the story. Shadow Warrior employs different surroundings each time and with the scripted events and various tasks you have the desired variety at hand throughout your quest. And while the game was not developed as an AAA title some of the levels can be jaw-dropping. The music accompanying your missions is equally good. Then of course you have a lot of collectibles and dozens of achievements.Shadow Warrior is one of the best old school style FPS games out there. The developer support is also commendable - they do listen to you and ever since its release date last September they have kept upgrading the game and constantly fixing any issues players encounter. Thumbs-up!			"

												The combat feels very fluid and controls are amazing. It feels right when you hit an enemy with your sword, and switching between guns doesnt take you out of the moment. Combos are easy to perform, but doesnt mean you will perform them by accident. In big fights you feel like a true badass when you switch back and forth between weapons and perform special moves  and obliterate everything. The story is rather forgetful and I forgot what was going on halfway through which was a shame. There is a part in the game where a lot of conversation is empty (you will know what I mean when it happens) which ruins a good part of the game. The humor between the 2 characters is quite entertaining and it goes downhill a bit when this is missing for a good while9/10			"

Also  there secrets i'll explain there mainly hide areas in the game where there rooms witch feature the same pixlated graphics and 2D people and props like chairs and plants. So it's like steping back into the 1997 version some are easy to find overs take time. Like today i found a spot on a wall with pixalated graphics i though odd so i crouched and walked towards it to find a secrect room. it's cool and thankfully there's loads. this is no duke nukem forever meaning Shadow Warrior is not trying to play catch up with COD it knows where and what it is a throw back to the Original you can tell bcause duck and cover and guns take a back seat to let melee with your sword talk center stage. there's health packs and Lo Wang opens his own doors.Just 1 small complain if you played the original you will miss the old voice actor as he was funny as hell but to be fair i do not think he would of work dwell in this version.

												After a great Hard reset of flying wild hog came time for Shadow Warrior. Original released in 1997. I have not played the original so I will not be compared. But I will try to say something about the new version. You can see similar arrangement as in HR. Sprint, fight,bosses and different functions weapons. However, in my opinion, HR is a better game from Flying Wild Hog. But let's get to the meat. The graphics are good but uneven. Picturesque locations delight the eye and not once can admire the work of graphic designers. But up close the graphics are not so great. No less is fine. I don't play on highest graphics settings. Gameplay is good and fight with katana is very good. To bring a special need such a blow, press 2x W and LMB. When it is mastered can make fun. However, a larger number of different enemies will be easier to use other weapons. At least to me it was easier. Weapons are many but some are not very effective and the feeling of shooting in some of the less impressive. Unfortunately, sometimes the game is frustrating. For me it was for this that some of the levels and enemies were poorly designed.  Level of exploding enemies is terribly weak. A fight with the boss very easy and unsatisfying. The music is atmospheric and the sounds of enemies and weapons are at a good level. The game is not really in my style (kung fu) but I have fun. The story and the main character are fine although his statements are not as funny as Serious Sam or Duke Nukem. Sometimes they are childish and not funny. The game has a lot of easter eggs and funny moments like Fortune cookies. Some jokes can be understood only did the Poles because the Polish game studio. But it should not be a big problem for other players. The game also has a survival mode but only single so it's a big minus, and does not have a multiplayer mode. In summary. The game is good and I recommend you buy it at some sales. Graphics 8/10 Audio 8+/10 Gameplay 8+/10 Final verdict 7+/10.			"

												This game easily earns the title for 'Best FPS of 2013'.Hordes of enemies, crazy weapons, cheesy dialog and one-liners...if you, like me, hate modern FPS games and miss the good old days when FPS games actually focused on the First Person Shooting - this is the game for you!The major strength of this game is the Katana gameplay, which turns out to be one of the best - if not the best - implementations of a melee mechanic in an FPS I have ever seen. The sheer enjoyment of slicing enemies to bits will carry you through the entire game.As much as I enjoyed Shadow Warrior, a few drawbacks need to be addressed:1. The Katana, being such an amazing weapon, tends to overshadow the gunplay of the game. The other weapons don't seem to generate the same level of enjoyment, and the game progression system itself seems to encourage the use of the Katana over the guns. As a result, the only shooting I found myself doing in the game was a forced result of the karma rating and the lack of ability to slice up the major bosses. If I could kill the bosses without using the guns - I probably would.2. Not all of the guns are fun to use. Lo Wang's crossbow, in particular, was a disappointment. The gun has no accuracy advantage over other weapons, has a projectile travel time and doesn't seem to provide a stealth element when engaging unaware enemies. As a result, I found myself using it mainly to detonate ""mines"".3. Some areas in the game seem to lead into a massive frame rate loss, which is something an FPS game should avoid at all costs.In spite of those drawbacks, the game is great fun and definitely a step in the right direction as far as FPS games go.

												Fast paced FPS, though you can do a lot of the combat using your Katana. with a good story. Positves: Immersive story, refreshingly different form any other FPS I have played. Multiple combat options, with various upgrades to weapons and your abilities. Fantastic map designs, awesome graphics for 2013. Great voice actiing. Well written dialog, lots of humor, if sometimes a bit corny.Negatives: May be too graphic for some peoples tastes. Could have used longer breaks in combat, not much puzzle solving, so combat fatigue can settle in.If FPS is a genre you enjoy, then this is a must have for your collection. Combat is on a managable learning curve. and to get the most ""Karma"" which you use to buy skill, you need to execute a variety of attacks well. "

												Shadow Warrior is a in many aspects successful reimagining of the 3D Realms classic from 1997. In this review I will describe how it holds up in comparison and try to cut right to the chase.The level design isn't quite as open and doesn't offer as many secrets as the original, but you can tell that Flying Wild Hog put a lot of love and work into this project. The combat is extremely fun and satisfying, especially the different katana moves. The weapons are varied, fun to use and none of them feel unneccessary or even useless. The story is fairly cheesy, so I guess you could say they nailed this aspect. Shadow Warrior and a serious story don't mix as far as I'm concerned. The voice acting is great, even though I miss Lo Wang's original voice. The quips are hit and miss, but overall quite funny. What really impresses me about this game is that it feels like an almost perfect blend of ""retro"" and modern game design. Many developers have aspired to do that and most of them failed. Flying Wild Hog managed to pull it off, which deserves much respect.I've spent about 21 hours on Shadow Warrior and enjoyed it a lot. I'm planning to replay it at some point.Bottom line: If you aren't offended by strong video game violence and dark, sometimes childish humor, you will have a great time with this game!			"

												Might contain spoilers. WILL contain parentheses (a lot).When this came out I was furious that someone had the nerve to call a game Shadow Warrior, exactly the same as the 1997 3D Realms title (as you can probably tell from that attitude, I loved that game as a kid). As the negative emotions got weaker (and the price lower) I decided to give it a try and I have to say it does its name justice. The many references to the original game didn't feel forced (and weren't overdone), and paired with modern engine and eyecandy, it was pretty damn awesome. There were some little things mostly associated with it being a 2013 game that I didn't like (certain gameplay mechanics, but mostly a number of things too small to mention), but overall I'd give this like 9/10 if I were to use numbers.Pros:+ Very good melee combat system. The special moves (including a ranged attack) make the sword a viable and even preferrable weapon for most of the game.+ Good engine. Haven't had any problems with hit detection or gamebreaking glitches.+ Nice aesthetics overall. I really liked the 2D cutscenes.+ Different sorts of environment from traditional japanese to modern industrial, topped with some surreal sky landscapes, much like the original game.+ Plentiful throwbacks to the original 1997 Shadow Warrior (either references or parts of SW1997 levels in secrets).Cons:- A little too linear level design in places. A ""secret"" is something you find if you wander more than ten feet off the beaten path.- Unentertaining bosses. I only played on Normal difficulty so far so this might not be objective, but they felt not-so-challenging, it just takes forever to take them down because of the tedious weak spots.- Most ranged weapons felt meh. Like, I'm already used to unrealistic shotgun spread in games, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ the shotgun in this has like a 90° arc spread - no point using it at any range longer than point blank.			"

YouTube™ Video: Shadow Warrior (2013) - PC - Review 

			Views: 835		

			YOU NO MESS WITH LO WANG! PvtHudson takes a look at the reboot of the 1997 classic. Available on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/233130/ Support me on Patreon:...		

A text transcript is provided below.Shadow Warrior is a first person shooter released back in 2013 where you run around with a plentiful array of weaponry with something as simple as a sword, to something as powerful as a “duke nukem” launcher, and to something as over the top as giant demon heads.The gameplay is right as rain for this game. All the controls feel smooth and it is perfect for anyone who likes action. With the exception of some occasional puzzles and the drudgery of trying to navigate the hallways of Shadow Warrior with its lack of directional markers to tell you where to go other than making the doorway you need to progress through glow, this game is constant fighting. The first half of the game is very well paced with short 20 to about 30 minute missions where you get to fight through all different sorts of unique areas and meet all the different enemy types. From these weird flying harpy demons, to giant minotaur looking mini bosses, and to rolling exploding green poisonous de monic balls of death. If you're looking for solid first person shooting mechanics and controls, you've found it.The graphics of this game look great for 2013 and still good today! The sounds compliment it all perfectly and there's a lot of things retro for anyone who is coming from the old shadow warrior game that this reboot is based off of. There's plenty of little hidden easter eggs throughout the game that you can find that I personally don't understand since I didn't play the original, but they still made me laugh every time I saw them. One con to note about the graphics though is that when you get up close and start cutting up human enemies, the animations seem to fall apart and appear retro in quality. I'm not sure if that's a feature or bad animation, but its very laughable in its lack of quality amidst the updated look of the game.The story of the game is extremely comical and interesting if not entirely common to advance due to how much action spaces out story segments. It ended on a bit of a serious note which was a bit unsettling though since the game had tried so hard to be funny that a serious ending didn't really feel like it fit. It was however made comical because its the first time a cutscene ever shows your character in third person, where you get to see that they didn't bother rendering your character's head outside of reflections and you get to see yourself sitting there with nothing but a mouth and eyes, no face to to be seen. There's a lot that doesn't get solved in the game though, making it very obvious that there was going to be a sequel since the ending is very unsatisfying and in the end you really don't feel like you accomplished anything.The games pacing is probably the biggest con the game has. While it starts out nicely spread and manageable with up to 30 minute missions…the later missions take 40 to about 50 minutes each which are extremely tiring when some of them don't even give you a cutscene to help advance the story, just some basic comedic dialogue with literally zero story progression. They start packing each level with larger and larger amounts of the same repetitive enemies jumping out at you after every couple of steps and it really just becomes cumbersome to carry on. What's worse is that they even start repeating the levels towards the end. You'll run through the same rooms and hallways more times than you can count with no sight of anything new.There's a very strange delay whenever you hit the U key to upgrade your weapons and skills. It seems to get worse as the game goes on as well, but it either reverted to its original state towards the end or I just got so used to it I stopped noticing it. I'm not sure what the deal with that is but it was very frustrating to start which is why I feel the need to mention it.Overall I definitely recommend Shadow Warrior. Even by today's standards this is still a good game. I give a 7/10. It was fun. It wasn't amazing, but this is probably the first arcadey shooter that pits you against the world with no friendlies and minimal story progression that I actually enjoyed, potentially the first one I've ever finished. Do not buy it for its full $40 price. You'll be paying $4 per hour of gameplay. Wait for it to go on sale, and then definitely pick it up.			"

												I recently finished Shadow Warrior as it went on sale a couple weeks ago and as I was already highly interested in the game by the humoristic moments they showed in the trailers I decided to finally get it.Now having finished the game I was quite impressed by the amount of quality they managed to put into it, while the game is pretty linear it does provide you with a pretty lovely and rather comedic story combined with some great action from slashing demon with your katana or just blasting their heads off with an a four barrel shotgun.The graphics of the game were also quite nice to look at, not to say they were the best but there were moments that I was baffled by the quality of the beautiful scenery that made me even stand still and just look around to then kill a couple more waves of demons. The gameplay was pretty fast paced with enough breathing room in between to prepare yourself for the next battle or for more story development. In general the gameplay was quite good and I really liked the comedy factor brought into the story, together with that the story was pretty properly buildup and combined with really great action I have to say that I really did enjoy playing this game.All in all this game sure was fun to play!Overall Score: 9/10			"

												A very inconsistant game that hovers over mediocrity through good visuals and pretty fun melee combat. Every aspect of this game varies wildy in quality: Sometimes the visuals are incredible, and sometimes you might think you're looking at an early PS3 game. Sometimes the enemies surprise you with their actions and attacks, and sometimes they just sit there in front of a gun turret waiting for you to shoot at them. Sometimes the game plays flawlessly at a high frame rate, sometimes you load a game and suddenly you're halfway through the floor and running at 15FPS. It tries to be reminicent of fast paced 90's FPS shooters, then adds in unnecessarily serious story elements and some seriously slow bulletsponge bossfights that completely suck the fun out of the experience. Definitely not worth it, unless it's on sale for less than 10 dollars.			"

												Hold Any Key to Skip!  Finished this on Hard.  Insane will have to wait.  Shadow Warrior while possessing kick♥♥♥♥♥combat mechanics is too long and much like Hard Reset the desire to continue in EX mode wanes.  Hold Any Key to Skip!  The boss fights are indeed memorable but not pleasantly.  Hold Any Key to Skip!  For a team of developers on the precipice of delivering an entire package, their boss fights are an exercise in tedium having you running around an arena for ammo like a dog looking for a hydrant on which to lift its leg to relieve itself.  Hold Any Key to Skip!  The environments are beautiful and an array of graphical options await.  Hold Any Key to Skip!  Hard Reset players will notice environmental hazards to electrify enemies carried forth as well as their sound effects and physics.  Additional environmental hazards have been added as well that fit the inherent theme.  Hold Any Key to Skip!  Non rendered and drawn cut scenes follow in the footsteps of Hard Reset as well.  They're low budget but serve their purpose.  Hold Any Key to Skip!   Secrets abound and if that's what gets you off then you're well taken care of.  Hold Any Key to Skip!  Weapons are a mixed bag.  The shotgun is laughable however every other weapon is well done.  Hold Any Key to Skip!  Certain enemies will unwillingly donate their organs to you so you can use them against their fellow hordes. Hold Any Key to Skip!  Weapon upgrades are available at any time given you've acquired enough coin as are Katana abilities which can be acquired via an alternate currency. Hold Any Key to Skip!  Shadow Warrior is a kick♥♥♥♥♥game and one you most definitely want to play but please do remember;  Hold Any Key to Skip!			"

												I had fun with this game for a couple of hours, then I suffered through a couple more hours that were exactly the same as the first couple, hoping this was just a minor pacing issue and something would eventually happen to break the monotony. It did not. As far as I can tell this game is a hack-and-slash through and through, and the way you're going to play it is by executing the same special move over and over to kill all of the incredibly non-threatening enemies, and occasionally shoot at the flying ones when they don't for whatever reason fly down low enough to be stabbed in the throat.Oh, wait, no. There is SOMETHING that breaks up the monotony, from time to time. Unfortunately that something is overly time consuming boss fights that just boil down to ""move in circles to avoid his attacks while shooting at his weak points for MASSIVE DAMAGE"". Sadly, there is not even a giant enemy crab to make this seem like a parody. It's just the actual way the boss fights work. They are the ultimate low point of the game even though they're the only time you ever really shoot anything.I have nothing against the developers, I think they set out to make a good game here, and they've been supporting it. I don't even REALLY have anything against the game... but it's another nail in the coffin for old school shooters. Calling this game an old school shooter is glaringly inaccurate for one simple reason - you don't actually shoot anything. The guns are pitifully ineffective while the sword will dispatch most enemy types in a single special attack. The whole melee component of this isn't even challenging because you have a superman dash to clear the distance of an entire room in a split second and, failing that, most of the enemies are melee anyway.The secrets are also not very secretive, and a lot of the places I thought to look for them turned out to be totally inaccessible thanks to some invisible barrier. Not very old school. The highest difficulty level has managed to not kill me once despite extremely reckless melee only play. Not very old school. In fact, I don't even find myself using my healing spell (healing on demand in an old school shooter?) because not only are health pickups numerous, you eventually get an ability that simply heals an absurd amount of damage whenever you hit something with your sword, which is to say, whenever you hit something because you always use your sword.Overall I would give this game something like a 6/10 as a hack-and-slash with some guns and minor RPG elements, which is what it is. As an old school shooter I would give it a 0. Buy it if you're not at all looking for what it's advertised as.			"

												Shadow Warrior is an awesome game. Period. I believe it is rare to find a game that is so tailored for an immersed and thoroughly entertaining experience. The setting and environments are top notch, the music is engaging and mood-defining. The gameplay is very gratifying and tactically versatile. The game is very challenging. I think what I like most about it is that they don't baby you into the game. You figure it out on your own. The game is a powerful homage to old school hardcore games. Secrets are not easy to find, high scores are not always simple, and you'll be damned if the game is lacking testosterone.If you're wondering, I played through on normal difficulty and the campaign lasted me 13 hours. That's fairly impressive for games nowadays. I died about 9 times, 5 of which occurred on the final stages. There is no multiplayer and I'd say the replay value is considerably low once you've beaten it once. But I can't say the content of the game is lacking. It didn't feel that way. And I gotta say, I can't wait for more. The game is absolutely beautiful (and demanding) and a memorable experience. I hope more games follow this trend.			"

												This reimagining strikes a nice balance with its main Character Lo Wang.  He's toned down a bit from the original, but not too much.The gameplay is generally great fun.  The environment is full of things that go boom (ala Hard Reset).  The level design is fine; it is generally easy enough to figure out where to go while still leaving one plenty of room to explore.  There were two locations where I gave up and checked a walkthrough to find some button / elevator whose small glow I had overlooked for a while.There is an over-reliance on monster closets, but destroying wave after wave of enemies is saved from being a chore by the absolute glee of carving through them with a variety of interesting weapons (foremost being the katana).  Occasional greater enemies provide more of a challenge and force one to juggle weapons abilities and powers.  The boss fights are also reminiscent of Hard Reset, and didn't end up being too frustrating.I'd love to see a Duke Nukem reboot from these guys, something more modest and just plain shooty than DNF.  Shadow Warrior was my favorite game of 2013 (of those I played of course, but to be recommended regardless)			"

												An absolute hidden gem of a game that surprised me with each and every aspect of it's design.I was not expecting this much depth out of the story or mechanics; specifically in the upgrade/skill system. While the game does have certain old school FPS sensibilities (collecting ammo/health, finding secrets, unlocking doors to progress) it does not neglect the narrative and totally sucked me into the story with decent writing and top-notch voice acting and all that made me want to continue playing the game for more than just the gameplay. The gameplay (which even on it's own) is amazing and the visceral feeling of gunning down, blowing up and, most importantly, slicing up enemies is truly a delight. Especially especially using the katana which (in my humble opinion) is the best melee weapon I've ever used in a game so far. The fact that the developers have taken the time and effort to include many many gore-y animations for when you go on a rampage shows they know what makes for a satisfying experience. As for the other weapons: all of them are wonderfully designed with alternate firemodes each and are generally a joy to use in their own ways; after all these are some of the Painkiller devs we're talking about.Finally, the cherry on top for me would be the sense of humor and the (non-pandering) pop-culture references which really make you feel at home with everything from Star Wars to Taxi Driver. Everything just has a fun-loving and playful feel to it.So, yeah, I haven't covered everything, but seriously watch the trailers and download the demo (yeah.. remember those?) and then seriously consider purchasing this little slice of gold.

												Not really sure how I'm even going to begin to start reviewing this game, as I have so many things I'd like to say about it. This is the most fun I've had on a game for a very long time (not to say that other games that I play aren't fun, rather, that this game is incredibly fun).(Scroll to bottom for tl;dr review)You play as the humourous, katana-wielding badass that is Lo Wang, who starts out on a quest to retrieve a sword for his master. Along the way, you bump into a demon called Hoji, who befriends you and follows you round for the rest of the game. There's lots of funny banter between the two of them, as well as the funny remarks Lo Wang makes throughout the game, which leads me to the first point.. the humour. The humour in the game is fantastic. ""Wang"" is incorporated into much of what Lo Wang says, usually with subtle innuendos like ""You want some Wang?"" when fighting enemies. Fortune cookies scattered throughout the game often have something humourous to say; it's always amusing to pick them up and read the witty humour. A few of my favourites are:""Having sex is like playing bridge. If you don't have a good partner, you'd better have a great hand.""""He who takes advice from a cookie is sure to crumble.""""Cardboard belt is a waist of paper.""""That's what Ki said.""""All your cookie are belong to us.""""The good news: You're not paranoid. The badnews: Everyone is actually trying to kill you.""""Don't sweat the petty things and don't pet the sweaty things. - George Carlin""""You will stop procrastinating. Later.""Unless you've played the game, you're probably wondering what the reference to Ki is (mentioned above). Ki is a form of energy used in the game, that allows you to perform many special actions, with or without your katana. Throughout the game, you will occasionally collect Ki crystals, that grant you new powers, and also allow you to upgrade them. These powers include healing, blocking, and immobilising your enemies by thrusting them up into the air, or knocking them down. They're simple to execute too: double tap a movement key, and hold the right mouse button to perform. The key binds are simple in this game. Being left-handed, I like to use the arrow keys and the right-hand part of the keyboard, and not have to worry about too many keybinds. Despite this, you are still able to perform everything with ease, from Ki powers to katana techniques, to the alternate fire option for your weapons. Ah yes, weapons...The katana is incredibly fun to use. As well as just having your standard 'hack and slash' option, you also have access to various katana techniques, purchased with karma points (see next paragraph). These include powerful thrusts, spinning attacks, and long-ranged attacks. The special techniques with the katana are accessed the same way as with Ki powers, except by holding the left mouse button instead. As if the game wasn't fun enough with a katana, you also carry a huge arsenal of weapons around with you (moreso the further you progress). Most weapons have an alternate fire mode (accessed by holding the right mouse button), which can be bought with the money you collect in game, which gives you even more weapons to enjoy. There are also plenty of passive upgrades for your weapons, such as laser sights, increased magazines and weapon damage, etc. If those weapons are still too mainstream for you, occasionally you'll be able to use demon hearts (damages enemies in close proximity) and demon heads (fires a freakin' laser)! I recommend getting the 'Headhunter I' skill early on to have access to demon heads.Karma is another essential part of the game. When you kill enemies (or drink a bowl of demon blood), you will obtain Karma, and occasionally receive a Karma point, which allows you to further upgrade Lo Wang. Most of the upgrades that can be purchased with Karma points are passive, such as improved maximum health, stamina (and its regeneration), finding more money/ammunition, and such. It is also where you can learn new katana techniques, and learn the ability to use demons' heads as weapons (Headhunter I).Perhaps after mentioning all the great weapons and abilities you have at your disposal, I should probably talk about some of the enemies you are likely to face. There's plenty of the standard demons which will run towards and attack you in melee range (if they get the chance), as well airbourne enemies, and some enemies which require a more tactical approach to defeat. Which reminds me, at some points in the game, you get access to a minigun turret to take down lots of airbourne enemies! Yes, it's incredibly fun, though it would be nice if the fun lasted a little longer.The level design is great, offering room for a little exploration, as well being fairly simple to follow the path to the current objective, with key doors and objects being highlighted in yellow. It's unlikely that you'll ever be short of health or ammunition, as you'll find plenty in boxes and cupboards as you travel around. You may occasionally come across hidden statuettes, which are pretty cool, but don't offer much other than looking fabulous and being worth a considerable amount of money (a bit similar to the Sokolov paintings, if you've played Dishonored). The graphics in the game are beautiful; you get to experience everything from temples, to forests, to snowy mountains.There is some element of story in the game, as Lo Wang and Hoji both have objectives that they wish to fulfill, although  if you're looking for a story-rich game, Shadow Warrior probably won't tick that box. It is a hack 'n' slash / shoot 'em up game after all, if my review hadn't already implied that. I feel that more could've been done with the ending, though I'm not sure what I was supposed to expect anyway.Unless you're new to video games in general, I'd recommend playing the game on either 'Hard' or 'Insane'. I wussed out and played the game on Normal, and although it was still incredibly fun, I felt like I wans't being pushed sufficiently to utilise everything at my disposal. There were also plenty of medkits still lying around for me to use, and my ammo was usually near-full on every weapon most of the time. I did notice that the game was pushing me more towards the end, though in hindsight, I think it would've been much more satisfying for me to complete the game on the 'Hard' difficulty. I'm definitely going to go back and try and complete the game on 'Insane' at some point!TL;DRIf you love...> Banter, witty humour, and 'Wang' jokes> Witty fortune cookies> Using a katana to slash things up> Upgrades and special powers for your katana to slash things up even harder> A large arsenal of weapons with loads of ammo at your disposal> A ton of upgrades and alternate fire modes for your weapons> Special powers> Using demon heads to fire lasers at enemies> Simple keybinds> Beautiful environments (including forests, mountains, and Japanese temples)...then you should definitely buy this game! :D			"

												What can i say? after 7 hours of recorded gameplay i can tell that this is a good game (i'm sure i'm nowhere near the end yet at this point). Knowing this was going to be developed by a company like Flying Wild Hog, i had high hopes. Didn't pick it up at release, but boy does it deserve the full price tag. Shadow Warrior is probably the most enjoyable single player FPS i've played in a long time (Bulletstorm coming close enough). I was a huge fan of the original Shadow Warrior from 1997, so playing this one felt like home sweet home. It has the classic humour and the swordsplay is a pleasent surprise and loads of fun (compared to the basic swordsplay back in the day). All the upgrades seem interesting too and add a lot to the game to keep it interesting. Combat with the weapons is fun, but i always find myself going back to the katana easily. The Soundtrack gives the game a great athmosphere and keeps giving great amount of goosebumps during the battles, making them seem epic every time you get in trouble with the demons, great work in that aspect as well.All in all, i recommend this to anybody who likes/liked Bulletstorm, Serious Sam series and the like, or even for old timers who grew up with the original SW, Quake, Blood, Duke Nukem and so forth. Pure mindless FPS fun that keeps you smiling and laughing all around. Highly recommended!			"

												A game filled with Gore and Easter eggs of the previous game, with secrets and jokes with reference to the original Shadow Warrior and other 3D Realms games.I give it an 8/10 for the abundance of bugs that get you killed every now and then but otherwise a very fun game.			"

												""YOU GOT WANG!""Shadow Warrior is a reimagining of the classic 1997 video game by the same title. This game is hilariously brutal and cheesy at the same time. You play as Lo Wang, a Chinese assassin working out of Japan. You are sent by your employer (Master Orochi Zilla) to collect the Nobitsura Kage, an ancient sword of unimaginable power, for him. Long story short, things don't go very smoothly, and literally all Hell (or Shadow Realm to be specific) breaks loose.The game is played from a first-person perspective, through the eyes of Lo Wang. You can see your hands, you can look down at your legs. Combat is fluid, very quick and very brutal. This game has a lot of blood and gore, and flying limbs (which is quite entertaining to say the least). You fight against mostly different shadow creatures, demons if you will, and a few humans as well. More often than not there are hoards of creatures coming at you all at one time, meant to try to overwhelm you... but you can handle it, you're Lo Wang.You start off with your sword (shurikens too), but as the game progresses, you acquire more weapons: revolver, submachine gun, crossbow, shotgun, flamethrower, and rocket launcher. You can also obtain the ability to pick up demon hearts and/or warlord heads. You can use all these amazingly fun toys against various baddies that show up in the game: crawlers, birdmen, trolls, warpers, mothers, warlords, shamans, berserkers... and the pitiful human enemies too. Also, if you come across a cute little furry bunny rabbit, and you feel so inclined to splatter its internals all over the ground over and over, you may come across a little surprise revenge of the bunnies moment, so by all means, use your toys on that as well.Joined with you along the way is Hoji, a banished immortal of the Shadow Realm. Quite an amusing character, and to be honest, I probably enjoyed him more than the main character of Lo Wang. He may be kind of annoying, snarky and sarcastic, but quite amusing nonetheless. And he grows on you... like a fungus... but in a good way? But I digress. He helps you along the way both with his knowledge of shadow creatures, and his innate ability to find the whisperers, who are synthetic creatures that hold memories as well as parts of the scattered sword you're after. Despite part of his own memories being missing, he is quite helpful.Aside from the normal enemies you come across, there are the boss battles. These battles take you into the Shadow Realm, and one-on-one with each of the other immortals, or ancients: Gozu, Mezu, and Xing. You only come across these bosses after finding a whisperer, retrieving part of the sword, and cracking open the lost memory of each. The boss battles require you to unleash all of your arsenal on their heavy armour before you can fully take 'em, take 'em out, take 'em down, do your... do your stuff.I had a blast playing through this game. You will too. There are a lot of things to do. Sometimes the waves of enemies become repetitive, but hey that's okay. There are a bunch of secret pathways to find secret items. You can collect secret statues, pools of blood, and fortune cookies as well. There are achievements for doing such too. I played through this game 3 times. First, on easy for a very casual introduction to the game, where I could explore and find everything I could. Second, on Heroic mode, which only unlocks once you've beaten the game on any difficulty, and I did that for more of a challenge. Third, to find anything I missed, and I missed a lot, which is quite easy to do. But, I found all the statues, all the pools, all the cookies, and attained all achievements.What a ride! If you haven't gotten this game, I highly recommend that you do. It is worth the full price, but quite often it goes on sale, and most times (or maybe every time, I don't know) that it does, it's at 90% off, I picked up the Special Edition for $5.49 CAD. Amazing deal!			"

												This game starts as a fun and absolutely funny game full of clever Easter eggs that devolves into a grind of repetitive enemies. But there's enough combat fun, just enough of a challenge, and just enough of a story to get you through that grind.The game isn't optimized the greatest in some parts, specifically the first big boss. Then the lighting is pretty weird as well. But for the most part the game plays smooth and looks pretty. The scenery is diverse level to level and the character animations are *mostly* good.Starting off the jokes are laugh out loud funny, consistent, and constant. But they evaporate almost entirely about halfway through. Even the fortune cookie jokes littered throughout the game run dry. And any clever Easter eggs are near the beginning. It definitely looses its silly charm as you progress.The game plays very clean. Each weapon is fun, especially the katana. Couple that with the ability to upgrade the weapons, as well as skill and powers to be unlocked, and the offensive variety stays interesting throughout. I never grew tired of slicing through enemies even after facing the same one for the 1,000th time.The funny stuff drew me in, the challenge and fluidity of combat kept me going. The game definitely isn't without flaws, but I had fun. There's stretches of repetition and grinding but I felt satisfaction beating each level making the 12+ hours worth it.Well worth trying it out if it is on sale!			"

												Shadow Warrior is one of the best reboots ever made - the original character wasn't remade to oblivion, the game actually has a story now and the gameplay is still very fun and great. There are some cons though, like the annoying charger enemies, the way the exploding enemies are sometimes used and the upgrade system, which is not bad on its own, but has a rather weak implementation with most of the upgrades being annoying numbers numbers numbers, like it's an RPG, while there's only around five upgrades that actually give you new moves and abilities. The weapon upgrade system is alright though.So, in the end, it's a really good game which has a few shortcomings that don't make you dislike the game. Combine that with the fact that this game is dirt cheap on sales and you get a question - why haven't you played it yet?			"

												Surprising can be used to summarize just about everything about this game. Surprisingly fun gameplay, surprisingly interesting mechanics and leveling, surprisingly funny dialog, surprisingly fun collectables/unlockables, surprisingly lengthy, surprisingly engaging story, surprisingly interesting environments, surprisingly fun.I went in expecting a short, fun, low-investment arcade shooter, but it definitely wasn't short, and I was definitely invested.Surpassed my expectations in every way.Edit: 2.5 years later this game is still tragically overlooked and overshadowed by other classically styled modern shooters such as Doom 2016 or Wolfenstein the Old Blood. Do yourself a solid and play Shadow Warrior.			"

												Well with no doubt this was one of the biggest 2013 surprise, a FPS with lot of action, very different from what we are accustom. This one was a retro-reboot inspired on the Shadow Warrior released in 1997. Here we control Lo Wang, a ninja mercenary from modern day time with excellent humor sense, we fight against demons hordes. Game is quite big, there are 17 large chapters, but linear levels with a good amount of secrets and easter eggs to discover. Besides the good humor sense that game gives us, the combat system very smooth and is very varied, you have nice combos to make, with your sword or weapons.  You get a good number of weapons added to your arsenal as you progress through the game and can carry all of them with you. The combat also has a fantastic melee element with the katana that you start the game with.We also have a progression and upgrade system, were we can upgrade our skills and get new powers with the KI crystals. When you upgrade the powers or the skills you can move faster, regenerate health easily or get a new power to Wang use. Now the worst part of this game was definitely the gameplay, is very boring at least for me, we kill, we follow the goal that most of times is destroy a statue that is blocking a magical door and nothing else to do. Yeah we can find the easter eggs and some other secrets but still, i did expect more on this.  Overall I was surprised at how good this game was. If you are a fan of old-school, fast paced FPS action with a sense of humor then I highly recommend this game.~ 7/10			"

												Back in the 90s I was more of a PC kid than a console kid, so that meant I had a lot of experience with the PC’s premier genre: shooters. Duke Nukem 3D, Dark Forces, Quake, Wolfenstein, Doom (of course) and even Blood were a few of the FPS classics I grew up on. Strangely enough, though, I never got around to playing the original Shadow Warrior, a 3D Realms-developed pastiche of Hong Kong exploitation martial arts flicks from the 70s and 80s. The game was full of heavy weapons, gratuitous violence and over-the-top monsters; check, check and check for shooters of that era. However the game’s rather embarrassing Asian stereotypes allowed for some unusual enemy and weapon design, particularly in that it was one of the few FPS games that let you wield a sword.I’m sorry to say that’s the extent of my knowledge of Shadow Warrior, which meant I was going into the remake more or less fresh. I may have been new to Shadow Warrior, but I was at least familiar with the developer. Flying Wild Hog, the Warsaw, Poland-based studio tasked with remaking Shadow Warrior, broke onto the scene in 2011 with their stunningly beautiful (and difficult!) retro-FPS, Hard Reset. I really enjoyed Hard Reset—the developers managed to mix brutal, fast-paced gameplay with some of the most gorgeous cyberpunk visuals I’ve ever seen in a videogame, and all at a rock-solid framerate. If anyone was up to the task of remaking an old school classic like Shadow Warrior, it was Flying Wild Hog. It’s also great that Devolver Digital is publishing, as they’ve shown that they know and love the retro action genre.The re-imagined game is still a retro-style shooter and still stars the smarmily-named protagonist Lo Wang, but the story has been completely updated, and the borderline racist Asian stereotyping has been toned down quite a bit. Lo Wang is still a Chinese-Japanese born mercenary in the hire of the egotistical billionaire Zilla, but the story is a bit more complex than the revenge plot of the original game. Zilla tasks Lo Wang with retrieving the Nobitsura Kage, a legendary demon-infused katana, but Lo Wang quickly discovers his mission has a lot more going on. The Kage is linked to a demonic invasion that Lo lands right in the middle of. Lo must team up with a snarky, amnesiac demon named Hoji in order to battle the encroaching demon hordes, get hold of the three pieces of the Kage and find out just what Zilla wants with the sword.Lo Wang might still be essentially a walking♥♥♥♥♥♥joke, but Flying Wild Hog smartly plays the name for ironic laughs throughout the game, instead of just making it a tired, one-note gag. Lo is still a badass but he’s also kind of an otaku shut-in too; he’s obsessed with 80s action flicks and videogames (Lo has arcade cabinets of Devolver’s other properties, including Serious Sam and Hotline Miami) and even has a massive underground lair dubbed “the Wangcave.” Lo comments that he stocked his lair to prepare for the zombie apocalypse, but a demon apocalypse will have to suffice. Hoji snarkily remarks that out of all the badass warriors in Japan, he had to get stuck with the nerd.The interplay between Lo and Hoji was one of my favorite parts of the story. The writing is really good here, and while the plot delves into some pretty heavy mythology, Hoji grounds the whole story by taking a sarcastic, cavalier attitude to the ancient struggle between gods and warriors that he and Lo get caught up in. The cutscenes are told in gorgeous moving woodblock paintings, resplendent with some very cool graphical effects, similar to Hard Reset’s rough, sketchy comic panel cinematics but with their own distinct Asian style. That said, like Hard Reset the larger story can be a little hard to follow at times.The themes at play here are quite refreshing. After dozens of shooters populated by zombies, terrorists, and even Western depictions of demons (usually sourced from the Bible) it was great to see enemies inspired by Eastern mythology. I’m no expert in Shinto or Taoist legends, but I got the sense that the game borrows its demons from both Japanese and Chinese myth, mirroring Lo Wang’s mixed ancestry. This means you get to fight some very cool demons—minions wearing masks or carrying poison sake barrels on their backs, old hags wielding katanas, deranged Samurai-like monsters with ornate shields, and giant, mystical shamans that spawn endless waves of skeleton warriors. Each enemy has the ability to become enraged as well, transforming into creatures that are even fiercer and more grotesque.Of course with such a healthy roster of monsters just itching to get slashed to pieces, blasted apart and thoroughly ventilated by 9mm slugs, Lo Wang better have an arsenal that is varied and fun to use. This is where Flying Wild Hog excels—Hard Reset had essentially two guns that had multiple modes and attachments—and the developers bring that experience to Shadow Warrior, full bore. Lo’s conventional tools of the trade include a revolver, SMG, crossbow, shotgun, flamethrower and rocket launcher. Pretty basic stuff for an FPS, but the developers included an upgrade tree very similar to the one in Hard Reset.Once you have collected enough cash you can give the shotgun four barrels instead of just two, and enable the ability to fire all four at the same time. The crossbow can be upgraded with remotely detonated explosive-tipped bolts. Just like in the original game, Lo can dual-wield SMGs and attach a laser sight for accurate shooting. Napalm bombs for the flamethrower, wide blast radius “Nuke Dukem” rockets, and a cowboy-style fanable hammer for the revolver are a few of the other goodies you can bolt onto your guns. In the best of FPS traditions, Shadow Warrior encourages you to swap between weapons during a battle.The upgrade system isn’t limited to the guns, though. With the help of Hoji, Lo can develop several powers and skills by gaining XP (chi points) and collecting rare ki crystals. With the right skill unlocks you can levitate whole groups of enemies into the air, recover health mid-battle, increase your critical hit chance, go into a damage-boosted desperation frenzy when you’re close to death, and even increase your spatial awareness so that you find more money and ammo. This makes for a frenetic, rich combat style far beyond anything else I’ve seen in a recent shooter. That said, it’s the Nobitsura Kage—the sword—that really makes Shadow Warrior stand out.Ironically, having a sword play a central role in the arsenal set Shadow Warrior apart back in 1997 and it does so again in 2013. Sadly few FPS games even try to approximate swordplay, probably because it’s damn hard to do. I still consider Red Steel 2 on the Wii to be the best swordfighting game ever made, mostly because its smart use of motion controls actually made me feel just a little bit like I was learning the katas of some obscure, wild west martial art. The new Shadow Warrior comes in at a close second. I’m as surprised as anyone, but Flying Wild Hog has taken that same “muscle memory” feeling of learning a fighting art and imparted it to a keyboard and mouse.Using the arrow keys, you can slash the katana in different directions. Pretty simple stuff, but a big difference from games that just lets you spam random melee attacks and call it a day. Once you start upgrading the sword with magical powers, combat becomes a lot more fun. By double-tapping different directional keys and clicking the mouse, Lo can eventually perform several suitably badass moves. These include a circular crowd-clearing move that’s great for mutilating a mob of smaller enemies, a backwards swipe that launches a slicing disc of energy from the sword, and a quick thrusting stab that saps enemy health and replenishes your own. I really wish you could use the katana during the massive, Metroid Prime-esque boss encounters.Rating: 9/10 Excellent "

												An unabashed, old-skool, hideously violent, borderline racist shooter; this is one hell of a tough game to review.There's tremendous fun to be had using different weapons and abilities (you'll learn some ninja magic too), but there's also frustration built into the game -- namely the mortal-kombat-esque spell-casting on the D-Pad for joypad users, and the boundaries of every level -- you want to explore, but there's not as much to explore as you think.That said, there are plenty easter eggs (about half of them are strictly adult humour), fast-moving action sequences, and a lot of 'almost too inapropriate' asian-based jokes in amongst the bloodshed.Playing the game as it is -- a series of beautiful gauntlets -- it's excellent fun, and mostly fulfils the promises made in the trailer, but take that 20% pinch of salt as you see fit. In the end, finding original parts of levels rendered as the original game, wiitnessing hidden hentai showering, and brutally using and abusing the body parts of your vanquished enemies is a great romp.

												There's been quite a number of reboots to classic FPS franchises in recent years. However most of them have turned out to be ultimately dissapointing, with Duke Nukem Forever being overall a shoddy experience and Rise of the Triad bringing a full old school experience but also including numerous design faults. So next up on the list is Shadow Warrior.You play as Lo Wang, who aside from being a walking♥♥♥♥♥♥joke has been sent to retreve a sword from an organisation by any means necessary. This inevitably doesn't go smoothly and thus there are demons all across the land, the rest of the game from then on is a quest for this mystical sword called the Nobitsura Kage. The plot itself is fairly standard affair for a game of this sort, never really reaching beyond decent. There are also some issues regarding the stories tone although it’s not too huge an issue. Although story qualms are a minor issue it doesn't detract from the game when looking at the main reason that one would play it, the gameplay.Gameplay is the make or break aspect of these throwback FPS's. Thankfully what we're given is a vicious thrill ride that entertains all throughout its playtime. One of the more interesting aspects to the original Shadow Warrior was that you could use a sword as a melee weapon, the reboot takes this side weapon and makes it the forefront of the game which turns out to be the best decision they could have made. The sword play in Shadow Warrior is simply one of the best melee systems that's been put into any game. You'll be in giggly fits of glee slicing through the demon horde in Shadow Warrior as each slice carves through enemies like butter. Limbs flying everywhere, heads lopped off and all done with an over the top gorey attitude. What makes the sword even better is that it's always a valid option, even until the final fights. However there are also an array of traditional guns like a revolver, machine gun and rocket launcher. Whilst these weapons aren't as fun to use as the sword, they add some nice variety to the game and are prove to be necessary with certain enemies. Also added in the mix are special Ki abilites that allow you to pull of magical powers such as pushing enemies away or healing, add in a dodge mechanic and Shadow Warrior provides a fairly robust and entertaining set of tools to be used at your disposal on your demonic foes.However this could all be a repeat instance of Rise of the Triad, which had great gameplay but suffered due to poor design. Thankfully Shadow Warrior avoids most of these pitfalls but doesn't necessarily come out unscathed. For one, levels are usually fairly linear rather than a mass sprawling map to explore, also the game utilises a checkpoint system but you are able to use normal saves and quick saves anywhere you like. There are however a few issues. As with most throwback titles like this there can be issues with backtracking in that it can become easy to get lost looking for the one door to progress to the next part of the level. Also I did encounter an issue during a fight where an enemy was stuck somewhere in the level which made progression impossible, this was fixed by reloading an old save. Aside from that however the game holds up design-wise.Graphically the game actually looks really nice for the most part. Thanks to the eastern setting there is an abundance of colour and vibrancy that makes the environments pop, leaving you truely impressed with some of the images. The game does find iself being bogged down near the middle with seemingly endless ship environments but they don't last too long in retrospect and end just as it would get truely tedious. There are also some texture pop-in issues but they were few and far between.Shadow Warrior is back with a bang! With its emphasis on sadisticly satisfying sword play Shadow Warrior manages to carve itself a unique indentity within the FPS genre. Those who truely appreciate and love old school FPS or melee combat in games should pick up that katana and have a bloodsoaked bash with Wang.			"

												At first I was suspicious of this game, since I've never heard from its predecessor before but the game managed to almost instantly correct my opinion on it. This is a wonderful remake. The graphics are beautiful and to the point, the combat is fluid, engaging and entertaining, the story is okay (I don't expect much anymore, thank you, game industry[/sarcasm off]) and the upgrading is one of the better systems. Useful skills and spells you actually use instead of having them for funsies. Although I tend to use mainly the katana but that is personal preference, I guess. There's a lot of weapons.tl;dr This game is an amazing amalgamation of Dark Messiah, Serious Sam and Painkiller. Get it!			"

												This is the best FPS I have played of 2013 as it is just plain fun. The story is not very strong but the dialog between the two main characters are funny. the voice acting is good nothing special but the real meat of the game is the game play.In the game you will start with a katana but you will gain more wepons that seem fairly standard until you upgrade and you gain magical powers that will help you and you will learn more moves with you katana that will just make you feel like a true badass.In this game you will get three types of currency and all are based on how much you explore and how well you do in fights as you are rated out of 5 after each fight.The enemys are fun  to fight and are not dumb or clever but there are plently of them to shot, slice , set on fire and blow up. There is aslo a new game plus and a newly added survival mode so it has replay value is you want to go back and get those upgrades you missed or ablilitys.Over all this game is alot of fun and i would reccomend it.

												★★★★☆This was one of the cooler games I have played on steam, something about using a katana to cut demons in half is just so so satisfying :P. What else is there to say about this game, it has a rich story and great gameplay the only down side for me was its difficulty. I played the game through on Hard and I had next to no challenge, so for new players I would definitely recommend hard as it is a satisfying experience, although I'd have liked if the enemies killed me more XD. 4/5 !!! Great game.The game also includes: Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow WarriorWhich is essentially a cleaning game, but what you’re cleaning up is the first levels main hall where you slice a few thugs up, very fun experience picking up disembodied limbs and cleaning the blood from the mess you made before XD.

												The ultimate Hack 'n' Slash. This game is one hell of an adventure, and on it's hardest difficulty, it's a beast to conquer. You'll find yourself wandering off into the trees and streets searching for small relics after you've slain a monsterous demon quite often, you'll try to think which guns are best to upgrade first, and wonder what powers are actually useful. The game is very satisfying, massive blood flowing from decapitated demons, lots of loot, a fancy arsenal of weapons, and a whole lot more. The 3 boss fights in the game can take quite some time depending on the difficulty, but feel very rewarding after defeating them.A crossbow that fires explosive detonating rounds? Why not? A shotgun that has a giant red button which allows you to shoot all bullets at once... why not?The controls are very responsive, and with a mouse and keyboard, there are no problems at all. The scenery and buildings are textured and completed to look very realistic, the cliched cherry blossoms and temples are a perfect addition, and the endless amounts of comedy also helps.After spilling a ridiculous amount of blood from decapitated demons and hilariously laughing at the dialogue, this game is perfect.10/10			"

												Not really sure how I'm even going to begin to start reviewing this game, as I have so many things I'd like to say about it. This is the most fun I've had on a game for a very long time (not to say that other games that I play aren't fun, rather, that this game is incredibly fun).(Scroll to bottom for tl;dr review)You play as the humourous, katana-wielding badass that is Lo Wang, who starts out on a quest to retrieve a sword for his master. Along the way, you bump into a demon called Hoji, who befriends you and follows you round for the rest of the game. There's lots of funny banter between the two of them, as well as the funny remarks Lo Wang makes throughout the game, which leads me to the first point.. the humour. The humour in the game is fantastic. ""Wang"" is incorporated into much of what Lo Wang says, usually with subtle innuendos like ""You want some Wang?"" when fighting enemies. Fortune cookies scattered throughout the game often have something humourous to say; it's always amusing to pick them up and read the witty humour. A few of my favourites are:""Having sex is like playing bridge. If you don't have a good partner, you'd better have a great hand.""""He who takes advice from a cookie is sure to crumble.""""Cardboard belt is a waist of paper.""""That's what Ki said.""""All your cookie are belong to us.""""The good news: You're not paranoid. The badnews: Everyone is actually trying to kill you.""""Don't sweat the petty things and don't pet the sweaty things. - George Carlin""""You will stop procrastinating. Later.""Unless you've played the game, you're probably wondering what the reference to Ki is (mentioned above). Ki is a form of energy used in the game, that allows you to perform many special actions, with or without your katana. Throughout the game, you will occasionally collect Ki crystals, that grant you new powers, and also allow you to upgrade them. These powers include healing, blocking, and immobilising your enemies by thrusting them up into the air, or knocking them down. They're simple to execute too: double tap a movement key, and hold the right mouse button to perform. The key binds are simple in this game. Being left-handed, I like to use the arrow keys and the right-hand part of the keyboard, and not have to worry about too many keybinds. Despite this, you are still able to perform everything with ease, from Ki powers to katana techniques, to the alternate fire option for your weapons. Ah yes, weapons...The katana is incredibly fun to use. As well as just having your standard 'hack and slash' option, you also have access to various katana techniques, purchased with karma points (see next paragraph). These include powerful thrusts, spinning attacks, and long-ranged attacks. The special techniques with the katana are accessed the same way as with Ki powers, except by holding the left mouse button instead. As if the game wasn't fun enough with a katana, you also carry a huge arsenal of weapons around with you (moreso the further you progress). Most weapons have an alternate fire mode (accessed by holding the right mouse button), which can be bought with the money you collect in game, which gives you even more weapons to enjoy. There are also plenty of passive upgrades for your weapons, such as laser sights, increased magazines and weapon damage, etc. If those weapons are still too mainstream for you, occasionally you'll be able to use demon hearts (damages enemies in close proximity) and demon heads (fires a freakin' laser)! I recommend getting the 'Headhunter I' skill early on to have access to demon heads.Karma is another essential part of the game. When you kill enemies (or drink a bowl of demon blood), you will obtain Karma, and occasionally receive a Karma point, which allows you to further upgrade Lo Wang. Most of the upgrades that can be purchased with Karma points are passive, such as improved maximum health, stamina (and its regeneration), finding more money/ammunition, and such. It is also where you can learn new katana techniques, and learn the ability to use demons' heads as weapons (Headhunter I).Perhaps after mentioning all the great weapons and abilities you have at your disposal, I should probably talk about some of the enemies you are likely to face. There's plenty of the standard demons which will run towards and attack you in melee range (if they get the chance), as well airbourne enemies, and some enemies which require a more tactical approach to defeat. Which reminds me, at some points in the game, you get access to a minigun turret to take down lots of airbourne enemies! Yes, it's incredibly fun, though it would be nice if the fun lasted a little longer.The level design is great, offering room for a little exploration, as well being fairly simple to follow the path to the current objective, with key doors and objects being highlighted in yellow. It's unlikely that you'll ever be short of health or ammunition, as you'll find plenty in boxes and cupboards as you travel around. You may occasionally come across hidden statuettes, which are pretty cool, but don't offer much other than looking fabulous and being worth a considerable amount of money (a bit similar to the Sokolov paintings, if you've played Dishonored). The graphics in the game are beautiful; you get to experience everything from temples, to forests, to snowy mountains.There is some element of story in the game, as Lo Wang and Hoji both have objectives that they wish to fulfill, although  if you're looking for a story-rich game, Shadow Warrior probably won't tick that box. It is a hack 'n' slash / shoot 'em up game after all, if my review hadn't already implied that. I feel that more could've been done with the ending, though I'm not sure what I was supposed to expect anyway.Unless you're new to video games in general, I'd recommend playing the game on either 'Hard' or 'Insane'. I wussed out and played the game on Normal, and although it was still incredibly fun, I felt like I wans't being pushed sufficiently to utilise everything at my disposal. There were also plenty of medkits still lying around for me to use, and my ammo was usually near-full on every weapon most of the time. I did notice that the game was pushing me more towards the end, though in hindsight, I think it would've been much more satisfying for me to complete the game on the 'Hard' difficulty. I'm definitely going to go back and try and complete the game on 'Insane' at some point!TL;DRIf you love...> Banter, witty humour, and 'Wang' jokes> Witty fortune cookies> Using a katana to slash things up> Upgrades and special powers for your katana to slash things up even harder> A large arsenal of weapons with loads of ammo at your disposal> A ton of upgrades and alternate fire modes for your weapons> Special powers> Using demon heads to fire lasers at enemies> Simple keybinds> Beautiful environments (including forests, mountains, and Japanese temples)...then you should definitely buy this game! :D			"

												An absolute hidden gem of a game that surprised me with each and every aspect of it's design.I was not expecting this much depth out of the story or mechanics; specifically in the upgrade/skill system. While the game does have certain old school FPS sensibilities (collecting ammo/health, finding secrets, unlocking doors to progress) it does not neglect the narrative and totally sucked me into the story with decent writing and top-notch voice acting and all that made me want to continue playing the game for more than just the gameplay. The gameplay (which even on it's own) is amazing and the visceral feeling of gunning down, blowing up and, most importantly, slicing up enemies is truly a delight. Especially especially using the katana which (in my humble opinion) is the best melee weapon I've ever used in a game so far. The fact that the developers have taken the time and effort to include many many gore-y animations for when you go on a rampage shows they know what makes for a satisfying experience. As for the other weapons: all of them are wonderfully designed with alternate firemodes each and are generally a joy to use in their own ways; after all these are some of the Painkiller devs we're talking about.Finally, the cherry on top for me would be the sense of humor and the (non-pandering) pop-culture references which really make you feel at home with everything from Star Wars to Taxi Driver. Everything just has a fun-loving and playful feel to it.So, yeah, I haven't covered everything, but seriously watch the trailers and download the demo (yeah.. remember those?) and then seriously consider purchasing this little slice of gold.

												Shadow warrior is well worth a check out. Based on its old school predassesor, Shadow Warrior lives up to its name. Blending a mix of katana combat, and first person shooter action, there are many ways you can deal with baddies. Some of the most satisfying first person melee combat I've ever seen comes from this game, partly because of the various options one has. You have the regular M1 does a simple slash, M2 does a charge attack that appears in most games of this nature. However on top of that you have 3 special moves, allowing for a nice diversity in the way you attack. And boy does it feel good to slice and dice a demon into peices. On top of these 5 katana attacks, you have 4 other moves that can be done alongside any of your guns. The guns are fun and satisfying to use. You also have a  fast dash, which makes can transform combat into fast paced fun. Slashing one person, quickly dashing back, shooting something to explode and then dashing foward to eviscerate 5 enemies with ypur sword and watching them drop to the ground in bits is exhilirating. And Shadow Warrior rewards you for variation. Perfection in combat gets you five stars, something not easily ascertainable. This is based out of a 5 star system, which rewards you with ""Karma Points"" which in turn you can use to better oneself. And boy is there a lot to upgrade. You can upgrade all of your weapons at any time with money you find in each level, a perk system which also gives you skills, such as mobility, improved healing, sword mastery etc. along with those 4 special moves. These skills you'll find nessecary as different ""types""  of enemies begin to appear.  In most  cases one must tackle each new situation in a different way. In the end Shadow Warrior's combat is fun, and intuitive, but if find myself constantly using the katana, because it is overall the best weapon, and yeilds the most satisfying results. But at the same time other weapons have their uses. I feel as though the devs. did so on purpose, to make the katana to feel as though it was your main weapon. Even if i got a new weapon id always find myself going back to the katana. Moving on, Shadow Warrior in some places is absolutely stunning. Many of the environments have their own distinctive look, and are very vibrant and colorful. I, personally, enjoy all of the cherry blossoms and japanese theming that appear at many times throughout the game. I never found myself while playing shadow warrior thinking ""This game looks bad."" Granted i had to optimize my system a bit, however at the end I still found it to look great (But keep in mind thats just me, im sure others dont have that same problem) . And hidden in these stunning environments are many secrets, and bonuses to find along with sarcastic fortune cookies. I dont have that many qualms with Shadow Warrior. I loved all the cheesey one liners, and the actual plot (which i dont feel like going into because this review is long enough) had no major plot holes, and wasnt necessarily terrible. In fact I quite enjoyed it. But at some points when running through a level, i found it hard to find the actual objective, but this was only one level, for the most part i never had this trouble. On the whole Shadow Warrior is a fantastic game that left me wanting alot more. I'd suggest having it in your steam library, i know im glad i purchased it.			"

												Shadow Warrior 2013 is a reboot of the 1997 classic by 3-D Realms developed by Flying Wild Hog and published by Devolver Digital. The game has you take the role of Lo Wang, a sarcastic and awesome protagonist who is told by the head of Zilla Industries to retrieve an ancient sword that goes by the name ""Nobitsura Kage"" which is a weapon that is said to have connections with ancient Gods and possess power unlike anything mankind has ever seen. Along the way Lo Wang will meet a spirit known as ""Hoji"", who helps Wang on his quest to retrieve the Nobitsura Kage.The gameplay is a mix between an old school first person shooter and a Hack-and-slash, the game starts you off with a Katana as your first weapon which is probably the best weapon in the game, with it you can slice enemie's limbs off, perform moves such as a 360 spin, power attacks and even press reload to clean your Katana from blood, which I gotta say is a pretty cool touch. As you progress in the game's 14 hour single player campaign you will gain upgrades for your katana, one being the ability to drain health from an enemy,Wang can also perform moves with the power of KI, moves include shockwaves, healing, levitation, push, etc. These moves are essential if you want to beat the game on it's higher difficulties.Along the way you will pick up a vast array of weapons ranging from Revolvers and SMGS, to the more heavy stuff like flame throwers and a rocket launcher at some stage. You can even use a demon's head to unleash a powerful beam which totally destroys enemies and even a demon's heart to instant kill a smaller demon. Some of these weapons may seem weak at first but stick with it and you will find them extremely useful in situtations. Each weapon also has their own description on it's original use, who manufactured it, and it's history which is quite an awesome touch. Each weapon has their own upgrades in the menu which can be bought using money found in the games 18 chapters (Including the prologue), upgrades can range from more damage, a bigger clip size, explosive ammunition, and akimbo for the SMGS. Speaking of upgrades, Lo Wang himself can be upgraded with more moves, health, KI, stamina, endurace, etc. These upgrades can be bought using Ki Crystals found within the chapters and earning KARMA, which is this game's equivalent to experience points. Then finally you have the games boss fights, which are all giant monsters whose weakpoint is the crystal behind their armour, these fights are definatly fun, but begin to grow repetitive, but are made a bit more interesting with new attack patterns and the upgrades you obtain on the way. Speaking of enemies, there is a large variety of enemies ranging from shield enemies, explosive enemies, winged enemies, golem enemies, shamen enemies and many more off the top of my head and each enemy provides a fair and balanced challenge to the player. This game is by no means an easy game, I had myself dying at certain points which made me angry, but enough to make me continue.Each Chapter is filled to the brim with med kits, ammo, money, fortune cookies, secrets, Karma pools, KI crystals, easter eggs which all make exploration a key factor in Shadow Warrior.The graphics in this game makes this one of the most beautiful games I've ever played with stunning vistas, crisp textures, lighting, models and animation. I could sit here for days saying how beatiful this game is.The sound design is also excellent, with well done voice acting, ambiant sounds, gun sounds, katana sounds and a superb soundtrack which help set the atmosphere.Lastly, Lo wang himself is an excellent character who let's out witty and sarcastic dialouge which makes the character in my opinion very loveable and full of personality, my favourite line from him was ""Where did you demons learn Kung-Fu? Kung-Fu r us?"" which had me cracking up.  Hoji is probably my favourite character, he also let's out witty and sarcastic dialouge and creates hilarious banter between him and Lo wang, such as the moment when they chat about Eye of the Tiger which made me laugh pretty damn hard.Shadow Warrior is no means a short game, each level can take from 25 minutes upwards to an hour and a half which resulted in a 14 hour single player, even longer if you want to find all the secrets and get perfect scores. After you beat the game you unlock Heroic and EX mode, EX is basically new game+ and Heroic has you beat each level with only 1 checkpoint at the start of each level that is apparently harder than Insane (The hardest difficulty).RECENTLY ADDED: Also, when you're done with the campiagn there is also a survival mode where you fight waves upon waves of enemies while buying upgrades along the way while trying to get on top of the leaderboards, this mode is definatly not one to be missed.After beating Shadow Warrior, I then took a big drink of water, then started the game all over again on Heroic I did this because Shadow Warrior 2013 is to me is a near-perfect game, and I can happily say that Shadow Warrior 2013 is by far one of my favourite games of all time, which ended on an unforgettable ending.Flying Wild Hog, I salute you, because this game, is bloody brilliant.10/10			"

												This reimagining strikes a nice balance with its main Character Lo Wang.  He's toned down a bit from the original, but not too much.The gameplay is generally great fun.  The environment is full of things that go boom (ala Hard Reset).  The level design is fine; it is generally easy enough to figure out where to go while still leaving one plenty of room to explore.  There were two locations where I gave up and checked a walkthrough to find some button / elevator whose small glow I had overlooked for a while.There is an over-reliance on monster closets, but destroying wave after wave of enemies is saved from being a chore by the absolute glee of carving through them with a variety of interesting weapons (foremost being the katana).  Occasional greater enemies provide more of a challenge and force one to juggle weapons abilities and powers.  The boss fights are also reminiscent of Hard Reset, and didn't end up being too frustrating.I'd love to see a Duke Nukem reboot from these guys, something more modest and just plain shooty than DNF.  Shadow Warrior was my favorite game of 2013 (of those I played of course, but to be recommended regardless)			"

												I can't stress how good this game is. Pur old-school FPS goodness. The graphics are great, the sound design and voice acting is great, and the sword mechanics are viscerally brutal. The story is simple and hilarious at the beginning, but slowly becomes more serious and heartfelt as the game progresses. Without spoiling anything, the ending was a real kick in the gut. My only complaint would be that every and now and then, the game does become a little repetitive. The designers clearly knew this, however, as every time I noted that things were a little 'samey', the level design or environments would shift. Overall though, this is a must buy.			"

												More fun than I've had in an FPS in a very long while, and the shooting's not even the best part. Swordplay is nearly perfect given the arcady first person setting, though really the only reason I include that 'nearly' is because I'm so spoiled from Dark Souls and Mount & Blade. Controls fairly responsive, customizable enough, and the system for powers/skills that calls for key combos like A-A-RMB and W-W-LMB is an interesting feature that may be a tad unintuitive at first but nevertheless is fairly easy to use once you get used to it.Overall if you enjoy action FPS, old-school shooters, slash 'em ups, or numerous♥♥♥♥♥♥jokes, absolutely play it.

												Shadow Warrior is the perfect blend of old and new, bringing back everything you loved about those hectic Old School FPS's while still adding enough new mechanics to make it's gameplay feel fresh and entertaining. Add to that great visuals, some dark humour as well as a surprisingly well written story, and you've got one of the best Shooters of the past year.			"

												This game is amazingly good fun. The combat feels responsive and has real impact whether or not you are using the sword or a gun. I had so much fun destroying the vast hoards of demons and humans alike. The setting and story are beautiful and rich. The interaction between the two main protagonists is also really fun. Speaking of which there is a lot of comedy in this title and all of it is welcome. I would recommend this hands down no questions asked. If this is where Flying Wild Hog is going I can’t wait to see their future projects.Have fun ^_^			"

												This game is terribly underrated. I felt like I was in a 90's Hong Kong action film.  The humor is relentlessly awesome as is the gore and over the top action.  I got to be a katana weilding gun toting maniac and had the funnest 10 hours of gameplay i've had in a while  The game gets slowly more and more serious as it progresses and had one of the best endings I have seen in a game in years.  Hats off to the team that put this title together.			"

Its amazing and the swordplay is super responsive and fun and the comedy is great. There is no other game I have played that has made me laugh as hard as this at the jokes. In short If you got the cash buy this game or just wait for the next sale. You will not regret it.			"

												Shadow Warrior is one of the best FPS's I've played this year, and possibly more rewarding than Bioshock Infinite in many aspects, though the story is a bit silly. That being said, the hand-drawn cutscenes and resolution of the story is engaging and emotional, despite all of the♥♥♥♥♥♥jokes made about the protagonist's name: Lo Wang. He goes from being an arrogant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to a respectable hero, and it makes for a pretty decent story. It's longer than Hard Reset and of the same caliber: outstanding and underrated, especially considering what it is. As mentioned before, the length is somewhat intimidating when one considers replaying Shadow Warrior. I'm sure I'll replay it someday soon.			"

												A very interesting reboot of the original 1997 ms-dos game. Your in for lots of dark humor (hilarious at times), a great sroundtrack, lots of gore and breathtaking level design which is where this game shines the most. The look and sound of the levels really is well made, accompanied by the great soundtrack of course.The story is the most interesting part of this game, although filled with ridiculous jokes I didnt expect much from it and it even drops off a few levels in and turns rather dull, leaving you with only the level design and slicing up countless demons to enjoy yourself but it gets better near the end and left me quite impressed with how well written it was.+ beautiful levels+ great soundtrack+ humor+ fun gameplay+ well written story & ending- story is dull near the start/middle of the game- gameplay gets repetetive before you unlock new powers/weapons- healing is OP- still has a few bugsVERDICT:Worth buying, I wasn't expecting much and was left very impressed by the end of it :)			"

												You may wonder if this game is good and the answer is YES. Remember playing DNF and wishing they would just copy the game formula and make a great game instead of making yet another abysmal monster with QTE, regen, weapon limit and idiotic vehicle levels.Well, this game did remake job RIGHT.If you loved those golden age of FPS games powered by the BUILD engine (ROTT, Redneck Rampage, DN3D, Powerslave, etc etc), you will really really enjoy the SW.A few things I love the most:* Almost everything can be destroyed / exploded.* Three different upgrade systems (weapon upgrades, skill tree, separate ability tree with separate resource pool)* ♥♥♥♥ING KATANA* Classic free-to-explore level layouts with tons of secret places. (I wish I had that BUILD-style map overlay)* Classic weapon set (Pistol, SMG, shotgun, boomsticks, etc) - no modern two weapon slots ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.* Healthkits, no regen. (Well, technically there is regen, but it is tied to the skill system)tl;dr - classical FPS with a remastered graphic that will make you cry in joy.			"

												Undoubtedly, one of the best shooters I have played in ages. If not THE best.Of the many first person shooters I have played in the last several years, only a handful of them reach that balance, timelessness, uniqueness, and most importantly fun factor to them, that stand out amongst my memory. This game not only exceeds in each of those aspects, but it takes what makes fun about the best of the best of first person shooters and, to put it in layman's terms, makes them its ♥♥♥♥♥!The top shooters that come to mind that I've had fond memories of were Timesplitters: Future Perfect, F.E.A.R. 2, Duke Nukem, and Serious Sam. Shadow Warrior is a renaissance of those games, giving you a wide range of weapons that are vast and have that perfect amount of kick, sound, and bass to them that give the bloody slices and shots to the demons and monsters all the more awarding and incredibly satisfying feel. This game encourages you to run, gun, and slice your way through hoardes of the shadow beings, with enemies dropping health, and the upgrades and strategies needed to kick every♥♥♥♥♥needed. Sure, this game has guns, but the swordplay. My god, the swordplay. Very rarely do I play, let alone encounter a game, with such amazing and exhilarating sword combat quite like this. It's one thing for a game like Metal Gear Rising to allow you to cut what you will. But there's just something about witnessing the bloody and gory brutality and dismemberment of your unfortunate foes in such over the top fashion, that it feels as though I'm in a game directed by Quentin Tarantino. And that puts a smile on my face.The visuals are simply stunning. The game has a strong personality that is complemented by the environments, locations, and just the sheer scope and feel to the game. Whoever says this game looks okay, is obviously blind, and closeted in their own bias opinion, for this game has more life and color to it than the monochromatic, military shooter that the so called ""gamers"" only play based on graphics before gameplay. Shadow Warrior on the otherhand strikes a perfect balance between style AND substance.In terms of story, the game keeps the intrigue inline with its great one liners and humor delivered by Lo Wang, tied in with the tragic backstory that he gets wrapped up in. And it certainly left an emotional impact me, even months after finishing it. Soundtrack is also phenomenal. The thumping and rhythmic intensity of the drums complimenting amongst the instruments coupled with the ambience and sounds of the various landscapes are both endearing and indubitably atmospheric. In addition, this game is incredibly lenghty, a rarity in modern first person shooters.By now as you're reading this, you may ask yourself, do I like this game? No.I love this game.I bought this game a while ago for 75% off, but at any price it is absolutely worth it. If there was any game that's superior from its visual asthetics, to its deep and enthralling gameplay, it is Shadow Warrior.I normally don't give games a score, but in this case, I give this game a 10 on the Wang-O-Meter.

												Shadow Warrior is an FPS reboot of the classic game of the same name. You play as Lo Wang, a sword and gun wielding one-liner machine on a mission to save the world from demons.What sets apart Shadow Warrior from the multitude of other FPS games is the swordplay. While the gunplay is not the most exciting you will see in the genre, with the guns not feeling powerful enough, the swords are really second to none. There are many special moves, each with their own uses, and there is a great sense of satisfaction to be felt as you see limbs and heads fly off your enemies. The best approach is probably to mix up the two weapons, but the more fun approach may be swords only.The graphics are ok if not spectacular for their time. There was recently a new graphics overhaul released for free, but I did not notice much of a difference. Maybe this is due to the graphics being a little forgettable in the first place.The story and writing is ridiculous and par for the course for 90's FPS games. Save the world while killing hordes and hordes of bullet sponge enemies. How Lo Wang finds time to think of his witty remarks during his genocidal spree, I may never know.The issue I found with Shadow Warrior is that it all starts feeling a little samey after a few levels. I kind of lost my will to continue shooting and chopping up demons after about 4 hours. I wouldn't say that makes the game a failure, just that I got my fill before it was over. The story is definitely secondary to the gameplay, which I enjoyed, but I really had no wish to see the game the whole way through. Overall I felt like I got my money's worth out of the game, but I got it on sale. Would I be happy if I paid $40, probably not. I couldn't recommend it at that price. But is it worth a play if you find it on sale? Absolutely.Grade: B			"

												I didn't honestly thought that I will like new Shadow Warrior that much. Bought it on sale and haven't got very high expectations about it. But...This game is awesome. It brings back the spirit of original, and put it in current graphics and game mechanics. And it's doing fantastic job. From very beggining to credits we are being taken to pure 90's awesomeness, where games meant to only entertain by giving effective ways to kill hordes of enemies, and feel badass about it.Lo Wang is younger than in original, but have much more to say, and his new companion, Hoji almost steal the stage. I laughed alot during cutscenes and while listening to their arguments. Plot is simple but it's ok.Stages are great in the first 1/3 of the game, beautiful, entertaining and unique. Second 1/3 are industrial complexes, which I don't like, because they all look the same, sadly. At the end there are again great maps, oriental, rich in details.Enemies are well desinged, but,  not variety of them is questionable. Frustrating are ones with shields beacuse you have to soften them up alot before they go down. It reaches the point of absurd when it comes to fights with Berserkers, baceuse you have to act like a torreador during this sections, and put alot of bullets in they back, its really boring.Aside from that cutting and ripping rest of the enemies is great. Weapons, and skills of Lo Wang give many way to kill demons. But katana is the best. It's remarkable how sword fights in this arcade-like fps are enjoyable.Game offers many secrets, and skills to unlock, and that gives players reason to try again for something more than just earning achievements.Overall this game is a must if you love old school fps. It's bringing it to it's full glory, like Serious Sam and Painkiller did few years back. Don't sleep on it!			"

												Shadow Warrior is an excellent classic arcade-style shooter. There aren't too many around these days, and Shadow Warrior stands head and shoulders above most.The good:-The swordplay: Definitely the strong point of the game. Incredible in both visuals and execution. While chopping my way through hordes of demons, I often neglected the rest of the arsenal, simply because it was just so much more satisfying to use the katana. You'd be hard pressed to find a game with better (or at least more spectacular) melee combat.-The writing and dialogue: A very nice mix between the serious and the silly, with neither side becoming too tedious or too repetitive. Lo Wang's quips are reminiscent of 80's B-movies in both style and delivery. If you enjoyed Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, you will love this! As for the story, it's surprisingly good for a first person shooter; my expectations were exceeded greatly. The voice acting should also not go unmentioned; Hoji's and Lo Wang's voice actors maintain superb delivery throughout.-The upgrade system: Simple and integrates with the fast paced combat very well. No skill trees, no minmaxing; just whatever makes you faster and deadlier (or adds more barrels to your gun). The non-sword based powers were also a nice touch, offering just a little extra depth to the combat.While I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone in search for a fresh take on the FPS genre, I'd be lying if I said it was all good. Some weak points:-The boss fights: Complely underwhelming, and not anything like the rest of the game (Deus Ex: HR, anyone?). Every single boss fight is your bog standard shoot-the-big-dude-in-the-massive-glowing-spot battle. There are 4 boss battles throughout, and all are nearly identical. The only saving grace is that they are of almost zero challenge, so you won't suffer for long.-The variety of enemies: However spectacular the combat may be, your targets will be the standard demon most of the time.     Throughout the game, you'll find two more types of the demon, and two bigger, miniboss-esque creatures: the Necromancer and the Warlord. Other than these, there's the odd troop of human gangsters, but overall, there's little difference in the standard enemy units.To sum up, Shadow Warrior is not without some flaws, but for anyone wishing to try something slightly different, it's an excellent experience. If you're interested in the time taken to complete, it took me 12 hours on normal, so it's definitely longer than most games these days. There's an NG+ for completionists, too.			"

												One of those times when a reboot does not just a decent job, but more like an AWESOME job at polishing an old gem. Action, comedy and rabbits humping; it's all more than enough for me to give it a thumbs up.For an in-house engine from rather young developers, it's impressive how good the Linux porting job was (heck, it performs better than it did on Windows for me). There's just the lil' quirk of mirrors not working, but I'm sure that'll get fixed eventually, since it kinda ♥♥♥♥s up the mood of a certain cutscene.			"

You won't get bored in this game, there's always something happening ( unless you clean an area and decide to stay there. XD ) there are many enemies, and many SECRETS ! Some of those are even really hard to find, just like the old times xD It's a bit more linear than what it used to be, but the maps are still damn large and detailed, and that's awesome !

												The original Shadow Warrior (1997) was a crass and quick cash-in on the popularity of Duke Nukem 3D released a year earlier. What Duke 3D’s Duke was to casual sexism, Shadow Warrior’s Lo Wang was to casual racism. This reboot isn’t as heavy on the corny cliches and stereotyping, but it’s still able to offend the more sensitive types. Thankfully, beneath the oriental trimmings and plot centered around themes of eastern mysticism, is a first-person shooter that excels at being what it is. Flying Wild Hog knows their stuff, as was proven by their excellent yet overlooked cyberpunk shooter Hard Reset (2011). Unlike the recent Rise of the Triad and Duke Nukem reboots, this one nails it. It’s the run-and-gun hard-boiled action 90s first-person shooter fans crave, but with modern trimmings to keep it fresh.Using money, karma and ki crystals you find throughout levels, you can upgrade Lo Wang’s guns, buy attachments, and purchase powerful spells. The gunplay works well in conjunction with the spell system, letting you do both at once, for some nice combo moves. After each fight, you get scored based on how creative you were with your bullets, katana and mystical powers. The corny plot even manages to hold it together all the way to the end.			"

												The reboot lacks polish, the combat is unbalanced (the Katana is overpowered as hell and there isn't much point in using many of the other weapons), and some of the levels have awful structure to them. But the visceral melee combat with its chaotic gore is so awesome, that it is powerful enough to overshadow most of the titles flaws. Shadow Warrior is not a perfect re-imagining of the 90s shooter, but it's pretty damn close.My full review is available here:

That's less important to knowing what this game feels like, but imagine a bald Kendrick with a weiner murdering the ever living demon sauce out of any and everything that runs off a rooftop or around a corner at you. Her. Him? Himher? (Shim?)I spent 90% of the game slashing and/or stabbing things to pieces, usually one head sized piece and one everything else sized piece, but the gunplay is old school cool. You have a very basic dial-a-combo for sword attacks and ye olde magic of death, destruction, and shielding. Lots of secrets to find, especially if you've been playing FPS games since dos days.Also language and straight up poor behaviour throughout.Highly encouraged that everyone who is even mildly interested give it a shot. It's great at full price, and the frequent 90% offs make it a must try. Go, as soon as possible, and enjoy being Miss Mr Anna Kendrick: Sword Weilding Gun-nut and all around stupendous bad♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Back in the 90s I was more of a PC kid than a console kid, so that meant I had a lot of experience with the PC’s premier genre: shooters. Duke Nukem 3D, Dark Forces, Quake, Wolfenstein, Doom (of course) and even Blood were a few of the FPS classics I grew up on. Strangely enough, though, I never got around to playing the original Shadow Warrior, a 3D Realms-developed pastiche of Hong Kong exploitation martial arts flicks from the 70s and 80s. The game was full of heavy weapons, gratuitous violence and over-the-top monsters; check, check and check for shooters of that era. However the game’s rather embarrassing Asian stereotypes allowed for some unusual enemy and weapon design, particularly in that it was one of the few FPS games that let you wield a sword.I’m sorry to say that’s the extent of my knowledge of Shadow Warrior, which meant I was going into the remake more or less fresh. I may have been new to Shadow Warrior, but I was at least familiar with the developer. Flying Wild Hog, the Warsaw, Poland-based studio tasked with remaking Shadow Warrior, broke onto the scene in 2011 with their stunningly beautiful (and difficult!) retro-FPS, Hard Reset. I really enjoyed Hard Reset—the developers managed to mix brutal, fast-paced gameplay with some of the most gorgeous cyberpunk visuals I’ve ever seen in a videogame, and all at a rock-solid framerate. If anyone was up to the task of remaking an old school classic like Shadow Warrior, it was Flying Wild Hog. It’s also great that Devolver Digital is publishing, as they’ve shown that they know and love the retro action genre.The re-imagined game is still a retro-style shooter and still stars the smarmily-named protagonist Lo Wang, but the story has been completely updated, and the borderline racist Asian stereotyping has been toned down quite a bit. Lo Wang is still a Chinese-Japanese born mercenary in the hire of the egotistical billionaire Zilla, but the story is a bit more complex than the revenge plot of the original game. Zilla tasks Lo Wang with retrieving the Nobitsura Kage, a legendary demon-infused katana, but Lo Wang quickly discovers his mission has a lot more going on. The Kage is linked to a demonic invasion that Lo lands right in the middle of. Lo must team up with a snarky, amnesiac demon named Hoji in order to battle the encroaching demon hordes, get hold of the three pieces of the Kage and find out just what Zilla wants with the sword.Lo Wang might still be essentially a walking♥♥♥♥♥♥joke, but Flying Wild Hog smartly plays the name for ironic laughs throughout the game, instead of just making it a tired, one-note gag. Lo is still a badass but he’s also kind of an otaku shut-in too; he’s obsessed with 80s action flicks and videogames (Lo has arcade cabinets of Devolver’s other properties, including Serious Sam and Hotline Miami) and even has a massive underground lair dubbed “the Wangcave.” Lo comments that he stocked his lair to prepare for the zombie apocalypse, but a demon apocalypse will have to suffice. Hoji snarkily remarks that out of all the badass warriors in Japan, he had to get stuck with the nerd.The interplay between Lo and Hoji was one of my favorite parts of the story. The writing is really good here, and while the plot delves into some pretty heavy mythology, Hoji grounds the whole story by taking a sarcastic, cavalier attitude to the ancient struggle between gods and warriors that he and Lo get caught up in. The cutscenes are told in gorgeous moving woodblock paintings, resplendent with some very cool graphical effects, similar to Hard Reset’s rough, sketchy comic panel cinematics but with their own distinct Asian style. That said, like Hard Reset the larger story can be a little hard to follow at times.The themes at play here are quite refreshing. After dozens of shooters populated by zombies, terrorists, and even Western depictions of demons (usually sourced from the Bible) it was great to see enemies inspired by Eastern mythology. I’m no expert in Shinto or Taoist legends, but I got the sense that the game borrows its demons from both Japanese and Chinese myth, mirroring Lo Wang’s mixed ancestry. This means you get to fight some very cool demons—minions wearing masks or carrying poison sake barrels on their backs, old hags wielding katanas, deranged Samurai-like monsters with ornate shields, and giant, mystical shamans that spawn endless waves of skeleton warriors. Each enemy has the ability to become enraged as well, transforming into creatures that are even fiercer and more grotesque.Of course with such a healthy roster of monsters just itching to get slashed to pieces, blasted apart and thoroughly ventilated by 9mm slugs, Lo Wang better have an arsenal that is varied and fun to use. This is where Flying Wild Hog excels—Hard Reset had essentially two guns that had multiple modes and attachments—and the developers bring that experience to Shadow Warrior, full bore. Lo’s conventional tools of the trade include a revolver, SMG, crossbow, shotgun, flamethrower and rocket launcher. Pretty basic stuff for an FPS, but the developers included an upgrade tree very similar to the one in Hard Reset.Once you have collected enough cash you can give the shotgun four barrels instead of just two, and enable the ability to fire all four at the same time. The crossbow can be upgraded with remotely detonated explosive-tipped bolts. Just like in the original game, Lo can dual-wield SMGs and attach a laser sight for accurate shooting. Napalm bombs for the flamethrower, wide blast radius “Nuke Dukem” rockets, and a cowboy-style fanable hammer for the revolver are a few of the other goodies you can bolt onto your guns. In the best of FPS traditions, Shadow Warrior encourages you to swap between weapons during a battle.The upgrade system isn’t limited to the guns, though. With the help of Hoji, Lo can develop several powers and skills by gaining XP (chi points) and collecting rare ki crystals. With the right skill unlocks you can levitate whole groups of enemies into the air, recover health mid-battle, increase your critical hit chance, go into a damage-boosted desperation frenzy when you’re close to death, and even increase your spatial awareness so that you find more money and ammo. This makes for a frenetic, rich combat style far beyond anything else I’ve seen in a recent shooter. That said, it’s the Nobitsura Kage—the sword—that really makes Shadow Warrior stand out.Ironically, having a sword play a central role in the arsenal set Shadow Warrior apart back in 1997 and it does so again in 2013. Sadly few FPS games even try to approximate swordplay, probably because it’s damn hard to do. I still consider Red Steel 2 on the Wii to be the best swordfighting game ever made, mostly because its smart use of motion controls actually made me feel just a little bit like I was learning the katas of some obscure, wild west martial art. The new Shadow Warrior comes in at a close second. I’m as surprised as anyone, but Flying Wild Hog has taken that same “muscle memory” feeling of learning a fighting art and imparted it to a keyboard and mouse.Using the arrow keys, you can slash the katana in different directions. Pretty simple stuff, but a big difference from games that just lets you spam random melee attacks and call it a day. Once you start upgrading the sword with magical powers, combat becomes a lot more fun. By double-tapping different directional keys and clicking the mouse, Lo can eventually perform several suitably badass moves. These include a circular crowd-clearing move that’s great for mutilating a mob of smaller enemies, a backwards swipe that launches a slicing disc of energy from the sword, and a quick thrusting stab that saps enemy health and replenishes your own. I really wish you could use the katana during the massive, Metroid Prime-esque boss encounters.Rating: 9/10 Excellent "

												The original Shadow Warrior (1997) was a crass and quick cash-in on the popularity of Duke Nukem 3D released a year earlier. What Duke 3D’s Duke was to casual sexism, Shadow Warrior’s Lo Wang was to casual racism. This reboot isn’t as heavy on the corny cliches and stereotyping, but it’s still able to offend the more sensitive types. Thankfully, beneath the oriental trimmings and plot centered around themes of eastern mysticism, is a first-person shooter that excels at being what it is. Flying Wild Hog knows their stuff, as was proven by their excellent yet overlooked cyberpunk shooter Hard Reset (2011). Unlike the recent Rise of the Triad and Duke Nukem reboots, this one nails it. It’s the run-and-gun hard-boiled action 90s first-person shooter fans crave, but with modern trimmings to keep it fresh.Using money, karma and ki crystals you find throughout levels, you can upgrade Lo Wang’s guns, buy attachments, and purchase powerful spells. The gunplay works well in conjunction with the spell system, letting you do both at once, for some nice combo moves. After each fight, you get scored based on how creative you were with your bullets, katana and mystical powers. The corny plot even manages to hold it together all the way to the end.			"

												Kay so it's been over a year and i still play this game.... slashing demons is just so fun 10/10I love how attacking demons/people at certian spots with your sword can be more/less effective.The moves are cool, especially the power that throws the blade out. Going for legs seems good at killing demons who block too much and head is always a good spot if you can get it.The guns have cool upgrades, I think my favorite is the crossbow's explosive tips, you can set up (3?) bolts at once and blow them up remotely.The storyline is inbetween meh and good.Remembering the combos are actually really simpleW, A, S or D two times + right or left mouse clickThe only complaints I have are:There are a few points where you need to deal with this thing only able to be shot in the back, that was annoying.The game encourages you to hide at low HP and heal, I like what Doom(2016) did where it gives a lot of health if you charge forward and risk dying.The level layout is bad in the latest parts of the game, the level that forces you to use the mask thing is the one I'd complain about, you can't tell where to go and there's no waypoint or map to tell you where to go, if you end up quitting and playing the next day, it is very confusing.

												Shadow Warrior is one of the rare few modern shooters that plays like a retro shooter. Level based with secrets items, hordes of enemies spawning at specific segments and crazy weapons! But what really steal the show is your Katana. This is the tightest melee combat I've ever played and I wish other games would be this fluid and satisfying to slice and dice enemies to little bits :DThe game also does a great job introducing different enemy types which require different strategies, like spawners, flying enemies or big dudes with shields who you'll have to either get behind or shoot at their feet to expose them.There's also light RPG elements where you can level your character and weapons, shaping the game around your play style! The graphics are also top notch, but can be a bit pressing on some computers.If you'd like to see the game in-action, here's an unofficial First Look (although I was using this video to test a new mic, it's a good highlight for the action this game provides)

At the end there are again great maps, oriental, rich in details.Enemies are well desinged, but,  not variety of them is questionable.

It's remarkable how sword fights in this arcade-like fps are enjoyable.Game offers many secrets, and skills to unlock, and that gives players reason to try again for something more than just earning achievements.Overall this game is a must if you love old school fps.

												Shadow Warrior is an excellent classic arcade-style shooter. There aren't too many around these days, and Shadow Warrior stands head and shoulders above most.The good:-The swordplay: Definitely the strong point of the game. Incredible in both visuals and execution. While chopping my way through hordes of demons, I often neglected the rest of the arsenal, simply because it was just so much more satisfying to use the katana. You'd be hard pressed to find a game with better (or at least more spectacular) melee combat.-The writing and dialogue: A very nice mix between the serious and the silly, with neither side becoming too tedious or too repetitive. Lo Wang's quips are reminiscent of 80's B-movies in both style and delivery. If you enjoyed Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, you will love this! As for the story, it's surprisingly good for a first person shooter; my expectations were exceeded greatly. The voice acting should also not go unmentioned; Hoji's and Lo Wang's voice actors maintain superb delivery throughout.-The upgrade system: Simple and integrates with the fast paced combat very well. No skill trees, no minmaxing; just whatever makes you faster and deadlier (or adds more barrels to your gun). The non-sword based powers were also a nice touch, offering just a little extra depth to the combat.While I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone in search for a fresh take on the FPS genre, I'd be lying if I said it was all good. Some weak points:-The boss fights: Complely underwhelming, and not anything like the rest of the game (Deus Ex: HR, anyone?). Every single boss fight is your bog standard shoot-the-big-dude-in-the-massive-glowing-spot battle. There are 4 boss battles throughout, and all are nearly identical. The only saving grace is that they are of almost zero challenge, so you won't suffer for long.-The variety of enemies: However spectacular the combat may be, your targets will be the standard demon most of the time.     Throughout the game, you'll find two more types of the demon, and two bigger, miniboss-esque creatures: the Necromancer and the Warlord. Other than these, there's the odd troop of human gangsters, but overall, there's little difference in the standard enemy units.To sum up, Shadow Warrior is not without some flaws, but for anyone wishing to try something slightly different, it's an excellent experience. If you're interested in the time taken to complete, it took me 12 hours on normal, so it's definitely longer than most games these days. There's an NG+ for completionists, too.			"

												One of those times when a reboot does not just a decent job, but more like an AWESOME job at polishing an old gem. Action, comedy and rabbits humping; it's all more than enough for me to give it a thumbs up.For an in-house engine from rather young developers, it's impressive how good the Linux porting job was (heck, it performs better than it did on Windows for me). There's just the lil' quirk of mirrors not working, but I'm sure that'll get fixed eventually, since it kinda ♥♥♥♥s up the mood of a certain cutscene.			"

												This is not your ordinary Wang.. er, game.  You play as a younger Lo Wang, drawn into a conflict between the human world and the ""shadow world"".  You start out with just your basic katana and shuriken, of which there's an infinite supply.  You'll receive other weapons in the game, such as an 8-shot revolver, sub-machinegun which can be wielded akimbo, a crossbow, and more.  The gunplay is excellent, but the real heart of this game is in the sword.  You have full control over the blade if you want, where your view and foot movements steer the blade slashes.  This is a sword game with guns in it, instead of a gun game with swords in it.  You'll definitely use both along the way, no mistake about it, and you have to master all weapons in order to survive.It starts out a bit slow, but after a few chapters there's no shortage of demons to slay.  Along the way you'll collect Ki crystals which give you dark powers, and karma points based on your combat style and finding certain items, which can enhance your skills, allowing you to do some amazing things with that sword.  In addition, there's money for upgrading your weapons.  Using combinations of skills, powers, and various weapons will grant you the most karma out of a fight.  There's no shortage of secrets, hidden items, and nods to the original Shadow Warrior.I can't recommend this game highly enough.  If you like plodding, ultra ""realistic"" 2-weapon only military-shooter wannabe games with regenerating health, then this is not that game.  If you like action games with no weapon carry limit, interesting enemies - including some huge bosses - and having just about everything in your environment able to explode and hurt enemies (and you), and you like dicing enemies to bits with a blade, then this is your game.

												It's rare that I regret spending £2.99 on a game.It's even rarer when that regret comes from enjoying the game, and wishing I'd paid more. See, that's what happened here, and for a skinflint like me to admit that says volumes.Shadow Warrior then. Reboot of the ""classic"" (racist) 3D Realms FPS, which I liked as a kid but which time has not been kind to. Remember how the ratings board in the UK made them replace the shurikens with darts, 'cos of fears that children would start lobbing death stars at each other? Darts are impossible to throw, of course, and not widely available. Not like shurikens, which are EVERYWHERE. Lo Wang is back, and once again he has brought along his little book of cheeky, timely quips. This time around they're quite funny, so that's ok. He's now a lackey for the head of Zilla Corp. (remember them from the first game?), and when an attempt to buy an ancient sword goes awry, Lo Wang is forced to chase it down, and graphically butcher anyone and everyone in his path. You've got your sword and your guns and here are some bad guys, what more do you want?How about MAGIC POWERS? Yep, don't remember those from the Shadow Warrior of old. After a demon hitches a ride in your body, you get the power to earn and spend Karma points (found in blood fountains and as a reward for killing enemies, more on that later) on spells. My favourite is the healing spell, because I'm so often at death's door...The action here is decidely old-school, and blisteringly fast. Lo Wang is, when he's not tripping over his own appendage, a nimble chap. By tapping shift you can do a short range dash in any of the cardinal directions, getting right up into an enemies face to hack him to bits with the katana, or leaping back to find a safe spot and get a spell ready. Speaking of which, most of them are offensive, and you'll want to use them in battle as often as you can. Some clever design ideas help keep the action in full flow, like how enemies frequently leave a soul when they're killed which will replenish your health during a fight. You'll want to charge in and keep killing, lay waste to all before you, hoovering these up as you go, and chip away at the bigger, stronger enemies.Shadow Warrior, like the excellent Bulletstorm before it, features a ""points"" system, where certain actions award points, and collecting them affects your rating after each big fight, and how much bonus Karma you'll get. For instance, beheading an enemy might get you 100 pts, whereas simply killing it by shooting it in the chest will only get you 10. You are rewarded for speed, flair, and ingenuity - keep an eye out for explosive barrels! You might successfully defeat a big horde of enemies without taking a speck of damage, but if you were too slow and didn't mix things up, you'll get a paltry karma reward. It isn't rare to find after a big fight that you'll want to do it all over again, to see if you can get a bigger bonus (and make a bigger mess).The real star of the show in terms of weaponry is your trusty Katana, and I've never grown bored of it. The guns are all perfectly good, nothing wrong with them at all, but the katana is so good, it's tough to let it go. I was playing this and iD software's RAGE concurrently, and I missed it so much. I felt slow, and leaden. Lo Wang has speed and power. Matron.I like this game a lot more than I thought I would. It's not big and it's not clever, but it is a heck of a lot of fun and a great palate cleanser between more serious games. Now, who wants some Wang?			"

												I kind of expected that this was updated version of the old Shadow Warrior. I was positively surprised, this game doesn't rely on just nostalgia. There's plenty of nods to the original, but this is totally new game.Serious Sam 3 (I haven't played the first two) might be close cousin to this game, but this one has better humor and tighter plot progression. Though I didn't finish Serious Sam, so comparison might not be totally accurate. What you can expect is swordplay that's supported with skills that keep sword relevant during whole game. Also weapons can be upgraded. Game is relatively linear, which makes it somewhat more frustrating when there's no good clues on where to go next. Though exploration is rewarded, mostly with just ammo and money, but sometimes with karma that will help gaining more skills. And of course fortune cookies!I think I finished the game in about 20 hours. I did explore quite a lot, rushing through the game should be lot faster.If you want to hunt achievements, you get to keep all skills and weapon upgrades on second replay. That makes it much easier to get achievements that depend on number of kills etc.			"

Pros Slice and dice enemies using sword combos Very nice graphics Tons of weapons that actually have both up- and downsides (be careful with those rockets) Contains humping bunnies (and other easter eggs)Cons: Levels feel quite linear at the start (gets better later in the game) Some map areas look like being accessible but aren't (invisible walls) Enemies being trigerred by entering an area feels a bit dull at timesOverall I can recommend this game for anybody who doesn't care too much about a story but wants some serious demon slicing action.

												Wow, this game's swordplay, the other weaponry and the story is just phenomenal. The sword feels so satisfying to use and cut a part enemies with the gore flying around. The weapons can be upgraded to your liking so you can choose your favourite weapon(s). The story is powerful, especially at the end of the game. I'd highly recommend this title if you like FPS games with great melee combat, cheesey humour and engaging story.			"

												Imagine if Anna Kendrick was a modern day samurai ninja assassin thief spy with a gun fetish. And also a dude. That's less important to knowing what this game feels like, but imagine a bald Kendrick with a weiner murdering the ever living demon sauce out of any and everything that runs off a rooftop or around a corner at you. Her. Him? Himher? (Shim?)I spent 90% of the game slashing and/or stabbing things to pieces, usually one head sized piece and one everything else sized piece, but the gunplay is old school cool. You have a very basic dial-a-combo for sword attacks and ye olde magic of death, destruction, and shielding. Lots of secrets to find, especially if you've been playing FPS games since dos days.Also language and straight up poor behaviour throughout.Highly encouraged that everyone who is even mildly interested give it a shot. It's great at full price, and the frequent 90% offs make it a must try. Go, as soon as possible, and enjoy being Miss Mr Anna Kendrick: Sword Weilding Gun-nut and all around stupendous bad♥♥♥♥♥			"

It starts off (and keeps being) very wacky, with a not-so-subtle 80s-to-90s action movie vibe (quiffs and one-liners galore), but - without going into spoilerish details - turns into something almost dramatic, and sad in the end.The gameplay is fast and furious, but not unfair. Ok, sometimes you might get squiched in a cavalcade of demons, but even if push comes to shove, the auto-save system kicks in and you don't lose much progress. Of note are the chapters, or levels: It's not the tunnelvision you might be used from current shooters, but rather something with actual thought in the design. There are no quest markers, no ""You are going the wrong way"". Sometimes you have to backtrack, sometimes the way seems obvious, but there are always hidden, or not so hidden, secrets to be found off the track.(What I played: Finished the game on normal mode, found some secrets, but not all of them.)

												This fps has very enjoyable game play with lots of interesting guns. Additionally there is one of the best katana combat systems in this game. The story is not particularly amazing or deep but I personalyy didnt care because the gameplay was so fun. The campaign has a decent length to it and the arena mode more than covers any desired replay value. Then enemie variety is great with everything from cannon fodder to massive bosses. Although there was one enemy type that was just a pain to deal with. It was a charger character with one vulnerable weak spot. It kept messing with the flow of the game since it would regularly be the last foe standing and take a minute or two to bring down one of them. This could take me as long as six minutes when there were four to kill. However the rest presented and ideal challenge and with lots of ways to deal with them. Ammo is pretty plentiful so if you are looking to be forced to change weapons that will not be quite the case. You will not be able to use the same weapon for the whole game since ammo drops are not that plentiful but a skilled player could mangage to use only two weapons. The exception to this previous statment is the  katana, which can be used for the whole game for obvious reasons. I can not comment on the viscera clean up detail bonus game since I have not played it.			"

												Shadow Warrior is one of those games that really goes back to what it used to mean to be a shooter. From the exploration, to the lack of regeneration health, the challenging enemies, and the absolutely absurd story. Shadow Warrior feels like a first person shooter designed in the mid 90's, with the amazing high definition graphics of today. If you love old school shooter then this one will feel right at home, if you don't then take a break from the linear first person shooters of today and experience something fresh, you won't be disappointed.

												I must recommend this game. It turned out to be much better than I expected, based on the promo videos. SW is a fun action game that is best for melee attacks. If you like Dead Island for melee (like I do), you’ll love Shadow Warrior. That katana is awesome. Guns too, especially later in the game. Purchase the dual-wielding option for the mini submachine gun. Buildup your character (Lo Wang) as the game progresses. Gather money for weapons upgrades, Ki crystals for powers, and karma points for skills. Although the game has lots of light banter, the underlying story is rich and serious indeed, if a bit confusing. This was a surprising and pleasing discovery. It helped motivate me thorough what begins to be a grind of arena battles, of which there are many, many.Bosses are enormous giants. Boss fights are doable and not too hard. Just remember to heal yourself frequently, circle to pick up powerups and shoot for the weak points when they appear. The “powers” must be invoked by keyboard/mouse combos. This can be a bit of a problem because it takes a bit of doing to remember them and invoke them when you need them most – during a battle.Map landscapes and architecture are very detailed and often beautifully done. Shadow world maps are sparse. Game was rock solid – stable movement throughout, no crashes or glitches, never got stuck, frequent checkpoints.I would give this game 85/100 for action, story, artistic presentation, and sheer fun.

												Excellent graphics, music and gameplay. Didnt have this much fun with melee combat since Dark Messiah of M&M (you will want and you will spend 90% of time wielding katana Nobitsura Kage), ranged weapons are also interesting (demon head for the win).Combat is extremely bloody and fun (especially chopping enemies with katana), but also challenging (when fighting swarm ofenemies). Story is also interesting with crazy twists. There are even three separate categories of upgrades (weapons,powers and skills)Maps are worth exploring (there are lots of easter eggs and hidden levels and locations).SW especially shines when it comes to humor(dialogues between Lo Wang and Hoji are memorable, Lo Wang's one-liners mocking almost everything are hillarious, fortune cookies, parodies...).You thought Duke Nukem and Dante are cool jerks with crazy comments? You haven't met Lo Wang.This game is fantastic...I mean Wangtastic.And whatever you do, early in the game...DON'T ATTACK CUTE BUNNIES FOR YOUR OWN GOOD!			"

												It's rare that I play an FPS action game all the way through, the last being TES V, but this one kept me going to the end.  The combat, while repetive depending on how you play, remains entertaining to the very last encounter.  The sword play is fluid and will never leave you frustrated with bad mechanics.  The action is high paced but I don't like how the simple puzzles cause unnecessary breaks in your progress.  Most give you more things to fight anyway.  This game brought back the classic FPS feel that Duke Nukem: Forever failed to deliver.  The game is witty and jokes in good taste.  The introduction of Lo Wang in his car is worth the price alone.  Many jokes and kung fu pop culture references compliment the game play well.  I played through my first time on normal and completed it in 8 hours.  The game was effortlessly easy on normal difficulty so I would recommend taking the highest difficulty for a challenging experience.  The upgrade system is there to give a nice diversity in play style but it wasn't to my taste since I use the sword whenever I can but that is just me.  Overall the game is a refreshing FPS experience that I recommend to anyone who enjoys FPS actions or hasn't played a good one in a while.			"

												I just want to say that I was initially frustrated by this game, but I gave it a second chance.  I cleared my mind of the bad habits that modern shooters had instilled in me:  Being Cautious, Conserving Resources, Fearing Death.  And suddenly it was 12 hours later and I was exhausted and oh hey the sun is coming up how did that happen.  The combat system in this game is amazingly engrossing.  I probably didn't take nearly as much advantage as I could have of some of the crowd control sword moves, but honestly, that would have sullied the Zen I had achieved while wading through the hip deep pools of blood I created mowing down everything that wasn't me.  The Sword is Useful, Effective, and provides the right amount of Feedback to make melee exceptionally satisfying.  You will want to use it.  Most of the guns are not immediately wonderful but if you invest in their upgrades nearly all of them BECOME wonderful.  Bottom line, if you've been burned by previous ""Reimaginings"" of classic franchises, I implore you to give the concept one more chance.  Shadow Warrior does it right.			"

												Played a lot of this in WINE before the linux port, and now that the linux port is out, it runs fantastic! Max out everything on i7-2700k and gtx 770 without any performance issues.I would like to see the FSAA options that are in the windows version in the linux version as well. FXAA is not nice, and I have enough graphics power to handle some of the heavier AA methods. Driver forced MSAA can be buggy.Also, with wine I could stretch the game across all three of my monitors (fake virtual desktop resolution). The linux port does not allow you to do this. Still a great port, however.Due to the great performance, I would have to say the ""recommended settings"" are a bit high. someone with a 750ti could run this thing on high settings at 1080p/60fps.If anyone knows of any console commands to get triple monitor support or better AA, let me know.

Pretty long game, I was expecting it to be short but wasn't disappointed. Melee combat for me was stood out to me the most :D. Huge fan of advance melee combat, similar to Mount and Blade where you can direct a sword swing with your mouse. It's not as indepth as Mount and Blade but doesn't make slicing a demon in half any less satisfying.			"

												First, let me start off by saying that I grew up with the original Shadow Warrior (and many of the old build engine games) as some of my favorite games when I was younger. I have many, many fond memories of that/those games. So when I first heard that they were rebooting it, I was a little hesitant. However, then I heard that Flying Wild Hogs was at the helm and I felt a little better. However, I also was worried that the racial & sexist stuff (which in many ways made the original what it was) would not be present due to the climate of today’s society... and quite frankly, rightfully so. Many of those racial things in the original were extreme and highly racist & sexist, so they really have no place in a modern intelligent game. Anyway, I am pleased to say that they did away with the racist stuff and improved on almost every aspect of the Shadow Warrior universe. The combat and controls are tight. The guns are amazing. The enemies are relentless. The core mechanics are awesome. But at the forefront is the swordplay. The Katana is no longer just a melee weapon that you use when you run out of bullets. It is the star of the show. I would argue that it is second main character of the whole game. If you liked hard reset, you will love this game. If you like Japanese culture, you will love this game. If you love great single player, story driven FPS's, you will absolutely love this game! Buy, buy BUY!!!			"

												8.5/10Overview: First Person Melee/ShooterThe Good:+ Graphics- both on an artistic and technical level everything looks fantastic. Every environment spread across 17 levels feels distinct. The only downside is the developers went heavy with the bloom lighting.+ Combat is fun and satisfying. The game gives you a variety of different weapons at your disposal. The katana, your main weapon is usually your go to weapon when things start to go bad. It slices and dices enemies to bits. You also have guns that are slowly acquired through the game. The first half of the game seems to be more reliant on your katana and when the larger enemies show up is when your guns start to become more useful. You also have a variety of spells and sword techniques that can give you the upper hand in combat. No matter how you choose to dismember your enemies, you will always have a good time.+ The game features a very robust upgrade system. Money is used to upgrade your weapons. Each weapon has 3 upgrades. Ki crystals are used to upgrade your spells. Each spell has 4 upgrades. Lastly as you defeat your enemies you gain experience which is used to upgrade your passive abilities and sword techniques.  + Secrets are scattered throughout every level, some secrets are a throwback to the original game+ The story starts off very weak however the more it starts to reveal itself the more interesting it gets.  The story is told through comic book style cut scenes that look beautiful. Throughout the game you are accompanied by a demon named Hoji who at first is really annoying but starts to grow on you. + The game is very polished. Even with all the explosions and all the effects happening my game barely dropped below 60fps. + New Game plus to start the game over with all your upgrades and weapons. The Average:You have the ability to dash forward. If you dash on top of a steep staircase you will die. This gets really frustrating as you will be dashing all the time and this will probably be the cause of a lot of needless deaths.  The developers said this bug/""Feature"" cannot be fixed.As much fun as the game is, it starts to wear itself out in the last few levels. Once you've seen all the enemies and upgraded all that you need, fighting the same hordes of enemies over and over again starts getting boring. Luckily the game ends before it really becomes a bigger issue.   This is one of those rare first person shooters where playing with a controller is preferable. The reason being is that you have to input directional inputs to cast your spells and I found it easier to do with a controller than a K/M. In addition the game relies more heavily on melee combat than guns so precise aiming is never really a concern.  Some of the later levels can get a bit confusing. I felt the last boss was underwhelming. I guess I was expecting something more.  ConclusionThis game is a remake of an old school FPS however this is not an old school fps. Levels are mostly linear with only one way to progress while throwing large amounts of enemies at you for you to dispose. If you enjoy fighting large groups of enemies while you level up your abilities than you will have a good time with the game. Overall this is definitely worth checking out and a very underrated game that deserves a bit more attention. "

												I only play on Linux, so I'm always doubtful when I buy a nice-looking game that may require some power since Linux ports are often in an alpha state (or worse). And... What a lovely surprise! This was recommended on Reddit, and I guess people were right about it.✓ Nice performance on Linux (so far, everything went flawlessly)✓ Good graphics✓ Entertaining combat system (""heads will roll"")✓ Cool Katana/cutting physics✓ Terrible puns✓ Gameplay variation with multiple character improvementsThis is Devil May Cry meets Kill Bill. You should not hesitate to buy it (especially when there's a discount).			"

												While I'm marking this as recommended, this game fails to avoid many of the pitfalls of modern first-person shooters.What the game does wrong • Confusing level design when trying to stray away from the linearity. This happens in roughly half of the ""break the 3 magical seals"" sections, as well as the labs level. The use of invisible walls, which are usually not too bad, really aggravates this.• Some of the weapons are extremely situational while some others are too good in any given situation. It gives you little reason to use/upgrade parts of your arsenal.• Tendency to pad out levels with more of the same fights, with seemingly little thought being given to how to shake things up a little. The latter half of the game degenerates quickly into ""let's throw every monster at the player at once"", with only the quantities varying. It's dull, it's not very fun.• A story that doesn't know whether it wants to be funny or dramatic. Witty cheap one-liners are followed by cutscenes about complex political plots and personal sorrow. I think it's possible to mix the two but as it stands, they clash too much. I feel like it would be possible to exploit this contrast for a good effect, and without that, the writing comes off as uncertain and incohesive.• A lot of looting. Way, way too much looting. Sure, you auto-pickup everything that's in containers, but spamming E everywhere gets old real quick.• The game has a rating system for fights where you can get bonus experience points (karma). While it flat out tells you that you should combo and vary the abilities you use, in practice, your different abilities do NOT guarantee that they'll actually serve their intended purpose. It feels like it's a lot up to random probability.• On several occasions I ended up becoming stuck for 10 minutes, unable to progress. On one instance, it was because a ragdolled enemy, which wasn't dead yet, refused to stand back up. On another, it's because I somehow went into a part of the level I wasn't supposed to be in, trapping myself behind locked doors. It's frustrating as hell.What the game does right• Binding the use of special abilities as tapping one direction twice + a mouse button. While it sometimes fails to register, the fact that this feels very natural really makes up for it.• The pre-rendered story cutscenes that are like animated dioramas are absolutely gorgeous.• Some of the writing is genuinely funny, but those moments are rare.Finally, a word on the game's production value. It feels a little cheap, with human models and faces suffering from the uncanny valley. The animation quality varies between average and good, but nothing bad especially stands out, besides the awful animation compression (creating the jitter issue). But I don't think that's the biggest issue. To me, the biggest issue is the extremely lackluster soundtrack. For well over half the game, there is no ambient music other than the same few loops, over and over and over and over. It wouldn't normally be that big of an issue, but when the level design has trouble directing you seamlessly towards your next objective and has you aimlessly run around for 5 minutes, it gets on your nerves.In summary, I'd give Shadow Warrior something like a 6,5/10? It's weird for an ""old school"" FPS to fall into modern flaws, but here we are, I guess.			"

It wouldn't normally be that big of an issue, but when the level design has trouble directing you seamlessly towards your next objective and has you aimlessly run around for 5 minutes, it gets on your nerves.In summary, I'd give Shadow Warrior something like a 6,5/10? It's weird for an ""old school"" FPS to fall into modern flaws, but here we are, I guess.			"

												Played a lot of this in WINE before the linux port, and now that the linux port is out, it runs fantastic! Max out everything on i7-2700k and gtx 770 without any performance issues.I would like to see the FSAA options that are in the windows version in the linux version as well. FXAA is not nice, and I have enough graphics power to handle some of the heavier AA methods. Driver forced MSAA can be buggy.Also, with wine I could stretch the game across all three of my monitors (fake virtual desktop resolution). The linux port does not allow you to do this. Still a great port, however.Due to the great performance, I would have to say the ""recommended settings"" are a bit high. someone with a 750ti could run this thing on high settings at 1080p/60fps.If anyone knows of any console commands to get triple monitor support or better AA, let me know.

												I only play on Linux, so I'm always doubtful when I buy a nice-looking game that may require some power since Linux ports are often in an alpha state (or worse). And... What a lovely surprise! This was recommended on Reddit, and I guess people were right about it.✓ Nice performance on Linux (so far, everything went flawlessly)✓ Good graphics✓ Entertaining combat system (""heads will roll"")✓ Cool Katana/cutting physics✓ Terrible puns✓ Gameplay variation with multiple character improvementsThis is Devil May Cry meets Kill Bill. You should not hesitate to buy it (especially when there's a discount).			"

												Shadow Warrior appears to be (arguably) the best swordplay game out there on the market. I craved for a shooter, but apparently katana's way is so much better! Every non-boss enemy in the game could be defeated with the sword only, even when they teleport on you in big numbers. No big deal — there is always a way to cut poor beggars heads off due to your greater mobility, ki-strikes and self-healing skills. Once you've invested into some Katana Mastery points, the game becomes hectic first person slasher like nothing else. Somehow, the whole game is balanced around beheading your enemies. (Bosses are unlike that though, there is a different gameplay for them to switch your pace.)Quick snapshot of your further experience with this game: you are below half of your health, dashing like a maniac between blooming sakura trees with your sword drawn, a dozen of lesser demons are running you down, while a pair of greater demons shoot green fireballs at you from afar. Gathering strength for the self-healing ki-strike you bash your way into the midst of the enraged horde: there is a smile on your face.In addition, Chinese cookies are delicious in this game. Would be such a waste if you don’t try them.			"

												First, let me start off by saying that I grew up with the original Shadow Warrior (and many of the old build engine games) as some of my favorite games when I was younger. I have many, many fond memories of that/those games. So when I first heard that they were rebooting it, I was a little hesitant. However, then I heard that Flying Wild Hogs was at the helm and I felt a little better. However, I also was worried that the racial & sexist stuff (which in many ways made the original what it was) would not be present due to the climate of today’s society... and quite frankly, rightfully so. Many of those racial things in the original were extreme and highly racist & sexist, so they really have no place in a modern intelligent game. Anyway, I am pleased to say that they did away with the racist stuff and improved on almost every aspect of the Shadow Warrior universe. The combat and controls are tight. The guns are amazing. The enemies are relentless. The core mechanics are awesome. But at the forefront is the swordplay. The Katana is no longer just a melee weapon that you use when you run out of bullets. It is the star of the show. I would argue that it is second main character of the whole game. If you liked hard reset, you will love this game. If you like Japanese culture, you will love this game. If you love great single player, story driven FPS's, you will absolutely love this game! Buy, buy BUY!!!			"

												Here is a game you probably passed on,even though it launched this september,Shadow Warrior is a perfect example of how a Reboot should be,from the devs that brought to us the excellent Hard Reset,comes a game on the same formula however fixing most of the issues that were present on hard reset.Just like the original you play as Lo Wang,one of the deadliest and funniest hitmans in the world,you are assigned with the mission to retrieve the legendary sword the Nobitsura Kage,however everything goes wrong and now you and your demon partner Hoji must stop the demon invasion by blowing everything up in your path and slicing demons to bits and pieces.The gunplay in this game is excellent however what they really nailed was the swordplay,its actually much more fun to go full on samurai on your enemies,believe-it or not you can actually finish the whole game by only using your katana and never shooting one bullet,kinda like Half-Life 2 Episode Two where you can finish the entire game by only using the Gravity Gun. Now talking about the weapons,you got a really diverse and powerful arsenal going from a revolver to a triple barrel rocket launcher and a demon head that spits laser out of its mouth,every weapon in the game is customizable by collecting money you find hidden around the levels.If you enjoy old school First-Person Shooters than definately get shadow warrior,its a lot of fun and you will definately not be disappointed,this was a game that when i finished it a satisfying ending made me close the game with a smile on my face wanting some more wang,so who wants some wang?

												A game like no other, and really brings the nostalgic feel of old school shooters and hack n' slash. Haven't played the original Shadow Warrior, though I have played old school shooters like doom and such so I anticipate its the same (please correct me if I'm wrong).You are Lo Wang, a seemingly hard-skin individual able to withstand tons of bullets and giant demons in suit of armors with ease. With an arsenal of badarsey weaponry, you will go through a a journey slaying humans and demons alike in a campaign length of about 8 - 15 hours.***PROS:****The pros. Oh boy. This game really hits you in the head with its old school combat. With drawbacks to the original with fanservice, references and... naked anime girls? The game comes in with 3 skill-tree like interfaces, called Powers, Skills, and Weapons (though the weapons are more like upgrades) which are- in my opinion pretty cool and can make one's user experience easier (please see cons). You will hack and slash (or gun your way through, but to be honest, no one ever uses guns.. right? I hope.) through a multitude of enemy types. Lo Wang, the protagonist, throughout the game undergoes pretty evident character development, going from a brat and dumb to a pro and awesome. The environments are also VERY well made IMO, able to maneuver quickly and efficiently without much obstacles in your way (unless its a corridor then might as well use your guns and dual-akimbo that crud).****CONS:****Cons, eh. Like I said before, Powers, Skills and Weapons will make one's user experience much, and I mean, MUCH easier. I really do NOT recommend playing this game on Normal or easier as that will ruin the classic ""Shadow Warrior"" experience. Besides, old school-like games are mean't to be played with a challenge, no doubt about that. Furthermore, I have two REALLY glaring problems for this game that I think I should address (in my opinion). The first being the enemies themselves. Even though I said that as a Pro point, they really recycled and reused the enemies A LOT. Every few chapters will have 1 new enemy and you will barely need to change your tactics at all. The boss fights are really cool at first, but it kinda disappointed me when every single boss is literally the same ""shoot dem armurz and u winz"", and to me, most bosses had the same skill sets with different animations (though the last boss fight when you had the Kage sword was pretty damn cool). Second major problem is the map layout and backtracking. As a Pro, the map design (like I said before) is really well made for combat situations. However, the devs seemed to have slacked off about 3/4 into the game. With the map so huge with no sense of direction, I found myself walking back and forth to realize I had to destroy a third statue 2 areas away where I came from in order to progress to the 3rd area I was in. The map flow was ideal for me at the beginning of the game, but it fell off at one point and it just felt damn lazy and it was very boring for me, not to mention that they even reused some parts of the map in other chapters as well.Even so, I do recommend this game. I wholeheartedly feel that, despite the cons, you will have loads of fun for the dozen of hours you will accumulate. Though, I suggest waiting for a price drop (as I got this for only 10 bucks) as I don't think the amount of content in this game is enough to satisfy that price range now (max 30 dollars imo) but they do include the Viscera Cleanup Detail version for free if you purchase this game.*NOTE: Everything is in my opinion, so pls no judgey			"

												""Shadow Warrior"" is one of those game that makes you wish Steam has third grade option, not just recommended or not. On one hand - it's fine specimen of FPS genre. On the other - it's just that. With it's outdated graphics and developers clear issue with making smaller objects it looks medicore at best from technical side. But the design? Very good, instantly catching that cheap oriental feeling of the '70 we all know from the movies and references to old titles.Gunplay is perfectly fine, all weapons feel right, have nice upgrades and even the revolver - your first firearm - is valid chocie till the end of the game. OK, the flamethrower - undperpowered. But except it, it'sjust fine. Unfortunately Katana and powers are ""meh"" all the way. While you will be running withy it, slicing and dicing quite a lot, it's unintuitive in use so you will keep to two moves that are more than enough to solve most of your demonic problems. And the plot? Yes, there is one. But as we say in Poland - dupy nie urywa or it's not mindblowing for those who can't speak more elaborate languages ;) It's not something that will keep you playing. Until the very end you will learn some facts, you will hear few stries. But it becomes understandable at the very end of the game. Wheter it is good or bad - it'scompletly personal. I liked it.  Much more interesting than main plot are small talks bewteen Wang and Hoiji (our demonic sidekick). When it comes to music - I have no idea. I turn off music in almost all games. But the sounds are good. Vocies too. And only thing that makes you irritated are Wang's one liners after gruesome kill. They are cheap - whichmight have been on purpose - and after heaing the same one dozens of time, you can get a bit angry...Overall... As I said at the begging. It's fine example of FPS but it's just that and there is plenty of titles that are just as good as ""Shadow Warrior"". Those of you who play shooters casually - it won't be good enough. FPS fans will find it suitable to distract their attention while they wait for some AAA title. Especially if you buy it one one of the sales.			"

												I only played this game for 2 hours, and it was only survival mode.But I don't need to play it any further to know that this game is ♥♥♥♥ing fun and akin to Serious Sam and other classic titles of the 90's. It's real effin colorful too and forgoes the realistic black and brown plague of recent ''trouble in a Middle-Eastern town'' shooters. Or, god forbid, the blue hue of Battlefield 3, which I just don't get. Actually, I'll update this later when I fully get to the game, but I already know it's gonna be awesome. I'm excited enough for it that I'll recommend it based on first impressions alone.------edit- I was right. It pretty much IS ''Serious Sam with Lo Wang'', the basic level progression is moving forward, encountering several enemies you have to take out, and proceeding with story scenes thrown here and there in the middle or towards the end of the level. Story scenes are kept succinct, obviously.One thing this game has that Serious Sam (or any other FPS title) doesn't have is fleshed out melee mechanics. Any other title and the melee weapon is merely a last resort for when you run out of ammo; ♥♥♥♥♥♥, slow, low damage output, and unwanted. Shadow Warrior made it so that your melee is versatile and preferable to long-range weapons. Don't get me wrong, sticky bombs on a crossbow and firing off 6 shotgun shells simultaneously is fun, but you have a dash that lets you get up to your enemies really quickly. You also have a sword technique to impale, to spin 360 degrees and clear out people around you, and to release a long range energy burst. Coupled with your healing technique you'll be dashing into enemies and clearing out waves, pulling back to heal (4 second heal time) and quickly rushing back in. In fact, I think its fair to say that the developers wanted you to mainly stick to your sword, since theres a level-up system that requires cash, and you might wanna forego buying ammo for weapons to scrougne up the funds to add bombs to your crossbow or to have auto-fire on your revolver. Which means that you'll only ever use your guns when you have the ammo to spare, to take out those annoying flying enemies, or when facing the larger enemies that really damage you if you stay close to them for long.Hell, I'll call this a first person hack and slash, or a FPS title-First Person Slicer. Witty, I know. There's nothing wrong with the guns, and the upgrades are REALLY worth it and make them incredibly fun. But the attention paid to melee makes this game really unique, and there's something satisfying about having your screen fill with blood and seeing a crowd of ghoulish faces up close rather than taking them out from afar. Your slashes and dashes are arguably more enjoyable than killing people from 15 feet away.I guess there are some downsides. Weapons are found as you progress with the game, rather than pickups in levels. So you don't get to enjoy the flamethrower until you're deeper into the game. Also, some enemy variety in attack patterns would make combat a little more tactical and less of a 'mow♥♥♥♥♥♥down' fest. There's the aformentioned bomb enemy, and those flying dudes that become a target range. But it still feels like there could've been more. Let me see...the environments and enemies look good, but some of the character models in cut scenes look a little low-tier, but its an FPS title so who cares. When I'm finding myself trying to pick negatives rather than them coming immediately to mind that means its a good game.			"

												Before I bought this game, I read some reviews and watched some videos. The game looked absolutely fantastic! And, at first, it was. At first, the level design was good, the enemies got harder over time, and there were variations of them. But after awhile...the level design goes downhill. Also, they don't put many different enemies in the game after chapter...7 I want to say. Also I'd like to add that the bosses are extremely simple. First, you shoot off their armor pieces, they go down, you destroy their crystals, etc, etc. This is for every. Single. Boss. It just seems like the game is completely awesome for a good 2 hours, then Flying Hog just kind of...ran out of ideas? I'm not sure what happened. Another thing is that the game is about 10 hours long (I played on normal difficulty), and really doesn't have any replay value. There's no extras. Finally, the skills and the powers and things. Lots of them are just plain useless, and you won't ever use them. Maybe it was because I was playing on normal mode, but still, I felt like if I didn't spend most of the power-up points I got, then I'd be okay and could keep playing the game.Now on to the good things. The sword mechanics are actually very good! You can even set it to an advanced mode in options to make the sword swing to where you move your mouse. Slicing up enemies is VERY satisfying. Also dual uzis is pretty much epic in my book. Firing 3 rockets at once while using a laser to determine where they'll hit? Play Shadow Warrior. Like to use a flamethrower WITH a GRENADE LAUNCHER attached?? Play Shadow Warrior. Like to behead six demons at once with a katana??!? Play Shadow Warrior.Despite some of the bad things, this game is fun. It's a good game. Not great, but good. I'll definitely recommend this game, but try to get it on sale.			"

												Finally a remake of a classic shooter, which delivers. I actually liked SW nearly a bit more than Duke Nukem back in the days for it´s crude humor. The remake captures this as well as including just a bit of a story mixed with some interesting gameplay options for a shooter. Have fun with Wang!			"

												Shadow Warrior is a reboot of the older Shadow Warrior, released back in 1997 and then was remasted in 2012 to Shadow Warrior Redux and along came this game and all I have to say is It's f***ing awesome!So story, the basics of the story is that you are Lo Wang, a man who is trying to buy a sword for his contact. Lo Wang's boss wanted a precious sword. When he talks to the owner of the sword, he says no. After that, things go south....FAST. Wang become a mass murdering, kitana welding foe for them. When exploring the palace for the sword, things go south again as you are captured by the owner of the sword and locked away. While all that happens, demons start to roam the earth, killing anyone in sight. You escape from the thing they call a prison and find out the owner of the sword died from a fire you have also fallen into. On the brink of death, you find out that the owner (I dont know his name) had a demon, trapped and banished to roam the earth, named Hoji. When you team up with him, you get abnormal powers such as healing. Other that the story is pretty bad.But I don't think anyone is here for the story. The gameplay of this game is f***ing awesome. This game has a score system after every wave of enemies you kill in the area. With the karma points, as they are called, you can buy abilities and ability upgrades. The scoring system kinda works like Bulletstorm, the more the combo and people you kill with one action, the more points. It works really well with this game, it makes the game more exciting and makes you want to try to get better combos and see how many points you can get with one action. The store and shop to upgrade your guns is very limited, 4 attachments for each gun. There's a pistol, submachine gun, crossbow and many more that you unlock farther in the game.The gunplay in this game is good. I only say that because when you have a kitana that can cut people in as many bits as the game will let you, you want to use that. Using the kitana will give you hours of amusement. I said this but, ""It's like Fruit Ninja, just with a lot of blood"" - Jeff the KillerThe graphics are beautiful. I don't know if it is my computer or not, but I can't run the game max settings. It's like Serious Sam with FPS, you'll get 60 in one place and 20-30 in another. I'll probably fix this part of the review when I get my 760 for now, this is my review on graphics.Overall, even though I haven't finished the story, you don't need a story to play a game, there are some exceptions, like this game. I think the story adds a bit more feel for the game so do Wang's funny a** one-liners. I recommend this game soooooooooo much. Only thing, is the price for this game is a bit high, I'd wait for a sale, 30-40 is way too high. Wait till a sale that brings it down to 10-15 bucks. 9/10 is what I give this game.			"

												""Old school"" is a term that gets thrown around a lot these days, by publishers and developers alike, and more often then not these so called ""throwbacks"" are nothing more than a cheap cash-in on nostalgia, rater than a real homage to the ""good old days"", completely missing the point of what made these games great. The most prominent case in recent history that comes to mind would be Bioshock Infinite, or rather its ""1999 Mode"", which was advertised to be a throwback to the unforgiving difficulty of System Shock 2. But instead of adding inventory or item management it just turns the enemies into bulletspongy death machines. So it goes. But I digress. After all, I am trying to review Shadow Warrior 2013 here.So, is this game true to its claim of being a throwback to the days of Doom and Build Engine games? The short answer is no!Level Design:If you are expecting complex maze like levels, ala Doom or Duke3D, you are out of luck. While Shadow Warrior 2013 gives you plenty of crates to loot for ammo and money as well as keys to hunt for in order to advance to the next area, it still feels like a streamlined version of 90's FPS level. This is not an issue for me however, since I usually got lost once the levels got too complex in later episodes of these types of games. Though I do have to point out, that I still managed to get lost in these rather simplistic levels, because I got stuck more then often without knowing what I had to do. This was mostly due to the fact that SW2013 Highlights usable items with an incredibly obnoxious glow effect that makes it easy to differentiate between geometry and usable entities. Since I am not a fan of these types of mechanics I played the game with the effect off, which unfortunately resulted in me sometimes not being able to figure out what to do because the switch I was supposed to press just blended in with the scenery. That's the issue with these types of helpers. Even if you have the option to disable them, game game is still designed with them in mind, making it unnecessarily complicated to discard them even if you want to.Core Gameplay:You are equipped with an arsenal of firearms as well as a Katana and an endless supply of underpowered Shurikens that drain your regenerating stamina meter as you throw them. Speaking of regeneration, your health does not automatically regenerate. Instead there are medipacks and armor vets scattered throughout the levels. Despite that fact that there is no auto health regen, you still have the ability to heal yourself in form of a Ki Power. Ki Powers are combos that you can pull of as a player by completing a sequence of actions. For instance, to initiate your healing ability you press D twice in a row and then press Mouse2, holding it down. Most KI Powers either give you crowd control over enemies, or new moves with your Katana. Throughout the game the play can find KI Crystals that allow him to upgrade or unlock powers. Speaking of Upgrading there are two other kinds of progression. The first one is the Karma system. If you use a wide variety of skills and weapons to kill of enemies, you are rewarded with Karma points that you can spend to level up various stats, such as your maximum health as well as the amount of damage you deal to certain types of enemies. How ever, by doing so you will cause some enemies to enter their rage form which makes them more aggressive and dangerous. If we are talking about damage dealing, we need to talk about the weapons as well. Throughout the levels you will find money which you can either spend on ammo (don't ever do this!) or on weapon upgrades. Each weapon has an essential upgrade that will turn it into a great DPS dealer, you will have to resort to in case you get overwhelmed by hoards of enemies. Unfortunately this means that all wepaons are utter trash unless you spend money to upgrade them. The core shooter mechanics however, is where this games shines. 95% of all enemies either use a projectile or melee attacks in order to deal damage to you. This means that there is no need to ever take any cover, allowing you do keep track of all projectiles and dodging them accordingly. To help you with this, the game allows you to jump in all four directions which adds a refreshing dynamic to the combat. To add to the challenge all enemies use a rather modern hit box system, that allows you to shoot off limps in order to immobilize them. You need to stand still trying to aim for a the head of the on coming enemies, pull the trigger and then do a quick jump to the left or right, to avoid the amount of stuff that comes flying towards you, ready to explode in your face. That being said, the shooting has its weaknesses though, especially concerning the stronger enemy types. There is one in particular that really grind me gears: The Shaman is a so called ""greater demon"" or mini boss that frequently shows up raising an infinite army of undead enemies, as well as shooting projectiles towards you. He is a real bulletsponge and fighting him is the very antithesis of fun. This gets issue grows less and less important as your weapons grow more powerful and your skill increases. Keep in mind that I was playing on the ""Hard"" difficulty setting. The bigger problem are the bossfights. They stink. All of them use the same mechanic, which is extremely tiresome and boring. Even though all bosses use a slightly different attack pattern, you feel like you are fighting the same boss over and over again. This is no different concerning the final boss, which was a major letdown for me.Story and Presentation:SW 2013 tries to get rid of the ""racist and misogynistic"" humor of the original game, replacing it with an emotional story. While the game manages to pull of the plot quite well, you should under no circumstances except something like Bastion or The Walking Dead which leave you completely emotionally destroyed, if you get emotionally invested with their respective characters. Shadow Warrior doesn't do this and leaves you indifferent at best towards the whole tragedy in which the games ends. Speaking of ending, the more you advance the more unpolished and untested the game feels. The game builds up an epic confrontation with Zilla, a Faustian villian who caused the invasion of the shadow realm onto the human word for his own needs. But instead of fighting him and adding some much needed variety to the bossfights, you just face him (twice!) in a first person cutscene. The same applies to the leader of the shadow beings. How overwhelmingly disappointing. Heck, the final boss fight doesn't even have music like the others with makes it even more boring.Technology:The games is extremely resource demanding even on my 4770k/GTX 780 rig and does not look good enough in order to justify this. Instead it makes about every other object in a level explosive which unleashes a storm of death and physics across the screen. I also had some issue with the vsync, that caused the FPS to drop to 30 once it went below 60, which was extremely annoying, up to the point where I just disabled it end endured the screen tearing instead.VerdictOverall Shadow Warrior 2013 is a great indie shooter with solid gameplay and a disappointingly weak presentation that completely falls flat on its face near the end of the game. If you are a fan of games like Serious Sam or Painkiller, this game is a must buy for you. But don't except a real 90's shooter, because it just isn't one. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The good   -Solid and fun gameplay   -Combat based on projectile avoidance and strafingThe bad   -Story and presentation fall completely flat towards the end.   -Resource intensive   -Terrible bossfights			"

												""Came for the shootouts, stayed for the swordplay""Brilliant oldschool shooter that gives you non-stop fun and satisfaction when you chop your enemies to pieces or blow them the hell up. It has a badass joker with a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥pun for the name as the protagonist, tons of different customizable weaoons, dozens of skills and powers that make the demon genocide even more fun, good sense of humor that makes you laugh from time to time, GIGANTING MIGHTY BOSSES and Pretty Big Mini-Bosses, tons of carefully hidden secrets and awesome easter eggs, big and vast levels. It took me 15 hours to beat all 17 Chapters on the Hard difficulty.And the at the same time the game gave me feels in the end, something what I didn't expect to get from that kind of game. Thank you, Flying Wild Hog, I'll be waiting for Shadow Warrior 2 for sure!P,S, There are also additional game modes and difficulties like Ex Mode (aka NewGame+ where you keep your skills and weapons) and the mighty Heroic Mode (where you have only 1 life for each level, no quick-saves and the game is actually more difficult than Insane difficulty). Replayability is really strong with this one.			"

												Shadow Warrior initially tries really hard to make you think it's less wonderful than it is, but the conviction that the developers and voice artists exhibit in delivering such a crazy product allows it to pull off the lame jokes, pop culture references and mindless action with panache. And after you're convinced that you're playing a superficial action game with another vapid set of cliche characters, somewhere along the line after all the fan service and wisecracks and gore, you realise that you're invested in the story and you care about the characters, and suddenly you become aware of how shockingly well-made this game is.  Given the patchy success-rate of recent nostalgic reboots and reimaginings (I'm looking at you, ROTT), Shadow Warrior suprised the hell out of me with it's smooth and responsive controls, entertaining gameplay, beautiful visuals, and well-cast voice actors. It understands exactly what it wants to be at any given moment, and excels at both the early tongue-in-cheek schlock, as well as the later more serious character development. This is clearly a game in which all the talent behind the scenes really shines through, and I can't recommend it highly enough.			"

												This game is worth 10$Over all rate 7.58 / 10 Graphics5 / 10 Boss fights. (Bosses are big but take for ever to kill).7 / 10 Level layout.8.5 / Combat system. Over all I did enjoy this game, but I did find my self wondering ""What were they thinking?"" moments. The combat system with the sword was pretty cool, especially when you decapitate enemies heads off and watch them roll down the sidewalk.The boss fights were a huge disappointment (On hard mode) because you just run around in circles collecting ammo for a 25 minutes as you slowly chip away at the bosses armor.Dont expect the same Lo wang moments you had playing the original because this is a new take on the world of shadow warrior. I do hope they make a sequel to this game and work out the kinks and try to experiment with the physics engine when dealing with the world objects.Cheers!			"

												Ok people, if you are sick and tired of dark gritty modern miliraty shooters that take themselves way too seriously and still want you to believe that a dog can take down an army helicopter consider this: When was the lest time a game let you slice your way trough a horde of demons, that come apart just as you would expect them to, with your trusty katana then have a 3 minute fight with a mini-boss involving you toasting him with flametrhower and blasting him with rocket launcher while having sacrasting comments about him and when you finally kill him you chop off his head and use it as a weapon that shoots lasers from his eyes! This game is a blast, levels are designed in a way that promote exploring, you can find secrets that have either currency or easter eggs like parts of levels from original Shaow Warrior and there is a naked girl showering behind a waterfall (I am not telling you where, you have to find her yourselves!). So do yourself a favor and get this game!			"

A reboot of the 1997 3D Realms title of the same name, this game is, in a word, ridiculous. The humor is awful in a wonderful way, and the gore is ludicrously delicious. Like Hard Reset before it though, the game at its current price ($39.99) doesn't offer enough substance to warrant the cover charge. But, if you can find it on sale for $20 or less, you'd be mad not to pick it up. Check it out.			"

												Originally saw this game on youtube as a part of a first impressions video, but for some reason it didn`t capture my attention enough for it to warrant its cost at the time. Boy do I regret not jumping on it at that time. Apart from a few dull puzzles and platforming sections, It`s definitely one of my favourite FPS game of 2013. The sheer fun this game offers to someone who is a fan of anything Serious Sam -or Painkiller-esc. is insane. You get to carry up to 9 (if i remember correctly) weapons simultaneously, with slots 8 & 9  being hearts and skulls picked from enemies you encounter. The gunplay feels really visceral and the upgrade system is perfect for a ""shoot-em-up"" game like this. Do you like killing tons of demons with swords or with tight gunplay? - Then this is the game for you.But the strongest parts of this game comes in the shape of:- Art direction - beautiful use of colors and Asian influenced set pieces and nature- Katana sword-play - PC features such as FOV slider which goes up to 120 if you so desire, a whole slew of neat    graphics options and no mouse accel. or smoothing. (""Praise the lord!"")I will go out on a limb here and say that I have never been this pleasantly surprised when it comes to the feel and handling of a sword in an FPS setting. The feeling when you slice up demons and execute the katana special moves is unmatched in anything I`ve played earlier. The fast-paced movement system allows for you to feel like an actual ninja in first person view, dashing in and out of combat slicing up demons. It also opens up for you to ""kite"" enemies around just like in Serious Sam and Painkiller, which is a feature I especially appreciate during battles in the more open arena-style settings the game has to offer.I really liked the story for what it was, and it takes you on a fun ride through a variety of different locations and offers a good variety in scenery, even if its somewhat stretched through backtracking and puzzles. The characters are fun, and early on you get to meet a really fun and excellently voice acted side character that will follow you throughout the game. The humor in this game Is something I really enjoy, even if its juvenile. Hearing Lo Wang crack jokes during combat is a nice touch that keeps you coming back for more demon-slicing goodness.I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of Serious Sam -or Painkiller-type games, as its the best in its genre by far.Lastly, I`d like to add that Shadow Warrior`s opening ""cinematic"" might be the best to date, in any game ever!

												It's rather a relief to find an old-school game that got rebooted and they didn't make a complete mess of it.  A lot of the gameplay style is fairly old-school ""keep-on-moving-and-don't-stop"" with fairly open levels (yes there is cover, but things like cars will work as much against you as for you if you're not careful), AI that isn't that intelligent (often comes straight at you and only tries to flank at the last moment) and generally not so secret secrets (providing you take the time to explore the whole map.)For the more modern player, you have the choice of whether/how to upgrade weapons, skills or even your katana abilities which gives quite a bit of flexibility in how you play. You can also use much of the scenery as a weapon e.g. roll barrels down a hill and shoot at them to make them explode or fire at abandoned vehicles to take out large groups at once.My biggest irritation is the inability to fathom what's safe and what's not as there seems no consistency in how scenery is treated. e.g. on some maps, you won't find secrets unless you go for a swim whereas on others if you dip one toe in the water it's instadeath. You'll find yourself dying an awful lot more than you should if you have an inquisitive nature as a result.As a player of the original I also miss the old Lo Wang accent, but the fact there are less of the cheesy one-liners is probably a good thing in this day and age. It's also more than made up for by the fortune cookies and their contents.The whole is something which is neither completely old or new and somehow manages to get away with being enough of both that it should appeal. Well worth a go if you haven't yet.			"

												Shadow Warrior was a good game. An absurdly good game. I went into it expecting some decent combat and a really schlocky story full of bad referential humor. What I got was fantastic combat, a legitimately engaging story, and dialogue that was both natural and actually funny on its own right.Considering this is a reboot of a 90s campy shooter ala Duke Nukem, I'm really confused by how awesome it was. It's easily up there with my favorites now.			"

												Great 8/10Shadow Warrior doesn't get boring too quickly and that is what makes it a great game.It doesn't take too long until you grab a katana and start cutting people heads off, but shortly afterwards you see that the game has a lot more to offer than guns and swords. Through the game you learn abilities and skills that allow you to create combos and fight your own way. You have different types of enemies and bosses, so you also need to use your head in combat.Secret levels can be found and they are probably more exciting if you played the old original game which I didn't unfortunately.The plot is a little weird, but ok.I loved the engine, mechanics, gameplay, graphics, humor (the bad jokes are also funny), and almost everything.You should give it a try if you're a katana fan			"

												This is an awsome game. It has gorgeous graphics, fast paced gameplay, a huge amount of skills, abilities and weapon upgrades (if you consider that this is an FPS) but most of all the developers recreated the feeling of the original Shadow Warrior, which is a priceless feature! Sword fighting is simple but extremely funny and at the end of almost every fight Lo Wang will comment with ad hilarious joke, and when you grow tired of swinging the katana you can always bring death with dual wielding uzi or a four-barreled shotgun.Finally the game has a very good longevity (it took 25 hours in high difficulty to complete) and a nice plot, which may seem superficial at the beginning but becomes quite intriguing as you proceed and almost epic in the end, with some high quality comic style cinematics.And now, who wants some Wang??

												Shadow Warrior is one of those games that didn't catch my interest well enough for me to buy it when it came out. I can't believe it took me this long until i finally saw it on the steam sale and said to myself ""£2...not bad. Let's do this"" I install this, launch the game and i am greeted with the well known song 'Stan Bush - You got the touch' which immediatly brings back memories of me re-watching The Transformers movie for the billionth time.Anyway. You are Lo Wang. Or as he likes to call himself ""Mr. Two Million Dollars"", you had this one simple job. Get the sword and give the money, but the owner doesn't want to part with it. Maybe he has developed some intimate emotions with it. I dont know...one minute i'm standing in front of all these gang members and the next i'm slaughtering them into pieces, literal pieces that slowly fall off from each other. Think Resident evil laser room scene. This was cool as♥♥♥♥♥♥The game progresses as you find that your boss (Zilla) is trying to find 2 swords, one of which you now possess and the others being elsewhere and these all link in with a Demon Realm and how the 3 swords combined are the only thing that can kill the Ancient Gods. So with the help of the dementia ridden Demon known to you as Hoji you go from environment to environment. Looking for whisperers who can hold the swords (demons can't hold the swords as it will kill them) The whisperers are mechanical beings that are powered by memories that are sacrificed by Ancients and as they are roboty they are not affected. That's pretty much it, find the girl whisperers, kill them and combine the swords for that perk and to get one stop closer to kicking an Ancient Gods♥♥♥♥♥ Wang style.The combat works suprisingly well, there was some worrying at the beginning as to how i'm going to remember all the moves but eventually you're locking down combos like it's Tekken (or streetfighter if that's more your thing) Want to sexually touch your sword so you can whip a blade ki slash to decapitate your enemies? Doubletap 'S' and hold RMB. Want to immobilize the enemies infront of you? Then Doubletap S and hold LMB. It's very easy to use. You have RMB for sword attack based movies and LMB for Ki based movies such as healing, throwing enemies up in the air, pushing them back and such.One thing that i did find irritating was how secrets were tied into upgrades and perks. I didn't want to be held back in unlocking the upgrades simply because i didn't find that Ki crystal behind those boxes that have to be slashed. I mean, the first time you came upon the Ki crystal, it wasn't even the path you were supposed to take to your mission! It does however change the way you play the game, making you look in every nook and cranny and slashing maniacally at those poor boxes to get that small statue.Lo Wang came off as a serious♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in fact. I think he was just born an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from beginning to end and his transition from ""I'm so full of it"" to ""He's my friend and i'm going to help him"" was very quick that i suddenly thought i was playing as someone else! He's quick witted as intended by the developers but man were his jokes corney. I loved them!Shadow Warrior would have been my most favourite FPS if i had played it back in 2013. It's a shame it took me this long to finally get around to playing it, it was worth every penny and i really do recommended it.By the way, if you find two rabbits getting it on. Please don't kill them, that male rabbit will not be pleased... ♥♥♥♥ing demons...*grumble grumble*			"

												Loved this game from start to finish. Not a single moment in the game let down once, absaloute perfection!Guns are great, good variety of enemies, gameplay is solid and addictive, story is unforgettable and immersive!--[TLDR Warning]--(Longer review)Where to begin...Shadow Warrior has pretty much everything I want and love. The scenery and settings are gorgeous. The gameplay is smooth and fluent throughout and never gets old or boring too quickly. Infact at all. The game doesn't give you any ""here's a ridiculous and pointless puzzle as a filler to make the game longer"". It's level after level of onslaught, story and exploration. The story is by far the most impressive and best thing about the game. With some games, the story can totally suck and you feel you just want to get through it and finally complete it. But Shadow Warriors story really is unique and different. It keeps on point all the time and doesn't slow down or make the game crap. Having completed the game, the story is absaloutely beautiful. The characters are unforgettable, the weapons are glorious, the melee combat is by far the best swordplay of any game I've played with the feature, and mostly what I love the most - it's a long game!The weapons. The weapons are awesome to use. At first you may notice they feel a bit... weak. But with future upgrades they feel better and look cooler. Your arsenal will build up from a revolver, smg, crossbow to a shotgun, flamethrower, and rocket launcher. But it doesn't stop there - there's an ability to use Demon hearts and heads against foes for a gruesome but fun attack method. If that doesn't settle, there's always the swordplay which you yield gracefully in the face of combat with some amazing and deadly combos!The enemies have some great variety and change the gameplay drastically. You'll fight common lesser demons for nearly all of the game but you'll run into bigger and more challenging foes, all inwhich have different tactics and attack methods making each encounter a new and fresh experience. You'll come across flying demons, sheilded greater demons, beserkers and more. Oh and did I mention the boss fights?! Boss fights are epic, with giant bosses and huge arenas!The gameplay is fun and addicting, when playing through this - I was personally playing it at 4-5 hour sessions. Which I usually don't do with most games. The story cuts in frequently but it never ruins anything good or slows the game down in a bad way. The characters are great and you get a real feel for each characters personality. Filled with quirky humour and some humerous stereotypes, this game is just so good.I highly reccomend Shadow Warrior to fans of swordplay/sword fighting, japanese related culture, or truely awesome FPS action!I rate this game a strong 10/10			"

												The gameplay in this is old school shooter, basically very little to no cover, lot's of strafing, enemies spawn in large numbers and play by patterns.However, this is old school at it's finest, the most beautifully well written love letter to old school shooters. Lovingly spit polished, this game is smooth, without so much as a mild under the breath burb, let alone hiccup.The graphics are fun and gory, set your sword to advanced in the gameplay options, slice and dice.I'm really looking forward to the sequel and I'm surprised I enjoined the tightly interwoven story line, being a fan of Bioshock, I have high standards for story.The skills tree is interesting and the weapons mods are fun. A bit disorientating for the first few hours, but once the story and the sword absorb you, it's loads of fun.I highly recommend this game, for me a must have. "

												Man, this is a tough one.Shadow Warrior is a game that has a lot of things going for it.  The main gameplay mechanic is the swordfighting, which is incredibly satisfying and enjoyable.  The shooting is fun as well, and the game mixes up enemy types in a way where it encourages variety.  Considering these developers have worked on games like Hard Reset and Painkiller, it's not surprising that the game throws tons of enemies at you at any given minute and keeps up a breakneck pace.However, the problem is that the game is 4 hours too long.  It gets to a point where the game runs out of enemy types, and every encounter feels the same.  In addition, a decent amount of the later levels involve a lot of backtracking that feels incredibly unnecessary, like the developers wanted to make a longer game for some reason but didn't have the time or budget to do so.  It got to the point where most encounters just felt like a slog and I just wanted to get it over with.  If this game were 7 or 8 hours long instead of 12, the pacing wouldn't have felt nearly as sloppy.So, having said that, I would recommend this game when it's on sale (I got it for $10), because it CAN be a lot of fun and the developers seem like really cool dudes who care about their fans, but be warned that it really loses steam in the last third of the game.

												There was a lot of skepticism surrounding the news that 3D Realms' 1997 shooter Shadow Warrior would be re-imagined for 2013, not least because the original game faded into obscurity compared with other Build engine games and was really remembered only for its often tasteless humour. Happily, Polish developer Flying Wild Hog went back to the original and rather than slavishly remaking it, did a wonderful job in taking from it what worked and removing or radically re-imagining what didn't. The end result is a hectic, gorgeous-looking shooter in a classic style with just enough of a modern sensibility to make it feel fresh. The most crucial aspect of the game's success? It has what the classic '90s shooters had and what modern ones very rarely possess - personality.			"

												Loved it, Classic old school shooter with some modern bells and whistles.  Excellent dose of nostalgia combined with nice graphics and good animation, Well executed and kept me entertained throughout.Not the longest game in the world but having bought it on a steam sale i still got the better end of that bargain in my eyes, NG++ mode also adds a bit of fun replayability. Weapons feel fun and over the top, nice sword play for the unusual touch. Oh and the blood, haha yeah lots of blood, all over your face and clothes, yep yep. Ohhh classic secrets, again nostagia, love a full on homage to the good old days through the rose tinted glasses of time.Hmm biggest negative i can think of is the boss encounters, not really much thought gone into them, but still, diddnt make me switch off and well executed, and fits in with the traditional style i guess... meh..Put simply this game adds nothing new to the genre, and does it well with juvinile witty old school feel...... Whats not to like !!!			"

												It's epically epic!!! In this game you play as a geek-mercenary-ninja-warrior-batman named Wang, and he loves making witty one-liner about wang. The battle system is fun, especially the melee part with the sword combo. The jokes are very goodly implemented. At least it can make you chuckle. The characters are interesting, especially Hoji. The thing I don't like about this game is the boss are kinda boring and tiring to kill, but that maybe because I play in Insanity difficulty. Mostly It's worth the price tag. Oh, and you'll be surprised that a game about mindless butchering have a quite good plot. 11/10 on my wang-o-meter "

												a great fast paced old school shooter with a lovely graphics and brutl sword combat and gun play that gives a verity of upgradeable  weapons with lots of reason to use them all .. mix all of that with a long exiting single player campaing that takes you like 12-15 hours to complete Altho the survival mod was a bit disappointing :\ but you can play the game with all your upgrades and powers with the new game+ to give you double the excitement  .. (( if you ever saw this game on sale do not pass on it !! its worth every piny of your money ))			"

												Definitely one of the best games I've ever played, 8/10TL;DR Version: It's an f'in awesome game, but works best if you only do one playthrough of it.Pros:Amazing melee combat-Having an actual knowledge of such things, I can say this game has one of the best melee combat systems I've ever seen in a game.-The ability to clean your sword is awesome, as I haven't seen it in any other game before.Pretty dang realistic physics and gibbing-Another one of my obsessions, this game definitely fits my expectations of what a hack n' slash game should have in terms of body physics and dismembering. Awesome references and humor-The goriest games should always have the funniest dialogue.-Also, the only time I heard ""reaction"" dialogue repeated was when Lo Wang ""hurt his wang"", so to speak.Pretty nice story and soundtrack-I've never been good at judging such things, so that's about as much as I can say.-Nice upgrade system-Good graphics-Lots of hidden things-Survival mode's pretty cool-Unlike other games, if you have full ammo and try to reload it will actually show him checking his weapons instead of not doing anything like most FPS'Cons:VV Major problem w/ the Game VV-After playing through the entire game, upgrading yourself and your weapons, it's basically all pointless since you can't go back and replay levels with your gear.-While it does make sense that the weapons might be to OP, this isn't a multiplayer game, so there's no one who would find it  ""unfair"".-Also, how can you get every upgrade in the game if, when you start at the beginning to get more karma points or ki crystals, your upgrades, the entire reason you wanted to replay the game, are gone?!!?Otherwise, there's just these minor problems;-cutscenes often glitch or won't animate properly-I played through the entire game without actually using any of the extra powers besides the regeneration one, so it's not like getting them in the first place is really necessary-Inconsistent fall damage-The stereotypical ""video game weakspot"" bull enemies are so d@mn hard to kill I once had to throw shurikens at one in order to kill it because I had literally ran out of ammo in every other gun trying to hit it's back.-While still fun, having to frequently fight a wave or two of enemies can get boring-No markers to tell you where to go-According to the end scene (where you can see yourself/Lo Wang,) Lo Wang apparently shaved off every hair on his body (i.e. he's too damn bald!)-Not enough wang punsOverall a great game, and I'll probably keep it one my computer for a while, but it still has very low replay-ability due to the whole ""weapons-and-gear-not-saving"" thing I mentioned earlier.

A quirky take on the barrier between modern and classic shooter styles.. good story, and a GOOD campaign length. All my hours on record are on 1 run through, or thereabouts on hardest. You can pretty much play the entire game with just the katana and the ki skills.. which I recommend. "

												Shadow Warrior takes everything that was good from the original and repackages it into a modern box. Unfortunately, it also leaves in some old mechanics, that as a long time gamer, I wish they had left in the past. Down and dirty, here are the pros and cons:Pros:1. The self depreciating humor from the original is still intact. While it is not as controversial as the original, it still leaves the player feeling that the game does not take itself seriously. Which is very good, as you are playing a stereo-typical meat-head. From the fortunes of the fortune cookies, to the campy dialogue, the player will sometimes have to pause play to get their laughter under control.2. The controls are tight and responsive. This makes the gameplay feel fast paced and enjoyable.3. Its linear levels are well thought out to minimize back tracking.4. As you progress through the chapters, you feel as if you are progressing the story.5. The weapons feel ""right"".Cons:1. At higher difficulty levels, the monsters become massive bullet sponges.2. The ""mini-boss"" and ""arena"" fights often feel longer than they need to be. This becomes escpecially noticiable at higher difficulty settings. The player often feels as if they keep spamming enemies just to lengthen out gameplay. This tends to break immersion and sometimes the battles become very boring. (This is a mechanic I wished they left in the past)Overall, the game is well put together and despite its sometime immersion breaking battles, very fun to play. If you are looking for an ""old-school"" type shooter, then I reccommend ""Shadow Warrior"".			"

Hack, slash, or shoot your way through waves of monsters in order to get all the pieces of the Nobitsura Kage in this 90's reboot. You play as Lo Wang, a modern day assassin, fighting your way through the chapters in the game alongside Hoji, a demon banished from the underworld. Whether you chose to split your enemies with a katana or with bullets, each kill is as satisfying as the last one. Add some absolutely beautiful environments to that and you get one of the better games of 2013.Pros:+Extremely satisfying sword mechanics, especially if played using a controller +The environments in this game are absolutely stunning, with lighting that can be described as perfect +Multiple difficulties to chose from +Survival game mode has just the right amount of challenge to it+Interesting story with characters that are unique to say the least +Each chapter takes at least 30 minutes to beat, easily making the game last you 10 hours +Weapons are balanced, making the game fun no matter what you use+The katana offers a versatile style of play +Comes with Viscera Cleanup Detail+Did I mention how beautiful this game looks? +Bunnies Cons:-Can get extremely repetitive after a while, though still very fun -Boss battles can be a bit awkward at times, though they are very doable -Though the glowing objective system works fantastically, it is a bit difficult to make out in a few environments To sum up this 90's reboot, it's a must have. The gameplay is fun, the story is entertaining, and the graphics are absolutely gorgeous. Whether it's on sale or not, it is definitely worth the money. If you're looking for fun game, you found it. 8/10 "

The sword play is smooth and fun, tons of laughs and references.The game is very crude, but that doesn’t make it bad it adds to the charm. I will recommend this game to anyone who loves FPS, sword play and just having a great time while you laugh at the game.  It is a very underrated game... don't let it slip away!			"

												A great way to describe this game, very simply, is with the word 'fun'. It's a blast. Gorgeous visuals, especially the lighting effects and a nice variety in level appearance. Great variety of weapons, which look and feel good to use. Plenty of upgrades, giving you lots of freedom to choose to how you want to power up. Lots of content too 17 levels and the levels aren't that short. Tons of secrets and amusing hidden easter eggs to find. Very nostalgic but at the same time very modern, for example the fact that nearly every little object in the game is destructible. The way the story is presented is a huge improvement on how it was handled in this dev's previous game, Hard Reset, and it's great fun to hear the banter between Lo Wang and the demon Hoji. Great game overall! (с)			"

												What can i say about shadow warrior, it is amazing. This game shows that old school games like of course shadow warrior, duke nukem 3D & so on can be done in moden time. Flying wild hog know how to make an old school game & make it enjoyable down to the very last thing. It has the best 1st person melee system i've ever seen, even with all the guns you will more likely use your katana the entire time. Enemies fall to pieces in the most satisfing way possible, arms go flying into the air, torso's get sliced in half & split apart. It is so much fun to play through especially with all the guns & mods for them, for example:Quad barrel shotgun,Quick draw pistol,Dual SMG,Grenade launching flamethrower,Rocket launcher firing 3 rockets & more.The only problems i've seen from my playthrough is missing textures & thats pretty much it. Boss battles are fun but repetitive, story is good & funny, the character Lo Wang & his demon companion Hoji are a great combo with there witty banter. I would get this game if you can, one of the most enjoyable games i've played this year. If you're unsure you can check my playthrough if you want to see the game & how it is if you want.			"

												If you played the original 1997 Shadow Warrior by 3D Realms and hope that this game isn't some washed up, hand holding, gun wielding simon says simulator, then don't worry. This game is developed by Flying Wild Hogs, developers of Hard Reset, another game I recommend taking the time to play as well. A very underrated game that deserves more attention because of the amount of depth, detail, and focus towards gameplay as well as bringing back a lot of elements used in classic games especially the 1997 version. Yes, there are a bit of cutscenes that you easily skip if you want, but don't worry, the second you start the game, there will be action throughout the entire journey. -StoryIn terms of storytelling, it's pretty basic and straightforward. The game takes place in China, you play as the amazing Lo-Wang who is now younger compared to the original elder Wang. This takes place while Lo Wang still worked for Master Zilla and starts off doing an assignment for him until all hell breaks loose. Story is alright in my opinion, never was a fan of storytelling when it comes to first person shooters, because all I really care about is the action, which this game heavily delivers a satisfying gameplay. -GameplayIf you remember the classic version or if you didn't, do yourself a favor and play it. The developers did a fantastic job at making sure that the Katana doesn't feel like a last resort optional weapon. The Katana is a lot more badass compared to how the sword was like in the original one. Wherever you slice, you will see your victims limbs cut off in the exact geometric shape, it's ridiculously awesome. You get to upgrade your weapons, skills, and powers whether it's increasing stamina and health, or increasing the amount of damage your Katana can bring. -VisualsThis game looks absolutely beautiful. There were moments where I had to actually stop and look around to see if this is a game or not. Sure it's not Crysis 3 or anything but I had to applaud the art team for delivering artwork. -VerdictThis game is a shining example of how to either modernize a classic game, or create an amazing single player First person shooter. If you enjoyed the original Shadow Warrior like I have, then you will not be disappointed with this game. Plus, there are secrets in game, meaning that the developers actually want you to explore. I remember finding a hidden path that led me to the actual first level of the original Shadow Warrior, they're not joking when they that they were fans of the original game. This game is exactly what Duke Nukem Forever should of been. Aside from the point, Shadow Warrior by Flying Wild Hog is a fantastic game to play, an awesome experience that delivers to fans of any classic shooter.			"

												A pretty good surprise for the price I got it (10€). However I wouldn't recommend it at full price since the game has some problems that hold it back a lot. First, I didn't play the original Shadow Warrior, so for all the nostalgic, you can already skip this review, I probably don't want the same thing as you do.So, to sum up this game in one sentence, Shadow Warrior: cut them all! That game asks you to use a lot a sword, it's the best weapon in the game and you have skills and attacks to unlock with it. You also use sometimes some guns, but they feel so weak because it needs so many amos just to kill one thing and they sound quite bad, seriously, guns are used mainly for ennemies attacking from the air. On the plus side, the sword feels so good. It's powerful, you cut the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of ennemies and turn them into a pile of remains with blood everywhere, so satisfaying. The game isn't too long and doesn't feel too short. However the story is meh, the story is just a way to make you kill stuff without thinking why you do that.The game is looking quite good, but on my hardware I had some performence issues (i5 3570k/GTX770), I needed to turn off some options like the mirrors, particle, and physics and even that way, I had sometimes huge frame drops. That was still playable anyway but still. The musics were okay, nothing felt wrong on that side. The game has some good humors too, like begining the game with Stan Bush music calld The Touch. Is the gameplay good? The swordplay is satisfaying yes, but overall the gameplay gets repetitive a lot. It's mainly due to the linear gameplay that keeps the same layout. You run, cut some demons, do your objectives, cut some more demons, grease and repeat. Talking about demons, you spent most of your time killing them. That's a choice yeah but I would have prefered the game being more focused on fighting humans on sword battle. Besides the variety of demons is non existant. You'll be fighting the same kind of demons during the whole game. And the boss battles that could have been awesome are just bad. It's just about shooting them on one blinking spot and then shoot some more in the revealed weak spot. And that's the same way to kill them for ALL of those bosses. Overall, that game isn't terrible, I've played way worse than this but for a game sold for 35 bucks on Steam, I expected something less repetitive, even if I got it for 10 bucks. Is it fun? Yes it is. Can you get bored before the end of the game? Yes, you could get bored fast, but you can still kill rabbits to kill your boredom I guess?			"

												I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME.Okay so Shadow Warrior is a beautiful masterpiece, the story/plot is very interesting and will really draw you into the game, by the time you've finished the game YOU WILL CRY because it's over.You play as Lo Wang, comic-collector hitman with a sense of humor that produces the most groan-worthy puns and chuckles, the dialog between him and the demon Hoji who's with you throughout the game is brilliant, Hoji's intense sarcasm and insults combined with Lo Wang's own sarcasm and swift comebacks produce pure gold. The gameplay is basically tons of combat which doesn't get repetitive due to the way you get rated out of 5 at the end of each fight and the more ways you use to kill gives you a higher score, as you go along you discover new weapons like how you would in Doom, you gain karma from finding secrets (There are like somewhere between 3-8 each level) and fighting which leads to leveling up skills that'll do basic things like increasing your health or stamina mostly along with the sword techniques section which lets you use special moves such as my personal favorite - Wing of Crane which sends out a wave of ki energy that cuts through loads of enemies, basically a slash that pierces through enemies and walls of maybe a 10m range. You can also find Ki crystals which you can use to upgrade your powers - healing being the one you'll use most probably but also things like flux, a water trap that lifts up enemies into the air rendering them immobile for a while, dragon scales aka a shield and tigers roar which is sort of like a less powerful Fus Roh Dah. Now the sword and magic is a huge part of the game but the other weapons you find you can upgrade with money which you'll also find throughout the game and by the end of it you'll have some f**cking awesome weapons that can cause a hell of a lot of damage, also YOU CAN USE A DEMON'S HEAD AS A LASER!Pros: Lo Wang's singing Interesting enemies Hilarious as Hell BEAUTIFUL PLOT ""La la la la laahh"" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) LOTS OF SECRETS TO FIND LOTS OF ACHIEVEMENTS  Beautiful scenery even though the actual quality isn't amazing Hoji ""Beware of the Wang"" Bodies can be ripped into even smaller pieces after they're dead Pretty fun boss fights *Shoots with crossbow* *Enemy corpse flies 34 miles before finally getting pinned against some mountain in the distance* If you set them on fire, they do actually panic.Cons TOO SHORT Ending leaves much to be asked Boss fights can get a bit repetative at times but there isn't many so it's alright How damn hard it is to get off your PC and eat something Music is nice but more tracks could be nice since after a while you get bored of hearing the same thing over and over The sword once fully upgraded you can literally just spam it in the last boss fights making them just boring and not challenging at allDefinitely my favorite game of all time so far. Get it now you won't regret it.			"

												It's a pretty good game, the original Shadow Warrior was much better in it's own ways, this one doesn't fall short, it's quite the reboot alright, and trying to be a little more serious than the comedy that was it's ancestor, overall, I loved it, except the fighting rating system at the end of each fight, the thing rewarded me for killing enemies in simple and silly manners, but when I did something totally awesome ninja-style and finished enemies quickly, it gave me almost no stars			"

												Shadow Warrior is a game that is unabashedly campy and crass. It's also the most fun I've had with a shooter in quite some time. The game controls great and it's definitely a change of pace from a lot of modern shooters; sprinting around with a katana or two machine guns is frantic and intense. It's fun, fast and definitely worth your time.			"

												After playing Shadow Warrior I can say that I highly recommend the game. I beat it today, and it was quite the experience, The graphics, the humor, the gameplay, the challenge, and the desire to move forward was all there. I beat it across the span of a few days. I saw elsewhere people saying between 10 - 12 for a normal playthrough. 15 or more for the secrets. I went into this game without playing the original Shadow Warrior, I have to say that it was quite the enjoyable experience and worth the money.			"

												Ok people, if you are sick and tired of dark gritty modern miliraty shooters that take themselves way too seriously and still want you to believe that a dog can take down an army helicopter consider this: When was the lest time a game let you slice your way trough a horde of demons, that come apart just as you would expect them to, with your trusty katana then have a 3 minute fight with a mini-boss involving you toasting him with flametrhower and blasting him with rocket launcher while having sacrasting comments about him and when you finally kill him you chop off his head and use it as a weapon that shoots lasers from his eyes! This game is a blast, levels are designed in a way that promote exploring, you can find secrets that have either currency or easter eggs like parts of levels from original Shaow Warrior and there is a naked girl showering behind a waterfall (I am not telling you where, you have to find her yourselves!). So do yourself a favor and get this game!			"

												The first cutscene in the game presents a badass Asian wearing aviator sunglasses and a black dress shirt singing along with his bad Asian accent to ""The Touch"" by Stan Bush while a dinobot bobblehead(Nice... touch, guys) from Transformers wiggles it's head around.Also, plays like a more polished version of Duke Nukem: Forever(Which did have some decent shooting combat) with more combat mechanics, humor that is way less ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and upgradable skills and katana moves.Did you buy it yet?No? What if I told you that the game goes on sale a lot and on some occasions is only 4 bucks? 5 Bucks to get the special edition that includes the soundtrack and the ability to make your katana the katana from Hotline Miami?How about now?

Plays like the old doom/duke nukem/shadow warrior games from the 90's but updated to current gen. Many ways to upgrade your character and a good amount of easter eggs for old fans. The music is a mix of hard rock/metal for the fighting to zen like ambient♥♥♥♥♥♥when it claims down.  Like a 80's kung fu film it is great in a small dosage.			"

												A diamond in the rough. A lot of you may have never heard of Shadow Warrior before, and that's just fine. You don't need to have played the original to love this one. It provides very steady and good gameplay elements with a Tarantino-like environment.Everything plays smoothly, and you will feel pretty powerful. But the game has challanges enough for even the most hardcore run-n-gunner. Choose the sword, or the gun, neither becomes obsolete. Combine this with your 4 unlockable powers and you'll be having a heckova good time.			"

												To me (Generation Doom, Quake, Duke Nukem) Shadow Warrior is the best shooter in the last 10-15 years. A multiplayer mode is missing, but besides that you get a perfect shooter. I could praise every single aspect of the game, but it all comes to this: Its damn good fun. Fair, bloody, funny, violent, GOOD. Buy this or be damned to bake fortune cookies.And dont forget: No one is an island. Except Lo Wang.			"

												Playtime: 16 Hours (includes secret hunting)Score: 7 / 10Recommended Price: $19.99A remake of the classic Shadow Warrior featuring still the character Lo Wang. It is easy to see that much effort went into blending modern and classic FPS styles. Medkits still litter the levels yet you have the ability to heal yourself at will with a Chi spell unlocked early in the game. Many people will remember the humour of the first game and it is still here, although at a toned down level. Much of the hilarious one liners and jokes are gone or purposefully changed to lower potentional insult certain people might feel and make vocal. Secret areas do exist and are done up in the classic Shadow Warrior pixel graphics. Areas from old levels and pixel-based girls await your discovery!Much of the combat focuses on the use of your sword, which I found to be a huge plus. There is an assortment of weapons as one would expect in classic FPS titles with three different upgrades each. Different Chi-based abilities help you fight your foes. Two skills knock down or suspend foes in the air, various katana abilities help you fight at range or slay foes in a circle around you. All in all I was highly impressed and surprised at how good the overall game was in both quality and length. If you can pick it up on sale for $19.99 or less it's definitely worth it!			"

												As you can see I have played Shadow Warrior for about 50 hrs for good reason, its fun as Hell. I have not played a game as bloody fun as this since Saint Row 4. I can't really fault anything in this game It's got amazing humour, fast paced shooting, fantastic katana mayhem, great music and It looks AMAZING, I literally haven't seen a game look this good on my computers specs ever. The only things that I can see that would make people dislike the game, is the humour which I personally love but I know there's some people who'd dislike it, and the rather repetitive story which I didn’t really pay attention to.I highly suggest this game to any fans of the old style FPS or FPS fans in general looking for a heap of fun, I thought it was the best shooter of 2013 in fact it was my favourite PC game of 2013. If I had a choice of every shooter out right now I’d play this one still in 2014. "

												Shadow Warrior came out of nowhere and blew my mind. It is the best single player FPS game I have played in a long time. The gameplay itself might get repetitive toward the end of the game, but the well written dialogue and great characters kept me interested.Shadow Warrior is a reimagining of the 1997 game of the same name. Some things connecting this new game to the 1997 original is some similar naming of locations, the main character and the heavy use of katana as a melee weapon, but basically you are not missing anything if you haven't played the original or even know nothing about it.Here are some additional scrabled thoughts about the gameWhat I liked-The story, characters, voice acting, visuals and soundtrack.-The story is a mix between drama and comedy. Usually this is a bad idea, but somehow Shadow Warrior makes the mood shifts enjoyable. One of the most important reasons as to why Shadow Warrior has such good characters is that they are a mix of dramatic and comedic traits, which makes them very approachable and human.-Good enemy variety. Different weapons/techniques are also required to beat some of the harder enemies.-Good weapon variety, and you can carry all the weapons at once without needing to swap. There's also a weapon upgrade system in place. The upgrades are kind of scarse, so it's always interesting to get one and the upgrades have real impact, and most of them are not like ""+5% accuracy"", but alternative firing modes and such.-Flow of the game. There's a good rhythm with the story bits, enemy encounters, humour, serious moments, exploration. It is aslo separated into chapters that range from about 20 minutes to 40 minutes, so it is nicely paced in terms of when you can just shut the game and take a break or do something else entirely.-Melee combat. It has a melee combat system with some executable special moves. The moves are always just double tap a directional key and press LMB or RMB, but still it's fun to execute them.-It has this kind of (but not quite) hint system where you need to always use objects or doors that glow yellow. I thought it was much more pleasant than the reqular arrow or path that shows you exactly where you need to go. When there was not immediate in your face indication of where to go I found myself exploring and taking in the world a lot better than in, say BioShock Infinite.What I didn't like-The boss battles are all the same. You just dodge attacks and shoot at the glowing weak spot.-Some of the chapters drag a bit, forcing you into huge arenas with multiple waves of spawning enemies.-The combat in general starts to become a bit boring when you have first learned all the sword techiques and then learnt when and how to execute them. It starts to become a bit mundane when there is no new stuff to learn.In conclusion it is in my opinion one of the best games of 2013, and it should not be overlooked.			"

The battle system is fun, especially the melee part with the sword combo. The jokes are very goodly implemented. At least it can make you chuckle. The characters are interesting, especially Hoji. The thing I don't like about this game is the boss are kinda boring and tiring to kill, but that maybe because I play in Insanity difficulty. Mostly It's worth the price tag. Oh, and you'll be surprised that a game about mindless butchering have a quite good plot. 11/10 on my wang-o-meter "

Really good transition  between using guns and the katana, really fun powers and smooth action all around. Good story aswell! I didn't think I would enjoy the main character  as much as I did, since I though initially he was a little bit wonky. But it all  delivered in the end =)			"

												Shadow Warrior is one of those games that didn't catch my interest well enough for me to buy it when it came out. I can't believe it took me this long until i finally saw it on the steam sale and said to myself ""£2...not bad. Let's do this"" I install this, launch the game and i am greeted with the well known song 'Stan Bush - You got the touch' which immediatly brings back memories of me re-watching The Transformers movie for the billionth time.Anyway. You are Lo Wang. Or as he likes to call himself ""Mr. Two Million Dollars"", you had this one simple job. Get the sword and give the money, but the owner doesn't want to part with it. Maybe he has developed some intimate emotions with it. I dont know...one minute i'm standing in front of all these gang members and the next i'm slaughtering them into pieces, literal pieces that slowly fall off from each other. Think Resident evil laser room scene. This was cool as♥♥♥♥♥♥The game progresses as you find that your boss (Zilla) is trying to find 2 swords, one of which you now possess and the others being elsewhere and these all link in with a Demon Realm and how the 3 swords combined are the only thing that can kill the Ancient Gods. So with the help of the dementia ridden Demon known to you as Hoji you go from environment to environment. Looking for whisperers who can hold the swords (demons can't hold the swords as it will kill them) The whisperers are mechanical beings that are powered by memories that are sacrificed by Ancients and as they are roboty they are not affected. That's pretty much it, find the girl whisperers, kill them and combine the swords for that perk and to get one stop closer to kicking an Ancient Gods♥♥♥♥♥ Wang style.The combat works suprisingly well, there was some worrying at the beginning as to how i'm going to remember all the moves but eventually you're locking down combos like it's Tekken (or streetfighter if that's more your thing) Want to sexually touch your sword so you can whip a blade ki slash to decapitate your enemies? Doubletap 'S' and hold RMB. Want to immobilize the enemies infront of you? Then Doubletap S and hold LMB. It's very easy to use. You have RMB for sword attack based movies and LMB for Ki based movies such as healing, throwing enemies up in the air, pushing them back and such.One thing that i did find irritating was how secrets were tied into upgrades and perks. I didn't want to be held back in unlocking the upgrades simply because i didn't find that Ki crystal behind those boxes that have to be slashed. I mean, the first time you came upon the Ki crystal, it wasn't even the path you were supposed to take to your mission! It does however change the way you play the game, making you look in every nook and cranny and slashing maniacally at those poor boxes to get that small statue.Lo Wang came off as a serious♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in fact. I think he was just born an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from beginning to end and his transition from ""I'm so full of it"" to ""He's my friend and i'm going to help him"" was very quick that i suddenly thought i was playing as someone else! He's quick witted as intended by the developers but man were his jokes corney. I loved them!Shadow Warrior would have been my most favourite FPS if i had played it back in 2013. It's a shame it took me this long to finally get around to playing it, it was worth every penny and i really do recommended it.By the way, if you find two rabbits getting it on. Please don't kill them, that male rabbit will not be pleased... ♥♥♥♥ing demons...*grumble grumble*			"

												Im really split between actually saying its a good game or saying its a bad game. So Im gonna leave it up to others to decide and just am gonna count up everything Ive noticed.The Story. You dont know atfirst but the story is actually quite deep and really nice. Especially because its told from different perspectives. Some parts get clear while others are still strange and I bet cinemasins would die trying to analyse what when and why couldve happened better. I think its nice, even though you have to figure it out yourself mostly, after something happened already.The Gameplay Yeah, what can I say to that.. Honestly, its mostly horrible. Its just a pile of crap. It has a ton of bugs which cause you to die and restart about twenty minutes in the past. The fights get harder but not more challenging, enemies can just be mowed down by buttonsmashing or dont die because their weakspot has a horrible hitbox that obviously was hit but didnt count as a hit. Its good for a hack and slay, but thats all. No real challenge, just doing the same thing over and over again.The Secrets and jokes That and the story are the best parts about the game. There are so many jokes, references, puns and dumb-action-movie sentences which make it hillarious. I enjoyed it much, especially the fortune cookies.The Characters They are all pending between having actual depth but still staying flat to the surface. I mean, they all just seem to want to do one thing but then suddenly, bam, character development. Have all of it. And it worked. Especially here the different angles of story telling are good.The Graphics Now, I dont wanna say that graphic is the only important thing, but its still an important factor, even if the story is awesome. Yet, good graphics and bad story dont make a game good. This game has a good graphic, I dont know why  but I think it was quite awesome, even though its kinda old and just a remake. Some places looked awesome, even though some were repetetive.			"

												This game is epic ninjastyle slashing and hacking with katana. You can and you will also shoot, penetrate, explode and slaughter your enemy with multiple different ways.There is also a story, which is very shady at first and the cutscenes are more than weird but it comes trough in the end. Quite less bugs in it, but be carefull if you shift hop forward, like in staircase or lower. For some reason, you gain high velocity and crush against a wall or floor in that case. It's best not to jump in stairs...Game lasts nearly 9 hours and some levels are quite longer than others. Good game, get from some sale or something. I did.			"

												Flying Wild Hog's follow up to their 2011 sleeper Hard Reset is much like that game: crazy, intense and gorgeous. A reboot of the 1997 3D Realms title of the same name, this game is, in a word, ridiculous. The humor is awful in a wonderful way, and the gore is ludicrously delicious. Like Hard Reset before it though, the game at its current price ($39.99) doesn't offer enough substance to warrant the cover charge. But, if you can find it on sale for $20 or less, you'd be mad not to pick it up. Check it out.			"

												The worst parts are the boss battles. They can be somehow enjoyable but are the worst of an overall solid game. Mixing swordplay with guns and magic feels really good. The combat can be played in various ways which keeps the game very interesting. Loved the story and the durabilty of the game. Wished there were more small enemies and more backtracking when exploring, so this game could relate more to classics like Doom, blood, and of course the classic shadow warrior. Still, this game is a pure gem. If you loved clasic FPS, go blind with this one and pick hard difficult. 9/10			"

												This game is fun. If you miss the old days of things like Serious Sam, you will like this game. No ADS and your sword is your best friend. The guns feel sorta weak, but headshots are deadly and it doesn't matter when your sword is so fun and deadly. The combos of powers you have are very awesome. My only complaint is that the flying enemies are super annoying. But every game has it's one annoying enemy so no worries. Also, figuring out where to go or what to do and navigation could be better for a game this linear. So if you like old-school shooters and don't mind having to figure your way around a bit, this game is well worth your time!			"

												Great single player game, campaign lasts anywhere from 15 hours+ depending on the difficulty and how much you look for secrets. Hundreds of enemies thrown at you at once for your almighty blade to slice into multiple pieces. There are also many guns to be used, abused and upgraded which are also very amusing to use. The ranking system after every battle is also a neat system that encourages you to go back and 5 star every map. Overall a great game and not just for fans of the Serious Sam formula, its a great game for anyone looking for a great single player experience. Also, your character's name is Lo Wang.			"

Posted: May 12, 2016
												With the binary nature of Steam's recommend/don't recommend system, it can be difficult to review some games (whereas a graduated rating system might be more appropriate but perhaps more difficult to interpret).  And although I can recommend this game to most people with a reasonable degree of confidence, I find that Shadow Warrior is occasionally one of those problematic games. It's not really necessary to be familiar with the 1997 original, since the 2013 version by Flying Wild Hog is a modern reboot.  Lo Wang's previously racist caricatures have been tempered by a more moderate (but strangely endearing) flavor of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  But I doubt anybody's playing either of these games for the puns, so I digress.  Just know that Wang and the demonic voice in his head can make for frequently entertaining banter, and that it helps move the story along in a positive way while helping distinguish it from other FPS games that are often devoid of charm or  personality.So Wang is on a quest for a sword (or several swords) that are imbued with magical powers.  This job quickly goes sideways, pitting Wang against everything from Yakuza to gargantuan demons from a ""Shadow Realm"".  As things progress, Wang accrues money (used to buy ammo and purchase upgrades for weapons), Karma (used to unlock and improve skills) and Ki Crystals (used to unlock demonic powers).  The weapons tree is pretty self-explanatory:  You'll come across new weapons as you work through the story, and each of these weapons (with the exception of two demonic-based tools) has three upgrades for purchase at your leisure.  For example, one of the upgrades lets you fan the hammer of your revolver ""Western Style"" as an alt-fire, greatly increasing firerate; another lets you wield a second SMG akimbo; a barrel attachment for your flamethrower gives you the ability to lob balls of explosive goo as an alt-fire.  Most upgrades significantly improve the utility of each weapon and can turn a relatively medicore firearm into something useful or flexible, even at higher difficulties.  In general I feel that the arsenal is pretty comprehensive, although even with the upgrades system it can feel a little small at times.  Despite all this, the good ol' sword (which, after a Karma and Ki Crystals, feels awesome to use) will likely be a mainstay of most players' strategies.The ""Skills"" and ""Powers"" trees are a little more nebulous.  Skills are generally passive qualities like ""find more money"" or ""do more damage to Lesser Demons"", but there are also active skills (such as sword moves) that blur the lines between the two categories.  Powers, on the other hands, are strictly active abilities like healing, throwing up a defensive shield, or projecting a force that knocks enemies off their feet.  Unlike a lot of games, you won't be able to buy/upgrade everything on a single run, nor will you feel pressed to make hard decisions with limited resources--and that's a good balance for the game to strike, in my opinion.Speaking of which, for the initial bit, you'll only have your sword (and a basic revolver not long after).  This is probably one of the lowest points of the game, since you'll be flailing your sword wildly and impotently at NPCs and shooting a sluggish revolver--and probably missing a fair amount--at squirrely demons.  I cannot stress it enough:  The game is really not that fun for the first 30 minutes or so.  For me, things only started to pick up once I was able to invest a few points into some skills, upgrade a few weapons, and accrue a couple of abilities.  The game is strongest when you are beheading crowds with 360-degree sword moves, unloading four-barreled shotguns into teleporting witch-demons, and flinging opponents through the air like ragdolls on a never-ending quest to get the approval of the game's rating system.  The general progression of levels are a distinct mix of classic FPS and arena FPS.  On some of the larger levels, you're free to approach things from several different directions or orders; at other points, the game will give you a more linear series of arena fights to work your way through (a la Painkiller or Serious Sam).  Sometimes the levels--the ""Shadow Realm"" chapters in particular--are beautiful.  On the other hand, the game often languishes in ugly, dull areas like the interior of a cargo ship. One of my bigger issues with the game stems from the aforementioned arena-based nature of a lot of the levels.  Specifically, they tend to go on for too long.  That in and of itself isn't a huge problem, but when coupled with Shadow Warrior's limited enemy roster, the fights can get monotonous fast--especially towards the end when you'll be fighting the same half-dozen enemy types over and over again, 3-5 waves per setpiece.  Though it's obvious that Flying Wild Hog was working with limited resources, the existing enemies are satisfying to fight (granted the shield-wielding demons can be obnoxious).  Of course, the game shouldn't have dragged on for so long if it wasn't able to keep things fresh with a wider roster of monstrosities.  There are seriously levels where you'll just go from arena to arena, fighting what is fundamentally the same group of enemies over and over again, for 45-60 minutes per level.  It really does a disservice to the game.  Also, despite Shadow Warrior's central conceit being about a sword and the jerk who wields it, the game inexplicably has  sections where you'll be obligated to man a turret as 15-20 flying enemies or several waves of ground enemies come towards you.  They aren't fun and the game throws more of these sections at you than it should, to the point where you'll start cringing whenever you see a glowing turret in a room.     Still, Shadow Warrior is probably the best case scenario of a classic FPS reboot we could ever hope for (especially after the less successful installments of other classic FPS games, like RoTT and Duke Nukem Forever).  Is it a fun game?  Most definitely.  Is it a perfect game?  Not even close.  But it's a great effort and the sequel is shaping up to be a solid game in its own right--something that wouldn't be possible without the success of the former.			"

												I played this masterpiece of a game with no knowledge of either the original or hard reset, and when i actually started playing i fell in love with the game by the first level. The combat is as satisfying as it is responsive and the katana's hit detection is probably the best i've ever seen in a video game (however special abilities are difficult to use at first), there is no weapon that you feel you won't like simply due to the fact that all of them have niche roles. The plot is interesting as well making mindless killing actually seem like your doing something meaningful however i won't talk too much about it due to spoilers. The game also has a surprisingly good sense of (especially considering the fact that the main character's name is essentially a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥joke). Lastly the world is absolutely beautiful (albeit it's no columbia from bioshock infinite)Dispite all of that however, the game has a few game breaking AI glitches (like enemies hiding behind cover forever in a place the player can't reach) that make it impossible to advance due to the ""kill everything to advance"" system that only works if it's well placed in games like castle crashers. Also as i mentoned earlier the abilities are hard to use at first due to minor control issues and the exploration can get pretty boring when you just want to kill everything in sight but there's nothing for you to kill. Another thing to note is the unbareable load times, it's worse than dead rising 2 in this respect.Overall i'd reccomend this game to anyone who likes good stories, mindless killing, non-serious games and good humour but can tolerate a few downsides that prevent this game being perfect			"

												Shadow Warrior is undoubtedly a breath of fresh air in the myriad of FPS games that have come out in recent times. You hardly use cover and must use the spacious environments to your advantage with your high-speed dodges and quick attacks. This game does nearly everything right. NEARLY. What it doesn't do right is a HUGE thing, unfortunately, and left a bad taste in my mouth in the end.Pros:+ The game looks great. To my knowledge, Flying Wild Hog isn't a huge triple-A company, so the amount of assets and how good they look is a real plus. Everything meshes together very nicely. Character models look good and the animations are very well done.+ The violence and gore is lovely.  Really satisfying to slice up, blast, and decapitate enemies in different ways.+ The story is nicely done. Even if my mind was usually rendered numb through all the fighting I had to go through, there was a semblance of a story and I think that it was told well enough.+ Good sense of humor. I got plenty of chuckles from this one, although some parts made me cringe admittedly.Cons:- The soundtrack was not all that memorable, but it fit into the game well enough. This is labeled as a ""con"" just because I would have preferred something more awesome through the mind-numbing gameplay I had to sit through.- This game is fun for the first few hours as more and more enemies are introduced to you. The thing is, at the 2/3 mark, the game takes a nosedive and thinks that throwing a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of bullet sponge enemies at you relentlessly for hours and hours will continue being fun. There was no more variety once the last of the enemies were revealed (this was around the 1/2 mark), and it was a massive hassle getting through the last chapters of the game. I was constantly praying that it would eventually be over. It dragged out its welcome.- To branch off the con above, the game is too long for the amount of derivative gameplay there is. Serious Sam 3 had a similar gameplay style to this one, but that game was the perfect length and spread out its levels into very interesting designs and introduced enemies at the perfect pace. It also had more fun weapons and co-op.Shadow Warrior is close to not being recommended, but there was obviously a lot of love put into this one, and I enjoyed it enough for the most part to where I think it skirts over the line. For anyone looking for a ""modern old-school"" title, I hope that you're one of the more hardcore ones. Maybe then you'll have a blast the whole way through.			"

												Excelente jogo. Muitas piadas, biscoitos da sorte com frases mirabolantes e muita matança. Valeu cada centavo. Posso dizer com propriedade que é um ótimo jogo, pois tenho mais de 50 horas nela e tenho 100% das conquistas. recomendo mesmo.			"

												Awesome combat and brilliant jokes?yes.A hero who's got the touch? god yes!this game is a pearl, the combat is crazy and fast and good flowing, the game itself is just so good, humping rabbits in the grass, fortune cookies with dry humor in them, The hero is having funny conversations throughout the game and has some wonderful lines. The only downside i can see is if you have a ""not so fast"" pc, you are gonna have some problems with the reflections, but still :)Now show those demons that they have come to the wang place!9/10			"

												Epic. Flying Wild Hog make the best FPS games out there at the moment. Hard Reset was a masterpiece and this game takes it to the next level. Katana sword play done how it should be. Slicing and dicing enemies is great fun, but the shooting is rock solid too. Traces of bulletstorm in there with the scoring system after each fight give this game instant replay value also. Highly reccomend if you are a fan of FPS games and want somehing refreshing.			"

												I have just completed Shadow Warrior and I really enjoyed it. The game offers classic arena style gameplay and a engaging story that kept me playing. There is a nice selection of weapons such as my favorite duel-wielding submachine guns and katana moves you can use. The keyboard controls and mouse movement are very responsive. I was happy to see how well optimized for the pc this game was on my mid-range gaming pc. I was able to enable ultra graphical settings on everything except I turned off mirrors and the game ran smooth. I recommend buying this game because Flying Wild Hog have put a lot of care (patches) and attention to detail that pays tribute to old-school fps.			"

												Don't look at the metascore for this one. This  is an old-school shooter with tight controls, satisfying gameplay, and a fantastic-looking environment. It's also full of crude humor and general oldschool machoness. Think Serious Sam or Duke Nukem, but with a lot more melee options. The gameplay is tight, you move fast, the enemies strafe and dodge your fire. The environments are detailed and feel realistic (as opposed to Seriouis Sam, where alleys look like football stadiums). The game is linear, but there are plenty of hidden gems and secrets to be found. It's also full of references to old school shooters.This game is gorgeous, even on low settings. But if you want higher fidelity you'd have to add a bit of heat to your graphics cards. Sometimes the enemies feel a bit repetitive or even bullet-spongey. The characters are maybe a bit too macho to be likeable, the same way that Bulletstorm's characters didn't really appeal to me.			"

												Oh how I love and adore this FPS shooter title.I've been a big fan of Biosock and a few other titles but strangely enough I never was heavy into anything like DOOM or Caslte Wolfenstein until I got to try out this game!I love and adore the insanity this game has to offer and you'll be laughing out loud and all the while enjoying the ride of this story you follow along with.Its basically like anything Duke Nukem would do but you have an endless variety in the ways you can cut up, or shoot up your enemies.  Tons of combos for players who love to get into the melee system, epic gunfights to make you feel like a badass.  There's everything here.I even have to stop and mention how beautiful this game looks.  Its amazing to see some of the time and depth put into some of the levels and expect huge levels with lots of variety to run and slice around with.You'll also be really taken into the story as well.  As much as you think a FPS migh not have a great story, I was left rarther teary eyed and impressed with this game at the end.Definitely recommened this game.  Even after beating the first one and I heard they were making 2nd one, I immediately bought it.  And now I'm playing the 2nd one and I'm already setup to support a 3rd game, not even kidding. Treat yourself and have some Lo-Wang in your collection!			"

												This game ROCKS!If you like the classic 90's shooters, this game is for you! Fast action, nice weapons, secrets areas, some plataforming. In addition, the game offers a wide customization range, with weapon upgrades, skills and powers to unlock.I loved the way the skills work, with keyboard + click combinations like W, W + Left Mouse Button (hold to charge). It's really useful while in combat and there are no delay. Some skills are used off combat.The dialogue is OK, with some good humour and references. The soundtrack is beautiful and recall the old Shadow Warrior.AND, if you played the original SW back in the 90's, you HAVE to play this!WHO WANTS SOME WANG? \,,/_			"

												A game that does so many things right.1. Combat: Very very well done. The swordplay and gunplay are a blast and actually, sword is the most effective weapon in the game to be honest and really easy to use. The character movement feels fluid and you will not feel bored anytime soon slashing through the demon horde.2. Weapon design: Cool looking weapons and upgrades that you definitley want to buy. 3. Skill trees: Easy to understand and interesting to use skills4. Story: A nice story that gets you a little more involved in the game if the combat didn't already sucked you in5. Visuals: Fantastic AAA class visuals. Whether it is a wide open area with mountains or a house, one can't help but admire to the level of detail put into everythingI say buy this game. I will go further by saying that support this developer (Flying Wild Hog) by preordering their games and buying at full price. "

Hack, slash, or shoot your way through waves of monsters in order to get all the pieces of the Nobitsura Kage in this 90's reboot. You play as Lo Wang, a modern day assassin, fighting your way through the chapters in the game alongside Hoji, a demon banished from the underworld. Whether you chose to split your enemies with a katana or with bullets, each kill is as satisfying as the last one. Add some absolutely beautiful environments to that and you get one of the better games of 2013.Pros:+Extremely satisfying sword mechanics, especially if played using a controller +The environments in this game are absolutely stunning, with lighting that can be described as perfect +Multiple difficulties to chose from +Survival game mode has just the right amount of challenge to it+Interesting story with characters that are unique to say the least +Each chapter takes at least 30 minutes to beat, easily making the game last you 10 hours +Weapons are balanced, making the game fun no matter what you use+The katana offers a versatile style of play +Comes with Viscera Cleanup Detail+Did I mention how beautiful this game looks? +Bunnies Cons:-Can get extremely repetitive after a while, though still very fun -Boss battles can be a bit awkward at times, though they are very doable -Though the glowing objective system works fantastically, it is a bit difficult to make out in a few environments To sum up this 90's reboot, it's a must have. The gameplay is fun, the story is entertaining, and the graphics are absolutely gorgeous. Whether it's on sale or not, it is definitely worth the money. If you're looking for fun game, you found it. 8/10 "

												Pump up the gore to the max!!! The dialog is very cheesy and it screams 80's kung fu films. This is a very nice looking game and will keep you entertained. Plays like the old doom/duke nukem/shadow warrior games from the 90's but updated to current gen. Many ways to upgrade your character and a good amount of easter eggs for old fans. The music is a mix of hard rock/metal for the fighting to zen like ambient♥♥♥♥♥♥when it claims down.  Like a 80's kung fu film it is great in a small dosage.			"

												I'm really new to the Shadow Warrior genre and I just bought it during a steam sale.My first experience with the game and my take on it.+ Astoundingly beautiful graphics.+ Delicious gore.+ Very original and cool weapon designs.+ Lots of easter eggs, secrets and funny tidbits you can find when exploring the world around you.+ Very fast-paced combat, always keeps you on your toes.+ Wang.+ Very nice artwork and environmental effects. Everything around you is a freaking deathtrap if you're not careful.+ Very nice blend of horror, thriller, suspense and action.Now for the cons.- The head and weapon bobbing makes me a little nauseous. I wish there was an option to turn that off.- The lighting in some are blinding and frustrating to navigate to.- Some of the control schemes just don't make sense to me. Like the regeneration skill. Constantly pushing ""D"" makes you move while healing, which can be convenient at times but there are some cases where you don't want to go in the direction you're trying to heal yourself in.- Motion blur is going to make me sick. I'm normally used and accustomed to FPS games  but this one just makes me wanna puke after playing for hours for some reason, something that most FPS games do not induce on me.- The death count: Seriously, don't be like GTA or other games that reminds players how many times they messed up in the game. I'm a perfectionist so I had to delete my old save data just to start fresh and go for a no death run.- There are times where Wang is just trying too hard to be funny. The accent is a little bit thick for an asian too.- Lo Wang is not even a japanese name. I don't know Wang's backstory but when I started the game, I assumed he was Japanese. If so, disregard this.- Experienced my first death when I misread the health number and thought it read 12 when it actuallity, it was written as ""92"". I panicked and ran all over the place, got mobbed and died.Overall, my score for this game is an honest 8/10.Will try to shoot vending machine and dying again.			"

												Great game! The mechanics were smooth and the sword (and magic) works well with this genre. The combos got frustrating at times, but I got used to them. The other weapons weren't great, but I really only needed them for larger enemies and bosses, and the customizability was okay. However, the most pleasant part of this game was the story that slowly crept in. At the beginning, the game seemed like Duke Nukem with a sword, but by the end there was some actual drama (and dare I say character development). Looking forward to the sequel.			"

												What a fantastic game. Very fun and worth the money if you can grab it for <$20. I wouldn't recommend this game if you dislike the ""feel"" of something like Ninja Gaiden where you see pretty much every enemy you'll fight all game within the first half of the main story. It follows the convention of just throwing more of the same enemies at you instead of different enemies. I'm perfectly fine with that but I can see why it could make others pass it up. The last few chapters become incredibly drudging however. In one section you're forced to fight two very fast and very strong minibosses at once with a vision handicap, and then they do it again in the next chapter, and AGAIN in the chapter after that. Some parts can feel very cheap and some of the mechanics as well. I found myself constantly using the Wing of Crane move because it was so damn good, but I rarely ever used the Flux or Shockwave skills. Some of the guns are fantastically good like the crossbow, but others are absolute garbage like the pistol. Pretty much everything in this game is hit-and-miss, but most of the time the positives highly outweigh the negatives, most of the time.			"

												I'm surprised with how much I enjoyed Shadow Warrior. I knew that I would probably enjoy it because I love old-school styled first person shooters, but it surpassed my expectations. Don't get me wrong, it's not a masterpiece or anything more than your simple shooter, but it really is an expertly done return to the exploration and chaos of older FPS games.The gameplay consists of two main aspects, combat and exploration. The combat, like all old-school FPS games, is fast paced and chaotic. It throws a lot of enemies at you at the same time, which demands quick reflexes and projectile dodging. Lots of little things really make the combat work, like you move a bit faster than your average modern game hero and you aren't retricted to holding only two weapons at a time, you hold an arsenal of varied weapons by the end of the game. It's a nice change of pace from the combat of a lot of recent shooters, namely cover based shooting. Not that there is anything wrong with that style of combat, it's just fresh to return to circle-strafing and blasting away large hordes of monsters with a dozen different weapons. The katana in particular is a joy to use, as it dynamically cuts off the body parts that you sliced and is also relatively powerful; it's really the star of the combat in this game. Another thing that really makes the combat is the upgrade system. You have to save up three different resources to level up Lo Wang as you play: money, karma, and ki crystals which level up your weapons, skills, and powers respectively. These can really change the way that you can handle enemy encounters, like being able to use a slain demon's head to defeat more powerful foes or being able to use your katana from a distance with a light beam attack. At the end of each enemy encounter, you're given a score out of five based on how well you did in the fight. It gives you karma bonuses if you used a variety of attacks and weapons instead of just spamming the same attacks over and over. That alone, if you follow it, makes sure the combat doesn't get too old too quickly. The exploration in this game breaks up the combat nicely giving the game a nice roller-coaster like pace. After you defeat all the enemies in an area, you're encouraged to scour it for hidden secrets which will reward you with resources required to upgrade your powers, weapons or skills. The combat, levelling, and exploration and tie together perfectly to create very satisfying and fun gameplay.I was also surprised by the look of the game. While the graphics are not exceptionally good, the asian art style really helped the game stand out visually from others. Levels are filled with pagodas, candles, Buddha statues, bamboo, samurai armour displays, it really does look unique for a shooter. There are also a tonne of little details to notice throughout the game, like how enemies fall apart after you slice them up. Each chapter of the game also has a different look to it, keeping you from getting tired of looking at the same types of areas. The comic book cutscenes that divide each chapter of the game are also visually interesting, if a bit cliched at this point.The story of the game also surprised me in that it was actually interesting. Again, I'm not saying that it's fantastic, but for an old-school styled first person shooter, whose stories are usually given no thought at all, it was a welcome surprise. The real stand out writing-wise was the game's humour. Dialouge during the story bits is funny, albeit in a very immature way, and Lo Wang will spit out so-bad-they're-good one-liners during combat. The secrets can also be funny with a lot of references to the original Shadow Warrior.For all the good things I have to say about Shadow Warrior, there isn't much bad. I only have three real, but minor complaints. One, with the katana being so much fun to use, the guns seam very boring by comparison, but that's only because they really nailed the katana. Two, I played this game on the hardest difficutly and I only died a handful of times. Some more challenge would be appreciated, especially for an old-school shooter. Finally three, the levels are a bit linear for an old-school shooter, you won't find Duke Nukem 3D or Doom styled non-linearity level exploration here which I feel was a missed opportunity.However, you're supposed to judge things based on what they are and not what you want them to be. I really enjoyed playing Shadow Warrior and was surprised by how well it was done. Granted, I have not played the original Shadow Warrior at the time of me writing this, but regardless, as a stand alone game, Shadow Warrior is very much worth playing through if you liked fast paced, old-school action.

												While I have never played the original Shadow Warrior, I am familiar with its setting and some gameplay footage. I am extremely glad that the borderline racist protagonist was remade without the accent and cringeworthy stereotypes.Shadow Warrior is not a great game. You go through levels, pressing buttons to unlock doors or destroy magical seals in order to move forward. In between all of this, you shoot predictable waves of demons or turn to your trusty sword when you run low on ammo. Fairly basic and rather unoriginal. Level design, while diversified, is at times lackluster and uninspired. When you find the same ammo-crates and closets in every level ranging from random house in random village to mountain fortress of solitude, things get a bit dull. Good thing they didn't put those closets in the shadow realm as well.What makes the game shine is the combat mechanics, especially the swordfighting. While in the early stages, you are best advised to keep your distance and deal headshots, using the sword only sparingly, the sword really starts to shine about 2 hours into the game, after you unlock certain special moves. These not only make dealing with hordes of enemies way easier, but are also pretty fun.Most of the guns, on the other hand, are pretty useless. I relied mainly on the Shotgun (which is borderline useless before the upgrade to 4-barrels) and Crossbow (again, it only really starts to shine after upgrading, after which it becomes a vital weapon for quick kills). They might as well have left out the flamethrower, since it really only seems to make enemies panic without actually dealing significant damage. What in the beginning looks like your garden variety macho-guy-slaughters-monsters-to-cope-with-inferiority-complex story turns out to be surprisingly deep and enchanting. The cutscenes are artistically rendered and the overall story really develops into something serious about 2/3 into the game. Although I wasn't able to understand every last detail, since some of it is told in-game, I was pleased with the plotline.A detail that sort of bothers me are the non-Japanese signs one can find in the harbour level that is supposed to take place in Osaka, Japan. I might be wrong about these, but they are either Chinese or just a random selection of Chinese characters. This along with the protagonist's boss' name Mizayaki (which, as far as I know, is not a real Japanese name - it should probably be Miyazaki), I found to be  a bit unsensitive. Then again, it might be some sort of innuendo or joke that I am not aware of.Overall, I'd rate the game 7/10. It was a fun experience, even while at times being a bit repetitive and dull. Secret-hunters will definitely be satisfied, as well as those who seek a break from generic duck-behind-a-kneehigh-wall shooters.			"

												For fans of the older Doom-style shooters, Shadow Warrior will be a decent rush of nostalgic fun. The shooting is well done, with the action keeping a fast, flowing pace throughout. The weapons aren't as fun as some of the old style shooters, however, they're all fairly bland, with the katana being the most fun to use. The swordplay is surprisingly visceral, although you will sometimes slice through an enemy and almost nothing will happen, the enemies more often are either sliced to pieces, or react as if they had been hit by an actual sword. The story is coherent and interesting enough to keep the game together, but it's so tonally different from the gameplay that it often pushes you out of the experience. The two main characters do have a nice back-and-forth, with some of their dialogue actually making me laugh. The enemies however, get a bit repetitive, you fight the same 6 or 7 enemies during the entire game, and in the last few chapters, it finally gets a bit too repititive, and the combat stops being fun almost completely. The bosses are also fairly boring, Shadow Warrior doing the big impressive boss thing that telegraphs their attacks so far in advance you'd think they were trying to let you win, with the amount of health and ammo scattered around during these fights, they're just too easy. The ending is also a bit disappointing. TL;DR: A fun rush of slightly repetitive violence with an okay story and a couple of interesting characters.Edit: It's also fairly pretty.			"

My only complaint is that enemies tend to get a bit tiring later into the game as there are only so many different enemies, and the number faced at one time just slowly increases at one point. The secrets add a nice classic touch to the game and the combat is just so satisfying. Would recommend to everyone			"

On my first playthrough i didnt max out every skill or gun which i think is a plus- it makes spending your points and money feel more important. Looks great and i ended up liking lo wang and hoji so the characters pick up the ok story. The last third of it could get a tad repetitive but i just played like 1 or 2 missions a night and that was perfect. Normally an 8/10 but just for the amount of fun i have to give it a 9/10			"

												What can I say, FWH knows how to make good old-school FPS and Shadow Warrior is not an exception. And although this game is much easier than Hard Reset, it is still a decent specimen of old-school FPS genre, that is rare in modern times. Now to the main plot, unlike old Shadow Warrior this game has a really exciting story, literally it's a very good tale. And even Lo Wang is a big part of this story, he is not the major one. Hoji is a much more important figure. So to wrap up my review I want to say: highly recommended, especially if you like good tales and good old FPS.			"

												This juvenile pre-remake for Shadow Warrior set in the 80s starts strong and the implementation of sword play works nicely with the special abilities that you gain and use through button combinations (like in a fighting game). Unfortunately the fun level doesn't rise but rather stagnates as you go through waves of the same enemies over and over again. I kept wishing there was some way to do combos like in 'Darkness 2' or 'Bioshock', and also some finishing moves would have been nice. The other thing missing is the stealth element, in the original game you could become invisible and choose when to attack a pack of baddies...hence the title of the game. Here you have to kill everyone in an orderly fashion to open the doors that lead you to the next part of the level (effectively annihilating any replay value). Still the game looks great if not entirely original - sometimes I felt I was playing 'RAGE' or 'CALL of DUTY' with a sword- it's fast and furious speed is noteworthy. In a way it falls shy of greatness, although there are 17 chapters, there are only 14 levels (and 3 bosses) and only 3 different enviromments (Japanese villa/town and forest/cemetery, Shipyard, and mountain lab/castle) clocking around 20h on HARD for a first playthrough. Maybe one day we'll get more Wang with a cool DLC but the fortune cookie says it's doubtful at this point in time.PS: There's a survival mode with 3 levels but no multiplayer all. Sniff.PPS: Whatever happened to the black and white twin sisters?			"

												Im really split between actually saying its a good game or saying its a bad game. So Im gonna leave it up to others to decide and just am gonna count up everything Ive noticed.The Story. You dont know atfirst but the story is actually quite deep and really nice. Especially because its told from different perspectives. Some parts get clear while others are still strange and I bet cinemasins would die trying to analyse what when and why couldve happened better. I think its nice, even though you have to figure it out yourself mostly, after something happened already.The Gameplay Yeah, what can I say to that.. Honestly, its mostly horrible. Its just a pile of crap. It has a ton of bugs which cause you to die and restart about twenty minutes in the past. The fights get harder but not more challenging, enemies can just be mowed down by buttonsmashing or dont die because their weakspot has a horrible hitbox that obviously was hit but didnt count as a hit. Its good for a hack and slay, but thats all. No real challenge, just doing the same thing over and over again.The Secrets and jokes That and the story are the best parts about the game. There are so many jokes, references, puns and dumb-action-movie sentences which make it hillarious. I enjoyed it much, especially the fortune cookies.The Characters They are all pending between having actual depth but still staying flat to the surface. I mean, they all just seem to want to do one thing but then suddenly, bam, character development. Have all of it. And it worked. Especially here the different angles of story telling are good.The Graphics Now, I dont wanna say that graphic is the only important thing, but its still an important factor, even if the story is awesome. Yet, good graphics and bad story dont make a game good. This game has a good graphic, I dont know why  but I think it was quite awesome, even though its kinda old and just a remake. Some places looked awesome, even though some were repetetive.			"

												Probably the most fun I've had with a shooter (though more of a hybrid) in a VERY long time! From start to finish, the game kept me coming back over and over. It's starts very comedic, and then takes a nice, emotional turn (for the better), in the later half. Difficulty can ramp up at some points; to the point where you're forced to make use of the games guns, rather than using your sword, like you're likely gonna want to do throughout. Some of the backtracking can get confusing, at points; until you get a real handle on how the game and its levels are laid out.Very well optimized, as I never dipped below 60FPS, on max settings.Win 10 (64)i7-4790nVidia Reference GTX 970 (4GB)16GB RAM			"

												I was never one to play the original Shadow Warrior, but I think this game captures the spirit of old school fps games with some neat twists. I would love for Flying Wild Hog to expand on the game a bit more, maybe create a more polished sequel, as I feel there were some bits and pieces of this game that felt unrealized or primarily unfinished. And the plot takes a surprising turn near the end. But in the grand scheme of it all these are minor gripes.Where the game truly shines is in the combat. Not quite Serious Sam level, but still more than enough to keep things tense and exciting. The environments have some nice touches, and although the secrets aren't necessarily well hidden, it's more than enough for anyone who wants to take the time to look for them. Unlike other franchises that have rebooted, while forgetting what made them so enjoyable (looking at you Painkiller and Duke Nukem), Flying Wild Hog has not only revived an aging series, but they've done so with good design sensibility, and an explosion filled, blood soaked shoot fest that also happens to have some very satisfying swordplay. 8.5/10.

												This game is fun. If you miss the old days of things like Serious Sam, you will like this game. No ADS and your sword is your best friend. The guns feel sorta weak, but headshots are deadly and it doesn't matter when your sword is so fun and deadly. The combos of powers you have are very awesome. My only complaint is that the flying enemies are super annoying. But every game has it's one annoying enemy so no worries. Also, figuring out where to go or what to do and navigation could be better for a game this linear. So if you like old-school shooters and don't mind having to figure your way around a bit, this game is well worth your time!			"

It starts to feel repetetiv after a short while but can keep you playing with its fun gameplay, even though you run 8+ hours around left clicking your way through hordes of demons and sometimes yakuza. If Shadow Warrior could have kept up the level of humor, which it starts with, troughout the game it would be much much better. I highly recommend this game WHEN ITS ON SALE.

While the gunplay is fun, where the game really shines is its swordplay, which is extremely satisfying and probably stands alongside Metal Gear Rising in terms of great sword fighting games that provide sheer enjoyment. The dialogue is surprisingly hilarious and some of the funniest material I have heard in a game in ages, which is an awesome surprise that I wasn't expecting at all. As far as the protagonist, Lo Wang is probably the most badass asian since Wei Shen or Bruce Lee.In short, I would definitely recommend trying all the things seen in this game at home, because while I haven't myself, they look freaking amazing and a hell of a lot of fun.

												Mess with the Bull you get the Wang!Shadow Warrior is a bloody good time. Real authentic hack and slash with endless gore and quirk jokes. Its one of my personal favorites and just has a unique setting of a game. Great single-player experience and has very remarkable asian world/mythical settings. You fight countless demons from the Shadow Realm and it becomes a very challenging game. Its a worthy title to have in your Steam Collection and it just works. The only flaws it has is the ending, and the overall backstory makes no sense...but that does not matter. A suitcase of money, a blooy sword and fighting endless demons is more than enough to deem worthy of being called Mr. Two Million Dollars. A'oh![PROS] Visually Stunning & Bloody Brilliant. Authentic Asian-style action & musical elements to the surroundings. Samurai-Style Sushi (Everybody was kung fu fighing! ~) Did I mention the blood and guts? You are reading this now and should be playing it instead.[CONS] Story is like...uhh...What happened? On higher Difficulties you will be owned. Don't Zip Run off cliffs, bridges or abyssal slopes. Aiming your guns is a bit stupid and irky jerky. (Couldn't get that to work better developers?) Heroic Mode is just Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ (You Developers are crazy, I mean seriously, really, come on!)Closing: Its all just Baby Farts... "

												I bought this for $20 about a month ago, and now that I've played it, I'd have been willing to pay more.Finding secrets the way that shooters used to have them is quite fun, and it has the most entertaining melee system since Dark Messiah of Might and Magic. While melee is clearly the weapon of choice, eventually, guns become not only viable, but rather fun, once you get their more ridiculous upgrades like a quad barrel shotgun and exploding crossbow bolts, but for the large part you will be making like Butcher Pete and hacking enemies to pieces, even the sub-bosses.

In addition, the game offers a wide customization range, with weapon upgrades, skills and powers to unlock.I loved the way the skills work, with keyboard + click combinations like W, W + Left Mouse Button (hold to charge). It's really useful while in combat and there are no delay. Some skills are used off combat.The dialogue is OK, with some good humour and references. The soundtrack is beautiful and recall the old Shadow Warrior.AND, if you played the original SW back in the 90's, you HAVE to play this!WHO WANTS SOME WANG? \,,/_			"

												A game that does so many things right.1. Combat: Very very well done. The swordplay and gunplay are a blast and actually, sword is the most effective weapon in the game to be honest and really easy to use. The character movement feels fluid and you will not feel bored anytime soon slashing through the demon horde.2. Weapon design: Cool looking weapons and upgrades that you definitley want to buy. 3. Skill trees: Easy to understand and interesting to use skills4. Story: A nice story that gets you a little more involved in the game if the combat didn't already sucked you in5. Visuals: Fantastic AAA class visuals. Whether it is a wide open area with mountains or a house, one can't help but admire to the level of detail put into everythingI say buy this game. I will go further by saying that support this developer (Flying Wild Hog) by preordering their games and buying at full price. "

												Realy liked this game decent story and the games length is above average.What I liked also is that you can use the sword or use the guns I didn't feel forced to use one over the other.I realy like the weapons in this game because you can ""feel"" them when hitting enemys.Keys are rebindable and very simple.Myy friend VOJ reminded me of something I didn't realy notice much in game since I used the sword alot.There are some enemies that are like bullet sponges in this game so I lowered from 9 to 7.5/10 WangarangsDetailed explanation below (Spoiler free)GORE:The enemies head , legs ,arms ,etc .. are ""detachable"".If you take out a enemies legs they will crawl after you while beeding out.WEAPONS:The weapons can be upgraded using money except for the sword (sword has ""upgrades"" but only unlocks during story progress.Upgrades are realy different swords that you find later in game)The weapons have 3 upgrades each and can be unlocked in any order you wish.Also most of these upgrades change the way the guns behave.Example: Flamethrower has a upgrade that adds a secondary fire that shoots a incendiary bomb that explodes on contact.POWERS :  Powers can only be upgraded by finding speacial Ki Crystals in each level , most can be found without much hassle but  this rewards exploration.These powers are structured like a tree branching in two different directions and can only be upgraded in order.There are four powers that each have two different branched paths that have two upgrades for a total of 4 upgrades each.I excluded the root upgrade because that is what unlocks each power , so five each counting that.You can upgrade everything if you have enbough KI Crystals.Example: (POWER) Protection once unlocked using a KI Crystal you can spend further KI Crystals going for increased protection and/or protection from all types of attacks and shield coverage.SKILLS : Skills can be upgraded using Karma point's. You get Karma points by doing well in combat and getting bonusus and also from hidden fountains of blood (These aren't too hard to find and some are not hidden).There are alot of skills and these can either boost some of the powers or add things like sword techniques and extra stamina/speed/health. There are some cool ones like being able to use the heads from certain enemies that shoot lasers from it eyes.REPLAY:Game has a New game plus mode too.:)Game has a survival mode (Have not tried it yet , will update if I have anything to add)			"

												This juvenile pre-remake for Shadow Warrior set in the 80s starts strong and the implementation of sword play works nicely with the special abilities that you gain and use through button combinations (like in a fighting game). Unfortunately the fun level doesn't rise but rather stagnates as you go through waves of the same enemies over and over again. I kept wishing there was some way to do combos like in 'Darkness 2' or 'Bioshock', and also some finishing moves would have been nice. The other thing missing is the stealth element, in the original game you could become invisible and choose when to attack a pack of baddies...hence the title of the game. Here you have to kill everyone in an orderly fashion to open the doors that lead you to the next part of the level (effectively annihilating any replay value). Still the game looks great if not entirely original - sometimes I felt I was playing 'RAGE' or 'CALL of DUTY' with a sword- it's fast and furious speed is noteworthy. In a way it falls shy of greatness, although there are 17 chapters, there are only 14 levels (and 3 bosses) and only 3 different enviromments (Japanese villa/town and forest/cemetery, Shipyard, and mountain lab/castle) clocking around 20h on HARD for a first playthrough. Maybe one day we'll get more Wang with a cool DLC but the fortune cookie says it's doubtful at this point in time.PS: There's a survival mode with 3 levels but no multiplayer all. Sniff.PPS: Whatever happened to the black and white twin sisters?			"

												Played the first part and it was pretty damn incredible and hilarious would recommend will update if it takes a turn for the worse but I can't see that happening - this♥♥♥♥♥♥is awesome and genuinely had me laughing a lot. (note this isn't a serious game this is a slash your way through an army of enemies with whatever you have - think DOOM as in that in story mode you can run around killing with whatever you want)Negative marks it doesn't follow all video game logic such as crouching in a bush doesn't make you invisible, there is slight screen tilting when you strafe with A and D which is a little uncomfortable.When you see the combo moves they look wierd but they are very easy to do and in all honesty the best way they could have done it since there seems like there is room for a bunch of combo moves.The game does look pretty but you wont be focusing on that as you are sprinting / air dashing around flailing your blade wildly - you can cut off limbs.If you want a good sword combat game this isn't what you are looking for - this game is for FUN.

												I'm not exactly sure how I feel about this game. There are many things I enjoyed about it, but it kept leaving me with a bad taste. I was initially surprised with how beautiful the graphics are, but the themes bored me very quickly for some reason. The combat is focused around your katana, which is fun at first, but too much melee will quickly give you a headache. The characters are funny, but they are given too few lines. The bigger story that they wanted to tell is pure garbage and completely failed to motivate me. The ending was predictable, but it still offered me no closure whatsoever. So, you kill every character that was even slightly developed, just to revive someone with no meaning whatsoever. Who is she again and why is she worth it? Something about rain? Was I supposed to care? I felt like the villain by the end. Characters looked at me with sad eyes as I was killing everything, hurting them while they did nothing to me, all of it over something I completely failed to understand. Shadow Warrior is original enough to stand out, and produced well enough to be good, but not great. You can play it, if you want a good fix of FPS. You're not going to make memories, though.			"

												Loved it, Classic old school shooter with some modern bells and whistles.  Excellent dose of nostalgia combined with nice graphics and good animation, Well executed and kept me entertained throughout.Not the longest game in the world but having bought it on a steam sale i still got the better end of that bargain in my eyes, NG++ mode also adds a bit of fun replayability. Weapons feel fun and over the top, nice sword play for the unusual touch. Oh and the blood, haha yeah lots of blood, all over your face and clothes, yep yep. Ohhh classic secrets, again nostagia, love a full on homage to the good old days through the rose tinted glasses of time.Hmm biggest negative i can think of is the boss encounters, not really much thought gone into them, but still, diddnt make me switch off and well executed, and fits in with the traditional style i guess... meh..Put simply this game adds nothing new to the genre, and does it well with juvinile witty old school feel......

												This has to be one of the most amusing, if not the most amusing FPS that came out this year.In a nutshell, this is just a (partially) old school FPS with accented swordplay, and oh my, the swordplay is satisfyingly good. Toss in a bunch of upgradeable weapons, a few magic powers and this game becomes a sandbox for creative beheading, incinerating, blowing up and slicing up hordes of enemies.Storywise, the game is actually very decent. I didn't expect much as most of the other reviews I read said the story sucked, but I actually liked it.If you get the chance, pick this one up, it will repay in hours of mindless fun, something quite a few FPSes have missed out on lately.

What I expectedI've been looking for a modern adaption of a fast paced, oldschool first-person shooter, comparable to Painkiller or Serious Sam.What I got+- Story: For a game of this niche the story is surprisingly entertaining. The basic idea: A man gets drawn into the conflict between demon lords and in pursuit of a legendary sword gets the power to not only save his world, but to also change the fate of their shadowy realm.There are a couple of nice looking comic sequences in which the background story is revealed piece by piece, where your sometimes a bit annoying companion becomes a more interesting character over time. Not bad!- Combat System: Fast and responsive. Melee is a big component and you unlock different swordstrikes over time. You have some magic spells (healing, stun, damage) and some enemies require different tactics.- Character System: You have three areas to improve; skills, magic and weapons. Each require a different currency to unlock. There certainly is some room for individual choices so it's not just a feature without purpose.- Presentation/Physics: Even two years after release, the game is still looking well enough. Enemies can be cut to pieces, burned or pushed away, some objects can be broken. The weapons feel strong and give a good impression of power in the game world.- Sound/Music: Just well made. Weapons and enemies sound good, music is decent - a few tracks with asian or jazz influence are even good. Can't complain.- Humour: It didn't make me break down laughing and did not send my sides into orbit. But still, the occasional Wang joke or light hearted comment was certainly good to keep the spirits high during the more repetitive moments of the game.- Hidden extras: Join the old-school fun when looking for the most inconspicuous places. Exploration is well rewarded with money (for weapons) and an XP like currency for skills. Contains some references to the original game aswell.- Difficulty: The highest setting ""insane"" felt just right for me as an experienced gamer. Enemies are dangerous and you have to be on your toes not to be surrounded my smaller minions or charged to death by the dreaded berserkers. Still, quicksave and the manual healing ability make every fight winnable. Even though you spend some time each fight just running away and healing yourself it still feels way better than those auto healing mechanics.+-- Weapons: Nothing really creative or particulary interesting. Katana, Revolver, SMG, Crossbow, Shotgun, Flamethrower, Rocket Launcher, Demon Heart, Demon Head. Each weapon can undergo at least one interesting change via upgrade.- Level design: Almost a negative point, if not for some beautiful places and those sometimes well hidden extras.Every now and then you re-visit areas that look very similar to other ones. Could be more diverse. Most fights have an arena like feeling where enemies are spawning until you've killed them all and the door to the next area opens.- Enemies: Nicely designed, some require special tactics. They get repetitive over time though. A plus are the big boss battles, although they all play VERY similar. Cool design though.- Characters: Not many interesting characters, which only develop over time. Doesn't take itself too seriously though, which avoids mindnumbing stereotypes.-- Repetitiveness: Consider this as a huge point. Some areas really feel drawn out, thanks to the arena fights and repetitive level design. There have been a couple of places where I was plain bored.- Bugs: I fell through the floor a couple of times and you can die when dashing down stairs. Minor annoyance.My perspectiveI've been pursuing this hobby since the mid 90s. My favorite genres are Strategy games, RPGs and (increasingly less) FPS. I also enjoy the occasional platformer, adventure or other indi game.I like competitive elements in online games, but without the social component of hanging out with friends I'd often prefer offline titles.

												This is one of the most fun games I've played in a long time. Shifting around the battlefield slicing up enemies with a magic katana couldn't have been executed better than in this game, though I wished there was more enemy variety. The game has lots of guns too, but aside from the revolver I don't find them that enjoyable. Graphically, the game is pretty good too, but it does lag in big areas with lots of enemies (although this is just my old computer hissing).There's lots of easter eggs and secrets, and after every battle you will be rated on how original/good it was, so there's enough to do for the completionist.Soundwise, it's pretty normal for a game. Somehow you can hear bullets impacting in enemies that are a hundred meters away, and other sounds are nothing special.Overall, I recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of shooters like Serious Sam and anyone who likes games with swords, like Chivalry or even Skyrim. The katana is one of the most fun weapons I've used in any game ever.My rating: 8/10			"

												A game with more under the hood than what it is credited for. Not only is it a blood and guts shooter swordplay hybrid, it is also a game which pays homage to the days of old, with games like Duke 3D and Serious Sam. Cheesy one liners, secret areas, half naked females, this game has everything that a veteran gamer could want. If you don't get this game for the nostalgia, get it instead for tight controls, well designed levels, good graphics and a stellar upgrades system. One of the best purchases I have made this year.

												Probably the best reboot of an older shooter to date.Rise Of The Triad is more of a new coat of paint on top of the original than a reboot, which is fine (except for those stupid hitscan enemies and first-person platforming segments) but Shadow Warrior has almost nothing in common with the old game except the name of the protagonist and sword-fighting.I want to say right away the sword-fighting is the best I've ever seen in a FPS. Most times I don't even bother with the sparse selection of guns because it's so much more satisfying to play with the game's simple combo system of pressing a directional key twice and then left or right mouse to use a sword attack or special move that knocks down or immobilizes enemies. Chaining together combinations will give you more points to use in a XP system for more moves, but will also make it more likely enemies will power-up themselves. It's a nice on the fly difficulty curve.The original game was notorious for being borderline racist thanks to the protagonist Lo Wang's broken English quips. That's been thankfully cut out and replaced with some genuinely funny back-and-forths between Lo and a mask-wearing demon who follows him. And even better, a reoccurring joke fans of a certain Monty Python movie will love.There is very little I can fault this game for – the shooting and sword-fighting is awesome, it looks nice, the difficulty feels just right, it's more violent than Peter Jackson's Dead Alive, it's hilarious, and there's a new game plus mode so you can max out Lo's skills and weapon upgrades.FPS of the year 2013 right here folks.

												I'll have to say, it is probably the best game I had the pleasure of playing this year.Graphics :As a whole, I can say that the graphics for this game were more than decent. Sure, they are not the best, but they make it up with style and gore. The way enemies blow up or get cut into pieces is so satisfying to watch that it never got old throughout my entire playthrough.I'll have to mention, that the cutscenes and animations were great and quite enjoyable. It is rare to see a ""comic book"" style cutscene done so well.Gameplay:This has to have been one of the most satisfying FPS experience I had in ages. The guns felt brutal and the swordplay is just amazing. The fact, that you can dismember your enemies in so many ways is quite joyful and gives style.Not only, this game has interesting weapons, but Ki powers which add quite a punch to the main character.Story:Although the story is quite simple, I did enjoy it. The characters are a blast and fun to watch talk, argue and taunt each others. Conclusion:This game is for anyone who wants a visceral FPS with alot of action and some somewhat raunchy humour. I truly wish, they will be more games like this in the next years.			"

												This game is... amazing. Really. The story is solid enough for what it's supposed to do, which is to give you an excuse to murder lots of stuff. Don't expect to get the likes of Bioshock Infinite in it's regards of story telling and plot twisting, it's the clear winner there. Where Shadow Warrior however is the clear winner is the gun and sword play. More specificly that both of it is perfectly viable. I used the fancy katana moves with it's combos about as much, if not even more than the guns in this game, because it's just so much damn fun to take apart your enemies with all kinds of sword slices. On top of that you also get some powers which allow you to heal or do a shockwave to push enemies back. If you are looking for a nice FPS experience and put gameplay before story, then get this game. Did I mention that the graphics are pretty goo too? So umm... yeah. If you want to shoot stuff to bits, get this.			"

Enemies are quick, tough, and painful. The enemies aren’t generic like the olden shooters. The demons in this game have multiple methods of death – Dealing with some is best if you shoot off specific limbs, others are best in melee range, and others are just best if you shoot them in the head.The best part is the melee combat – If you’re okay with double tap action combat, this game is a great Melee FPS. Oh if only Skyrim had the sword play as this game did. "

This game doesn't take itself seriously, and that allows it to work in  humor and satisfying gameplay that will likely have me missing important meetings and deadlines. Diologue is witty and precise, self referencial and bizzare. It may be said that the maps are generic (as are the enemies), but it's wrapped up smoothly with smooth and easy to use gameplay and controls that makes cutting through hordes of identical demons a thing of joy. I would recommend having a higher end computer (there's only so many blood particles a proccessor can handle), but the game is still functional with minimum  requirements. In short, the game has a few flaws, but with a little work it could easily become a classic, something our generation of games very badly needs. 8/10			"

												Shadow Warrior is a first person shooter/hack and slash game that places you in the shoes of Lo Wang who is a contractor for the mysterious organization ruled by Zilla.If you enjoyed games like Skyrim or Dark Messiah but are annoyed by fetch quests, and would much rather go out and dice demons apart using a katana and ancient spirtual powers, then this is the game for you!The shooting elements is very reminiscent of Doom 3 and other retro FPS's (back when you can carry all weapons instead of a primary and secondary) and while I acknowledge that as a good thing, the level design leaves much to be desire, due to it being very repetitive and to be honest, quite bland at times. The humor in this game is something definitely that should be made aware of, as it the kind of kick♥♥♥♥♥here and drop F-bomb here while I♥♥♥♥♥♥down your neck.

												This is what Duke Nukem forever should have been. Very impressive 3D engine but be aware, it is very hard on the GPU. My 7970 frequently was 95% gpu usage. The combat is really well balanced with the swordplay being a standout from the rest of the FPS crowd. Gameplay is mostly old school with tried and true tested method of hordes of enemies one after the other. The enviroments are filled with plenty of variety with things to shoot and explode with very impressive graphical effects. You are able to take down enemies limb by limb disabling them firstly before finishing them off.Even amongst the big budget titles of today it still looks visually impressive. Gun Mechanics are good as well with a good variety of weapons with multiple upgrades and modifications on offer.There is also the odd easter eggs to find which reminds you of the old shadow warrior game from 1997. Seasoned gamers will be impressed by this. Unlike Duke Nukem forever, Shadow Warrior is a funny game with humour that actually works. You have a tag along demon character who is always giving his input on situations. At first i thought this was going to become a chore but further into the game i realised how well it was working and was keen to hear his next remark.Highly recommended and took me by surprise.

And the classic mistake of giving you the coolest guns to enjoy for like a minute and it's done.

												Seriously, this is the best straight-up shooter I've played in years for a whole bunch of different reasons. First, the running and gunning is top notch. All the weapons are fun and useful, though none moreso than the Katana, which makes the large rooms of monsters a blast to get through. Never once was I dreading another encounter with a horde of enemies like my outings in Serious Sam. Even the most ridiculously hard fights were absurdly fun. With the variety of enemies to fight, weapons, and special abilities that you unlock... there's nothing here that feels tacked on and useless.As an added bonus, the writing in this is way better than a straight-forward shooter deserves and the game so much better for it. The dialog is self-aware and genuinely funny. I legitamately cared about Lo Wang, a man who seems to actually enjoy the fact that his name is a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥joke, and his wise-cracking and contemptuous demonic partner in crime, Hoji. Seriously, Shadow Warrior should be used as a case-study on how to do everything right with narrative design in an action game.An excellent ride, through and through and I cannot recommend this enough to any fan of old school FPS or just FPS in general.

												There was a lot of skepticism surrounding the news that 3D Realms' 1997 shooter Shadow Warrior would be re-imagined for 2013, not least because the original game faded into obscurity compared with other Build engine games and was really remembered only for its often tasteless humour. Happily, Polish developer Flying Wild Hog went back to the original and rather than slavishly remaking it, did a wonderful job in taking from it what worked and removing or radically re-imagining what didn't. The end result is a hectic, gorgeous-looking shooter in a classic style with just enough of a modern sensibility to make it feel fresh. The most crucial aspect of the game's success? It has what the classic '90s shooters had and what modern ones very rarely possess - personality.			"

												Don't look at the metascore for this one. This  is an old-school shooter with tight controls, satisfying gameplay, and a fantastic-looking environment. It's also full of crude humor and general oldschool machoness. Think Serious Sam or Duke Nukem, but with a lot more melee options. The gameplay is tight, you move fast, the enemies strafe and dodge your fire. The environments are detailed and feel realistic (as opposed to Seriouis Sam, where alleys look like football stadiums). The game is linear, but there are plenty of hidden gems and secrets to be found. It's also full of references to old school shooters.This game is gorgeous, even on low settings. But if you want higher fidelity you'd have to add a bit of heat to your graphics cards. Sometimes the enemies feel a bit repetitive or even bullet-spongey. The characters are maybe a bit too macho to be likeable, the same way that Bulletstorm's characters didn't really appeal to me.			"

Posted: January 8, 2015
												So I loved the original Shadow Warrior.  It had a different premise, being that not many other games took place in the Oriental world, and the humor was great.  So of course I wanted to play the new Shadow Warrior.  In a nutshell, it was fun, but lacking in certain elements.First off, the swordfighting is a blast, and will probably be your main means of attack.  Lo Wang carries a katana around at all times, and although you do get access to a few guns, they aren't nearly as useful as the sword.  Once you learn the Wing of Crane ability, there's almost no need to use the guns, since that ability gives you a ranged attack.  When wielding the katana, you can slice and dice your enemies into bits, and it's all strangely satisfying.  You can also throw shurikens, but there's no reason as they aren't accurate or powerful at all.As for the guns, you get access to a pistol, submachine guns, crossbow, shotgun, flamethrower, and rocket launcher.  None of them are particularly useful though.  In addition, there are iron sights, yet the game is too faced paced to properly use them, plus the iron sights aren't as accurate as you would think.  I normally turn off crosshairs when possible, but I found that the iron sights are typically set below the crosshair, so take my advice and just keep the crosshair on and skip the iron sights.The game's visuals are just amazing, and there's not much else to say to describe them.  The developers did an amazing job capturing the atmosphere and feel of the land.  In addition, enemies will split apart when attacked with the katana, and can be mutilated in different ways. As you play, you'll earn both money and karma.  Money is used to upgrade your guns or buy ammo, the latter of which I've never needed to do once.  Karma is used to earn special powers, and can be considered the XP of the game.  Every time you level up, you'll earn a karma point, which can be traded in for skills such as fire protection, more powerful Ki attacks, or faster healing rates.Speaking of Ki, there are a lot of different Ki moves available.  Some of them deal out major damage, and others are used as supportive abiltiies, such as the starting healing ki.  All Ki moves are done by double tapping a movement key and pressing a mouse button.  For example, to heal, you press D twice and then the special key.  To do the lunging stab Ki attack, you press W twice, then the left mouse button (or whatever button it is to do the primary attack).  These are simple enough to do, which adds to the simplicity of the sword fighting.My biggest complaint about the game is the lack of true humor.  The original DOS Shadow Warrior was littered with small one liners that made you chuckle a bit.  I understand that they tried to be ""politically correct"", but in doing so, ruined the comedy of the game.  Yes, fortune cookies are lying around, mainly just used for quick humor, and those are great, but Lo Wang lacks any of the one liners that made him ""famous"" in the original game.  When doing Ki attacks, sometimes he'll say something, but it's always the same line, not pulled from a pool of recorded dialog.  For example, when doing the Shockwave ability, Lo Wang will always say ""Pull my finger.""  It may be funny the first time, but that's it.  If you use that ability a lot, you'll be hearing that quite often.Overall, it's definitely worth a play.  The gameplay is solid and fun, and that's really what makes the game.  The story is fairly confusing at first (at least to me), but the ending scenes do tie everything up quite nicely.  I just wish there was a bit more of the old-school humor in the game. "

												Fast paced, arcade style shooter with a modern twist; upgradeable weapons, active skills and passive powers that you can customise throughout. Slapstick humour mixed with semi serious tones makes for a fun story if a bit grating towards the end. Sticks to the ""annoying enemy"" cliché of arcade shooters with shrieking teleporting katana women, large necromancers that summon enemies and then cast shields around themselves and berserkers who can only be damaged from the back. There are sequences when multiple enemy types are thrown at you, which can really test your patience, so be prepared for that. Finally the hit detection feels slightly off, particularly in the boss battles. Regardless, a good experience overall.			"

If youve done the campaign you still can hack-n-slash through everything in survival mode, how far can you get?I would rate this game 9/10 , again, it has great humor and the story line is great and again, it could be a litle longer, yes.I would say, BUY THIS GOD DAMM GAME!

												For fans of the older Doom-style shooters, Shadow Warrior will be a decent rush of nostalgic fun. The shooting is well done, with the action keeping a fast, flowing pace throughout. The weapons aren't as fun as some of the old style shooters, however, they're all fairly bland, with the katana being the most fun to use. The swordplay is surprisingly visceral, although you will sometimes slice through an enemy and almost nothing will happen, the enemies more often are either sliced to pieces, or react as if they had been hit by an actual sword. The story is coherent and interesting enough to keep the game together, but it's so tonally different from the gameplay that it often pushes you out of the experience. The two main characters do have a nice back-and-forth, with some of their dialogue actually making me laugh. The enemies however, get a bit repetitive, you fight the same 6 or 7 enemies during the entire game, and in the last few chapters, it finally gets a bit too repititive, and the combat stops being fun almost completely. The bosses are also fairly boring, Shadow Warrior doing the big impressive boss thing that telegraphs their attacks so far in advance you'd think they were trying to let you win, with the amount of health and ammo scattered around during these fights, they're just too easy. The ending is also a bit disappointing. TL;DR: A fun rush of slightly repetitive violence with an okay story and a couple of interesting characters.Edit: It's also fairly pretty.			"

												Shadow Warrior is a 3D hack-n-slash where you fend off thousands of demons while following blinking objectives. There is no mini-map, instead objectives are highlighted and blinking (doors & switches). The game has a few different difficulty settings. I played on casual and only died a couple of times due to gravity. The fights never seemed boring and I felt like I could still die if I wasn't careful. I can imagine some of the fights taking alot longer on a harder difficulty. Overall, the gameplay is solid, the story is fun, and the length of the game is good. I don't think I will be re-playing this title for a few months or so but I do feel like I will come back to it again in the future. If you can pick this game up on sale like I did, it will be totally worth it.			"

												Make Senpai notice you in this balls to the wall hack-and-slash shooter extravaganza. You will be feeling kawaii as ♥♥♥♥ after playing this game because let's face it, who the hell doesn't want to be a god damn samurai? Mormons, that's who. While the gunplay is fun, where the game really shines is its swordplay, which is extremely satisfying and probably stands alongside Metal Gear Rising in terms of great sword fighting games that provide sheer enjoyment. The dialogue is surprisingly hilarious and some of the funniest material I have heard in a game in ages, which is an awesome surprise that I wasn't expecting at all. As far as the protagonist, Lo Wang is probably the most badass asian since Wei Shen or Bruce Lee.In short, I would definitely recommend trying all the things seen in this game at home, because while I haven't myself, they look freaking amazing and a hell of a lot of fun.

												I'm not exactly sure how I feel about this game. There are many things I enjoyed about it, but it kept leaving me with a bad taste. I was initially surprised with how beautiful the graphics are, but the themes bored me very quickly for some reason. The combat is focused around your katana, which is fun at first, but too much melee will quickly give you a headache. The characters are funny, but they are given too few lines. The bigger story that they wanted to tell is pure garbage and completely failed to motivate me. The ending was predictable, but it still offered me no closure whatsoever. So, you kill every character that was even slightly developed, just to revive someone with no meaning whatsoever. Who is she again and why is she worth it? Something about rain? Was I supposed to care? I felt like the villain by the end. Characters looked at me with sad eyes as I was killing everything, hurting them while they did nothing to me, all of it over something I completely failed to understand. Shadow Warrior is original enough to stand out, and produced well enough to be good, but not great. You can play it, if you want a good fix of FPS. You're not going to make memories, though.			"

If you ever wanted to play as an asian dude named Lo Wang, collect statues, crystals, and pools of blood to upgrade your skill and powers while quartering every adversary you come into contact with on your quest for a sword, then this is for you.

It's really useful while in combat and there are no delay. Some skills are used off combat.The dialogue is OK, with some good humour and references.

												A game that does so many things right.1. Combat: Very very well done. The swordplay and gunplay are a blast and actually, sword is the most effective weapon in the game to be honest and really easy to use. The character movement feels fluid and you will not feel bored anytime soon slashing through the demon horde.2. Weapon design: Cool looking weapons and upgrades that you definitley want to buy. 3. Skill trees: Easy to understand and interesting to use skills4. Story: A nice story that gets you a little more involved in the game if the combat didn't already sucked you in5. Visuals: Fantastic AAA class visuals. Whether it is a wide open area with mountains or a house, one can't help but admire to the level of detail put into everythingI say buy this game. I will go further by saying that support this developer (Flying Wild Hog) by preordering their games and buying at full price. "

												Playtime: 16 Hours (includes secret hunting)Score: 7 / 10Recommended Price: $19.99A remake of the classic Shadow Warrior featuring still the character Lo Wang. It is easy to see that much effort went into blending modern and classic FPS styles. Medkits still litter the levels yet you have the ability to heal yourself at will with a Chi spell unlocked early in the game. Many people will remember the humour of the first game and it is still here, although at a toned down level. Much of the hilarious one liners and jokes are gone or purposefully changed to lower potentional insult certain people might feel and make vocal. Secret areas do exist and are done up in the classic Shadow Warrior pixel graphics. Areas from old levels and pixel-based girls await your discovery!Much of the combat focuses on the use of your sword, which I found to be a huge plus. There is an assortment of weapons as one would expect in classic FPS titles with three different upgrades each. Different Chi-based abilities help you fight your foes. Two skills knock down or suspend foes in the air, various katana abilities help you fight at range or slay foes in a circle around you. All in all I was highly impressed and surprised at how good the overall game was in both quality and length. If you can pick it up on sale for $19.99 or less it's definitely worth it!			"

												Now this game is pretty great dont get me wrong, the gun play is great, the sword play is phenominal (at first i thought the sword was going to be ""that melee weapon that you use when you have no ammo"" in these kind of games) but i find myself using the sword alot more so then even the guns (which i still think have a good feel to them especially the shotgun and crossbow). The problem with it though for me is some of the odd things in the game, like how there are a couple diffculty spikes in the game, and one of the sword attacks called Iron Circle (allows you to swing your sword in a circle, to kill the enemies around you) seems like it doesnt do enough damage to take down or even severaly damage the that surround you, leading you to do the attack again, just swing your sword wildly for a more direct approch, or take out your machine gun and spin in a circle instead. Overall, its a pretty good game despite all this, funny dialog by your protagonist Lo Wang, Music in the game is amazing and really brings you into the atmosphere of the game. Id give this game a 9/10.			"

												An absolutely fantastic game, a must-have for any FPS enthusiast. Shadow Warrior has it all: great graphics, awesome weapons, blood-pumping soundtrack, fast-paced action, hidden collectibles, one-liners, and a surprisingly good sense of humor. Even with the fast-paced combat, explosions, and the hail of bullets you'll be sending towards the enemy, that's not the best part. The best part of Shadow Warrior is the sword-play which combined with the supernatural powers you get is done surprisingly well. The game has great features such as a quick-slash, shuriken throwing, and consumable weapons like the demon head and heart. To keep things interesting, all weapons are upgradeable adn so are your powers. Even with all of the solid aspects of the game, it goes above and beyond with things that most games would have left out such as equippable skins for your sword, an ultra-hard final difficulty, new game plus, an arena mode, fortune cookies, and fully destructable bicycles.

												This is certainly the best fps ive played all of this year... and maybe ever. Ever since i saw Kill Bill i've wanted a video game where i could play out my katana massacre fantasy.., and here it is! But if that isnt enough (which it totally is) you also get tons of other kickass weaponry! The game does a far better job of being funny than the first one (its about 200x more clever) and Lo Wang is the most lovable and generally enjoyable character i've played in a LONG time. This deserves your money and you deserve it! PLAY THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥!!! 100000/10			"

												Shadow Warrior is awesome!  Its made by the same devs who made Hard Reset, so they did a similar upgrade to the classic 90's formula for the modern generation.  This game has the best melee combat I've seen in an FPS too.  It has a genius control scheme that seamlessly combines Guns, Katana, and Ki power combat, using fighting game-style button combos to perform various Ki powered katana attacks and stand alone Ki attacks that can be used in parallel with the katana or guns.  There is also a sophisticated, multifaceted upgrade system to really customize the way you want to play the game.I can't recommend this game enough, buy it now, especially while its still on sale!

												As much as I enjoyed the gunplay - shredding demons into bloody gibs is very satifying indeed I was totally frustrated by ridiculous hand-holding and invisible walls as well as inability to backtrack to explore. This is just infuriating.Pros:+ Really satisfying gunplay+ Somewhat funny one liners+ More or less not-a-bad story+ Graphics is also goodCons:- Inability to backtrack (doors are closed not only in front of you, but behind you. Doors you should be able to open, but for some reason you can't)- Invisible walls EVERYWHERE- Ridiculous skill spikes. I think the most hard battle was not a boss fight, but a fight with mere two Berserkers.- Finding secrets is not very satisfying as they are ""hidden"" in plain view. But you miss some of them because finding them sometimes implies checking where there is an Invisible wall and where there is not. It's just boring.- Complex system of skills/powers/upgrades is not very useful. I predict healing from Ki and katana strikes. Demons die faster just from WW-M1. Stamina is useful though. I have troubles with deciding what to pick for Kis and Karma beginning from chapters 7-8 because I equally DON'T need everything I don't have.- Same goes with weapons. I found the Shotty and Flamer to be quite redundant.All in all, it might be fine for someone who is looking for a shooty-blowy shooter and does not feel the urge to search every level through. If you like to rummage areas for loot I think you will be as much frustrated as I am right now.But at least it's not as bad as Duke Nukem Forever, so I guess that counts.			"

												Took me about 9 hours to beat this game on normal difficulty.Overall, this is now one of my favorite action games. It's like a fun version of Red Steel. It's also somewhat similar in feel to Bulletstorm (and others have made that comparison), but I found it to be more fun than Bulletstorm primarily due to the sword-based and fluid combat. It's fun-ness comes primarily from the responsive, fast-paced, empowering gameplay. You quickly discover, right from the start of the game, how powerful all of your attacks are against the scores of enemies you encounter (unlike other action games where enemies just soak up damage). Also, the way the sword works is very satisfying - I can't think of a more fun implementation of first-person melee combat. Combined with the cool powers, it makes for a very over-the-top, violent, but pleasantly challenging game. Also, you would normally expect an action game to skimp on the writing, voice acting, and overall story, but this game provides humorous and ocasionally thoughtful writing and voice work and presents an interesting and unique story.I definitely recommend this if you know you like action / FPS games. It's kind of a hybrid because you can use a sword and guns, but you'll probably end up enjoying it if you like either.			"

												After first playthrough on normal difficultyPros:- Story is funny while not being overly crude or juvenile (despite the number of♥♥♥♥♥♥jokes)- Charcterisation is good even if the characters aren't insanely deep- The plot is a good mix of both comedy and tragedy- Having the dash move really makes combat fun since you can dodge enemy melee attacks and get in and out of sword range really quickly- Game is fairly lengthy - my playthrough took nearly 12 hours and I didn't really stop to try and find secrets either. There is also a NG+ option.- Weapons are fun and upgrades enhance and transform the way they can be used- Runs really well- Some environments look greatCons:- Enemies repeat alot - there are about 6 or so main enemy types that get used throughout the whole game. You've seen pretty much every enemy by the 2/3 though mark and those enemies get thrown at you throughout the entire game.Towards the end they just take a bunch of the hardest enemies and put them in the arenas together and repeat them in waves so fights can end up feeling the same.- Maybe its just me but the constant arena after arena style of gameplay caused some pacing issues for me. You'll get out of a massive multi-wave fight and then you'll be in another one not very long after.- Finding keys and destroying colour coded shrines to open doors isn't really my bag - but alot aren't really hidden so you don't need effort to find them - so why have the plater search for them at all?- Bosses are few and far between and can be underwhelming. You basically shoot the weakpoint then shoot the weakppoint underneath the weakpoint.			"

Posted: January 7, 2014
												I'm surprised with how much I enjoyed Shadow Warrior. I knew that I would probably enjoy it because I love old-school styled first person shooters, but it surpassed my expectations. Don't get me wrong, it's not a masterpiece or anything more than your simple shooter, but it really is an expertly done return to the exploration and chaos of older FPS games.The gameplay consists of two main aspects, combat and exploration. The combat, like all old-school FPS games, is fast paced and chaotic. It throws a lot of enemies at you at the same time, which demands quick reflexes and projectile dodging. Lots of little things really make the combat work, like you move a bit faster than your average modern game hero and you aren't retricted to holding only two weapons at a time, you hold an arsenal of varied weapons by the end of the game. It's a nice change of pace from the combat of a lot of recent shooters, namely cover based shooting. Not that there is anything wrong with that style of combat, it's just fresh to return to circle-strafing and blasting away large hordes of monsters with a dozen different weapons. The katana in particular is a joy to use, as it dynamically cuts off the body parts that you sliced and is also relatively powerful; it's really the star of the combat in this game. Another thing that really makes the combat is the upgrade system. You have to save up three different resources to level up Lo Wang as you play: money, karma, and ki crystals which level up your weapons, skills, and powers respectively. These can really change the way that you can handle enemy encounters, like being able to use a slain demon's head to defeat more powerful foes or being able to use your katana from a distance with a light beam attack. At the end of each enemy encounter, you're given a score out of five based on how well you did in the fight. It gives you karma bonuses if you used a variety of attacks and weapons instead of just spamming the same attacks over and over. That alone, if you follow it, makes sure the combat doesn't get too old too quickly. The exploration in this game breaks up the combat nicely giving the game a nice roller-coaster like pace. After you defeat all the enemies in an area, you're encouraged to scour it for hidden secrets which will reward you with resources required to upgrade your powers, weapons or skills. The combat, levelling, and exploration and tie together perfectly to create very satisfying and fun gameplay.I was also surprised by the look of the game. While the graphics are not exceptionally good, the asian art style really helped the game stand out visually from others. Levels are filled with pagodas, candles, Buddha statues, bamboo, samurai armour displays, it really does look unique for a shooter. There are also a tonne of little details to notice throughout the game, like how enemies fall apart after you slice them up. Each chapter of the game also has a different look to it, keeping you from getting tired of looking at the same types of areas. The comic book cutscenes that divide each chapter of the game are also visually interesting, if a bit cliched at this point.The story of the game also surprised me in that it was actually interesting. Again, I'm not saying that it's fantastic, but for an old-school styled first person shooter, whose stories are usually given no thought at all, it was a welcome surprise. The real stand out writing-wise was the game's humour. Dialouge during the story bits is funny, albeit in a very immature way, and Lo Wang will spit out so-bad-they're-good one-liners during combat. The secrets can also be funny with a lot of references to the original Shadow Warrior.For all the good things I have to say about Shadow Warrior, there isn't much bad. I only have three real, but minor complaints. One, with the katana being so much fun to use, the guns seam very boring by comparison, but that's only because they really nailed the katana. Two, I played this game on the hardest difficutly and I only died a handful of times. Some more challenge would be appreciated, especially for an old-school shooter. Finally three, the levels are a bit linear for an old-school shooter, you won't find Duke Nukem 3D or Doom styled non-linearity level exploration here which I feel was a missed opportunity.However, you're supposed to judge things based on what they are and not what you want them to be. I really enjoyed playing Shadow Warrior and was surprised by how well it was done. Granted, I have not played the original Shadow Warrior at the time of me writing this, but regardless, as a stand alone game, Shadow Warrior is very much worth playing through if you liked fast paced, old-school action.

												I'm surprised with how much I enjoyed Shadow Warrior. I knew that I would probably enjoy it because I love old-school styled first person shooters, but it surpassed my expectations. Don't get me wrong, it's not a masterpiece or anything more than your simple shooter, but it really is an expertly done return to the exploration and chaos of older FPS games.The gameplay consists of two main aspects, combat and exploration. The combat, like all old-school FPS games, is fast paced and chaotic. It throws a lot of enemies at you at the same time, which demands quick reflexes and projectile dodging. Lots of little things really make the combat work, like you move a bit faster than your average modern game hero and you aren't retricted to holding only two weapons at a time, you hold an arsenal of varied weapons by the end of the game. It's a nice change of pace from the combat of a lot of recent shooters, namely cover based shooting. Not that there is anything wrong with that style of combat, it's just fresh to return to circle-strafing and blasting away large hordes of monsters with a dozen different weapons. The katana in particular is a joy to use, as it dynamically cuts off the body parts that you sliced and is also relatively powerful; it's really the star of the combat in this game. Another thing that really makes the combat is the upgrade system. You have to save up three different resources to level up Lo Wang as you play: money, karma, and ki crystals which level up your weapons, skills, and powers respectively. These can really change the way that you can handle enemy encounters, like being able to use a slain demon's head to defeat more powerful foes or being able to use your katana from a distance with a light beam attack. At the end of each enemy encounter, you're given a score out of five based on how well you did in the fight. It gives you karma bonuses if you used a variety of attacks and weapons instead of just spamming the same attacks over and over. That alone, if you follow it, makes sure the combat doesn't get too old too quickly. The exploration in this game breaks up the combat nicely giving the game a nice roller-coaster like pace. After you defeat all the enemies in an area, you're encouraged to scour it for hidden secrets which will reward you with resources required to upgrade your powers, weapons or skills. The combat, levelling, and exploration and tie together perfectly to create very satisfying and fun gameplay.I was also surprised by the look of the game. While the graphics are not exceptionally good, the asian art style really helped the game stand out visually from others. Levels are filled with pagodas, candles, Buddha statues, bamboo, samurai armour displays, it really does look unique for a shooter. There are also a tonne of little details to notice throughout the game, like how enemies fall apart after you slice them up. Each chapter of the game also has a different look to it, keeping you from getting tired of looking at the same types of areas. The comic book cutscenes that divide each chapter of the game are also visually interesting, if a bit cliched at this point.The story of the game also surprised me in that it was actually interesting. Again, I'm not saying that it's fantastic, but for an old-school styled first person shooter, whose stories are usually given no thought at all, it was a welcome surprise. The real stand out writing-wise was the game's humour. Dialouge during the story bits is funny, albeit in a very immature way, and Lo Wang will spit out so-bad-they're-good one-liners during combat. The secrets can also be funny with a lot of references to the original Shadow Warrior.For all the good things I have to say about Shadow Warrior, there isn't much bad. I only have three real, but minor complaints. One, with the katana being so much fun to use, the guns seam very boring by comparison, but that's only because they really nailed the katana. Two, I played this game on the hardest difficutly and I only died a handful of times. Some more challenge would be appreciated, especially for an old-school shooter. Finally three, the levels are a bit linear for an old-school shooter, you won't find Duke Nukem 3D or Doom styled non-linearity level exploration here which I feel was a missed opportunity.However, you're supposed to judge things based on what they are and not what you want them to be. I really enjoyed playing Shadow Warrior and was surprised by how well it was done. Granted, I have not played the original Shadow Warrior at the time of me writing this, but regardless, as a stand alone game, Shadow Warrior is very much worth playing through if you liked fast paced, old-school action.

												I'm really new to the Shadow Warrior genre and I just bought it during a steam sale.My first experience with the game and my take on it.+ Astoundingly beautiful graphics.+ Delicious gore.+ Very original and cool weapon designs.+ Lots of easter eggs, secrets and funny tidbits you can find when exploring the world around you.+ Very fast-paced combat, always keeps you on your toes.+ Wang.+ Very nice artwork and environmental effects. Everything around you is a freaking deathtrap if you're not careful.+ Very nice blend of horror, thriller, suspense and action.Now for the cons.- The head and weapon bobbing makes me a little nauseous. I wish there was an option to turn that off.- The lighting in some are blinding and frustrating to navigate to.- Some of the control schemes just don't make sense to me. Like the regeneration skill. Constantly pushing ""D"" makes you move while healing, which can be convenient at times but there are some cases where you don't want to go in the direction you're trying to heal yourself in.- Motion blur is going to make me sick. I'm normally used and accustomed to FPS games  but this one just makes me wanna puke after playing for hours for some reason, something that most FPS games do not induce on me.- The death count: Seriously, don't be like GTA or other games that reminds players how many times they messed up in the game. I'm a perfectionist so I had to delete my old save data just to start fresh and go for a no death run.- There are times where Wang is just trying too hard to be funny. The accent is a little bit thick for an asian too.- Lo Wang is not even a japanese name. I don't know Wang's backstory but when I started the game, I assumed he was Japanese. If so, disregard this.- Experienced my first death when I misread the health number and thought it read 12 when it actuallity, it was written as ""92"". I panicked and ran all over the place, got mobbed and died.Overall, my score for this game is an honest 8/10.Will try to shoot vending machine and dying again.			"

												What a fantastic game. Very fun and worth the money if you can grab it for <$20. I wouldn't recommend this game if you dislike the ""feel"" of something like Ninja Gaiden where you see pretty much every enemy you'll fight all game within the first half of the main story. It follows the convention of just throwing more of the same enemies at you instead of different enemies. I'm perfectly fine with that but I can see why it could make others pass it up. The last few chapters become incredibly drudging however. In one section you're forced to fight two very fast and very strong minibosses at once with a vision handicap, and then they do it again in the next chapter, and AGAIN in the chapter after that. Some parts can feel very cheap and some of the mechanics as well. I found myself constantly using the Wing of Crane move because it was so damn good, but I rarely ever used the Flux or Shockwave skills. Some of the guns are fantastically good like the crossbow, but others are absolute garbage like the pistol. Pretty much everything in this game is hit-and-miss, but most of the time the positives highly outweigh the negatives, most of the time.			"

												This game is very man's joy when you cut your enemies wide open and when the ground is painted red. The way the sword cuts is verry beatiful and the guns are just bring you joy when you explode an enemy. The powers are amazing and make you feel awsome. The characters and story are cool and intresting. The more you progress the cooler♥♥♥♥♥♥gets and you feel like you moved from home made weed to some high class herion (this is not encouraging drugs). The more you play, the less you stop. Overall, all the things this game did where great, and it only needs some minor changes like a minimap or a better way to break up the action besides trying to find oblesiks. If you love swords, guns, magic, and lots, lots of corny jokes then this is the game for you.			"

												I don't get it... Why do you waste your time on reading this ""review""? Instead you should buy this game right now and experience it for yourself. No seriously! Stop reading! Buy it, play it and enjoy it! NOW!This game is freakin' awesome!Ok... since you're already here, I'm tellin' ya why reading this is a waste of time, when you could already start playing one of the finest games developed in 2013 (or was it 2014? well who cares...?).It's a good old run-and-gun-(and-hack-and-slay)-shooter, that doesn't want you cowering behind some kind of convenient placed barrier, from where you can calmly shoot your enemies one by one. Instead you're forced to stay in motion. Otherwise the enemie's projectiles will kill you faster than a dive into a volcano... You're slicing thousands of demons with your Katana, u're nailing them to the wall with ur crossbow (Painkiller and F.E.A.R. send their regards), u're burning them with your flame thrower until they scream in agony and then you blow'em to pieces with ur 4-barreled shotgun (it has 4 barrels after u've upgraded it (which you should)). It's bloody and gory and soooo rewarding and satisfying in doing so. In addition to this u gain some magic powers. For example you'll be able to let your foes float defenseless in the air for a very few seconds, so you can shoot them like they were some kind of ""meat pinatas"" as LoWang states, when u're using this power.The story is maybe a little convuluted but nevertheless very interesting. It's also presented in a very beautiful way: while the present (which is appearantly the late eighties or early nineties) is shown directly in ingame cutscenes (95% from your point of view), the backstory is presented in some kind of 3D cartoon. It's a very fine crafted single player (only) shooter that'll keep you longer on your toes, than those average 5-hour-hogwash-pseudo-military-shooters... It took me roughly 20 hours to complete the campaign (the first time).The only thing I regret, is the fact, that I bought it when it was on sale. I didn't want to pay the full price for a remake of a nineties game after I had to suffer through travesties like DNF. Flying Wild Hog deserves better though. I would have been happier, if I would have paid the full price. Gearbox should take note on how to make proper old school games.Now buy the game already!			"

												Without any doubt, Shadow Warrior, is a great reimagining of the old classic. The game is brutal in many ways, with one-liners reminding us of Duke Nukem. It’s a bit repetitive and some variation wouldn’t kill the mood. Overall it is a amazing game with a lot of blood and a great fighting system; good times and a cheap price. Fun gun/swordplay and fast paced action with exploration elements. Upgradeable weapons and sliceable enemies. Looking forward to more games from this developer.			"

												The intro is just plain awesome. Seriously, even if you don't play the game it's worth watching. The sense of humor seen in the intro pervades the entire game, although somewhat sparsely.  That brings me to my main issue with this game, which is something that Bioshock Infinite struggled with as well - having combat sequences occur far too frequently and last far too long. The gameplay involving sword fighting and combat in general are great, but the endless waves of enemies quickly grow tiring. The good parts of the game would shine much more if only the combat was cut down a bit.The story has a strong hook in the beginning but I eventually found myself not caring much after running around on a wild goose chase. So in retrospect I really should have just played the first hour or two and stopped there.			"

												This game is awesome. In a world of burly white dudes with voices that sound like they swallowed a comb, an asian protagonist with a voice that isn't as gravelly as chain smoking cocaine addict os ertainly welcome. That is of course not the original intent of the game and indeed not what makes it good. What makes it good is colorful environments, good level design, and amazing combat. The swordplay joyous, that's the only word to do it justice. It is just as important, if not more important, than the gunplay and is incredibly satisfying. The gunplay is well varied with all upgrades being very useful and having a visual effect on the weapon. All in all, the developer did an amazing job with this, and deserves all of your money.			"

												As a hardcore gamer (albeit one who was not permitted to play the 1997 original by his parents), I was very pleasantly surprised by this game.   The story is a little incoherent at first, but becomes interesting through the inclusion of an unique companion character (who has a lot of smart♥♥♥♥♥comments to make) and carries you all the way through.  There are a string of solid ""Wang"" jokes scattered throughout, and as I understand it, the modern Lo Wang is nothing like the potty-mouth of the 90's.If you had asked me beforehand, I never would have figured that the combat system in Shadow Warrior would be fun to use and interesting--typically, sword/magic/gun games are all kinds of awkward, forcing the gamer to default to gunplay as he or she suffers their way through the game, chasing the next bit of dialog.  Not the case here.  All three aspects of combat have a place, especially as the difficulty level is cranked, and it'll teach even the most experienced gamers a few new tricks about crowd control and resource management.  When things really start to click, the game rewards the player with a great feeling of being devastatingly powerful--a great carrot to chase, and something few developers do well.Highly recommend--ignore the Metacritic score and give this a shot.  If you make it through the intro where the game basically drop-kicks you into its irreverent take on a generic Asian mythology story about a sword, you'll love the next 15 hours or so.			"

												General Overview: If you hated Borderlands or Borderlands 2 because of its off color humor you will hate Shadow Warrior as the humor is beyond Borderlands - but if you can tolerate or even enjoy slightly immature and grin and bear it humor, then this game is a great one to play. Well written dialogue, a decent story, solid shooting, well done sound, incredible graphics and smooth game play make this a shooter that is worthy of the Shadow Warrior name as a reboot and if you like shooters this is one you should pick up.TL;DNR: 8.5: A humorous over the top shooter, tons of loot, hidden secrets, decent story, great action and solid game play with beautiful graphics make this a shooter for those with a sense of humor and desire for lots of combat. Sound is great, soundtrack is fitting and there is never a dull moment.Technology/engine: 9: super smooth execution although a number of loading screens that are placed in such a way as to not be annoying and keeps the graphical fidelity high and controls responsive.AI: 8: Serviceable but a bit predictable but when the individual AIs of the mobs get mixed it gets intense and is enjoyable.Graphics: 10: Gorgeous sets, great character models, wonderful animations, great cut scenes and great use of 2D cut scenes for memories. Flying Hog deserves high marks for the graphics used in this game.Sound: 8: Sound effects are well done but occasional source to reception issues can be found in the game that prevent you from spotting the source at a longer distance. Otherwise its a solid ambient soundscape that creates immersion and adds to the game.Soundtrack: 9: Great music throughout, I especially liked the unnerving heavy metal on the appearance of the black rabbit - one of the funniest and weirdly frightening moments that was totally unexpected in the game.Voice acting: 9: Solid cheesy delivery and poignant when needed or appropriate.Crafting: N/ACustomization: 9: Customization includes various powers, skills and weapon customization all of which are rewarding and make a difference in the game.Game play systems: 9: Really well mixed variety of weapons and abilities and the game scales with a difficulty spike if you are just ripping through. A number of the fights almost feel unfair until you find a technique to deal with the situation and the tools are always there.Controls: 8: Slightly awkward controls that are occasionally unresponsive or do something other than what was intended - ie D-D-RMB is supposed to heal you but will occasionally perform the RMB function of the weapon - which can kill you of course. Perhaps when it comes out for consoles it will function better (although I hate to play shooters on console - prefer mouse and keyboard). Other than that it functions well.Story: 9: I was surprised at the quality of the story, the great use of humor and the still poignant tale that is weaved into over the top violence and silliness that really, somehow, works well.Multiplayer: N/A			"

You barely have to use anything else if you don't want to.-almost all of my deaths were from falling off of things. Not only insta-death pits, but even stuff like dashing down small staircases will often kill you. Really frustrating to have to restart off of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like that, and the devs plain out said it's not a bug and they won't fix it.-storyline leaves a lot of loose ends. I guess if you play the original it kind of ties it together though.-Bosses were kind of lackluster and same-y. Shoot glowing points until weakpoint is revealed, then shoot weakpoint. Circle strafe while doing so. The spectacle made up for the gameplay with the bosses to an extent.Overall it's a lot of fun, but watch out for those stairs.			"

												This shooter has a cool setting and balanced feeling mechanics (including a fun melee system). Pick it up if you are after something a bit more old school.A pretty game with smart level design and mechanics. Flying Wild Hog have clearly learnt from Hard Reset, this time doing away with the flaky weapon system and adding some cool melee and spellcasting mechanics to add some variety. The awesome (but lighthearted) setting really adds a lot to the game, and improves a lot upon the dark and boring generic not-really-cyberpunk sci-fi theme from Hard Reset. Some talented artists have been given an opportunity to flex their muscles here, with some truly spectacular art (especially in the first level).The melee and spell based combat system is nice, despite some strange key combinations needed to access them. The ability to heal means the game doesn't leave you stuck without enough health if you've missed a few health packs, but can remove some of the tension from combat. The melee system is nice and fits in well with the guns. You learn new moves as you progress, so tedium is avoided. But it can make guns feel less useful.Levels can still feel very boxed in and limited compared to games like Serious Sam, and many of the secrets tend to be pretty boring. The guns can lack the authentic feel and kick you might be familiar with.But otherwise, Shadow Warrior is a good effort at making more of an old school feeling FPS, with skill based, bombastic combat making up for most of the failings.

												I never played the original Build engine game of Shadow Warrior, but this is what Duke Nukem Forever should have been - an awesome reboot bringing back the gameplay values of its era powered by a modern engine.The implementation is a little like the Serious Sam series, but don't let that put you off if, like me, you're not a fan. It's a series of semi-technical combat 'arenas' in which you need to choose your weapons and tactics carefully so as not to be overwhelmed, joined together by explore-and-lewt sections, but Shadow Warrior seems to pull it all together a lot better than other games of the same ilk. The story is.. just ok.. for the majority of the game, but it rounds it out and sets the mood well enough to make it feel as though you have a purpose beyond go-there-kill-everything-repeat.Not that that would be a big problem - the combat is immensely satisfying, with the game offering a large variety of ways to blow up, burn, electrify, perforate, and slice and dice the reasonably varied set of lesser and greater demons that you'll run into. You always have a few options on how to tackle a given situation, and throughout the game you'll be upgrading your sword skills, Chi powers, and less-up-close-and-personal weaponry to increase them.The game also features a few boss battles which, although a little samey, make for a nice change of pace from the frantic melee of the rest of the game.Hard difficulty recommended if you're a regular fps player - the difficulty paces pretty well, and by the time you're hitting the stiffer challenges of the later levels you should be good enough to whoop them if you've invested a bit of time in hunting down some of the secret xp-stashes that are lying about. Learn the special moves and make sure you've got your dodge key bound and you'll be kicking demon backside.TLDR; had a blast - play this if you like to chop things up with a sword while listening to corny 'wang' jokes.LO WANG / 10			"

												Frustrating enemies and length undermine what could have been a short and sweet retro-nostalgia-ride.  Takes the best of old-school shooters with a dash of light rpg (namely experience and progression).  However, this game overstayed its welcome by a good 8+ hours.   By the end of it, I was praying for it to be the last level... for the last 1/4 of the game, actually.I did play on insanity difficulty.  On this difficulty, bosses can be very tedious and time consuming.  Taking nearly 30 minutes to bring some of them down.  If it weren't for quick-save, I'd likely have thrown my computer through the wall. Swordplay is ok.  Since the game overstayed its welcome, it began to feel pretty stale and by the numbers towards the end.  Similarly, the story and tone were novel at first, but the inside-jokes and juvenile humor couldn't stay fresh all the way to the end.If the charging demons were tweaked so they couldn't turn on a dime or follow you forever (these were probably the most frustrating enemies I've dealt with in a videogame in years).  And boss fights were more engaging.  And the overall length of the campaign reduced by about 20%... then this would be a near pitch perfect throw-back game! 5.5/10 "

												This game is just ridiculously damn fun. Take a pseudo-ninja, a katana, a bunch of fire weapons, lot of humor and throw all this into a mixer along with brainless demons and you will have Shadow Of Warrior.The game is all about torning demons into pieces by any means with spectacular graphical effects.This FPS feels like the old, classic PC shooters: gameplay is fast, frenetic and ""act-now-or-die!"" genre. Infact, if played at highest difficulty, you will have a hard time remaining alive while facing hordes of demons.To help your slaughter you will find weapons of any sort and also will develop a set of skills that will aid you in combat: unique looking katana special moves that tear apart all the stupid demons surrounding you, generate wave of energy that spread from your blade and kills from distance, powerful blows that overcomes any protection and some defensive skills too, like healing and a ki-energy shield.The skills are a lot and during the course of the game you will have to make choices because you don't have enough ability points to take them all.The graphics is good and deep-customizable but some of the uber effects are really heavy on the GPU and CPU, so in the most populated encounters the framerate fluctuate a bit too much.Overall is a fantastic fun game that's worth buying and playing, especially if you can grab it while on-sale!

Spouting one-liners that could make even the Duke himself cringe, he hacks his way through 17 gratuitously gory levels of fun.9/10			"

												Thsi is the first time in a while i feel tempted to write a review for a game that surprised me. I bought it at a sale and thought i'd try it. My expectations were low - i thought it would be a nice hack and slash to play when i just had time to play for half an hour. It is that - but also a lot more.First of all - the level design is beautiful. It is made with a lot of clichè in mind, but still - the temples and foreign landscapes are breathtaking. The story is not too brilliant but also has some nice twists and the neatly embedded memory sequences are a piece of art. Last of all the fights are nicely done, with a focus on speed and the knowledge of when to use what attack.The only thing to critise for me would be its repititiveness. For a few sections it just feels like you are doing the same thing over and over again. Also there is just one way, it would have been nice to offer at least two ways sometimes or even desicions in the storyline.I'd rate this 8/10, hope this helps!			"

												I bought this for $20 about a month ago, and now that I've played it, I'd have been willing to pay more.Finding secrets the way that shooters used to have them is quite fun, and it has the most entertaining melee system since Dark Messiah of Might and Magic. While melee is clearly the weapon of choice, eventually, guns become not only viable, but rather fun, once you get their more ridiculous upgrades like a quad barrel shotgun and exploding crossbow bolts, but for the large part you will be making like Butcher Pete and hacking enemies to pieces, even the sub-bosses.

												I pretty much got what I expected with this title - good old school PC FPS, and lots of it!The developers seemingly didn't wanna leave any boxes unchecked, and went all-in with powers (double tab a direction keys and press LMB or RMB), skills (permanent stat upgrade like more max health) and upgradeable weapons. Each category has its own resource - Money, KI crystals and karma. Lots of stuff is borrowed from other titles, but all things good imo. This is a lot like the ""Darksiders"" of FPS'es - a compilation of everthing that has proven to work in other titles.The basic FPS mechanics feel fairly solid and rewarding, but there's a certain undefinable something missing. I don't know if it's the visual/sonic feedback from hitting your target that's a bit ""off"" - but it simply didn't feel as tight as I've come to expect from the best FPS'es. I did experience some annoyances with the physics - dash while running down a flight of stairs and you just instantly die, and terrain climbing is awfully unintuitive - luckily you hardly have to do any, unless you're searching for secrets.The presentation is a hit and miss - The narration/dialogue is witty, and the voice acting fairly good. The sound effects decent, but some of the weapon sounds lacked personality. My biggest gripe was with the graphics - the textures and 3d models were at times pretty lackluster. Fortunately the graphics engine is feature rich, and with all the bells and whistles acivated, you essentially apply enough makeup to make it all seem passable. But whoever drew and layered the 2d comic book style ""cutscenes"" absolutely nailed it - suberb stuff!Sadly the 3d engine performs somewhat poorly, and the latest WHQL nvidia drivers didn't even have a working SLI profile for this game, so I spent the first couple of hours with very poor framerates until I learned that it was fixed in the latest beta drivers. Stuff like this really has to be sorted at release date.I spent 12 hours on the SP campaign which is the longest I can remember in a FPS, and even though there were some recycled parts, I enjoyed the entire game a great deal. If anything the first couple of hours was the least fun, as you hardly have any weapons or skills. Not that you REALLY need the weapons anyways, as the Katana melee weapon with it's shuriken partner is plenty powerful for most of what the game has to throw at you (too powerful perhaps).My verdict is 80%			"

												For $3.90 on the Steam Sale, I think this game was worth it.PROS1. StoryWhile the game is pretty linear, the story near the end was pretty good. I won't spoil it.2. Interesting conceptsDemon heart kills were interesting. Sadly, demon heads were just weak laser beams, even with upgrades.3. Katana fightingRather than a First Person Shooter, it's more a First Person Slasher. It's refreshing to slash, instead of shoot. This is probably the most fun part.4. Upgrade system3 parts : Skills (Karma), Powers (Ki Points), Weapons (Money). Slightly redundant to divide skills and powers since they are almost the same thing. However, Weapons were interesting. You change how you use the weapons with the upgrades e.g. Crossbow has 2 upgrades, one for a piercing shot and one for an explosive bolt.CONS1. RepetitionYou will face the same monster hordes over and over again. It is most boring. The developers simply created a zone and spawned more monsters of increasing numbers and difficulty in each zone.Worst, you can fight in the exact same location you came from earlier.The bosses are also killed in the exact same pattern e.g. Run in a circle, collect items, damage weak point, rinse repeat.2. WeaponsThe rocket launcher is extremely clunky. Your submachine gun will be the most useful weapon. Flamethrowers have a minimum range problem where you can't burn someone standing next to him.3. Death by stairsYou cannot sprint jump off the middle of 3 steps as you will die. The game somehow detects you crashing into the floor at super speed.4. Generic trash creaturesThe yakuza, slasher and skeleton will all attack you the same way. They just look different. While you have a large variety of creatures ranging from the Warlord, Necromancer, Charger, Teleporting Sword Witch, Mother Demon, etc etc. Killing them in the exact same way really makes it boring. It does not help that you fight them multiple times over and over again.I use WW+Left Click, with the life steal upgrade, a lot and it kills EVERYTHING, except air units and bosses.5. Nobitsura KageYou only get to use the super slash power of the Nobitsura Kage in 1 level.6. Complicated Ki StrikesWW+Left Click/Right Click are easy and fast. All the other spells have delays in casting animation which prevent you from moving. The directional aspect of the spells ensure you can't use certain spells for offense e.g. SS+Right Click only works when you are running away.7. NPCsOddly, there are a pair of twins that are introduced that you never need to fight.8. Quest ObjectiveThe game uses golden doors to show you where to go. However, for some very large stages, the golden door is very hard to find. It would be better if they had a map since you can only progress through ONE DOOR.9. ZoomHow the hell do you zoom with X?

												Shadow Warrior is bold reimagining of 3D Realms cult classic shooter with same name. Blending the viciously over-the-top gunplay of its predecessor with the elegant precision of the powerful katana, Shadow Warrior is an imaginative take on the classic arcade style shooter. Plenty of action, plenty of humor, plenty of flying meat of deamons you will kill on yourr way. And couple humans but who cares. Secrets, women, big enemies, bosses and epic Ki powers.			"

												Best FPS I've played in a long time. There is no multiplayer, but the campaign is stellar. Plays like an FPS from late 90's-early 2000's, but with modern functions (sprinting, leveling/character building, etc). Combat is phenomenal - between your katana, ki powers, pistol, SMG(s), crossbow, shotgun, flamethrower, rocket launcher, and demon bits (yes, you use pieces of demon as weapons. yes, it's as awesome as it sounds), combat is varied and exciting. There are probably an infinite number of ways you can approach any fight. The swordplay is pretty great - the lack of a parry  is a slight downer, but the ki powers make up for it. The dialogue is drop-dead hilarious. Lo Wang's one-liners never get old, and the constant banter is what really gives this game its personality (IMO). The story might be linear with not too many surprises, but if you can get by that and take this game for what it is (a throwback to late 90's shooters) you will enjoy yourself.This is my first review ever, and until now I hadn't planned on writing one ever. Even at 10 hours (mine went a little longer after a bunch of avoidable deaths) for a playthrough, if I never played it again I think it's worth your money (or more, if you catch on a 75% off sale like I did).

												How did I miss this game when it came out?Shadow Warrior is great action fun, plenty of well hidden secrets, really well hidden, and upgradeable weapons and powers.I feel there is a much more entertaining second playthrough ahead once you have seen all the options and how the upgrades play out, as well as getting the hang of figuring out were the hidden areas are...so far I'm hitting around 50%.The story is bonkers and mostly told via some nicely drawn cutscenes, but dont let that get in the way of kicking all sorts of♥♥♥♥♥once you come out in the next level.  Action is similar to that other Flying Wild Hog shooter Hard Reset (also featuring animated story cutscenes now I think about it) and involves destructible environments which really adds to the chaos and pain to be inflicted on your victims.  Gather Money, Ki crystals and Karma to buy more upgrades to your arsenal and let ripThe tone of the game is quite humorous and there are many jokes and puns scattered throughout, and the art style is quite lovely too making playing through the non action areas as entertaining as the killing bits.Often going cheap, you just have time to blast through it before the sequel hits and everyone is talking about the next big thing Shadow Warrior 2Get some Wang today.

												Shadow Warrior is a very good shooter with a bit of buts.I honestly recommend playing this game to every fan of FPS games. It's fun, it's wild, it's well made. It has great humor and some dirty jokes and innuendo thrown in. We have 9 weapons, some with consierable different alternative fire mode. Overall mood of the game is mysterious and full of chineee (?) demons, ancient magic, some weird artifacts and a bit of Yakuza or other Asian mafia group. If you like games that follow the spirit of Duke Nukem 3D, classic Shadow Warrior or Serious Sam First and Second Encounter then go for it! You should not be disappointed.That was at least the short version. A bit longer and more detailed text will follow. This game has some weak spots. Lets do standard Pros & Cons.Pros:- explosive gameplay - yup, really a lot of things in this game explode- great and juicy graphics- early level design as well as well as demon world design - small town looks as it should - claustrophobic; cementary looks creepy and mysterious with all of those candles; demon world reminds somewhat worlds from Zeno Clash games. Also winter levels look good.- good looking chinese demons- badass protagonist, nice sidekick - maybe not as fun as Mad Max's Chumbucket but Hoji is still memorable- lots of guns and alternative fire modes - katana & shurikens, revolver, smg, crossbow, shotgun, flamer, missile launcher, demon heart and demon head- three separate ways to upgrade hero - you buy weapon upgrades for money, spells for ki crystals and skills (that gives some bonuses like +10 to Health Points) for Karma points that you get for killing demons and finding chalice secrets- sword fighting and spellcasting works very well- when killing demons in special way you get more points like in arcade games - when you kill a demon with a rocket you get a DETONATOR bonus, when you behead him you get HEADSHOT or BEHEADED depending on weapons used- humor is really fun, fast and sometimes references good old classic games- speaking of good old classic games - this game has a lot of GREAT and FUN secrets. You can see Godzilla in the background on some levels, you can find pixel rooms just as in the Shadow Warrior 3D so on, so forth. Oh, just to give you a taste of ingenious humor - one of the main bad guys is called Zilla and he wants to become a god. Just add those words. Ring any bell?Cons:- although the first 5-6 hours into the game are brilliant, the rest are just somewhat dull. Somewhere during play I just felt that I am slashing or shooting the same enemies over and over and over (yada yada) again. Later levels are long. Not just long but loooooooong. Winter levels can take as long as 1 hour to finish each. - whole game takes about 12 hours to beat. Although this seems fine for a shooter, it's about 2-3 hours too long. Most of the original ideas become familiar after playing for about 6 hours and there is not much more original content later.- boss fights are prolonged. I am not bickering about this one. Just compare Serious Sam bosses to this game bosses. Big Aludran reptile was challenging and the whole fight was rewarding. In Shadow Warrior after beating those big armors I felt tired. Especially second windged armor was tedious and took too long to beat. - no point in playing this game for the second time - when we have seen those levels the only thing that remain is slashing demons over and over again. If you like maxing out your characters then that's fine but that may take some time in this game.- after getting the final weapon and buying some upgrades we can see that some of weapons are not really useful. I think that the best gun for wiping weaker demons is shotgun. SMG is a bit weak, although useful when fighting bosses. Revolver is fine for flying demons as it kills them with one shot. Katana is fine. Crossbow is the weapon that you will use for most of the time as it is somewhat powerful and I recommend buying exploding bolts upgrade as fast as possible. Missile launcher is powerful but slow. Flamer is well, slow and not really that powerful imo. Alternative fire modes are fun but not really useful except revolver, shotgun and crossbow ones.- fights are fine when there are small packs of demons but battles tend to drag on when there are more enemies. You need to hack and slash through every one in order to progress to some ares. That's just tiring. As tiring as grinding in mmo. This is why I recommend boosting your shotgun with upgrades because shotgun in this game is one shot = one kill when it comes to weaker enemies.Phew, that was long. Don't hesitate after reading my Cons. These are my free thoughts on this game. Overall this a great game.

We can change it to e.g. Serious Sam 3 sledgehammer or Saint's Row♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ It does not change weapon 1 characteristics, only visuals. Yeah, that means you can slash with a hammer.

												A reimagining of a classic that surpassed every expectation.I’m not a huge fan of shooter games but it would be a lie to say that I don’t enjoy a good shootout every now and then but what  I do most of the times is that I get a game, shoot my way through it while trying to do as much as I can in that one playthrough, and once I beat it I rarely go back to it ever. It was nothing like that with this one.Shadow Warrior takes a step forward by backtracking quite a lot when it comes to FPS gameplay, making it feel rather retro by arming you with 10 different weapons all equipped with primary and secondary fire (some even have 3 ways to use them), which is not as popular approach to FPS today as it used to be, and I don’t know about you but I personally don’t  give a s*it about it not being realistic, it’s a game it is meant to be fun, not real. First they limit your weapon carrying capacity under the excuse of “making it realistic” and before you know it, we have games where you have to pay taxes because that’s also realistic… Oh wait, that’s already happening… Never mind, back to the game review. HP loss being permanent (unless you heal yourself) also contributes to the retro-ish FSP play but it still keeps up with the modern fast paced + tactical feel with it’s moderate tactical approach to battle situations. It’s quite a visionary reimagining of the old title and a true modern day successor in every aspect.I’ll keep this on short because despite all the minor things that set this one apart from the other titles in the genre, it’s still mainly a FPS with some minor trait based character development, weapon upgrade system and gameplay that really feels like a successor of the old FPS games like Doom, Duke and the original Shadow Warrior. I guess if I had to compare it I would say that this one is kind of like the first BioShock game with a dominant samurai theme and cheesy jokes that, no matter how much you find them not to be funny, after some time, the Wang will get to you and you will have no choice but to chuckle at them. So, do I recommend it? Absolutely. For everyone, this title is so likable and enjoyable that you can play it no matter what kind of gamer you are. Casuals and obsessed hardcore challenge seekers will enjoy it equally. 70 hours of gameplay on a linear single player only FPS is more than enough to describe how much I liked this one. So yeah, it’s a yes, definitely a YES and I can’t wait for the sequel for I absolutely am left wanting more Wang!			"

Many secrets need discovering too and that should keep you busy for a while as well, i see myself having fun with this game for quite some time to come.In Short, Great Game, i was already sold as soon as i saw ""Shadow Warrior"", But if you needed help or convincing if this is a good buy or not, dont be worried, It also has just as many good jokes as the first all beit much less racist.Buy It, NOW :)			"

												I suggest you play the demo first. Otherwise you will find a superb twitch FPS here. Also, don't buy Hard Reset/Redux, it will feel too much of the same. There are many positives, like a somewhat funny main character, very good gunplay/swordplay, and huge boss fights reminiscentof Painkiller. My only negative is that the game has some path finding issues, recycled enemies, and some really tough levels. The single player campaign is long, but I actually thought it was unnecessary long, as the remaining hours felt like a bit of slodge. On sale, it's not a bad way to waste some time, while you ponder buying the newest Doom game.			"

												I bought this game 2 years ago, I thought that this ""would be a pale piece of defecated material when compared to the nostalgia of the original (like duke nukem 3d and duke nukem forever)""...How wrong i was...This game is eternally fun.If you are new to the FPS genre, or if you are looking to get your children a fun birthday present, this game is it.It is easy to get yourself drowning in the story of Evil vs. Lo Wang.Without further Rearkissing, I shall now present to you all, the Pros and Cons. Pros Great story. 9/10Ok sword manuevering . 7/10Amazing replayability. 9.99999999999999999999/10 (basically 10/10)amazing refrences. 10/10Arsenal for the ages (other FPS games should take a hint and copy the upgrading system). 8.5/10Graphics are pretty damn good. Subjective scoring ( this one is just my opinion )Fortune cookies are hilarius. ""i'm sorry your fortune is in another cookie""- A fortune cookie from shadow warrior. Cons Music is non-exeistant. ( a good song to listen to is Dividing by Zero/Slim pickins does the right thing and rides the bomb to hell when playing Shadow Warrior)Horridly linear gameplay.Spots where if you dash you die... instantly (usually when you go retro or where there are secrets).In conclusion, Shadow Warrior is a game I'd reccomend to all.I've included links to all of the things i've listed for refrence.Dividing By Zero/Slim Pickens Does The Right Thing And Rides The Bomb To Hell

												Don't trust the published paid reviewers!  This game is a gem - one that shouldn't be overlooked.  Now, would I pay $50 for it?  Nah.  But it is regularly out there for $20 or less, and at that price IT IS A MUST PLAY.   The games lines are cheesy, the graphics are great, and the bad guys die by the dozens at a time by the blinding blood-spatted slasshed of your sword.  What's not to love?  The plot starts off light and vapid and evolves into a very complicated and mature one.  The closeout of the stroyline was one of the best I've seen in any game.  Folks, its the real deal.  Someone told me there are guns in the game, but I wouldn't know it - seeing arms and legs flying off their hosts in slow-mo is all I ever needed!  Mess with the bull, and you'll get the Wang.  Play.  This.  Game.			"

												Excellent game with exceptionally fun melee. The voice acting and story are surprisingly good enough to hold your attention and the graphics as well as the sceneries are varied and detailed so as to not become dull.The game lasts much longer than I would have expected, about 15 hours or so but is fully worth it. Decapitating enemies with a pink♥♥♥♥♥♥♥has its quirks as well. The guns aren't too powerful so as to force you to use your sword but the bosses are impossible to kill without them so it's a good idea to familiarize with each of them.The normal difficulty shouldn't pose much of a challenge as I have only died by falling off platforms rather than in battle but the two difficulty levels above are suffient to pose a challenge to those who seek it.  The jokes are hilarious.It is ill advised to kill rabbits if you value your life.			"

												This game.... THIS GAME! I can't tell how much I like this game. :) Where should I start... oh yes, It's amazing! It combines old school game experience with mature story, funny characters with good development, nice graphics and mainly sword fighting. You will learn to love the Katana so much that you will want all other games to have one also. This game has so many different elements that are so well put together that I cannot believe that the developers were able to put it all together in such good fashion. It's fast paced, original mayhem. And it also has RPG elements! You can upgrade skills, demonic powers and weapons at the same time. Combat is fluid and katana combos are easy to learn along with the powers. It's also really long for a FPS. It will take you about 12 hous to finish the game, even more on harder dificulties and even more if you will want to find all the secrets. And it has GREAT ending to the story. The music is also pretty good... No really, what are you waiting for, go buy it. You will not regret it.			"

												This game is good. Very good. Honestly, as of late, i've become increasingly bored of first person shooters, too much of the same thing. two weapons, regenerating health, drab brown setting, it's overdone, and just feels... bad. Shadow Warrior is a throwback to classic FPS, and as a remake of a old-school FPS, I guess I expected that, but what I didn't expect by this game was to be completely blown away. The game never feels old, the combat feels so rewarding and substantial, with each sword blow and shotgun shell feeling great. The pacing is fantastic, the levels fun and unique, and the story also, while at first sounding pretty cheesy, turns out to be really interesting.My favorite part of this game, however, is the boss battles. Oh yes, this FPS has boss battles, and by god are they fantastic. The towering bosses you take on are incredible, and the otherwordly enviroments you fight them in are stunning. The fights are challenging, fun, and jaw-droppingly beautiful.Flying Wild Hog did a fantastic job with Shadow Warrior, and I am beyond impressed9/10			"

												Having played the original Shadow Warrior nearly some twenty years ago (damn, I just made myself feel old), I can say that I was both looking forward to and kinda fearing a series reboot since they tend to go one of two ways: an improvement or a waste of time. And I'm happy to say, this reboot was a MAJOR improvement in every way.Shadow Warrior kept to its defining roots; you play as Lo Wang and you fight demons with an assortment of fun weapons while cracking jokes, including poking fun at the original when you come across secret areas using the old, old, old graphics.For me, story is what made this a top-rated FPS (maybe my favourite). An interwoven tale of gods and demons with practical and emotionally-driven decisions provides motivation far beyond 'they're bad for the sake of being bad, so I should go shoot them'. And the buddy-cop relation Lo Wang shares with Hoji kept me laughing and, better yet, uncertain how things would end.Graphically, they didn't go for the super-duper-high-end which is always fine with me, but it's still pretty good and the enemeis and scenery were nicely varied (gotta love them coy ponds and cherry trees).The audio was decent with a soundtrack I found worth the special edition upgrade.Game-play harkens back to the old-school FPS of (eventually) packing 10guns at all times and secret areas everywhere but also adds in a few puzzles and an upgrade system for the weapons, your skills, and your magic so you can fight your way.So even if you don't have a connection to the original Shadow Warrior, this is a great game for anyone who is a fan of story-based shooters.Also, here's hoping Strife and CyberMage receive similar treatment some day.

												I pretty much got what I expected with this title - good old school PC FPS, and lots of it!The developers seemingly didn't wanna leave any boxes unchecked, and went all-in with powers (double tab a direction keys and press LMB or RMB), skills (permanent stat upgrade like more max health) and upgradeable weapons. Each category has its own resource - Money, KI crystals and karma. Lots of stuff is borrowed from other titles, but all things good imo. This is a lot like the ""Darksiders"" of FPS'es - a compilation of everthing that has proven to work in other titles.The basic FPS mechanics feel fairly solid and rewarding, but there's a certain undefinable something missing. I don't know if it's the visual/sonic feedback from hitting your target that's a bit ""off"" - but it simply didn't feel as tight as I've come to expect from the best FPS'es. I did experience some annoyances with the physics - dash while running down a flight of stairs and you just instantly die, and terrain climbing is awfully unintuitive - luckily you hardly have to do any, unless you're searching for secrets.The presentation is a hit and miss - The narration/dialogue is witty, and the voice acting fairly good. The sound effects decent, but some of the weapon sounds lacked personality. My biggest gripe was with the graphics - the textures and 3d models were at times pretty lackluster. Fortunately the graphics engine is feature rich, and with all the bells and whistles acivated, you essentially apply enough makeup to make it all seem passable. But whoever drew and layered the 2d comic book style ""cutscenes"" absolutely nailed it - suberb stuff!Sadly the 3d engine performs somewhat poorly, and the latest WHQL nvidia drivers didn't even have a working SLI profile for this game, so I spent the first couple of hours with very poor framerates until I learned that it was fixed in the latest beta drivers. Stuff like this really has to be sorted at release date.I spent 12 hours on the SP campaign which is the longest I can remember in a FPS, and even though there were some recycled parts, I enjoyed the entire game a great deal. If anything the first couple of hours was the least fun, as you hardly have any weapons or skills. Not that you REALLY need the weapons anyways, as the Katana melee weapon with it's shuriken partner is plenty powerful for most of what the game has to throw at you (too powerful perhaps).My verdict is 80%			"

												For $3.90 on the Steam Sale, I think this game was worth it.PROS1. StoryWhile the game is pretty linear, the story near the end was pretty good. I won't spoil it.2. Interesting conceptsDemon heart kills were interesting. Sadly, demon heads were just weak laser beams, even with upgrades.3. Katana fightingRather than a First Person Shooter, it's more a First Person Slasher. It's refreshing to slash, instead of shoot. This is probably the most fun part.4. Upgrade system3 parts : Skills (Karma), Powers (Ki Points), Weapons (Money). Slightly redundant to divide skills and powers since they are almost the same thing. However, Weapons were interesting. You change how you use the weapons with the upgrades e.g. Crossbow has 2 upgrades, one for a piercing shot and one for an explosive bolt.CONS1. RepetitionYou will face the same monster hordes over and over again. It is most boring. The developers simply created a zone and spawned more monsters of increasing numbers and difficulty in each zone.Worst, you can fight in the exact same location you came from earlier.The bosses are also killed in the exact same pattern e.g. Run in a circle, collect items, damage weak point, rinse repeat.2. WeaponsThe rocket launcher is extremely clunky. Your submachine gun will be the most useful weapon. Flamethrowers have a minimum range problem where you can't burn someone standing next to him.3. Death by stairsYou cannot sprint jump off the middle of 3 steps as you will die. The game somehow detects you crashing into the floor at super speed.4. Generic trash creaturesThe yakuza, slasher and skeleton will all attack you the same way. They just look different. While you have a large variety of creatures ranging from the Warlord, Necromancer, Charger, Teleporting Sword Witch, Mother Demon, etc etc. Killing them in the exact same way really makes it boring. It does not help that you fight them multiple times over and over again.I use WW+Left Click, with the life steal upgrade, a lot and it kills EVERYTHING, except air units and bosses.5. Nobitsura KageYou only get to use the super slash power of the Nobitsura Kage in 1 level.6. Complicated Ki StrikesWW+Left Click/Right Click are easy and fast. All the other spells have delays in casting animation which prevent you from moving. The directional aspect of the spells ensure you can't use certain spells for offense e.g. SS+Right Click only works when you are running away.7. NPCsOddly, there are a pair of twins that are introduced that you never need to fight.8. Quest ObjectiveThe game uses golden doors to show you where to go. However, for some very large stages, the golden door is very hard to find. It would be better if they had a map since you can only progress through ONE DOOR.9. ZoomHow the hell do you zoom with X?

												Ridiculous, gorey, perverted, juvenile, and ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.This game is a hack and slash masterpiece of insanity.You play as a very steriotyped asian man named ""Wang"" who is essentially fighting evil blah blah blah, it's ridiculous. You will definitely have a ton of fun playing this game if you enjoy hack and slash rogue style games. The story is actually relatively engaging as well. A bit repetitive, but hey, that's a hack and slash for you.I would definitely recommend buying this, but not at full price. I think $40 is stupidly excessive, wait till it's on sale or in a humble bundle.			"

												This great re-imagening of the 1997 classic is what Duke Nukem Forever should of been. Shadow Warrior is simple and fun to play with nice visuals and smooth gameplay, story is not the strangest part, but acceptable for an FPS, the comedy is not to bad either. The one thing I wished for was more weapons and more enemy variety, other then that, Shadow Warrior is downright fun to play as bad♥♥♥♥♥smart mouthed Lo Wang! If you are interested in playing  and see a great discount, go ahead and play this game!			"

												Great game. Good fun combat and very robust upgrade system, but the story alone is worth it. It has a good ending that brings closure but also gives you something to think about. Shadow Warrior is a tale of sacrifice and tragedy; it is about the price of ambition and ramifications of forbidden feelings. What does it mean to be alive? The Ancients' memories can reveal all to you. Shadow Warrior pulls a rabbit out of the hat and the game makes it fly beautifully.One of the best games I have played this year. Think about things from the POV of the demons and every characters in the game when you finish it. I won't spoil anything. When you do that, in addition to all your insights, answer me this:Did anyone, including Lo Wang, really had any choice in the game? Think about your fun when you slice demons open too.Maybe it doesn't have the same delivery style, but Shadow Warrior plot has some theme in Dark Souls.			"

												The folks that made Painkiller, Bulletstorm and Hard Reset get together and make the most fun I've had with a sword in a video game? Truly surprising. A B-list retro franchise that was a slightly fun Duke riff with Asian stereotype flavor gets an update that is more fun, more explosive, and less offensive than its forebear. This is what Duke Nukem Forever should have been.The viscera is hilarious, the limb-explosions frequent, and the dance of all the crazy slash/dodge/shoot violence ascends to actual balletic grace. You will feel like a badass. You will laugh out loud. You will kill demons by ripping out the still-beating heart of their comrade and squishing it in their faces. Then they explode. This game wants to be fun, and it is. If only more games understood that. Buy this and remind yourself that shooters can still be adrenaline-fueled stress-relief of the highest, most perfect order.The boss battles are sh*t, though. I guess you can't have everything.			"

												Well i must admit i was late to this but hell this game is amazing if you are even remotely interested in linear FPS and have no problem with gore you should stop reding this and buy the game NOW!The gameplay is simply perfect probably the best i've experinced in a FPS the controls are also very intuitive and tight (keep in mind this game is meant to be played with keyboard and mouse), the graphics and effects are gorgeous and also light on your GPU (my aged and close to retirement GTX 550 Ti can run this on ultra perfectly smooth), the story, the atmosphere, the seetings, the dialogues lines, hell even the UI arts feel exactly as they should be and blend eachother perfectly to create one (if not the one) more inspired linear FPS i've ever seen. This game is totally worth the full price but for the current winter sale prince is a ♥♥♥♥ing STEAL! Still reading?! Go buy this already one best value you may get for your money!			"

												Shadow Warrior is a reboot/prequel of the obscure 1997 shooter developed by 3D realms (creators of the legendary Duke Nukem.) The reboot was developed by Flying Wild Hog and published by Devolver Digital. After playing the original game along side the two expansion packs I was eager to get my hands on the reboot once it was announced on May 10, 2013 the trailer showed promise and looked like what a reboot should be. Once I finally purchased and started playing I was introduced to our main hero and one-liner zinger Lo Wang an assassin who works for the powerful Japanese industrial magnate, Orochi Zilla. He is sent to a mission to purchase an ancient katana from a collector named Mizayaki for 2 million dollars. Mizayaki refuses the offer and Lo Wang tries to take the sword by force which takes a horrible turn for the worse. ""Let's see... briefcase full of cash... blade... million dollar smile... ready for school, ma!"" This game has a soild presentation and reinstated the hopes I had for the game. The story does do its job right with interesting, funny and downright awesome characters, and the plot keeps you engaged thoughout.Gameplay wise it is almost flawless, old school with exploration for secrets in well designed levels and run and gun combat with modern elements and amazing sword fighting. Gunplay is soild and fun with great toys to play with against anything that bleeds although I would have liked to see abit more weapons and some more returning guns like the riot gun (a gatling shotgun) from the original game. Sword play really stands out and is really satisfying with full control of different swings to hack and slash any foe that dare crosses you alongside with special chi moves to bend reality to your will, you can also upgrade guns, skills and power to create more havok. There are some problem with the game unfortunately the maps can be a wee repatative, the guns are way to underpowered with the katana killing enemies with ease and the later demons can be way too annoying on the hardest difficulties.Visually the game is stunning and alot of work has been done to make the game look jaw dropping there are some low quality textures even on highest settings and some cutscenes animations look terrible but they get a pass due to being rare. On launch this game was brutal to run but thanks to a recent patch it did help abit however it is still very terribly unoptimized which is unacceptable for a PC launch games, a huge bummer that ruins the experience. The game is out on Windows and with the recent patch Mac OSX and Linux is now supported. Music, sound and voice acting are pretty good aswell with a kickass soundtrack, witty and hilarious voicework and writing and satisfying sounds this game has a good amount of polish but could have been a little better.  Overall Shadow Warrior has to been one of my favourite shooters of all time and if your even slightly curious do play it I 100% recommend it. Packed with tons of content I have not completed still and you can even play the original free on Steam. ""Do you want cake or death? I should mention that we are all out of cake.""			"

												This game is full of dumb Wang jokes, has a confusing supernatural plot, and some grating voice acting. Who cares about that, though. This is a game about unleashing the wrath of Wang on demon hoards. Let there be Wang jokes.Some of the best first-person swordplay I've seen in a game. It's just a blast to slice up bad dudes and demons into pulpy giblets. If you don't like swords, there are plenty of guns at hand. You can't go wrong. Lots of secrets to find, and useful skills (self heal, sweet sword maneuvers, etc.) to level up.It's mindless fun and you should play it.			"

												I was suspicious at first, could they recapture the charm of the original while also making it a bit more acceptable for the time (i.e. not hideously racist)? Hard Reset was a good game and all but it wasn't funny, and it started getting a bit tedious towards the end. So, how did this one end up?They wanged it up. It's perfect. The gameplay is great, the character, though different, is just as great as the original, and it's, simply put, a fun game to play. There's not really much else to say, I'd recommend this whole-heartedly, it's up there with the classics.			"

I didn't look at any guides etc. before starting or playing, just went to options and put sword controls (?) to advanced (?) and now I'm swinging my katana very happily!Speaking of katanas, one random (or was it?) event occurred which made me fall in love.I was cutting down demons, with a small grin on my face, suddenly I see two little bunnies making little bunnies. Without second thought, I grabbed my katana and swung those poor little bunnies heads off. Surprised after metal music started playing and poor little bunny had gained some demonic powers and was attacking me lika a maniac!

												Excellent game with exceptionally fun melee. The voice acting and story are surprisingly good enough to hold your attention and the graphics as well as the sceneries are varied and detailed so as to not become dull.The game lasts much longer than I would have expected, about 15 hours or so but is fully worth it. Decapitating enemies with a pink♥♥♥♥♥♥♥has its quirks as well. The guns aren't too powerful so as to force you to use your sword but the bosses are impossible to kill without them so it's a good idea to familiarize with each of them.The normal difficulty shouldn't pose much of a challenge as I have only died by falling off platforms rather than in battle but the two difficulty levels above are suffient to pose a challenge to those who seek it.  The jokes are hilarious.It is ill advised to kill rabbits if you value your life.			"

												An amazing game, with lots of humor. Nice story, and good graphics. Awesome boss battles. Nice soundtrack. Fun weapons. I love the katana, a bit change from the same old fps games. It really works nice with sword fighting in first person in this game. I completed in 12 hours, but I was rushing thru, for a propper gameplay, I would say 20 hours.			"

												Holy wang, this game is unbelievably fun! I tried the demo first and immediatly fell in love with it. The story is interesting and captivating, at least in part because the character Lo Wang is so easy to ""identify with"" as a nerd trying to be a hero. The controls are also very streamlined and simple, while still having a lot of fun tricks you can master with playing around. The game feels a lot like bioshock minus the deep suspense.All in all I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed playing through the bioshock series and is looking for a fun game to spend a lot of quality time with.

												A great way to describe this game, very simply, is with the word 'fun'. It's a blast. Gorgeous visuals, especially the lighting effects and a nice variety in level appearance. Great variety of weapons, which look and feel good to use. Plenty of upgrades, giving you lots of freedom to choose to how you want to power up. Lots of content, tons of secrets and amusing hidden easter eggs to find. P.S. DO NOT KILL THE MATING BUNNIES OR IF YOU DO MAKE SURE TO KILL THEM AT THE SAME TIME, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED			"

This game is incredible. Except chapter 13, you will see (it's terrible). Aside from that chapter, It is very well made and I would strongly reccomend it.			"

												This is a no-spoiler review.Pros: -AMAZING gameplay. Think Quake or Doom type combat, but with some additions (i.e. katana moves and special powers). If you haven't played those games, then think about what Call of Duty or Battlefield would feel like with more than two weapons.-Nice weapons. Each one (except the pistol) feels powerful and has good sound effects. -Fair difficulty. The game gets really tough, but it never felt unfair. Near the end of the game, it gets REALLY difficult. But there isn't a single enemy in the game that takes advantage of you. Every enemy has a predictable moving/shooting pattern. It's literally your skill vs the game designers. -Nice graphics. Good shaders and textures used.-Good optimization. I don't have the best PC in the world but this game runs like a beast.Cons:-The unoptimized karma system (which involves being innovative with killing enemies) doesn't always reward creativity. For example, I might decide to kill a certain enemy using a certain weapon, but it isn't the best and the game doesn't recognize that I did something unusual. -Monotonous environments. The graphics are really good, but after a while, you end up seeing the same house or lab over and over again. -Terrible boss fights. Almost every review mentions this; the boss fights suck. But don't let this keep you from enjoying this amazing game!Summary:8/10. There are better AAA games on Steam, but after you play those, you HAVE to play this.			"

												I've really enjoyed my time with this. I find it astonishing that more people didn't snap it up during the last sale! The game is a wonderfully up-to-date dose of oldschool shooter goodness - the guns are excessive, the action is frantic, the gore is intense and IT. IS. GLORIOUS. :D The dialogue is wonderfully cheesy, as are the in game jokes, but it's all part of the charm, think Onimusha meets Duke Nukem - Oriental sensibilities and setting/daemonology with a ridiculously over the top protagonist who is in on the fact that the game is out to be fun. I highly recommend this, great for long time FPS fans and newcomers too!A--Legion			"

Until the demonic hordes of Shintoism unleash their giants and demigods to eviscerate you and burn you to a crisp with laser eyes.Very difficult, very fun, very worthwhile.

												I've got wang of steel.Here's the real review. I'm in the 10th chapter and I feel comfortable enough to write my review for it.Pros- A good return to the classic singleplayer FPS that was popular in the 90s-early 2000s. but polished to the point where it feels Modern.- Great melee system, it's fun to slice up demons with your katana and other powers you'll get throughout the game.- Funny. I've laughed a decent amount while playing this, Lo wang is a great protaiganist and still feels like the Chinese Duke nukem from the original shadow warrior.- GORE. Tons of it.- It looks great. - Rewards you for exploration. There are a decent amount of secrets in every level, rewarding the curious type.Cons.- Isn't really optimized for low end systems, but I can manage a solid 30fps when exploring, but you will take a giant dive of FPS when you're in a battle.- Combat can get a bit repetitive, but there is a good amount of exploration in these levels that you can take a break from if you want.I would reccomend this at full price, but I personally would wait for it to go down to 15$ or lower.

												This game is great.I don't know if you can justify $40 for it, but I picked it up on sale because of the funny trailer.  Like every other steam sale game, it sat in my library untouched for 6 months, until I saw it while bored and installed it.  It's brilliant, it really is.  It's a throwback to old school gaming, taking elements from quake, doom and duke nukem.  Fast paced action orientated combat is completely stale today, but this game absolutely nailed it.  The story was surprisingly interesting, and I found myself really powering through the game to find out what happened, but it also had a good amount of comedy mixed in.  But not too much to ruin the plot of the game, very well done.If this game is on sale, get it, definitely.  A friend said to me that it's a 'game that you play in between other games when you are bored and alone.'  I disagree.  It's one of the better games i've played in a while, I haven't enjoyed a playthrough like that in a long time.			"

												Basically, this is one of the best ""retro-modern"" games out there (a retro style shooter with modern graphics).  It's an attempt to bring the fun of games like Doom or Duke Nukem 3D into the modern age.  Frankly, I'll always like that style of FPS versus the more modern types with limited weapons and complicated cover systems.A special not about the best weapon in the game, the katana.  If you're one of these people who goes through a game crowbarring or wrenching everyone to save ammo, you'll love this game's treatment of the katana, probably the best melee weapon I've seen in this type of  FPS, they really put a lot of thought into it.  I'll note, however, there is also a good selection of upgradable firearms and special weapons, and plenty of ammo for them.Also, the environments are very pretty and colorful, mostly.  This may seem like not a big deal, but I find it helps differentiate this game from a lot of modern FPSs.I find the main characters (the hero gets a ghostly sidekick) to be very appealing.  He's funny and tough.  The ghostly sidekick is appropriately sarcastic.Well, for me this was pretty much a must buy, so I highly recommend it.			"

												Great game. Good fun combat and very robust upgrade system, but the story alone is worth it. It has a good ending that brings closure but also gives you something to think about. Shadow Warrior is a tale of sacrifice and tragedy; it is about the price of ambition and ramifications of forbidden feelings. What does it mean to be alive? The Ancients' memories can reveal all to you. Shadow Warrior pulls a rabbit out of the hat and the game makes it fly beautifully.One of the best games I have played this year. Think about things from the POV of the demons and every characters in the game when you finish it. I won't spoil anything. When you do that, in addition to all your insights, answer me this:Did anyone, including Lo Wang, really had any choice in the game? Think about your fun when you slice demons open too.Maybe it doesn't have the same delivery style, but Shadow Warrior plot has some theme in Dark Souls.			"

Hard Reset was a good game and all but it wasn't funny, and it started getting a bit tedious towards the end. So, how did this one end up?They wanged it up. It's perfect. The gameplay is great, the character, though different, is just as great as the original, and it's, simply put, a fun game to play. There's not really much else to say, I'd recommend this whole-heartedly, it's up there with the classics.			"

The characters and story are cool and intresting. The more you progress the cooler♥♥♥♥♥♥gets and you feel like you moved from home made weed to some high class herion (this is not encouraging drugs). The more you play, the less you stop. Overall, all the things this game did where great, and it only needs some minor changes like a minimap or a better way to break up the action besides trying to find oblesiks. If you love swords, guns, magic, and lots, lots of corny jokes then this is the game for you.			"

												This is a sweet FPS game.Pros-Tons of weapon/magic variety- big horde enemy fights- decent enemy variety- sense of humor- Lots of Easter eggs and secrets.- Storyline is interestingCons-sword and magic combo is almost too good. You barely have to use anything else if you don't want to.-almost all of my deaths were from falling off of things. Not only insta-death pits, but even stuff like dashing down small staircases will often kill you. Really frustrating to have to restart off of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like that, and the devs plain out said it's not a bug and they won't fix it.-storyline leaves a lot of loose ends. I guess if you play the original it kind of ties it together though.-Bosses were kind of lackluster and same-y. Shoot glowing points until weakpoint is revealed, then shoot weakpoint. Circle strafe while doing so. The spectacle made up for the gameplay with the bosses to an extent.Overall it's a lot of fun, but watch out for those stairs.			"

												Do you enjoy martial arts games?  Are you a fan of yakuza/gangster films?  Would you like to take on an army of demons and their human servants armed with nothing more than your sword and your sarcasm?""Who wants Lo Wang?""Great action game.  You're a low-level gangster, trying to buy a sword for your boss.  Problem is, dude won't sell.  He knows your boss is working for some demons.  Doesn't want them to destroy the world or whatever.  So you gotta ""convince"" him.  Yeah, you're a thug.  But you're good with a sword and you're funny as hell.As the game progresses, you start to question whether you're on the right side of things.  Eventually the thug evolves into the hero.  Or something like that.  Quit reading reviews and just get the game already!  It's not that expensive, is it?			"

												This shooter has a cool setting and balanced feeling mechanics (including a fun melee system). Pick it up if you are after something a bit more old school.A pretty game with smart level design and mechanics. Flying Wild Hog have clearly learnt from Hard Reset, this time doing away with the flaky weapon system and adding some cool melee and spellcasting mechanics to add some variety. The awesome (but lighthearted) setting really adds a lot to the game, and improves a lot upon the dark and boring generic not-really-cyberpunk sci-fi theme from Hard Reset. Some talented artists have been given an opportunity to flex their muscles here, with some truly spectacular art (especially in the first level).The melee and spell based combat system is nice, despite some strange key combinations needed to access them. The ability to heal means the game doesn't leave you stuck without enough health if you've missed a few health packs, but can remove some of the tension from combat. The melee system is nice and fits in well with the guns. You learn new moves as you progress, so tedium is avoided. But it can make guns feel less useful.Levels can still feel very boxed in and limited compared to games like Serious Sam, and many of the secrets tend to be pretty boring. The guns can lack the authentic feel and kick you might be familiar with.But otherwise, Shadow Warrior is a good effort at making more of an old school feeling FPS, with skill based, bombastic combat making up for most of the failings.

												I never played the original Build engine game of Shadow Warrior, but this is what Duke Nukem Forever should have been - an awesome reboot bringing back the gameplay values of its era powered by a modern engine.The implementation is a little like the Serious Sam series, but don't let that put you off if, like me, you're not a fan. It's a series of semi-technical combat 'arenas' in which you need to choose your weapons and tactics carefully so as not to be overwhelmed, joined together by explore-and-lewt sections, but Shadow Warrior seems to pull it all together a lot better than other games of the same ilk. The story is.. just ok.. for the majority of the game, but it rounds it out and sets the mood well enough to make it feel as though you have a purpose beyond go-there-kill-everything-repeat.Not that that would be a big problem - the combat is immensely satisfying, with the game offering a large variety of ways to blow up, burn, electrify, perforate, and slice and dice the reasonably varied set of lesser and greater demons that you'll run into. You always have a few options on how to tackle a given situation, and throughout the game you'll be upgrading your sword skills, Chi powers, and less-up-close-and-personal weaponry to increase them.The game also features a few boss battles which, although a little samey, make for a nice change of pace from the frantic melee of the rest of the game.Hard difficulty recommended if you're a regular fps player - the difficulty paces pretty well, and by the time you're hitting the stiffer challenges of the later levels you should be good enough to whoop them if you've invested a bit of time in hunting down some of the secret xp-stashes that are lying about. Learn the special moves and make sure you've got your dodge key bound and you'll be kicking demon backside.TLDR; had a blast - play this if you like to chop things up with a sword while listening to corny 'wang' jokes.LO WANG / 10			"

Campaign is in chapters, and there are lots of Weapons, Upgrades, Abilities and Secrets to find and unlock.The chemistry between the two main characters is absolutely hilarious.The graphics are beautiful, and I wish they would have had more daytime areas (but this game goes over the course of a couple of days)Where there's a will there's a Wang.

I didn't look at any guides etc. before starting or playing, just went to options and put sword controls (?) to advanced (?) and now I'm swinging my katana very happily!Speaking of katanas, one random (or was it?) event occurred which made me fall in love.I was cutting down demons, with a small grin on my face, suddenly I see two little bunnies making little bunnies. Without second thought, I grabbed my katana and swung those poor little bunnies heads off. Surprised after metal music started playing and poor little bunny had gained some demonic powers and was attacking me lika a maniac! Heh where the heck do these people get these ideas :DI feel a bit bad that I haven't bought this earlier with bigger price tag (not really since I'm such a cheap♥♥♥♥♥mfo).9/10Good humorGood action			"

												I have only played this game for a small amount of time but I feel the need to review it already because it amazes me at how such a simple concept of a game can leave me fulfilled after playing. This is a classic guns-blazing fighting game (similar to Serious Sam) where it's everyone else vs you because your character is the only one that knows how to get stuff done apparently. I guess it makes sence that I like it because I enjoyed some of their previous titles.Great game, would highly recommend.			"

												What a tremendous game, I can't wait to play the second one!At first I didn't find the game so interesting. It looked pretty simple and I didn't like the setup. Demons looked silly and I couldn't do much with my skills. However, as I progressed into the game I came across harder opponents, a surprisingly interesting story and a rich and fun gameplay.I really enjoyed playing with the katana, which was my favourite weapon during most of the game, except for the very first levels. Furthermore, what I liked the most was the possibility to customise my character with certain skills and weapon improvements.Really, if you like SP FPS games you should totally give this one a try.

												I've got wang of steel.Here's the real review. I'm in the 10th chapter and I feel comfortable enough to write my review for it.Pros- A good return to the classic singleplayer FPS that was popular in the 90s-early 2000s. but polished to the point where it feels Modern.- Great melee system, it's fun to slice up demons with your katana and other powers you'll get throughout the game.- Funny. I've laughed a decent amount while playing this, Lo wang is a great protaiganist and still feels like the Chinese Duke nukem from the original shadow warrior.- GORE. Tons of it.- It looks great. - Rewards you for exploration. There are a decent amount of secrets in every level, rewarding the curious type.Cons.- Isn't really optimized for low end systems, but I can manage a solid 30fps when exploring, but you will take a giant dive of FPS when you're in a battle.- Combat can get a bit repetitive, but there is a good amount of exploration in these levels that you can take a break from if you want.I would reccomend this at full price, but I personally would wait for it to go down to 15$ or lower.

												This is probably one of the goriest games i've played ina while but i mean that in a good way. You play Lo Wang who is sent byhis boss to retrieve a sword called the Nobitsura Kage but it turns out it's not a normal sword and then Wang finds himself fighting demons who are invading the world. I really enjoyed this game at first. It gives you a samurai sword and some guns and lets you hack,slash and shoot up enemies in a very gory fashion and has you do so in a funny over-the-top kind of way. However once that initial enjoyment wore off the game started to feel a bit dragged out and the combat became repetetive.To be fair they did try to make the combat a bit varied with the ability to unlock different attacks and powers as well as a variety   of weapons but the game just boils down to you entering an area, the game throws a load of enemies at you, you kill them and travel through the level a bit more and then repeat. This really makes playing the game a chore after a while as it just feels like your doing the same thing over and over again. I did like the frantic pace off the combat though and it does provide a good challenge as well as being visually gory which people may like or not.The games levels look pretty good in general although there is a bit of lazy level design at times with certain areas looking like they have been copy and pasted in from earlier. In the beginning there doesn't seem to be much of a story and as the game continues it's a bit hard to follow but it does pick up going into the final third of the game and ends quite well. The Good:- Enjoyable combat with the ability to upgrade and unlock weapons and powers and rewarding damage to enemies like cutting off heads and limbs.- I liked the humour in this game and the back and forths between Wang and his accomplice Hoji are enjoyable.- Visually the game looks pretty good with some of the earlier levels in particular looking quite nice.The Bad:- Combat sections get repetetive after a while and at times it just feels like a chore when the game is constantly throwing wave after wave of enemies after you.- The game feels a bit dragged out with the middle part of the game feeling unneccesarily long.- I found the hit detection was a bit poor at times which can be irritating at times.SummaryThis is a pretty decent game although it has it's flaws.  It's a 6.5/10 from me.			"

Subjective scoring ( this one is just my opinion )Fortune cookies are hilarius. ""i'm sorry your fortune is in another cookie""- A fortune cookie from shadow warrior. Cons Music is non-exeistant. ( a good song to listen to is Dividing by Zero/Slim pickins does the right thing and rides the bomb to hell when playing Shadow Warrior)Horridly linear gameplay.Spots where if you dash you die... instantly (usually when you go retro or where there are secrets).In conclusion, Shadow Warrior is a game I'd reccomend to all.I've included links to all of the things i've listed for refrence.Dividing By Zero/Slim Pickens Does The Right Thing And Rides The Bomb To Hell

												A solid FPS overall, with some drawbacks in design that keep it from really shining:- The Special Ki Moves are activiated by tapping a direction twice and holding a fire button. These seem to arbitrarily not work and will get you killed pretty often if you're using them in the heat of battle.- Several enemy types seem designed to take up time with Shields or other game mechanics that make them a chore to kill.- Weapon selection is a bit lacking. The starter pistol/SMG will take you through a good hunk of the game.While these are annoying, none of these keep Shadow Warrior from being a good game, just one that's not quite as good as it could've been.If it's on sale, buy it. Full Price, stay away.			"

												I bought this game as a daily deal and said, eh, fps hack and slash? might be fun. worth every penny. Lo Wang is like a funny asian version of Duke Nukem, with sappy one liners that you cant help but laugh at, and fluid swordplay that feels fairly balanced with the awe inspiring guns you can use. normally youd see the guns take a predominant role for fighting, but the sword has a clear balancing act with the guns that makes it fun to forgo the guns and just massacre all the bad guys with just your blade. Really Fun Game.			"

												Decent game to play over weekend. This is a reboot of awesome Shadow Warrior, though in my opinion not as good as the original.Positive+ Graphics are great, nice map design, and awesome scenery.+ Sword ! You can chop things into little pieces and see them flying around+ Humor - although a bit chessy, it works sometimes+ Gameplay - good sometimes, it gets a bit repetitive Negative- The Sword, as fun as it is to use, it is way underpowered, you only upgrade it at the end, and don't use it as much, which is a shame. Guns are way more effective.- Bugs and glitches - The app just ate 9 GB of ram and then crashed, possible a memory leak. Also getting error messages constantly.Overall it is still a decent game to play, as long as you keep your expectations in check.			"

												I've got wang of steel.Here's the real review. I'm in the 10th chapter and I feel comfortable enough to write my review for it.Pros- A good return to the classic singleplayer FPS that was popular in the 90s-early 2000s. but polished to the point where it feels Modern.- Great melee system, it's fun to slice up demons with your katana and other powers you'll get throughout the game.- Funny. I've laughed a decent amount while playing this, Lo wang is a great protaiganist and still feels like the Chinese Duke nukem from the original shadow warrior.- GORE. Tons of it.- It looks great. - Rewards you for exploration. There are a decent amount of secrets in every level, rewarding the curious type.Cons.- Isn't really optimized for low end systems, but I can manage a solid 30fps when exploring, but you will take a giant dive of FPS when you're in a battle.- Combat can get a bit repetitive, but there is a good amount of exploration in these levels that you can take a break from if you want.I would reccomend this at full price, but I personally would wait for it to go down to 15$ or lower.

												I have only played this game for a small amount of time but I feel the need to review it already because it amazes me at how such a simple concept of a game can leave me fulfilled after playing. This is a classic guns-blazing fighting game (similar to Serious Sam) where it's everyone else vs you because your character is the only one that knows how to get stuff done apparently. I guess it makes sence that I like it because I enjoyed some of their previous titles.Great game, would highly recommend.			"

												This game is great.I don't know if you can justify $40 for it, but I picked it up on sale because of the funny trailer.  Like every other steam sale game, it sat in my library untouched for 6 months, until I saw it while bored and installed it.  It's brilliant, it really is.  It's a throwback to old school gaming, taking elements from quake, doom and duke nukem.  Fast paced action orientated combat is completely stale today, but this game absolutely nailed it.  The story was surprisingly interesting, and I found myself really powering through the game to find out what happened, but it also had a good amount of comedy mixed in.  But not too much to ruin the plot of the game, very well done.If this game is on sale, get it, definitely.  A friend said to me that it's a 'game that you play in between other games when you are bored and alone.'  I disagree.  It's one of the better games i've played in a while, I haven't enjoyed a playthrough like that in a long time.			"

												Just bought it on sale for 2.5€ expecting it to be a ""generic"" hack 'n slash / shoot 'em up, oh boy was I wrong:PROS+Combat: Let me tell you, the sword handling system is great, and it doesn't get boring with the special sword attacks you can perform. On top of that you also have guns, spells to knock enemies up, stun them, heal yourself... everything is upgradeable and opens up a lot of possibilities when fighting.+Story: Actually, it was a beautiful and saddening story, I didnt expect it to have a good plot but I got really surprised.+Graphics: Beautiful scenaries, I found myself contemplating some views for more than one minute. More than once.+Length: 12-15 hours, really good and doesn't get repetitive.+OST: Really good all around.+Has a lot of references to retro and older games, also the main character and his companion will crack you up, good humor.+Feels like Serious Sam, who didnt like that game?+Really cheap on sale.CONS-A more frequent autosave in levels would be nice, sucks to have to repeat 1-2 areas because there wasnt a checkpoint-Sometimes you sprint and die by falling 30 cm, which coupled with the above issue may be a bit frustrating.

The added visceral clean up game that comes along with the game for free is a nice added touch! All in all I can say that this game was an enjoyment.

												Having played just about everything that 3D Realms produced in the nineties, I was very interested in this Shadow Warrior reboot. It is true to the original, with updated graphics and gameplay elements. Lo Wang looks and sounds different, but the cheesy one liners, the ambiguous chinese/japanese setting and the humour are all there. Even the killer rabbits. The levels are big, highly explorable like the original and other games from the early shooters, I must say I was surprised when I thought I had fully explored a map and found I had only gotten maybe 70% of the secrets found by the end. The biggest gameplay improvement has to be the functionality of the sword, I find myself using it over any of the guns whenever possible, when it was pretty much a last resort weapon in the original (for me anyway)There are also a upgrade/perk points/skill tree system which has some useful things like upgrades to weapons, more stamina/health etc. It's not too complicated and I found that improving all the sword related abilities made the game even more enjoyable.

The campaign is kind of short for my taste, but chances are, you're not gonna finish this game only once. It doesn't hold your hand at every objective and every mission and it's fairly challenging. There are also additional game modes like survival, ""ex"" and hero, which motivates you to replay the game after finishing the campaign. There's also a crossover mini-game which was surprisingly funny and entertaining.Definitely worth the few bucks I spent on it on the sale.			"

												Not only is this a fun as hell and incredibly beautiful first-person swordfighting shooter, but the more expansive level design makes me wish other shooters took note. You can backtrack through pretty much every level, so you never feel railroaded into what the designers want you to do. Even though there’s no real point to it, I love the destruction. It’s an incredibly long game too, took me more than 25 hours for completion. I would never have expected such a deep skills system, but it becomes worth investing into when later on the game just dumps every enemy variety, gigantic or minute, onto you. The tougher the game gets (played on Hard difficulty), the more you’ll be switching out different sword specials, guns, and even demon heart/heads like a multitasking maniac.Beyond the gameplay and design that respects the player, it’s probably the funniest game I played in 2013. Great tongue-in-cheek references, fourth-wall breaking, hipster jokes, ironic fortune cookies, one-liners, and a well-developed love/hate relationship between Lo Wang and Hoji that becomes surprisingly emotional towards the end.

												An excellent FPS. Linear story but there's a lot of reward for going off path and exploring.  The story is good and has some plot twists but the real amusment comes from the main characters snarky commentary.  Is always vulgar though so if you're easily offended by that then this may not be for you.   The weapon choices, and enhancements along with skill and power purchases make it fairly customizable and no weapon (aside from the flamethrower for me but even that can get a grenade launcher attachment) feels left out.  Enemy diversity isn't great but it isn't bad either.  The combinations of enemy encounters that they throw at you does escalate well and never feels too rediculous.  Bosses are well designed and nice to look at but the strategy for all of them is essentially the same.			"

												21 hours of gameplay in an FPS game. That's cool... sort of. I have to say, the last couple of hours were a little bit boring. If it were an RPG game, I wouldn't have any problems with that length, but in an FPS, where I just kill demons and men all the time, it's not that great. But the most of it were awesome, the fights are cool, I liked the variety of weapons, and the asian setting. (And the cookies, the jokes, Wang and Hoji were really funny.) So I recommend this to every gamer, especially those, who wanna kill millions of demons. :D)			"

												+: I was initially apprehensive of this since it was a reboot of an old school FPS but hey, they nailed it. This is a very funny game that has a pretty interesting story (for most of it) and the gunplay feels good (for the most part) although it encourages pretty heavy katana usage tbh.+: The upgrade systems are all good and the game runs like a dream on my hardware.+: A lot of customization options too, more than you would expect for a SP only game.-: About 70% of the way into the campaign it gets extremely repetitive and kinda runs out of fuel.

The only bits that I've seen were the trailer and the beginning of the game. After playing through it however, I can say that's definitely worth your time. Gameplay heavy, with a touching story as well. Don't know if I would pay the whole 40 bucks tho.TL:DR:  Game is great, grab it if it's on sale.			"

												Shadow Warrior (2013) is an excellent game.  It's a politically correct reboot that packs a punch with ridiculously fun combat as the star of the show.  The amount of badassery that comes with toting oversized guns, demonic powers, and a katana is really something else, and the quality of both its amazing swordplay and gunplay make Shadow Warrior incredibly satisfying as you slice and blast your way through endless demonic hordes.  The game is also fairly long, but it never felt like a chore to play simply due to how fun I had every during every second of game time (The incessant jokes, easter eggs, and surprisingly capable story probably helped).  Shadow Warrior is probably one of most fun games I've played in a long while, and its entertainment value makes the game a veritable steal when its on sale, so get it if you can!			"

												""Beware of Wang.""The original 1997 version of this game could be summed up as having the gameplay style of Doom with a character who is like a japanese Duke Nukem. This remake is still that, but with a much better graphics engine and UI overhaul.You play as Lo Wang (AKA ""Mr. Two Million Dollars""), a hitman who is sent to buy an ancient sword, the Nobitsura Kage, from a collector. You're orders are to obtain the sword through an offer of two million dollars or by killing everyone inside the mansion and to steal it. Neither of those options go well when you are captured by the collector with the help of his demon jester friend ""Hoji."" That doesn't go very well either (at least for them) when demons show up, kill everyone, and a female golem steals the sword and runs off with it. Now, it's time for heads to roll!This is a fast paced, action FPS where you utilize your skills with the katana, as well as with an array of guns, while empowered with the magic of Ki (pronounced Chee), a mystical power of balance between mind and body and gives you awesome powers to kick some demon butt! You can heal, blast foes with a wave of energy to knock them down, and empower your katana with Ki energy to perform special attacks. The game is a very well made remake of the original release and pays homage to its retro heritage through easter eggs and secret areas strewn throughout the game's 17 chapters. I'll leave it to you to go find them. I bought this game of sale for $25, and I haven't regretted my purchase. While I may not have purchased it for the full $40, I would say that for fans of these types of games, it's worth a buy.			"

												This is just . . . a good game.1. The swordplay is some of the best I've ever seen in an FPS. You want to kill one big enemy? There's a move for that. You want to behead a group of enemies? There's a move for that. You want to clear out a bunch of dudes that have you surrounded? etc.2. The guns are funny, and by funny I mean that they are presented to you in a way that not only makes sense in context but also have funny upgrades. The sticky bombs for the crossbow are just a blast. I hate puns.3. You can self heal pretty easily, which actually doesn't feel like cheating. It makes fights strategic and really adds to the fun.4. On that point, there are almost no instances of cheesing in this game. You're going to be surrounded a lot, seldom finding bottlenecks or inaccessible areas to barricade behind. Even on casual you're going to get your butt handed to you frequently.5. The story is interesting enough, and the voice acting isn't annoying.6. Stop reading, go buy it. I feel guilty having recieved this for a song in a bundle.			"

												It's a shame Flying Wild Hog decided not to stay true to the original Shadow Warrior. The soundtrack is forgettable and the one liners sound like they belong in a disney movie. Lo Wang isn't Lo Wang anymore and the story is pretty damn lame. Now, I know the original Shadow Warrior didn't have much of a story at all and that's fine but in the remake it really tried to have one, and it just sounded so lame. I liked Hoji as a character and that's about it. Now, the gameplay, level design and the visuals are AMAZING. I had tons of fun and went through a second playthrough immediately. Excellent guns, excellent sword play, and tons of blood. $40 is a great price given it's 8-9 hour length on my first playthrough. It might fail in being a Shadow Warrior sequel but god damn is this game fun. If you can ignore that it shares the same name as Shadow Warrior then you won't be disappointed. This is how modern FPS should be. Buy it. Now.			"

												Lo Wang, akožto typicky akčný hrdina 80-tých rokov okolo seba chŕli humor, drsne hlášky a sarkastické narážky s rovnakou presnosťou, ako sa vie oháňať svojou katanou, ktorej existencia má len jediný účel - Rozhodovat o osude tých, čo stoja na jej opačnom konci.Asi je už každému jasne, že Lo Wangovi je najlepšie nepliesť sa do cesty podľa možnosti vôbec. No aj napriek tomu si väčšina, o chvíľu už neexistujúcich bláznov niekedy proste nedá povedať. Dobre pre vás, pretože katana je až zbytočne moc ostrá a všade sa váľa až podozrivo priveľa streliva do všemožných zbraní. Neviem, ako sa všetky nazývajú. Poznám len ten zvuk, ktorý vydávajú, keď človeku (mytologickej postave) berú život...Takisto je Vám asi tiež už jasne, že o inteligentný prednes ponorený hlboko v poézii tu nepojde. Nie, Lo Wang je nekontrolovateľné hovado, ktorému je nedôstojne sa niečim tak povrchným, ako je inteligencia vôbec zaoberať. Navyše pre Lo-a je to zároveň až zbytočne komplikovane a dlhé slovo. Lo totiž nerád rozpráva a keď už k tomu musí dôjsť, nechá prehovoriť ako prvú svoju katanu. Sarkazmus  vkladá podľa nálady, buď pred, alebo po.Na dnešné pomery ponuka Shadow Warrior až nezvykle dlhú kampaň a niekde v druhej polovici to začína byť aj mierne na škodu. Hráč zo všetkého toho opakujúceho sa máchania, strieľania a urážania protivníkov, začína byť už trochu unavený. Do určitej miery si s únavou poradí častá a radikálna zmena prostredia s výborným dizajnom úrovni. Vizuál je sám o sebe viac než príťažlivý a týmto smerom by padnúť žiadne výtky ani nemali. Shadow Warrior je v podstate mladším remakom svojho staršieho predchodcu. Typické koridorové akčné béčko s vtipným hlavným protagonistom a stovkami useknutých končatín, sa ale hra tak báječne, že nesúhlasiť s presvedčením Pána Wanga budete len sotva...			"

												A fantastic homage to the original classic, Shadow Warrior is everything a PC game deserves. An absolute roller-coaster ride from start to finish. Definitely worth the asking price, and looking forward to more SW from Flying Wild Hog.Pro's:+ Fantastic game play, including gun play. The satisfaction the Katana brings is just amazing. SW has set the bar for fast melee combat.+ Beautiful graphics, screenshots abound here. Fantastic amount of PC options for graphics, sound and gameplay.+ Great variety of satisfying weapons and enemies. Slicing humans with the Katana is just therapeutic ;)+ Feels perfectly arcade, just like the original game.+ Checkpoints are placed at logical points, with the ability to F5 quicksave, perfect.+ Fantastic one liners from Wang, in tune with the hilarity of the original, but not quite as good!Con's:+ I didn't enjoy the story as much as the mechanical elements, but it's still quite good.+ A couple of weird bugs caused a save load here and there, sometimes losing progression, but nothing major.

												I saw gameplay earlier, ""maybe it would be entertaining"" so i got this on discount.First impressions - very nice graphics, funny protagonists and entertaining gameplay, secrets almost equal with Serious Sam that made me checking every single corner and blowing up everything to find anohter supprises. But after first bloodbaths I went deeper...I never expected any deep lore from this kind of slashers, just ""hey, this is big evil guy, we must destroy him by slaying one milion of smaller evil guys!"". Shadow Warrior storyline could be in first approach something like that, but I think, that everyone who reccomend this game also was supprised how deep is the story and how big is immersion. Ending scene just makes me...I don't even have a world, just how game ends its amazing.Game is hard itself. I have the moment, when i just slashed everything like I am a god, but later game became more and more challenging when you are surronded by every type of enemies. Still its not broken, its ballanced and even more fun when encounters force on you to use every weapon, every skill and many time the enviroment! It's not a shame to play on easier diffulty, I played on normal and still it Was a challange to me.Enemies are varied, but game don't throw on us every type on the beginning. Some of them we can meet in the beginning, but others in the middle/slow endgame. They are realy different from eachself and force on player to use also other tactic to single one. Everyone played their role on battlefield and every demon we encounter doing something realy different, for example support his allies or summon other minion (but also still hurting us badly). Later game mix often almost all types, and from autopsy I can said this - In this game, more is better. You need to think many times to survive in bloodshed.Skills and equipment are satisfying. Many weapon, which every have their own advantages and cons, which makes every usefull. Upgrades maybe makes one more universal, but still not an ultimate massacre machine. You can see it especially in endgame, where its bloodbath overload. More interesing are skills, merits of swordfighting. I use katana almost everytime I can, so I can say that its created perfectly. I never felt that I need some other skill instead that i can use, same as perks.I fully recomend this game. Its awesome, one of the best production of 2014, maybe in whole gaming history. Entartaining and challanging.Only one con is that you can finish this game in max. 15 hours, but content loaded in this makes me fully satisfied.			"

												Having played just about everything that 3D Realms produced in the nineties, I was very interested in this Shadow Warrior reboot. It is true to the original, with updated graphics and gameplay elements. Lo Wang looks and sounds different, but the cheesy one liners, the ambiguous chinese/japanese setting and the humour are all there. Even the killer rabbits. The levels are big, highly explorable like the original and other games from the early shooters, I must say I was surprised when I thought I had fully explored a map and found I had only gotten maybe 70% of the secrets found by the end. The biggest gameplay improvement has to be the functionality of the sword, I find myself using it over any of the guns whenever possible, when it was pretty much a last resort weapon in the original (for me anyway)There are also a upgrade/perk points/skill tree system which has some useful things like upgrades to weapons, more stamina/health etc. It's not too complicated and I found that improving all the sword related abilities made the game even more enjoyable.

												Similar to all of the titles Devolver publishes like Hotline Miami, Serious Sam, or Heavy Bullets the combat has great impact from the animations and sound design. I also dig the soundtrack, even though it isn't as distinctive as Hotline Miami's OST and of course nothing in memory tops Electronic Super Joy's tunes.The humor is a little hit-or-miss, but its pretty silly and I enjoy when games can take a step back from being serious and play around a little.

												WHO WANTS A MORE WANG! This game is awesome! Run around as um... a ninja named Lo-Wang (we would get into the Japanese vs Chinese argument, but that happened when the game first came out in 1997*). You're out for revenge (like all good ninjas), and you'll take it via lead and steel. The voice acting isn't the cartoony Chinese stereotype it was in the original, but the facepalmy oneliners still remain. The graphics are outstanding, with lighting effects, and spraying blood in every corner. The ragdoll physics are pretty good, and the coolest part of the gore-fest that is Shadow Warrior is that you can slice up foes Kill Bill style leaving a trail of gore and parts through out the numerous scenic temples and bamboo groves you traverse. A rough patch I'd say is the controls, which get a bit floaty with numerous enemies on screen, but they work. All in all, this isn't Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or Ran, it is Rage of the Master or Hard Boiled and it does provide a thuroughly enjoyable bloody romp full of interesting enemies and scenic locations.*If you are basing your views on the thousands of years of diverse, rich cultures that encompass half of the world's population, on a (very tongue in cheek) game, then you are indeed a sad person and should probably log out, get out more.

												Shadow Warrior was a delightful surprise. A perfunctory examination indicates little promise; it looks and sounds like a pile of cliche: ""ninja fights army of demons."" On closer inspection however, Shadow Warrior is much more. I understand it's meant to be a callback to older shooters like Duke Nukem or Quake, titles which I never got to experience. Yet even without nostalgia, this game enthralled me despite its faults. The gameplay has little variation; occaisional half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥puzzles always give way to more fighting, but thankfully that combat is far too fun to deride. The whimsically gratuitous carnage from carving through demon hordes with a spirit-laser firing katana is indescribably fun, and the initially lack-luster firearms can be upgraded to satisfying levels of destruction.While the storyline may be thin and unclear, the characters are engaging satires of modern cliches. Lo Wang and his questionable name make for healthy banter rather than the usual silence gravely grunts of self-insertion oriented shooters.Altogether Shadow Warrior is a must-play for any shooter fan, so long as one doesn't mind the occaisional slightly racist Wang pun.

												I genuinely didn't know what to expect going into this game.  After playing the horrendously disappointing Duke Nukem Forever, I was fairly skeptical about this rebooted title.  At the very most, I was expecting a shallow FPS/FPK(First-Person Katana-ing) with decent action and an almost vacant story.  To be honest, I was surprised.  Shadow Warrior actually contains a story.  It's not particularly deep or engaging, but it is somewhat creative and the cutscenes were enjoyable.  The interaction between Lo Wang and the shadow realm demon Hoji ranged from annoying to hilarious, but I mostly enjoyed them poking fun at each other and taking cheap shots.  The action, however, was sublime - pure and simple.  Specifically, the katana was a pleasure to wield.  It sliced up demons and humans alike with noticable heft and precision.  The damage model for the enemies fit the game perfectly.  As the game progresses, new abilities for the katana and your ""ki"" powers are unlocked.  These range from a brutal thrusting strike from your katana to a shockwave-like burst of energy from your free hand.  During the game, you will wield a weapon in one hand and perform ""ki"" abilities with your other hand (think plasmids/vigors).  Unless you are dual-wielding akimbo style, this is the format for combat.  This opens up the possibility for numerous different attack combinations and variations.  In fact, the more varied and aggressive your combat style, the more karma points you are awarded after each encounter.  Karma is used to buy skill upgrades to further increase your skillset.While the katana is the staple of your arsenal, there are plenty of other weapons at your disposal, all of which feel solid and accurate.  Some are more effective than others, of course, but all have the ability to get the job done.  My only complaints about the weapons are that the fire-rate on some of them felt too slow and sometimes hitting the reload button prompted no response.  I would have to hit reload multiple times in order for the gun to actually reload.  The only reason that stands out so much is due to the rest of the controls being so responsive.  It wasn't a huge issue, but it was annoying at times.Ultimately, this game was well worth a purchase, at least for me (sale for $11.99).  The in-house game engine produces some gorgeous visuals.  Texures look good, as do the lighting effects and the amount of color is refreshing.  No dull brown and greys here, well very little of that anyway.  That being said, I would have to recommend this title.  It's an action-packed romp that delivers on what it promises, unlike other certain titles (*cough* DNF *cough*).  I give Shadow Warrior 4 out of 5 bloody demon hearts.			"

I shot a rabbit while it was getting busy with another...It turned into a demon and killed me.11/10 would die again.Serious Review:If you think shooting and slashing demons with swords and explosive crossbow bolts while dashing away from charging demons sounds fun, this game is for you. Shadow Warrior is the reboot from the classic 1997 Shadow Warrior made in the Duke Nukem 3D engine.The reboot is filled with fast-paced, horde like combat. Allowing the player to  hack and slash body parts into pieces. The game doesn't like to take itself seriously like most shooters today and will occasionally throw funny jokes and easter eggs likely to make you stop and laugh. The dash system allows you to dash towards or away from the charging demons or fireballs raining from the sky. The game begins with you and your sword which you will master as you progress. You slowly progress to different weapons as well as various attachments. This form of progression allows for you to fight the increasingly more difficult hordes of demons out to get you and left me interested in unlocking my next attachment or skill.This game might not seem as good looking as crysis or metro but the atmosphere in levels like Lo Wang's (the main characters) secret cave or looking over the hills of the cemetery can leave you breathless.Overall I had a great time playing Shadow Warrior and I can easily recommend it to anyone.    PROS:  Graphicshumorgameplaylevel designprogression style     CONS:  Only a semi-decent storyonly 2-3 variants of enemy aesthetics per class (there should be some sort of looks randomizer to make it feel like you have sliced the same demon twice in a row. This should be noted that this is a problem I have with many other games that involve you up close and personal with your target.)    "

												Great game.  It has an amazing combat system along with very nice visuals / graphics.  The story is well written and has good character personalities with great humor.  There's a good amount of enemy variety, and lots of cool skills and weapon upgrades that can be unlocked as you play through the game.  The wave defense mode is pretty solid, but there's not much there that isn't already in the main story mode.  Overall I'm fairly happy with my purchase, and I recommend picking it up if you like single player fps games or if it goes on sale.Final score: 9 fortune cookies out of 11 mariachi bands			"

												Incredibly fun, quite challenging, even sometimes pretty, pretty hard (at insane difficulty). I laughed at lot with this game, liked the plot, the history behind, the communication between the characters, the combat system, the combos, I really loved the crossbow. Hands down. Even with that, I felt that sometimes the game was offering always the same, spawning mobs at certain times, at a determined locations, so you can tell when they will happen.It would be awesome if enviromental explosives things did much more damage, because it was kinda hard to lure them and get the achievement for killing mobs with them (and keeping barrels and such intact until they were almost dead).I was never running out of ammo, because you can get them almost everywhere and if not you can buy them, which is all the opposite to the original version of this game. Medikits are everywhere.Boss fights are cool, but the mechanics don't change that much. They are hard, and will wipe you if you don't pay attention!Don't get me wrong, this game is awesome, bought it when it was on sale, and I enjoyed it a lot.If you want to spend around 18 hours in an unending killing spree of demons, and punishing the evil from here and beyond, this is your chance!

												It is my strongest recommendation that if you like FPS games, you get this one.  It has the perfect combination of what's new (upgrades, powers, and a great story) with the old (lots and lots of shooting bad guys!)  The graphics engine really shows off the locales in addition to the blood and gore, and the writing and story has all the feel of a labor of love from these guys.  The guns are all very enjoyable to use, and the katana helps revolutionize quick kills, gibs, and the use of the 'alternate weapon'.  I had so much fun running through this, and while I did a lot of secret searching (many of which do a fantastic job of alluding to the original), it still clocks in as an extensive game to play through.  By all means, grab this game and start enjoying some Wang!			"

Yes it still goes like many FPS's but still it keeps the game fresh and entertaining.  Besides chop the demon is a very fun game when you get farther in the game.  One final note, beware the bunnies.			"

												An excellent remake from an up-and-coming developer. Much like Hard Reset, this game features incredible atmoshpere, lots of customizable weapon options, beautiful graphics, solid sound design, and a competent series of skill and power upgrades. While not the best game around in terms of enemy variety and certain enemy mechanics, the game is a blast to play anyway. I had a great deal of fun romping through the world's levels, finding secrets and throw-backs to the original, and generally being a badass against the hordes of demons.			"

And they're an enemy type, not a boss so you'll sometimes fight 2 while fighting off a horde-Exploding enemies can put multiple, seemingly infinite moving explosives down that will track you -Back tracking-Puzzles-Platforming-Cutscenes can be glitchy-Some maps are a maze to navigate-No accessible map or objective guider-No suicide button. if you get stuck you just gotta restart the level or whenever you saved. reverting checkpoints is only an option if you die-Fall damage -Some cutscenes are not animated-Can be hurt by your own explosions-Dende tease secrets which make you worry if you've gon too far to be able to acquire-Never get to fight the two assassin girls-Game ends with some loose ends (left for sequel?)-Awful forced train/ride and shoot segment  -Somewhat confusing story-Tries to make you cry			"

Well worth the money, well worth the time spent so far. i also like the skill progression and upgrade scheme.

												This game easily has the best first person melee I've ever experienced. The katana is a joy to use and I often slaughter hoards of demons without pulling out any of my other weapons. Shadow Warrior reminds me a lot of Serious Sam where you make your way through a fairly linear path looking for loot (money, health, secrets, etc) and run in to demons along the way. My only complaint would be that the game is reasonably easy. The first few levels on the hardest difficulty are a breeze and only later on do they present a challenge. It would have been nice to have one more difficulty above that for those that want a very hard time. I haven't finished the game yet though so perhaps you unlock one upon completion.Summary: This game is a sack of fun. Hurry up and buy it.			"

												It's all about katana! Fighting with melee weapon for me was much easier than with guns. And it was funnier this way! Great experience! If you like games like Dark Messiah of Might & Magic or Zeno Clash you should give it a try!Good graphics and very beautiful levels. The game is full of action! Even if you use only katana there will always be something that explodes! =D (But it's very sad when it explodes next to you and you die...). Shadow warrior has some RPG elements, you can learn or upgrade magic skills, fight skills or weapons. Script writers have prepared some good jokes for you (don't forget to check out fortune cookies) =) Still, this game is not perfect... It's kind of lengthy. Story is pretty simple. All fights look the same. You enter another ""room"", fight demons there and after killing all of them, you can go to the next ""room"". But as I mentioned before, you rarely get bored, as you can always try something new in battle! Game has some bugs, but developers still release patches.			"

												Shadow Warrior is a fantastic game. If you are a fan of old school FPS and played the original Shadow Warrior then you will get extra enjoyment out of this. For those that didn't, this is still worth picking up. A solid FPS with great humour, lots of blood and gore, good level design, amazing details and lots of easter eggs/secrets to find. There are funny one liners like in the original Shadow Warrior and other additions such as rabbits having sex, secrets that have the old school textures, you see footprints in blood, the anime looking woman bathing etc. If you are looking for a quality FPS this is a must buy regardless if you played the original or not. Using the swords feels very satisfying with dismemberment and blood everywhere. The other weapons are great too, especially firing two machine guns into a mob of enemies, or using the rocket launcher and watching the gibs fly.Most FPS games will have you simply running through from start to finish. This game makes you want to explore every area for secrets. There is a decent variety of weapons and lots of upgrades you can do to improve your weapons and skills. I highly recommend it.9.5/10			"

												The recreation of Shadow Warrior is probably one of the most fun slice and dice shooters to show up on the PC. I played this game on insane difficulty and it was worth every aching minute. Epic comedic voice acting throws some homage back to Duke Nukem and Serious Sam. Plenty of sword powers to keep heads rolling and kids trolling. Amazing story, lots of weapons and power upgrades, epic enemy bosses, and the minions aren't too shabby either. 10+/10 GOTY--in fact Game of ANY Year.			"

												Flying Wild Hog has done it again with their re-imagining of Shadow Warrior.  I love the atmosphere they pour into their games.  Both Hard Reset, and Shado Warrior had this in abundance.  The only thing I wish is that you came into contact with a few more stragglers (single enemies or very small groups of them) instead of sections of groups of enemies.  But minor complaint.The optimization this time around seems slightly improved over Hard Reset.  I mean this because on the same rig, Shadow Warrior Looks noticeably better graphics wise, while the performance may even be slightly more stable than Hard Reset. (at least no worse stable than Hard Reset)I enjoyed the weaponry, just like in the original Shadow Warrior, (although the nuke upgrade for the Rocket Launcher could be a bit more powerful).  I love the ability to upgrade them, and my abilities. I don't mind for one second that this game doesn't have any multiplayer. They made a solid single player experience. The levels are pretty big, and most are quite long.  The combat is fun, especially the sword combat.  The movement, and feel of the game is very solid. This is not a typical short FPS game like we are use to seeing these days. The music is nice, I especially like the way it added to the atmosphere. Some of the levels are done extremely well on here that make you just stop, and admire the work the devs have done!  Which you can see in some of my screenshots of the game.  The story is nice too, its an interesting telling, and the way its told is pretty nice as well.  I found myself doing a quiet little (non-sarcastic) golfclap at the end of the story, right before the credits started rolling, which were nicely done as well.I caught this game on sale for like $7.50-$9.99.  I easily got my worth, it was a great game, and I would have got my worth even paying up to $25-$30.  I wouldn't pay any more than that though. I would love to see Flying Wild Hog do a re-imagining of the 90's build engine FPS called BLOOD! I would buy that in a heart beat. That being said, I have my eyes on anything Flying Wild Hog will be working on.			"

												Shadow Warrior is one of my favourite games of 2013, a First Person Shooter that incorporates all the mechanics that I prefer as a long time fan of the genre, adds some unique twists, and has amazing tactical depth. Above all, it focuses on just being fun.You are Lo Wang, a sort of modern day samurai, on a quest to recover an ancient sword for your Yakuza-style boss. You soon discover that the sword is also wanted by a race of demons who live in a shadow realm.The combat is outstanding, fast paced and intense. There are several types of demons, each with different abilities, and they attack in large waves, usually a dozen or more at a time. Thankfully you have access to a wide variety of weapons, and you can carry all of them simultaneously, so you can always choose the best weapon for each situation.Your primary weapon is the katana, and Shadow Warrior has some of the best melee combat of any FPS I've ever played. You have a normal attack, two charged power attacks and a spinning area of effect special move. Add to that a really useful dash move to quickly close the distance, and its surprising just how effective the katana is. Most of the guns are useful as well, when enemies attack from outside melee range, or have powerful melee attacks of their own that you want to avoid.The health system is fantastic. You can collect medkits. You can use magic. You can collect the souls of fallen enemies. Or, my personal favourite, you can absorb health from any enemies killed by the katana's special moves. So now when you're low on health, a group of demons changes from a threat, to an opportunity. Charge up the spinning attack and dive right into the middle. Glorious, and so much more enjoyable than just hiding behind a wall for a few seconds.There are three separate types of level up systems in play. Killing enemies gains XP which can be used to unlock passive stat bonuses. Finding crystals allows you to unlock or upgrade magic abilities. And money can be used to buy upgrades for the guns. Each system has lots of different options to choose from, so you can decide which ones best suit your playing style.The technical points are all positive as well. Level design is like a tree, with lots of branches coming off the main path, to explore and find secrets. Graphics are pretty good, makes good use of the Japanese theme, and I was able to get a solid 60 fps. Keyboard and mouse works perfectly, and all keys are rebindable. You can also customise how much info is shown on the HUD. You can save anywhere, and also enable checkpoints. I didn't experience any significant bugs. It took me 12 hours to complete, which is quite long for a FPS.I honestly can't find anything to complain about, and therefore Shadow Warrior is an absolutely essential purchase. "

I own a radeon 6770 and does well, hopefully it will run better with my new 7870, because the swordfights get somewhat slow, especially when things get crowded. DX 9.c to the extreme. Some very nice additions like cleaning your blade and checking your loaded guns are there too. Just when you thought yu have seen it all in FPS games. Well worth the money, well worth the time spent so far. i also like the skill progression and upgrade scheme. Music is good, The theme hosts plenty of Japan, China, Thailand, Hong Kong, Bruce Lee, you name it. Also your hero is a bit crazy, if you like Batman and the likes, you will understand. That's all. EnjoyFor the older ones: it's certainly doesn't have the funny twist of 3drealms.			"

												Gorgeous looking game with a really fun combat system. I played through the game using mainly the katana. There's an upgrade system where you can use found resources (money, Ki Crystals or Karma) to upgrade your combat abilities, powers or weapons. The story was surprisingly good.Pros:-Graphics, especially the 2D cutscenes and varied level design.-Good story.-Upgrade system where you can upgrade whatever playstyle fits you.-Lots of secrets and puns, which lighten the mood of the game, although Wang puns get stale after a while.-Sword combat is fun as hell.-A good challenging game.Cons:-Lot of bullet sponge type enemies, meaning each engagement took a while to get done with, which is understandable but it gets boring after you stab the same dude 20 times in a row. This, I felt, sort of artificially lengthened the game by quite a bit. It took me around 17 hours to beat it on Hard.-Loading times could be better considering the challenging difficulties. I had an SSD and loading times were around 10-20 seconds, which adds up if you played it through on harder difficulties like I did and die a lot.-Physics engine is coded in such a way that if you fall a short distance, such as sprinting downstairs, you would actually die from the fall damage. So don't expect to find yourself rushing through levels.			"

												Outstanding.  I love games that just do what they do and don't try and do everything.  SW is an outstanding shooter.  Having just finished Crysis 3 I can tell you I am having MUCH more fun in SW.  Don't let the ""it's like serious sam"" talk fool you.  This is a VERY well done shooter...with a story.  It is VERY liner, but that isnt a bad thing.  This game is about combat, and oh is it sweet.  Well worth the money!			"

												Shadow Warrior is EXACTLY how old games should be remade. If one thought the original was a bold move, this one is even bolder. During the first stage, if you look around, the scenery is just beautiful and amazing. The sword fighting is awesome and the skills are impressive. Comedy in this is epic and worth checking this game out. Oh look! Bunnies in love! LOL!			"

												A very fun FPS from start to finish! It brings back a lot of what made this genre so relevant for gaming throughout the past two decades. The combat escenarios might get repetitve but the solid game-play constantly delivers and doesn't disappoint. The are some basic RPG elements that allow you to improve the character's skills through the different chapters as enemies get more powerful. It offers decent content and a lenghty campaign for today's standard.Play it if you want a genuine and enjoyable throwback to the genre's roots!7.5/10Update: sequel is out...More Waaang!			"

												I can certainly say that this is one of the most enjoyable games i've played in a very very long time. It combines stunning visuals with a fast paced and fun hack-n-slash-n-shoot gameplay, with a little dash of an interesting story to keep you glued to the campaign. The gameplay can overtime get a little bit repetetive, but the developpers have easily countered this by adding different combinations of mini-boss battles and the hunger to attempt to achieve a better score after each battle by trying out different combos. I would easily compare this to L4D2 in terms of gameplay, but the enemies are not as 'soft' as the zombies were in said game, but the quality of the visuals exceed that of most games being released thus providing wonderful eye candy as you progress through each level, making it a necessity to stop from time to time and just stare.

												Очень достойный и качественный продукт. Оправдывает свою цену полностью. А уж цену на распродаже ($1.5) - неоднократно.1. Отличное повествование. Серьезно. Сейчас таких игр уже практически не делают. Один из примеров ""нашего времени"" это Far Cry 3. Настолько гармоничное повествование, что за ним интересно просто следить. В перерывах между игровыми сессиями - реально сидишь и с удовольствием смотришь кат-сцены. 2. Игровой процесс. Превосходный бодрый экшен с качественными вставками, насыщенными локациями, кучей скрытых потайных мест. И, само собой, отличная разрушаемость всего. Как объектов, так и противников =) Причем, не смотря на свою олд-скульность, всё это отлично адаптировано под геймпады.3. Визуальный ряд. Это конечно не нэкст-ген, как его подносят в трейлерах, но весьма на уровне. На уровне, конечно, середины поколения xbox360 \ ps3 - но этого всё еще вполне достаточно, особенно в сумме с отличным геймплеем и сюжетной линией.Итого - крайне удачное переиздание и без того удачной игры. Взяли всё хорошее старое, разбавили современным новым - и вышел отличный, бодрый, атмосферный экшен, с котрыми нынче туго. Советую всем скучавшим по ""старым-добрым"" шутерам от первого лица. И просто всем, кому понравились подачи Darkness 2, Serious Sam 3 и Far Cry 3.			"

												This game is awesome.If you liked Painkiller, this is highly recommended. Sword combat done really right, I haven't had this much fun with an unusal combat system since The Darkness 2. The sword is a very powerful and capable part of your arsenal, and I thought it was the most fun to use. Each weapon has 2 firing modes, much like Painkiller did, giving them a large and versatile role when things are going straight down the tubes.The game is visually stunning, and I spent a fair bit of time just walking through the areas soaking in the visuals and setting. The level design is also superb, particularly with an eye towards using lighting to help guide the player towards where they need to go. The humor was occasionally childish but otherwise had enough great lines to get me laughing plenty of times.			"

												A polished, fun game with fantastic mechanics and enjoyable humour. Guns are fun to use, although the sword offers a much more enjoyable experience; the combination of the two and way in which the game spams enemies at you makes combat awesome fun.The mechanics for the sword, a Japanese Katana, are smooth and intuitive. Menu options exist for altering how much input is required from the player to control Katana attacks (casual, basic and advanced), alowing the player to tailor the experience to their preference. The graphics are also solid, and the level design, while linear, offers some fantastic looking locations, very well exectued Eastern-style architecture and stunning vistas. I highly recommend  this game.+ Mechanics+ Game options+ Graphics+ Level design+ Humour- Didn't care much for the story, mainly because I was enjoying the combat so much.			"

												This game is abso-♥♥♥♥ing-lutely amazing.The combat is fun, the story is great (if that even matters), the melee is incredible, the guns fill all the niches guns need to fill and the secrets are very well hidden.I've 100%ed the game and it's been some of the best fun I've had in a video game. It's also resulted in some keyboard smashing when on Heroic (i.e. restart the level if you die), but still - there's a reason I went for 100%.The only downside is that if one chooses to forego using the katana, they'll likely find their efficiency handicapped, especially on higher difficulties, so this might be a deal-breaker for people who dislike melee combat. This grain of salt should be taken with a grain of salt, however, as the swordplay is easy to pick up on and really quite fun.This game goes on sale frequently, so the three fiddy is no price at all for the value in this beauty.10/10			"

												Incredible fast-paced run-and-gun FPS. Runs excellent on my 960 at 1080p with settings on Ultra, maintains 60FPS everywhere minus a very specific area where the flamethrower would drop the FPS to 40 while being used, however this only occured once.Gunplay is extremely satisfying - by the end of the game, it begins feeling a bit more like Serious Sam with the amount of space you have and the number of enemies you face, however the fluidity of the combat keeps it from getting repetitive.I did not find the story very interesting. I mostly played through Shadow Warrior (and soon, the higher difficulties) for the fast-paced combat, however I usually do not have strong opinions for lore behind games, so that's my own fault.I highly recommend this game for anyone who really enjoyed Quake, DOOM or the original Shadow Warrior as this effectively follows the same fast-paced genre and I'm proud to have completed it the whole way through.

												Shadow Warrior is a fantastic game. If you are a fan of old school FPS and played the original Shadow Warrior then you will get extra enjoyment out of this. For those that didn't, this is still worth picking up. A solid FPS with great humour, lots of blood and gore, good level design, amazing details and lots of easter eggs/secrets to find. There are funny one liners like in the original Shadow Warrior and other additions such as rabbits having sex, secrets that have the old school textures, you see footprints in blood, the anime looking woman bathing etc. If you are looking for a quality FPS this is a must buy regardless if you played the original or not. Using the swords feels very satisfying with dismemberment and blood everywhere. The other weapons are great too, especially firing two machine guns into a mob of enemies, or using the rocket launcher and watching the gibs fly.Most FPS games will have you simply running through from start to finish. This game makes you want to explore every area for secrets. There is a decent variety of weapons and lots of upgrades you can do to improve your weapons and skills. I highly recommend it.9.5/10			"

												Similar to Serious Sam I first had to get a feeling of the game. Being a good looking, widely new interpreted version of the old game, it first feels...awkward. I tried to figure out the sword, and tried to figure out the guns, being frustrated, until I realized, this game isnt about finding the right time and spot to hit and shoot.Just hit and shoot your enemy.This game is all about speed and awareness.You are some kind of master assassin, who has to claim some mysterious sword from a japanese crime clan. Very fast you will be confronted with magic, CHI, KI, demons and a lot of other mythical crap.While in most games, your melee weapon is a more a tool than a weapon, this game is refreshing different.around 3/4 of the combat I could solve with the sword, the guns are for special tasks. Taking out bigger enemys, comanding and summoning units, flying ones or laying down massive AOE into an enemy group.Weapons like the Pistol and the SMG feeling totally useless in most of the fights are actually impressive against big single targets and mostly used for the massive bossfights.Everything is upgradable. While finding money everywhere, you can upgrade your weapons, making them stronger, faster and more precise. Also every weapon gets a alternate fire mode, which always is a great fun.Then you have a great set of abilitys you can unlock from faster movement, damage to using demon skulls as a weapon, healing yourself and big energy blasts.The combat system is mostly based on your movement, aim and the right use of your abilitys.The story being a little bit confusing and irrelevant, the dialogues are great work. Even while my second playthrough, I still listening to everything, and dont skipping any cutscene.The game is a great piece of classic FPS in new grafics and I hope there will be more.			"

You can upgrade Weapons, invest Karma-Points in Skills and KI-Crystals in Powers. You will see a lot of humor, easter-eggs and references.  The Maincharacters always has a ""funny"" comment on his lips. I beat it on Hard and it wasn't too hard, if you ignore like 2-3 difficult fights.If you like Shooters like Wolfenstein, you will like Shadow Warrior. "

												This game show by itself how the fps should looks like ,it looks freacking awesome developers squish UE3 very hard to make the game looks so great ,gameplay really well maded ,the swordfight is best one i ever saw in games atleeast in first person games ,which overspit Dark Messiah and Dishonored and show that sword its a personal weapon .Gunplay is really enjoyable -all guns are responsible and have a lot of upgrades which can change weapons in core.Only weak spot i was saw so far its level design - not as much freedom as you want in this game.

												Shadow Warrior 2013 by Flying Wild Hog is a reboot of the old FPS that goes by same name which was made by 3D Realms. Though it could as well be separate franchise, the only thing that remains is that main hero's name if Lo Wang, human Villian name is Zilla and that it takes place in modern Asian-styled world with asian demons. And that main hero has a sword. Also, no more multiplayer. All yay single-player focus.It also was released for Xbox One and PS4. No good differences that I am aware off.You also get Viscera Cleanup little spin-off with single Shadow Warrior level. A game where you clean up all the blood and gibs as a space janitor.You can get additional sword skin if you own Saints Row 4. Plus two additional skins from Special Edition of a game. Oh, Rise of the Triad and Walking Dead sword reskins are available in the game without having to have anything else. I also heard that there were additional skins depending on what platform you pre-ordered the game.Plot wise you are a Zilla's man, who's current job is to take a sword. Which will go wrong, land will get invaded by ugly asian demons who aren't related to Zilla and you will get into family melodrama of Ancients from Shadow Realm, with plot being focused more on that. It actually gets interesting. And even though Lo Wang isn't same pervy stereotypical asian old fart, he still cracks his jokes along with new spirit friend.Main core gameplay is changed. It's not old-school in same fashion as old 90s shooters as original Shadow Warrior. Instead it takes another type of old-school: Painkiller style! Where the levels are strongly divided between calm exploration areas where you search for keys, find secrets without wall-humping, destroy locks and open thousands boxes to find supplies and money. It's almost maze-like at times, but there is always a shining door which will give you a hint where to go next. It also gives you a hint which area contains bonus goodies. Protip: it's the one not behind the shiny door.And once you enter a suspiciously empty area you will be locked down into arena and the waves of enemies will begin to pour in. Though sometimes there is already somebody around. And not only that, but when the fight will end, you will get rated and given karma points. Sadly, the requirements for good rating are unclear and as it turns out, ""use different weapons and be cool"" isn't true. Guides say it's about multiplayer like ""shredder"" or ""headshot"" and suggest you to just use few weapons along with stun.Well, plus there are few encounters where you aren't locked into arena or rated. Happens.And levels are build around pacing these two section types around and it usually works well. Sadly, the game is a dat too long. Or at least some chapters are. In some of them, you might already complete the climax of a level, like some cool mini-boss. And yet it will still keep going and going, sending you to wander futher in mazes. Just finish already and don't drag!And as much as original Shadow Warrior was about shooting from Grenade Launcher into corners, the reboot Shadow Warrior is about the mighty sharp katana. Monsters hit feedback ismore detailed than usual, swaying around as you hit them with sword with some angles. Actually, if you manage to hit some with strong horizontal attack over neck, common fodder enemies may even die in a single hit, losing their heads. Or to lose their arms. Some say that their beat the game using katana 95% of times.But in reality is that once you put skills into katana mastery it will become more straight-forward strong melee weapon, as you will be spamming special moves and heal from them. No, there is no sword-blocking or such. Just shifting around. You know, avoiding things. Though at least monsters become more enraged when you spam special moves.But it's not all just hip sword play, as you got at least 6 more weapons, each can be upgraded to have special alternative fire modes. All of them are balanced around each other and are fun to use. Also look pretty fancy. Akimbo Uzi is back and is good for constant fire from distance. Crossbow is good for nailing things to a wall once you charge it up. Shotgun is interesting, it strong and has a cone of fire so wide that it will make Super Shotgun from Doom 2 choke up from envy. And there is a highly explosive rocket launcher.It's a bit more sad with enemies variety. They are mostly demons who are designed to either melee you, charge at you or just throw fireballs. There are also regular mini-bosses. And shield demons. It's all good and fun, but by the end of a game, everytime you see game spawning 2 of mini-bosses you just would grunt ""again those bulletsponges"". Oh and at least there are some bosses.It also has some RPG elements in that you can upgrade yourself by collecting recources. Money is littered around and you have to search for it, it will let you upgrade the weapons.Ki Crystals are very few, but they are almost always placed in your face. They let you upgrade your special powers. Yep, you got some and you can activate them like in fighting games, like ""forward, forward, hold alt-fire"". If Metroidvania can do it, then why not other genres?  Though it's a shame that Flux and Shockwave are too same, stunning enemies, with Flux being the worse one, due to making you pause for a second. Also, all yay healing and shielding.And then when you kill enemies, get big rating at fights or find blood bowls you will get karma, which is like experience points. With you getting a single point you can spend on skills once you level up, so to say. Skills are varied and all of them are useful, though I recommend you to get those sword skills up.It also has awesome enviroments and graphics, even if it's not AAA game. Asian and other-world worlds are quite fashinating and nice. Music is sadly completely forgettable, movie-like stuff. Fortune cookies are still fun, all messages are now unique through the game. Too much retro secrets though.And while the game has problems at being too repetetive either due to same pacing or because it's too long, the gameplay is simply awesome. It really makes you move and fight with tactics in mind at arenas, changing weapons and shooting them the cars to make them explode, whille getting exploring outside of them in huge non-straight-line levels. I can't say how it compares to original Shadow Warrior as it's very loose reboot, but it's one of the best Painkiller-style FPS around!			"

												Incredible fast-paced run-and-gun FPS. Runs excellent on my 960 at 1080p with settings on Ultra, maintains 60FPS everywhere minus a very specific area where the flamethrower would drop the FPS to 40 while being used, however this only occured once.Gunplay is extremely satisfying - by the end of the game, it begins feeling a bit more like Serious Sam with the amount of space you have and the number of enemies you face, however the fluidity of the combat keeps it from getting repetitive.I did not find the story very interesting. I mostly played through Shadow Warrior (and soon, the higher difficulties) for the fast-paced combat, however I usually do not have strong opinions for lore behind games, so that's my own fault.I highly recommend this game for anyone who really enjoyed Quake, DOOM or the original Shadow Warrior as this effectively follows the same fast-paced genre and I'm proud to have completed it the whole way through.

												This game was shockingly good.  Fun swordplay and fun FPS fighting, along with sword combos worked very, very well.  Even had some pretty amusing jokes, and good characters and story, which is shocking for a game who's hero's name is essentially 'big♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Has some fun call backs to the original 97 game, but with a style all its own.  Probably my biggest critisism is that it may have been too easy, with health packs everywhere, and the ability to self heal with the sword and life steal too.  But I suppose that may be for harder difficulties.  Overall, it was far better than I would have ever expected.			"

												I just revisited this game to play through it with a friend. And i was really blown away by just how fun the game was my thrid time through.The story is simple, is the origin story of the almighty Lo Wang and concerns his rise to the man he will eventually become and the origins of his nemesis that will continually hound him in his quest to achieve his devious machinations.First off, the weapons. While most of the weapons have a nice, solid feel to them, the weapon models tend to be on the larger side with no way of reducing them. The main gimmick of this game is the Katana and the way that it handles. You can press a direction and then press swing for it to produce different animations of cutting. While nice, this is pointless as there are no enemies that require you to use the directional slashes. You can also power it up with various abilities as you level up, and that's where the main use of the sword comes into play.Overall, it's a solid game with mostly well realised characters, witty banter and character development while keeping the gameplay old-school, fast paced and full on balls against the walls.Get it, play it and enjoy it. If you liked FPS genred games, you are sure to have a good time with this.			"

												Shadow Warrior is one of my favourite games of 2013, a First Person Shooter that incorporates all the mechanics that I prefer as a long time fan of the genre, adds some unique twists, and has amazing tactical depth. Above all, it focuses on just being fun.You are Lo Wang, a sort of modern day samurai, on a quest to recover an ancient sword for your Yakuza-style boss. You soon discover that the sword is also wanted by a race of demons who live in a shadow realm.The combat is outstanding, fast paced and intense. There are several types of demons, each with different abilities, and they attack in large waves, usually a dozen or more at a time. Thankfully you have access to a wide variety of weapons, and you can carry all of them simultaneously, so you can always choose the best weapon for each situation.Your primary weapon is the katana, and Shadow Warrior has some of the best melee combat of any FPS I've ever played. You have a normal attack, two charged power attacks and a spinning area of effect special move. Add to that a really useful dash move to quickly close the distance, and its surprising just how effective the katana is. Most of the guns are useful as well, when enemies attack from outside melee range, or have powerful melee attacks of their own that you want to avoid.The health system is fantastic. You can collect medkits. You can use magic. You can collect the souls of fallen enemies. Or, my personal favourite, you can absorb health from any enemies killed by the katana's special moves. So now when you're low on health, a group of demons changes from a threat, to an opportunity. Charge up the spinning attack and dive right into the middle. Glorious, and so much more enjoyable than just hiding behind a wall for a few seconds.There are three separate types of level up systems in play. Killing enemies gains XP which can be used to unlock passive stat bonuses. Finding crystals allows you to unlock or upgrade magic abilities. And money can be used to buy upgrades for the guns. Each system has lots of different options to choose from, so you can decide which ones best suit your playing style.The technical points are all positive as well. Level design is like a tree, with lots of branches coming off the main path, to explore and find secrets. Graphics are pretty good, makes good use of the Japanese theme, and I was able to get a solid 60 fps. Keyboard and mouse works perfectly, and all keys are rebindable. You can also customise how much info is shown on the HUD. You can save anywhere, and also enable checkpoints. I didn't experience any significant bugs. It took me 12 hours to complete, which is quite long for a FPS.I honestly can't find anything to complain about, and therefore Shadow Warrior is an absolutely essential purchase. "

												How in the hell did it take so long for me to discover this gem?! If you are a fan of FPS games like Serious Sam, Doom, Quake, Duke Nukem 3D etc... then you absolutely MUST buy this game. Sure there are several guns to choose from and plenty of mayhem to be had with demonic-like powers but the real fun IMO comes with the swordplay. The swordplay mechanics are absolutely fantastic and blast to play. There is nothing quite as satisfying as slicing a demon apart limb by limb then finishing him off with a good ol' fashioned decapitation. I could literally run through the entire game with my sword out and not feel the need to pull out a gun. It's a blast! The level's are very linear with a few collectibles and ""secrets"" scattered about along with crystals that help you upgrade your character. They were never really hard for me to find so I am sure you won't have any trouble either. There is usually a boss of some sort at the end of each level as well, they aren't all that hard and I recommend using a  machine gun or Launcher on them as to keep distance from the melee attacks. Your character also has a talent tree of sorts which you can use the Crystals to pick whichever talent upgrade you want. You can also earn and find money and ammo via boxes or kills (think Bioshock or Farcry) and use the money on upgrades for your weapons. You can save at any point as well which I encourage you to do because instant deaths can happen and it can be frustrating.I feel I also need to say something about our main character (not much but something). He is a fairly likable Asian man with cheesy one-liners ala' Duke Nukem or Serious Sam which are delivered at tense moments to lighten the mood. They made more sense in those games because those protaganists are more big burly badasses but Lo Wang is more of an assassin so it didn't really fit for me. It still is not bad to watch though.All in all if you are a fan of Ninja's, Stupid jokes, Samurai swords or dismembering demons pick this gem up (8$ on sale sometimes!).-Casey "

												Similar to Serious Sam I first had to get a feeling of the game. Being a good looking, widely new interpreted version of the old game, it first feels...awkward. I tried to figure out the sword, and tried to figure out the guns, being frustrated, until I realized, this game isnt about finding the right time and spot to hit and shoot.Just hit and shoot your enemy.This game is all about speed and awareness.You are some kind of master assassin, who has to claim some mysterious sword from a japanese crime clan. Very fast you will be confronted with magic, CHI, KI, demons and a lot of other mythical crap.While in most games, your melee weapon is a more a tool than a weapon, this game is refreshing different.around 3/4 of the combat I could solve with the sword, the guns are for special tasks. Taking out bigger enemys, comanding and summoning units, flying ones or laying down massive AOE into an enemy group.Weapons like the Pistol and the SMG feeling totally useless in most of the fights are actually impressive against big single targets and mostly used for the massive bossfights.Everything is upgradable. While finding money everywhere, you can upgrade your weapons, making them stronger, faster and more precise. Also every weapon gets a alternate fire mode, which always is a great fun.Then you have a great set of abilitys you can unlock from faster movement, damage to using demon skulls as a weapon, healing yourself and big energy blasts.The combat system is mostly based on your movement, aim and the right use of your abilitys.The story being a little bit confusing and irrelevant, the dialogues are great work. Even while my second playthrough, I still listening to everything, and dont skipping any cutscene.The game is a great piece of classic FPS in new grafics and I hope there will be more.			"

												I picked up this game while on sale for $5 and have to say it is well worth it.  Here's my quick run-down:Pros -Gameplay is fast and fluid; full 60 FPS on my mid-level systemMelee combat is great; shooting is on par with other FPS gamesMonster models and their AI are well doneRacy humor and language is done right; doesn't go too far to be distractingMap level designs feel right compared to the story being toldSecret areas offer incentives for those who wish to search for themGame has many chapters which extends its valueCons - Graphics are not spectacular but sufficeRepetition sets in after awhile; more monster models are neededNo map or pointers makes finding the right path difficult at times""Double press"" keyboard options can be difficult during heavy fightsClimbing or extended jumping would enhance the gameplayVerdict -This game is really enjoyable so far.  I'm only up to level 7 so far, so I may update my review if needed as I get further along.  Currently I'd score this game an 8 out of 10.  The pros definitely outweigh the cons, especially at this value.			"

												Shadow Warrior is an excellent old school style first person shooter. I bought it on sale and got about 13-15 hours of actual play time through the main campaign. If you're into extra difficulties you can get a lot more and if you like to just mess around in a new game plus with all your suped up weapons you can put some more time on the clock. I didn't have super high expectations to start, not to say they were low, but this game well surpassed the ones I had with its visceral gunplay, great sound design, diverse weapons, a pretty damn cool story and a really fun melee combat mechanic involving a katana. Thats not to mention the upgrade system, which admittedly is a bit shallow but gives a nice feeling of progression throughout the game. Shadow Warrior also doesn't drag itself out too long and wear out its welcome. I just recently played Alien: Isolation and I did love it for the most part but by god if that last 4 or 5 hours didn't draaaag on forever, it just makes you realize what a difference good pacing makes. Luckily this game hits all the right notes at the right time. This is a really fun game, definitely worth any asking price, especially if your a fan of the old school. Pros --Nice old school first person shooter gameplay and feel.-Visceral combat and feedback from the guns and sword.-Upgrade system for skills, powers and guns (and the gun upgrades actually show on the weapon models).-Varied level settings and design.-Enjoyable, crazy story with funny humor.-Easily 12 or more hours of game play for a first playthrough.-Good graphical fidelity and physics.-Funny and likeable characters.-Very stable, no crashes experienced and smooth framerate even on higher settings.-Lots of secrets and hidden goodies, old school style.-Well designed and varied enemies with only one that was frustrating.Cons --Somewhat shallow upgrade system.-Upgrade system is a bit hit or miss with some relatively useless skills and lacks really interesting upgrades.-Some of the weapon designs are bog standard and the Flamethrower I felt was pretty useless without its upgrades.-Levels are fairly linear but open up occasionally.-Some of the secrets aren't very well kept.-Similar boss battles throughout the game.My complaints are mostly nitpicking I feel, and went mostly unnoticed during my play time. I was having enough fun with the combat, powers and weapons to pretty much ignore them all. This game really is a love letter to classic FPS games and is an excellent reboot of one of the old greats. Even though I felt some of the Powers and Skills were silly or useless there are quite a few that are pretty fun though only a few I felt really made things much more interesting. While Shadow Warrior isn't bad in any way, it also doesn't truly stand out on its own. Its a hard thing to describe, because the game is really good, its solid, solid as a rock but it isn't the MOST interesting thing out there. Its really damn solid, a very good game made by a good Dev team who loves old school shooters. I guess if I have to give it one definitive negative its that it doesn't do anything too impressive. Solid accross the board, in every way.8/10			"

												I don't always buy games. But when I do, I make sure they're good ones. And Shadow Warrior is definitely one of them. After watching YouTube sensations TotalBiscuit and Jesse Cox play and give their glowing impressions on it, I knew this was something I could get into.What really sets Shadow Warrior apart from other FPS is its katana swordplay. Every slash and scission bisects objects and beings in a way that is both appropriate and well animated. And it is just as effective as your arsenal of firearms, if not more so--meaning you can get up close and personal with the katana all the time if you really want to. And that's what I like the most about the gameplay: you as a player have a choice on how you want to upgrade weapons and skills. Will you build yourself around guns, swordplay, or a bit of both? That's up to you.However, what speaks to me most about any game like Shadow Warrior is its attention to detail. For example, the first level has a garden rendering cherry blossoms, rock surfaces, waterfalls, and bamboo forests with spectacular fidelity. And apart from a few dark industrial-themed environments, that kind of quality eye candy never lets up all the way to the end. And the details don't stop with the graphics. Voice acting is witty, modern, and enjoyable. It is never cringeworthy. And the music is absolutely top notch, capable of evoking scale and drama during boss fights, as well as calm and tension before combating an enemy horde in the areas leading up to it.A game that delivers both mechanically and viscerally while being pleasantly enjoyable to the easily squeemish is a win in my books. I would highly recommend Shadow Warrior to everyone.			"

												Different refreshing fps amidst the repetitive war ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.nice customization for a fps and good amount of enemies with varying skills and abilities.Scales pretty well with difficulty (refreshing also...) but still pretty challenging at parts in normal mode.easy to learn and yet there is alot of space for you to master it. nice set of achievements (for a fps)			"

												Takes old school shooter formulas from the era of Duke 3D / Shadow Warrior and adds a satisfying layer of mechanics such as dodging, and key combo sword moves.  Didn't expect much from it, butwas pleasantly suprised to see how much fun the combat was.  This is what Duke Nukem Forever should have been like.			"

												Personal Rating: 7 of 10This game is awesome. From the studio that also brought you Hard Reset, you can expect something similar. Awesome graphics, secret location, tonnes of enemies and blood! Another reason to get this game is the ability to cast Getsuga Tenshou. I mean how many games out there allows you to do that.Shadow warrior is a first person shooter set in today's Japan. You can wield guns or a samurai sword that both can be upgraded (which is awesome). As you progress in the game, you will earn/collect skill points where you can spend on upgrading offensive/defensive spell or your ability. This takes the game to a whole new level and huge variety of play style. The levels are linear where you only have to follow a single path available. Huge amount of enemies will spawn when you reach a huge open area. This is also indicated by the background music. The plot is alright but you will tend to get a little confuse at first because you cannot familiarize with the names and the story telling is vague in the beginning. I highly recommend this game if you are a fan of clean, simple, classic first person shooter. When you complete the game, you are given a new play mode where you can keep all the upgrades from the previous game. However they will reset your sword upgrade which sucks.			"

												First things first, this is probably the best FPS you are gonna play this year.The gameplay is fast, old-school fast. Maybe not Quake fast (This is in the Rise of the Triad remake), but ""enough"" fast to remember the good old times of circle strafing everyone. There are medkits (wohoo!) and armors, a proper arsenal with different upgradeable weapons and the best melee/magic combat I've seen in a ""gun"" FPS in my life.There is a nice story to fill the reasons for what you are killing everyone with nice moment (Not the best plot ever, but good enough) filled with funny dialoges and one liners from the new Lo-Wang, lot of references (To both other games from Devolver Digital and the classic (and better) Shadow Warrior), all in a BEAUTIFULL, colorful (although in some times it has the EVERYTHING IS A SHADE OF THE SAME COLOUR illness) and vibrant maps full of things that go boom and things that make you go ""wow"". Just look at my screenshots. Is ♥♥♥♥ing impressive.But......it is not an ""Old school shooter"". Yeah, there are circle strafing. And medkits. And loads of weapons. Then what happens?If you played Hard Reset, you already know what happens, as Shadow Warrior is ""the same game"", longer and with improvements in how the combat works and in enemy design. If you don't know how Hard Reset played, let me explain you: You walk into a big room, all the access closes, and the monsters start to spawn until you kill them all. Walk again, repeat. Until the end.Serious Sam invented the ""Arena Shooter"" and Painkiller made it more similar to what Hard Reset did. Shadow Warrior repeats this mechanic and gets you into arena after arena until you end up fighting a boss that works EXACTLY AS THE BOSSES IN HARD RESET. All of them are the same. Repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat.It is still funny killing monsters in arenas, but it gets old REALLY fast. You will still firing up the game over and over just to get into two arenas of the story, kill everyone, and save right after you walk into the next one because you are already bored of ""doing the same"" again. And to be honest, is not ""really"" hard to beat the game, having a ""magic"" to heal yourself.I sincerely hope that the guys at Flying Wild Hog move away from this mechanics and start going into a more ""open"" shooters. A man can dream, ain't it?			"

												It's honestly pretty boring, especially on higher difficulties. Enemies, especially the greater demons and bosses are huge bullet sponges. I ran out of ammo on multiple occasions and were forced to wail at the greater demons with the katana after everything else in the room was killed. The high difficulties aren't exactly challenging either since the enemies don't really do that much damage (with the exception of charging greater demon type) and it's extremely easy to dodge around the corner and heal. It's just time consuming padding.I want to know what the ♥♥♥♥ they were thinking with Zilla fight in particular. He has the most predictable moveset in the entire game (oh gee, he disappeared, wonder if he is going to give me a 10 second break and attack me from behind with Hoji announcing his ""surprise attack"" to me for the 30th time), is the most bullet spongy encounter and you have to fight him ♥♥♥♥ing twice, with both fights having the exact same movesets and ""strategies"" for beating him. I can't honestly think of a worse video game boss fight.As for the good points it's commendable that the game rewards exploration and there's a good amount of secrets to discover. The environments also look pretty nice. For a few bucks it's not a complete waste of money, but it's definitely not something memorable or a game you could recommend to anyone either.			"

												Basically, you play the game for the secrets hunting and the 'wang' jokes. Nothing more.Gunplay is abysmal. Everything is sluggish in general. You got a shotgun? Great! Good luck reloading while dodging 5+ demons charging at you.Ok so you decided to change using katana, you enter command for a ki strike. What now? You need to use your WASD keys. While dodging attacks. Wait for it to charge and oh god finally got one down. Nice job. Now do this 10 more times to clear the area.The game, being a FPS, fails at the very core mechanic: it just cannot put itself togther to make it fun to use weapons to kill stuffs. 4 of the 5 times here is no 'explosive gunplay' without blowing yourself up since everyone is charging at you. It is even more so when you reach the latter half of the game - it just throws same bullet-absorbing enemies in greater numbers. You run, shoot/slice, heal, run, shoot/slice, heal. Rinse and repeat.That being said, the game is not without its charm. The gore is not bad (for a game published in 2013). The aesthetics, despite having a pseudo-oriental art style that will♥♥♥♥♥♥off any Asian being serious in this area, is generally colourful and pleasing.In conclusion, I just couldn't recommend this to anyone. This, is a very medicore game that, quality-wise, being outdone by many other far more enjoyable gory monster killing games. Grab it only when it is on sale and you absolutely don't mind wasting hours just for some funny, though lame jokes and references.			"

												I played the old Shadow Warrior on my old 468 ""back in the day"". It was great. Hillarious dialogue and ""modern graphics"". (It was honestly, the first time I'd heard the joke: *ring ring* ""Hello? Is your refrigerator running? Better go catch it!"" Lol.)But this game, this is a different game. Much more gritty. It has a more modern edge to it. (Edge, sword? see what I did there?)The maps are good - although I did find that I was confused in some places (mostly because I missed the obvious), the sound track is quite nice, the story is solid and graphics are pleasing.There are bunches of secrets and tributes to the original Shadow Warrior (& Hotline, Serious Sam etc etc). And of course, a sweet sword. (also, enemies block - which is always a nice element.)All in all, a good game. :)Note: Does contains swears here and there, there are dealings with the 'demon-esque', and the like, in the overall story line - as the enemies consisting of them. So if you're touchy about those things, you might want to give this one a miss.""WHOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooo want some Wang?!"" ~ Lo Wang (Snr)			"

												Disappointing and underwhelming. It’s a very average game. It was so mind numbingly repetitive to the point where I completely switched off my brain and went on auto pilot mode to finish the game. Just waves upon waves of generic enemies throughout the whole game. It was cool for the first few hours but after a while you are expecting the game the change up and do something different but it never does. I really loved the art style and level design in the first few chapters. The levels then became very mundane and boring when you arrive to a small town, then the sewers and a cemetery and the docks etc. It didn’t help that the levels are so linear with so many invisible walls. The game then went back to having great and interesting visuals in the last few chapters. The game has little moments of greatness like chapter 16 for example but because the game is so long and drawn out, these moments are so few and far between. The katana and cool sword moves save the game from being bad, but it could have been something a lot better. From the prologue of the game I thought I was in for something special and I got kill bill vibes from it which is always a good thing but as the game kept progressing the less I liked it. The upgrades didn’t do enough to improve or change the gameplay they were very minor. I didn’t find the story very compelling or interesting but I did enjoy the cheesy voice acting.  I was expecting a lot from this game with all the praise it got but it was ultimately very disappointing.5/10 (Average)			"

												Shadow Warrior:Positives:+ The game features lots of guns, including uzi's, revolvers, crossbows, shotguns, flamethrowers and more. There's plenty of weapon upgrades which add everything from dual wielding to explosive rounds for your firearms. In addition, two skill trees are available which focus on improving your healing abilities, movement, luck, katana mastery and defensive and offensive Chi powers, such as knockdown stuns and damage reduction blocking. There's a great amount of variation here for character building.+ Very engaging combat for the most part, keeping you on your toes. There's several different types of enemies - standard demons, warlords, shamans, berserkers, flying demons plus others.+ Hidden secrets to find for those who enjoy a bit of exploration, along with the often amusing fortune cookies.+ Graphics are absolutely fine considering the obvious low budget for the game. It's clear Shadow Warrior is not a triple A game so stunning visuals shouldn't be expected. It's decent and that's all it needs to be.+ The game takes a good 15-20 hours to finish, which is not too bad for an FPS, hack 'n' slash style title.Negatives:- Weak story, limited dialogue, somewhat hard to follow. Very linear for the most part.- Some non-sensical environmental mechanics, cars explodes by throwing shurikens at them, or a few bullets. Fighting is very arcade-like and lacks realism.- Really tedious and boring boss encounters, which can take 20-30 minutes per battle (hard difficulty). Often they're not that hard, just time consuming and annoying. Overall Score: 7/10Shadow Warrior is a nice, action packed game to pass the time. It has an acceptable amount of content for a cheap price (especially on sale) so it's well worth it.			"

												Well, I'm at the end of my 4th playthrough (disregard play-time, dunno what's up with that) and I still intend to play more Survival mode. This game got everything right. I was starved for a good fps and this game hit all the right spots. Buy this instead of Wolfenstein: The New OrderThe story is amazing, except Chapter 16, where it get's a bit too serious in a bad way. The ending (ch. 17) is fine and very feely - nothing wrong with that. Chapter 16 just came off as... awkward(?). The transformation of the characters at that point is done a bit poorly.The swordplay is pretty cool. The enemy models slice up rather nicely. It's pretty accurate. The sword does seem a little bit overpowered though, because of the healing upgrade you can get for it. Not that there's anything wrong with that - it's a singleplayer game, and regardless of how strong the sword is, you will still want to/need to use the other weapons.Regarding the main character, some people said the original Lo Wang was better. I call bs on that. He had NO character. He was a pair one liner ripping pants that the player wore. The new Lo Wang is a lot better. He has an awesome character, but he's still badass, he still has one liners.I just wish I could get the classic katana somehow. I have SW Classic Redux, but I still can't select it. :(9.5/10 best fps in a loooong time. Looking forward to the sequel (fighting your way home through the Shadow Realm would be nice)			"

												So... Shadow Warrior. Graphics are ok, not great but good. The Story is probably best described as cliched.(spoilers) You have to find the 3 parts of a sword, not all that great but it works. Audio is ok. The hook of this game is probably the humour and the gameplay. The humour is not the humour of the 1st one but I found it quite amusing. The gameplay is very melee-heavy, the guns don't feel all that powerful and the sword combat is extremly OP. It get's a little bit boring after a while. A thing that is very good about this game is probably the level-design, the set pieces are good, it's linear but not on a COD level. To wrap it all up: Shadow Warrior is a solid game. If you like beign OP and slashing through your enemies like butter you should buy it, if you expect a remake, don't.P.S.If you don't like the music all that much and want to feel a little bit more epic, open the steam overlay, make a playlist on youtube and listen to that.(Recommendation: Use something by Two steps from hell and Hammerfall)			"

												You control Lo Wang, an employee of Zilla Enterprise. With a katana and 2 million dollars, you were sent to purchase the Nobitsura Kage from a certain Mr Miyazaki. The deal went south and you have to fight your way through to the Nobitsura Kage. Thankfully, Lo Wang is an extremely skilled swordsman and is quite resilient to pain. Later, as you accumulate karma points, you'll even be able to cut down your enemies from a distance. Other than his katana, Lo Wang will also find other weapons throughout the game, including demon hearts and heads. After making a pact with the demon Hoji, Lo Wang can unlock demonic powers to further enhance his fighting capability. The combat is fast-paced and delightfully gory, especially if you use the katana most of the time. I would definitely recommend this if you enjoyed games like Painkiller.			"

												Pretty good game. Bought this a while ago and just now got around to playing it. The combat reminds me a bit of Black (if anyone remembers that game.) with sword melee and chi attacks added in. The guns remind me of the old quake games. The humor is duke nukem style. Works out pretty well.Pros:References all over. Duke nukem reference, posters of serious sam and hotline miami. The rocket launcher even has an ammo upgrade called Nuke Dukem.Good weapons. I felt like alot of them had their uses, the only gun I didn't like was the flamethrower. SMG's were good on flying mobs, shotgun was good on most light mobs, I used crossbow on bigger guys after I got high tention upgrade. Rocket launcher if I needed to clear a more annoying enemy quickly like the necro guys. Pistol I used for shield guys after knocked them down with tiger roar. So that worked pretty well.Upgrade system. You upgrade guns with money, Chi powers with crystals, and skills with karma or something. It works since they're not battling for the same resource.Nice visuals, map design (linear though), atmosphere, etc..Easter eggs, I like that they hide pixelated rooms in the levels to honor the original game (which I never played), the naked girl sprites are a bit out of place here but are again homage to the orginal game as I understand it.Lots of cheesy jokes (this could be a con but it kind of works into Wangs personality. His interactions with Hoji are also have some high points to them.)Cons:While the game has some insentive to explore there just little rooms off the beaten path so it doesn't feel much like exploration.Karma system didn't make sense to me, the rating I got after fights seemed completely random.Advance melee controls blow, I have zero clue what they do different from normal setting.Towards the end the game goes the path I tend to dislike. Instead of making harder enemies they just send loads more after you, those 4-5 waves on the second to last chapter were aggrevating, end up running around like crazy spamming your heal.Some weak upgrades. I upgraded the trap chi attack but rarely used it since it was easier to run in and plant the tiger roar for a knockdown instead of trying to levitate the enemies. Also the sword spin I rarely used after I got the range energy attack since it was easier to back up and launch that point blank and hit about the same enemies.If it's on sale and you're curious about trying out some Wang I'd definitely say give it a try.

												I recommend only those who have played the  'ShadowWarrior Classic Redux'  . But if you haven't played that, I guess to it has a chance to you like that game too. I have bought that game because I like the first one. Please if you are thinking about buy that game, I suggest go and watch some YouTube videos about that game. Because there are some joke in that game who are referring the old one game. So, if you haven't played before the first one, you will not understand that jokes. Good thing. 	-This game run well on my computer. 	-There have useful skills and weapons. 	-Good control. Bad thing. 	-If you haven't played the first one, you will not understand some jokes. 	-If you want to get all achievement, you need be a pro player! Because the last achievement 'No Ordinary Wang' is seems like impossible. 	-Occasionally, I couldn't make head-shots, at least I have really aimed their heads. I recommend that game those who played the 'ShadowWarrior Classic Redux' and those who like the single player action first person shooter games.			"

												Before you do anything, turn up the difficulty and increase your FOV. I haven't had this much fun and tension in a while! Or played a game with such satisfying melee mechanics. Each chapter is a good 30 minute chunk, just the thing I need for quick katana slicing sessions.At higher difficulties you need to use tactics and deal with the different enemies you get, so there is definitely some depth to it. The humor is alright and the graphics look great together with a world design refreshingly different, although the gore is almost comic. I'm very glad I picked up this game and I hope that more developers are taking note of its success.			"

												What I expected was a fun FPS game with a very good swordplay mechanic built in.What suprised me is everything else. The graphics, the voice acting, the storyline, the boss fights... everything that one may think not much attention is given to is actually one of the game's greatest feature.Great PC Optimization and awesome combat and cutscenes. This is a game that keeps on giving.Admittedly, there are some problems. The sword is too powerful and makes the myriads of guns in this game barely usable. Some levels are rehashed and is confusing to find which door, lever, or button to find in order to progress. And there isn't a whole lot of enemy variety.But damn, for a game that came out of nowhere, did it deliver. Just look at some of the screenshots, and take a sneak peek at the bosses and you'll know what I'm talking about. It is a very visceral game with huge thematic environments and a touching story with a good sense of humor. I can go on with these run-on sentences, so tl;dr: this is a gem that you should not miss!			"

												shot a rabbit while it was mateing and it turned super sayian and ♥♥♥♥ed me up gg 9/11 would interept bunny breading again. This is a brillaint old school shooter type game, it truly a amazingly fun game that brings back the feel of old shooters a like Doom and the orginal shadow warrior games. It has a great variety of weapons and enemies, the gameplay is smooth and the graphics a decent and well optimized. anyone that is a fan of the DOOM games and the wolfistien series need this game and if you arent a fan of those games this still worth taking a look. The story isnt revolutionary but the chacaters and dialog are pretty funny, but where this game truly shines in it gameplay so if you want a fun shooter/hack and slash get this game.			"

												Psst.  Hey, Duke Nukem Forever? This is how you bring a classic FPS franchise to the modern era while straddling that fine line between ""old-school tough-as-nails"" and ""modern accessibility.""I know a lot of my recommendations go on forever, so I'll keep this one short.  This is a great game, and a great mix between the old-school ethos of ""here's a bunch of dudes, kill them"" and the modern philosophy of ""it's called a learning curve, not a learning cliff.""  The gameplay is very much classic FPS, not a chest-high wall to be seen anywhere, but there's modern touches like character upgrades and health regen.  And before you lose it, no, this is not automatic ""run away and hide until you feel better"" health regen, this is health regen you have to activate yourself.  Sometimes in combat.  Y'know, like a big boy.Anywho, it's a tiny bit shorter than I'd like (14 hours on my first playthrough), but I enjoyed the whole playthrough start to finish.  It's a welcome update to Shadow Warrior: it has all the key elements of the old game, even very well done references to the old game, but with enough differences and updates that it is very much it's own separate experience.  Well worth a play.  Also well worth a sequel or some DLC.			"

												I've only played the multiplayer portion of the original game so I don't know where the story stands in Shador Warrior 2013 but the gameplay is quite fun. What makes the gameplay fun is that you have the ability to upgrade various skills and weapons, giving you different ways to kill enemies. I thought the game seemed a bit long for a single-player FPS but it was fun enough that I didn't get bored with it. It took me 17 hours to complete on normal difficulty.If you value your performance, disable the mirriors setting.			"

												Well, I'm at the end of my 4th playthrough (disregard play-time, dunno what's up with that) and I still intend to play more Survival mode. This game got everything right. I was starved for a good fps and this game hit all the right spots. Buy this instead of Wolfenstein: The New OrderThe story is amazing, except Chapter 16, where it get's a bit too serious in a bad way. The ending (ch. 17) is fine and very feely - nothing wrong with that. Chapter 16 just came off as... awkward(?). The transformation of the characters at that point is done a bit poorly.The swordplay is pretty cool. The enemy models slice up rather nicely. It's pretty accurate. The sword does seem a little bit overpowered though, because of the healing upgrade you can get for it. Not that there's anything wrong with that - it's a singleplayer game, and regardless of how strong the sword is, you will still want to/need to use the other weapons.Regarding the main character, some people said the original Lo Wang was better. I call bs on that. He had NO character. He was a pair one liner ripping pants that the player wore. The new Lo Wang is a lot better. He has an awesome character, but he's still badass, he still has one liners.I just wish I could get the classic katana somehow. I have SW Classic Redux, but I still can't select it. :(9.5/10 best fps in a loooong time. Looking forward to the sequel (fighting your way home through the Shadow Realm would be nice)			"

												Yes. This game was made by true game developers from former People Can Fly(which developed Painkiller).Although I totally recommend playing this game, I have several minor complaints for this game.1. Non-melee weapons aren't fun to use.There are:Pistol, which is weak and frustratingly slow fire rate so not worth using.SMG, it works, but boring. Crossbow, you only need this when some enemies stuck sy the wall.Shutgun, frustratingly low magazine size.Flamethrower, I forgot the very existence of this weapon because it's boring.Rocket Luncher, It works like any other cheap third person shooters for kids. Very boring.All guns require reloading. Reloading animations are pretty fast so why do they bother to implement it?I prefer no reloading for this kind of game.2. Enemy stuck at the wall.You advance the area by killing all enemies.But some enemies spawn at the upper ground sometimes stuck at the wall and won't come down to fight you.Sometimes, it can be killed by boring ranged shots, but they stuck behind the wall so you can't kill if you were unlucky.You have to load previous save to fix this bug.3. Confusing map design.Map is linear but some objectives requires you to search the area for interactive things to continue(doors, keys, breakable stones, corpses, etc).Sometimes, It's hard to find the interactive things.Once you failed to notice the interactive things in one spot of the area, you'll assume that area has been already searched and miss the tiny green glowing interactive objects.4. Fall damageThere is a fall damage in this game.I died many times thinking i can jump down the seemingly low platform but Noooo, the game is very unforgiving for falling down for otherwise almost invincible hero.5. Sprinting requires stamina drainIt's just annoying and totally unnecessary.I wish steam has a option for ""barely acceptable""			"

												Shadow Warrior is a game you should buy. Its story is surprisingly excellent and the gameplay is excellent as well.Story:I say the story is surprisingly excellent because the original Shadow Warrior had an awful story and the dialogue was mostly dumb middle school sex jokes. This game's story is unique (at least to me) and at the end you might shed a tear or two. While Hoji at first seems like the comic relief character it is later revealed that he is more involved in the events of the game than you think.Gameplay:I played this game on Hard so the effectiveness of the weapons is based on hard mode.This is a hack and slash / FPS game. Your sword is incredibly useful and you can perform Ki moves with it like a thrust, a spin attack and a sword beam attack. You can also use Ki to create a shield, a net to float enemies, and an energy attack. While the sword moves are useful the latter is not. I fully upgraded the net and it doesn't last long enough for you to do any significant damage that you could've done without charging it up. The shield is OK but you can already regenerate your health and it doesn't allow you to use Ki moves with your sword or certain special modes of your guns (anything that requires the RMB). The shield at least might be more useful in insane mode. You can purchase new modes for your gun like sticky bombs for your crossbow, a firing mode for your revolver and more. I would like to say that your shotgun is super weak. It does barley any damage against bigger enemies in Hard and it has a long reload time. A shielded enemy needed 3 firestorm attacks (both barrels) to die so even with the quad pack I would still have to reload. Here is a tip: In the luck section buy the richman I and richman II at the start of the game. Later on it gets more difficult to obtain Karma Points and without Richman the game will be less fun since you will never make enough to get the gun upgrades you want. The gameplay works like Fear. You walk forward, fight enemies and if you stray from the path you might find a secret with money or karma. You have regenerating health but you have to activate it by double tapping the D key and holding RMB. Doing this in the middle of combat is very intense. In combat while you do your Ki moves you can still use your guns and sword and even reload the former. So the combat involves alot of multitasking and hectic shooting and slashing.While some of the weapons and moves are useless to me they might be useful to others. Either way I had a fun time with this game and was surprised that the story was really good. In the game credits they place the credits of the original game despite only sharing its premise. This is a completely original game and you should definitely check it out.			"

												The game is really worth playing. At the start it begins to be quirky and has a lot of shallow comedy to it, but you eventually get use to it. You get surprised at the amount of details this game has to offer.The cutscenes and artowrk make it grand, visualy presentive and a good story to hold on to.The hero you start off with is really a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and the more you play the more you get surprised on how well the character development goes.That being said, the game has awesome gameplay mechanics and a LOT of upgrades to make you hunt for secrets all around the game, the visual representation really makes it worth while.Plus, you can use demon heads to kill other demons. That got me sold to this game.Its really a doozy, the more you play the more you like it and I would really recommend it to anyone.10/10			"

												A great old-timey FPS with lots of little flaws: very limited enemy and level variety; boring weapons; needless power and ability upgrade system; human characters look like mannequins; screen turns black and white below 1/3 health; ""use"" key required to pick up items; enemy melee attack distance too far for their animations.

												Shadow Warrior is what Duke Nukem Forever should have been, and could have been, but instead gives us the greatest reimagining of the classic asian themed shooter imaginable. Wang is back, and more bold than ever, saying lines that rival his 90's shooter counter part and greatly complimenting the old school shooter world. But where do I begin ? Shadow Warrior is a tongue in cheek title and yet the story, characters, and beasts you face are as intriguing as they are hilarious. Swordplay is out of this world, in that no enemy you kill with your trusty two handed samurai sword dies the same way. Blocking, slashing, dodging, and striking is as addictive as it gets, making you pine for such high standards of melee combat in other games. Wang's arsenal is every bit as explosive as ever, including machine guns, ancient spells, and even environmental weapons such as turrets and the like. Each level feels different than the last, with a difficulty that scales accordingly to the skill you will acquire throughout your first playthrough. All in all, a wonderful modern shooter.			"

												Loved it.At first it looked like a typical ""slice and dice fun"" game to me, but eventually I got really attached to the storyline as well. All that attention to detail, effort put into designs, all those crappy jokes. Everything was amazingly great. Even the combat never got any repetitive for me, despite some points of the game being just constant kill grind, which still was fun.One thing, though. Some parts of the game were quite choppy, such as the fact that you may easily die just by pressing Shift in the wrong place, because it makes you dash. In one direction. Straight. OFF THE STAIRWELL, DOWN WHICH YOU'RE GOING. Oh, and why the heck were the stairs at Hoji's workshop entrance floating in the air above invisible ground?...Anyway, it's a shame that my PC couldn't run it on proper settings, but visuals were still great even on lowest.Definitely recommended.

												Originally I thought this game was a bit of a joke having played the original ""back in the day"". But twelve hours in and this game simply rocks. Its the very essence of old school shooters with the polish and shine of a triple A title. How this only received 73/100 on Metacritic is beyond me, but the story is a bit on the comic book side. But it's Shadow Warrior, what else would you expect?For anyone who grew up playing Doom, Quake, Duke Nukem, ect., this baby will not disappoint. Compared to today's shooters I would place this game among such titles as Bullet Storm, Serious Sam, or Pain Killer. If you're looking for some run n' gun action with boss gear and hilarious gore, you've found home sweet home :)			"

												Before you do anything, turn up the difficulty and increase your FOV. I haven't had this much fun and tension in a while! Or played a game with such satisfying melee mechanics. Each chapter is a good 30 minute chunk, just the thing I need for quick katana slicing sessions.At higher difficulties you need to use tactics and deal with the different enemies you get, so there is definitely some depth to it. The humor is alright and the graphics look great together with a world design refreshingly different, although the gore is almost comic. I'm very glad I picked up this game and I hope that more developers are taking note of its success.			"

												Well, I'm at the end of my 4th playthrough (disregard play-time, dunno what's up with that) and I still intend to play more Survival mode. This game got everything right. I was starved for a good fps and this game hit all the right spots. Buy this instead of Wolfenstein: The New OrderThe story is amazing, except Chapter 16, where it get's a bit too serious in a bad way. The ending (ch. 17) is fine and very feely - nothing wrong with that. Chapter 16 just came off as... awkward(?). The transformation of the characters at that point is done a bit poorly.The swordplay is pretty cool. The enemy models slice up rather nicely. It's pretty accurate. The sword does seem a little bit overpowered though, because of the healing upgrade you can get for it. Not that there's anything wrong with that - it's a singleplayer game, and regardless of how strong the sword is, you will still want to/need to use the other weapons.Regarding the main character, some people said the original Lo Wang was better. I call bs on that. He had NO character. He was a pair one liner ripping pants that the player wore. The new Lo Wang is a lot better. He has an awesome character, but he's still badass, he still has one liners.I just wish I could get the classic katana somehow. I have SW Classic Redux, but I still can't select it. :(9.5/10 best fps in a loooong time. Looking forward to the sequel (fighting your way home through the Shadow Realm would be nice)			"

												Psst.  Hey, Duke Nukem Forever? This is how you bring a classic FPS franchise to the modern era while straddling that fine line between ""old-school tough-as-nails"" and ""modern accessibility.""I know a lot of my recommendations go on forever, so I'll keep this one short.  This is a great game, and a great mix between the old-school ethos of ""here's a bunch of dudes, kill them"" and the modern philosophy of ""it's called a learning curve, not a learning cliff.""  The gameplay is very much classic FPS, not a chest-high wall to be seen anywhere, but there's modern touches like character upgrades and health regen.  And before you lose it, no, this is not automatic ""run away and hide until you feel better"" health regen, this is health regen you have to activate yourself.  Sometimes in combat.  Y'know, like a big boy.Anywho, it's a tiny bit shorter than I'd like (14 hours on my first playthrough), but I enjoyed the whole playthrough start to finish.  It's a welcome update to Shadow Warrior: it has all the key elements of the old game, even very well done references to the old game, but with enough differences and updates that it is very much it's own separate experience.  Well worth a play.  Also well worth a sequel or some DLC.			"

												14 hours worth of game time so far after beating the game on normal and this has been one of the best games that I have played in a long time, I really do hope to see more from Flying Wild Hog.  The style, the sound track, the player movement, story, characters, VOs, combat, upgrade and RPG elements of the game and more combine to create one of the best FPS games that have come out in years.  A good story driven by a comic book, still picture images as well as the in game narrative which was good all the way to the end credits, a sad but good ending.  Honestly the only times that I didn’t have fun was when I died trying to get into some secret areas that were across water, pro tip the by way, Lo Wang is hydrophobic in this one soooo look for alternate paths if you’re hunting for secrets, that and the last mini-boss fight, man infuriating, but doable.  The game environment is very lush and varied; there are certainly colors in this game rather then generic brown or muddy colors and textures.  At times you might have too much stuff flying around, artifacts, effects and so on floating around which may distract you, however all enemies pop out and are very well contrasted between them and the background.  The sword and combat system are just so sweet I really didn’t think I would like it this much as I’m more of a gun kind of guy I surprised myself by favoring the sword over firearms, most of the time anyway.  However that’s this games major claim, the rpg element to this game is very well done allowing you to choose what your style of combat, whether it’s aggressive, defensive, healing, loot, or range, the skill trees are well done in that respect as well.  The gore is so sweet, dismemberment is fairly accurate and satisfying as are the special Ki moves that you gain and use.  That is one problem I had with the button combination system in this game, in later harder levels you will be hard pressed to do the button combos while in direct combat with mini bosses plus hordes bitting at your heels, I found that sometimes the system would not register my frantic button pushing for regeneration and I would just continue trying to dodge fire while attempting to problem solve.  Another problem that this game currently has is the weapon damange, even with full upgrades you will be hard pressed to rely on anything BUT your sword, everything short of the rocket launcher is needlessly weak.  This can cause problem in the higher difficulty settings since most enemies have higher hit points then they do in say easy or normal.  There are some points in this game that scream bad design, a few mini boss fights, some enemy units and the second to last large fight are just a few that make me wonder what the developers were even thinking.  With the added bonus of the Special Edition I still have 2 other melee weapons to choose from and as I understand this game one beaten has an extra mode where you keep your level and powers and continue on.  You probably will not get all of your skills and powers leveled up to the max on the first run, if you have a loot and secret guide you may but I like it, making going through the game on another run, possibly on a harder difficulty palatable and possible to me.The sound track was very good as it sets the pace well for each fight and calm moments, I rather liked it.Honestly I’d say buy this game when you can, either on sale or full price because right now, it was well worth the money and only later did I start to get more used to the combo system, I’m pretty sure on my second play through I’ll enjoy it just as much or even more.  I would say support Flying Wild Hog, as for me, they have earned it.			"

												I definitely have more than 1.8 hours logged in this game. I definitely put a lot of time into it. It seems like every few years, a game with a rather hilarious and egotistic protagonist goes on to defeat waves of monsters for no particular reason. This is one of those games, although there is some reason involved with it. If you have played and enjoy games like Serious Sam, Duke Nukem, Doom and Rise of the Triad, then this game is for you. You take the role of a character named Lo Wang who is contracted to pick up an ""old sword"". The game evolves into quite a fun surprise and the levels are nicely detailed with rich visuals. The controls are nice, such as the combo attacks. You can be a badass with just the katana you carry, or you can be a badass with guns too. While this game may seem to be quite linear, it is exceptionally a good linear shooter. The humor in the game just puts the icing on the cake; with very funny words from the protagonist and other characters you involve yourself with. You essentially do nothing but slaughter everything in your path, and the game does hard effort into splashing viscera when you wield something as significantly sharp as a Katana. 8/10Pros:+ Thrilling and nicely paced Shooter/Slasher.+ Beautiful level design and details.+ Follows the traditional FPS, more fighting less bull.+ The humor hits in many moments, even important ones. + Lots of secrets and ways to tackle fights.+ Excellent Multi-Monitor support.Cons:- No Coop.- No mod support.

												I had almost forgotten unbridled joy in an FPS, but Shadow Warrior reminded me. The carnage is fantastic, whether you're using the most basic sword slash, or the most explosive gun. It is rare that I find a game I have a genuinely hard time putting down, but Shadow Warrior is so damn fun that I just kept playing. Also, for a game that takes itself so unseriously, the story is surprisingly poignant. I really can't recommend this one enough.Playing the sequel has made me realize just how compact and well-paced the first game was. There was exploration, but being linear let them curate what you see and where you go a bit better. The simple weapon unlock and upgrade systems meant you were spending a tiny amount of time in menus, and most of your time killing stuff and playing the game. Also, Hoji is the most amazing wisecracking ghost sidekick of all time. This thing regularly goes on sale for like $5 or less. If you're even remotely interested, it is so, so beyond worth it at that price.			"

												Played my random roll a few times now, total about 2 hours. Shadow Warrior was a blast to play. It’s the reboot version from 2013. I’ve played a little bit of the old 90s version as well, prior. First off, the graphics are passable, but disappointing. It’s not that old but there were aspects to them that were almost downright bad. On the other hand, environments looked really really good and there are other aspects that look good. It runs very smoothly, though, so that also helps. I think I was in the 70-90fps range most of the time with my 5 year old hardware and there are a lot of monsters at times. So I played two levels, each about an hour long. The game starts off, you are going to buy a sword from some old traditional Japanese guy, you get double crossed and you get imprisoned. Sometime in between conscious demons erupt from the earth killing basically everyone in the most gruesome fashion. They are your primary enemies. The low level ones are basically sword fodder and rush you with their claws. Later I came upon some other type that shoot glowing balls, and then some giant warlord one that shoots fire and has a gigantic sword. Basically just kite and shoot or go in swinging with my sword for the little ones. The AI isn’t anything spectacular, but I wouldn’t expect them to be. The humans are pretty much just as stupid though. I’m pretty sure I heard “I got something for you BLADE!*” Combat is fast and somewhat frenetic. I used a sword 90% of the time. In the options you can change the appearance of the basic katana with a couple other things. Ice axe from Walking Dead (telltale? I don’t remember) some sort of bat, and the “penetrator” from Saints Row, which is a 3 ft purple d1ldo on a stick. Which is funny, especially when you unsheathe it like the sword and rub your hand along its length. I generally stuck with the sword though. With the sword you can also throw shurikens. Other weapons I got so far was a pistol that can be upgraded, a submachine gun, sort of like an uzi that is incredibly weak and almost worthless. A demon heart, that kills any low level demons in a very short radius. And then after I killed the warlord I could use his head (this is an unlockable ability) and it shot some sort of fire/energy from it’s mouth. You get a bonus in energy points (for ability unlocks) by doing a multitude of strike types against a group of enemies. Usually it just gets crazy fast though and I just hack away. Story is actually pretty decent. After hell breaks loose, you are still after the sword, for some reason. It’s a pretty big deal. You get the help of some kind of magic being that gives you powers. You start with a self-heal. I unlocked a couple so far, one being a blast that knocks enemies in a line into the air “oh look, demon pinatas!” and another that knocks them down in a radius. As well as a Ki strike that is pretty powerful. And I think I unlocked so ki strikes give me health. I’ve died a few times when absolutely overwhelmed, especially in corridor type areas that have a lot of explosives like vending machines and cars (why does a coke machine blow up like a nuclear device?!). The unlock section is pretty neat actually. For some you get tattoos, for others you color in classic Japanese prints, and then you can buy upgrades for your weapons with found money. I like it. Of course Lo Wang has his quips and remarks. They aren’t USUALLY repetitive, but I’ve heard the piñata joke enough times now. Oh yea, and it’s really gory gross. Mutiliated bodies skewered on spikes everywhere. Pools of blood and smears and whatnot. Monsters get hacked to bits from your sword. A lot of things are destructible, but could be more. On the other side, there are some really nice classic Japanese artwork pieces on the walls.  "

												I picked up Shadow Warrior, expecting yet another casual slash 'em up.But by God, I did NOT expect anything this awesome.This reboot of the classic Shadow Warrior game puts that horrible remake of Duke Nukem to shame, by being both visually stunning and psychotically amusing. As with the first game, you play the legendary 'Mr. Two Million Dollars' himself, Lo Wang: Mercenary Ninja Warrior for hire. He's sent to buy a legendary Katana for his corporation, Zilla Enterprises, and within the first few minutes of entering the Temple where the seller is keeping it, you get your first fight with sword-wielding Yakuza gang members. This is where the main selling point of the game comes; the violent, bloody swordplay we all love in games like this.If you think he's dead, best to make sure; even an enemy in the process of falling to the floor can be put into an even worse way with another well-placed swing, decapitating and dismembering your victim. Later on in the game, you get to do even worse when you're granted Chi powers and have a demonic companion following you around as a disembodied voice. And best of all, you get given guns.Glorious, glorious guns.These allow you to get even more immersed in the bloodshed, ripping off legs and heads from a distance. The upgrading system is simple, and shows exactly what's needed to unlock that secondary firing mode for your weapon. While this game may be very strenuous on lesser PCs, those with higher grades of computing are in for a real treat.			"

												Devolver Digital and Flying Wild-Hog have brought what Duke Nukem Forever should have been to the Shadow Warrior franchise. The swordplay makes melee combat much more fun than the gunplay; but the over the top 4-in-1 shot quad-barrel shotgun and the laser guided 3-in-1 shot rocker launcher really make a strong effort for attention. Tons of unlockable abilities and skills, and the ability to carry every weapon in the game simultaneously mean your arsenal never runs dry. From channeled shields, and healing spells; to spinning blade attacks, and one-shot charge stabs, no one playstyle is going to be ""the best"" really leaving you open to play the way you feel most comfortable. The level's are designed well, and there are tons of secrets to find in each one. The characters are all likable, and the dialogue is the perfect mixture of over-the-top action movie and video game/comic book nerd humor. The story is fine, no complaints, it's deep but never goes 2deep4u, it unfolds at a good pace and could be skipped entirely if you just want to cut more demons and dudes up with your Katana. Shadow Warrior is a fantastic game that all FPS fans should play, let the post 2005 gamers see why the retro FPS players always talk about how great the genre used to be. This game gets a #1 Super A+ out of ten/5			"

												I feel obligated to recommend this game. Fast, and responsive stylized combat with many different variations to approach every battle.The highlight for me, was the character development and writing. Not often where I can say I actually laughed out loud playing a game alone, as much as I did with this one. Will be doing my second run on a higher difficulty. I should add that I don't normally want to run through the same game right away, but the choices you have to enter every battle and the solid writing; I'll be diving in again soon.8.7 Wangs outta 10			"

												Im very picky when it comes to FPS games. Console focus titles like BF4, AssCreed, CoD, and all the other shallow franchises bore the hell out of me. They're made for casuals and idiots on console because therye are the easy money these days. So my high praise for this game, written below, should be an indicator of how good this game is.This is the most enjoyable FPS ive played in a loooooong time(Hard Reset comes in close second in recent years, also made by this dev). Partly what made it so refreshingly is the fact that this is a PC dev making PC games for PC gamers(being a PC version of a game is not the same. BF3, BF4, AssCreed, etc are all console focus titles aint idiots and their slower controls and audience) and its controls. This game's graphics is practically art. Theyve used textures, colored lighting, and post processing effects to make some truly beautiful and realistic levels. Their dedication to really good art also translates into the story cinematics that slowly unfold the backstory. It very much reminds me of Witcher 2. This game is very fast paced if you want it to be.  Its got plenty of weapons(each with a secondary fire), various powers and katana maneuvers, a lot of upgrades in 3 different categories(skills, powers, and weapons). Combat can go either way or a mix of both. You can either go heavy into automatic weapon use or just katana as its a very viable option for almost EVERY fight. The voice acting is very top-notch and hilariously witty at times. Shallow console focus publishers and developers can learn a lot from this dev. Theyve blended old and new game designs in a very awesome way.			"

												The game is awesome, problem is: even with all settings on the lowest possible and palying only on 720p and even a bit lower, it runs on my pc with about only 20-40 fps. Since my PC isn't all that bad, I'd say that it definetely has some performance problems.			"

												Shadow warrior is a great and funny game.Pros:Amazing sword slashing physics.Beautiful scenery.Dialog is hilarious and creative.Great story line and plot.Graghics are really nice.Enemy AI is perfect.Cons:Hard to get used to pressing a key 2 times to active a special sword move.Crashes constantly through out the game and at the end I got so fed up with the crashes I decided to just watch the ending on Youtube. But that might just be on my side.The combat gets very repetitive.I feel like the guns weren't really necessary and you could beat the game with only your sword.Other than all that, Shadow Warrior is a great sword slasher and I definitely reccomend it to players who like a great gory game.

												Great game, amazing how a shooter of this caliber could come out of today's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ horde of FPS games. Not as good as the original, but this is a damn good FPS by todays standards, pick it up and support FPS that isn't Battleduty 26 CurrentWarfare!			"
