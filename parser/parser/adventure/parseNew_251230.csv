												It's a pretty fun game, if you're into top down co-op shooters. But, really, look...I have an RGB keyboard, and the game automatically changes the key colors based on what character I'm playing and what abilities are active. And that's pretty wicked.			"

												I'm torn on this game.It frustrates me because the game itself is really fun!The whole running through a post-apocaltypic wasteland full of robots that you can mow down with an arsenal of weapons and 'functions' is hugely enjoyable.The story is predictable as all hell but I can forgive a super cliche storyline that sits somewhere between SOMA and A Space Odyssey.Where my frustrations lie is in how little of the game there actually is.You have a campaign that you can run on Easy, Normal and Hard, though you may as well rename those ♥♥♥♥♥♥Easy' 'Very Easy' and 'Easy' because the game itself isn't hard and as mentioned in other reviews you have unlimited continues, the only consequence to dying is having your score multiplier reset.The only other play mode is Survival Mode, which is exactly what you expect, though the area you use in Survival Mode is pitifully small, though thankfully it does actually get pretty damn hard around the 20 minute mark.And... that's it.A campaign and a survival mode.GAAAH!!!I'm just not satisfied! This is a good game, truly it is! To the Devs of this game I have this to say:1. Bring up the difficulty because this is way too easy and/or give us something like a Hardcore Mode where you don't get continues and the robots are genuinely hard opponents!2. You've got a real gem here, but there's so little to do! More modes, more Chassis' just... give us more! I feel you released this just a bit too early, or perhaps figured 'Ah that'll do' and held back. ------------------------------------------------------------------For now, I'm tentatively recommending the game. It is fun and if you do buy it, you'll enjoy what it does currently offer.But if you're expecting to spend days playing this, you're going to be disappointed.			"

												Livelock is a top-down cooperative/singleplayer shooter with RPG elements. Players can tackle the game’s campaign as one of three different characters, a long range fighter, a support character who can also play a medium range combatant’s role, and a melee tank. Along the way, gamers will collect extra weapons, and their characters will level up and get new active skills to help them fight against tougher enemy types.The story mode clocks at a respectable 6 hours, and there are three difficulty levels, which should keep players entertained for a few hours more at least. The character archetypes are different enough to change the game’s pace quite significantly, adding to the replay value. Solo players will be happy to read that all three characters are viable for a singleplayer run of the campaign (though turning up the difficulty increases the challenge quite a bit) so the game can potentially be played three times, one for each chassis type. After the main story mode is over, there’s also a survival horde mode which can be played solo or in co-op, offering a never ending supply of enemies that will satisfy even the most hardened robot killers.Livelock has a strong story focus, which is strange considering the game’s genre. Sadly, it’s a mostly by the numbers affair, with cliched characters and twists that can be seen from miles away. Basically, a cataclysmic event forced humanity to lie in a long sleep, leaving three cyborgs and countless machines in charge of the planet until they can reawaken the dormant humans. Players take command of one of the three cyborgs, fighting against an army of machines that has taken over the earth while their former masters slept.The voice acting is top notch however, and each of the three different playable characters has its own personality, blurting out one liners and commenting on the state of the world during mission briefings. Gamers worried about having to sit through the game’s cutscenes and long lines of dialogue can rest easy knowing that every story sequence can be skipped at the touch of a button.Graphically, Livelock is a very pleasing game, with plenty of eye candy wherever we look and an astounding amount of destructible objects littering each level. Audio design is also a high point, weapons sound powerful and the music tracks fit the action well.Livelock controls like a classic twin stick shooter, with the left stick or W, A, S and D keys being used for movement, and the right stick or the mouse for aiming and shooting. Both control styles work as intended, and the game disables joystick vibration on the fly if it detects that players are using mouse and keyboard.Most levels work the same way, with the player moving forward through the map and destroying everything between them and their objective. The game does spice things a bit however, spawning bosses, “upgraded” enemies (similar to Diablo 3‘s Unique Enemies) and different objectives from time to time. Luckily, the base gameplay is strong enough to keep players from being bored, and the scenery changes drastically from act to act. “Upgraded” enemies usually drop cosmetic loot that can be used to enhance our characters’ visual design.The game shines when playing online with friends, as each character complements the others, and gamers looking forward to an enjoyable cooperative experience will not leave disappointed.Ultimately, Livelock is a fun top-down shooter with fine tuned mechanics and gorgeous graphics. The story isn’t as strong as one could hope, but that doesn’t detract from the fact that the game will offer many hours of enjoyment for shooter fans.7.5/10 (Good)			"

Product received for free
 Target Audience:   Online Co-op Top Down Shooting Fans Summary:  Pretty solid all around in the online co-op top down shooter genre. While the story is as generic in the sci-fi genre as they come, the presentation makes up for it with some nice in game visuals and detail physics engine. But this is all about the gameplay: and it's solid in the genre. Guns are fun to use, and the chaos in battle can be pretty high, even if you aren't necessarily afraid of dying due to the games respawn mechanics. Score chasers will love trying to eeek out extra points with the multiplier system, and playing online can be a lot of fun with your friends. It's a shame that there's no local co op, as the game is best with friends that you can be within arms length of. But the gameplay is what shines here, as a good weapon and skill variety helps to deal with all the enemies that the game will throw at you. While the game may have some problems with replayability in the long run, for the 20 dollar price tag: it does bring the fun. And in the end: that's what you want: fun. Video:  


YouTube™ Video: Livelock(Review): Pew Pew, and More Pew! 

			Views: 572		

			Shoot everything. Twice. And Repeat. This Review was done with a key obtained from the publisher. Livelock is a top down shooter that you've seen before story wise, but that doesn't mean you can't...		

 Lists: Positives: Actually rather impressed with the level of design in the presentation. I don't know what it is about presentation here: the angle, the lightning, whatever it is: It really works. The customization actually works here. The different robots look pretty cool, and in particular with the capes, that feel like they fit in this world. Like using an emergency blanket as a cape. It plays to the dystopian world.  The gunplay is pretty satisfying. Switching between different weapons for each of the different situations makes you want to keep playing, as you can feel enemies being torn apart limb from limb. Good enemy variety, along with enhancers in statuses/different mechanics to keep things fresh. Overall, combat pace is good, and there's different missions/elements that help keep things fresh in the long run. Good variety in skills/weapons for loadouts, leading to experimentation against different enemy types. Score-chasers will appreciate the different measurables here.  Controls are solid on both the controller/keyboard mouse.  Good Voice Acting with the robotic tones. Feel mechanic, but works for the dialogue in question.Negatives: It doesn't advertise it, but having no local co-op sorta sucks for a game like this, where the chaos and shenanigans could be what really brings people together in the end. The difficulty is weird. Due to insta-respawning and it only affecting score, you never feel threatened. If you're not a score chaser, you'll find that the game may kill you a lot at high difficulties, but you won't feel a challenge.  Feels like the menu system needs a tiny bit of a revamp. It's more complicated then it needs to be in some cases, or at least that's how I felt.  Some story elements that the game tries to surprise you with can be seen a mile away. Popular quotes thrown in there for no good reason, and it can get extremely, extremely groan worthy. Little polish elements, like having to reset the music slider every time I start the game up to remind it what music level it's at.  "

												I have waited for this game for a long time and after playing it i feel somewhat let down. I must admit upon my first couple of hours i enjoyed it to some degree - i was playing solo offline to get used to the game, then however i entered a few online matches. Online Gameplay is very different, slowing down and some hideous sound clicking issues when the voice audio kicks in over the background fire etc. The part of this game i was most looking forward to is the most dissapointing of all - Survival mode, i  expected some streets/arena  to run around  with team mates blasting and running for your life.What you actually get in survival is the tiniest survival area i have ever seen in a game , its basically a small square of land always the same. One of the greatest problems is the game is just too easy, even on hard with unlimited continues you can just keep running through levels and eventually complete them . Gameplay is also extremely linear with a few walls you can break to reveal ""secrets"" these are basically score multiplyers.I couldnt recommend this game as i really dont feel there is enough content for £15 . Others may really be enjoying it but for me it was a waste of hard earned cash. As a result of the problems with the game i  requested a refund from steam however as i have played 5 hours ( virtually all offline ) i cant get one. So if you decide to purchase this game play it online immediately to see if the online / survival suits you . Not happy with the game , not particularly happy with steam refund policy on this one.

												I have been looking forward to this game for quite some time. I had watched a couple of videos created by people who apparently had early access to the game. It appeared to be right up my alley (I love switch stick shooters *&* difficulty).What I did not see from the videos or read at all in the description of the game on the Steam store page, was a deal-breaking design decision by the developers. This game has unlimited lives with no option to disable it. This means that the only true 'death penalty' to this game is your score takes a hit when you die. For some that might mean something, but for myself, I couldn't care less about score. I play these kinds of games for their progression (and the difficulty required to do so). As this game stands now, I have zero interest in playing it. You can basically finish the entire game, regardless of your skill, with time being the only factor (it appears you could just keep killing the enemies by dying and respawning on top of them... maybe there is an achievement for someone willing to try it!). I mean, you don't even have to restart the level at least... You just keep respawning.This isn't a review from someone who doesn't like a particular genre of game, but buys it anyway and then complains about it. I love this style of game. I'm hard pressed to find another game like this that chose the ""everybody can... errr, will... win"" approach. On top of this, the game is apparently fairly short. Not a good combo.The purpose of my review is to help others (who may not know of this mechanic) in their purchasing decision. Should the developers choose to give the OPTION to have lives for those of us who don't want training wheels on our games, I would certainly give the game another go. Since there hasn't even been a single reply to the threads about this that I have seen, I am doubting there is an interest.If Steam had a neutral review score, I would have chosen it, because I understand that some people might actually like the unlimited lives aspet of the game.

												Been there, done that. Made in Unity, by, what i presume, a rather small team of developers, but still polished and competently made. At least when it comes to performance and sound. Gameplay wise, it's rather mediocre. Too easy. A time waster, if you know what i mean. A game you pick up and rush through with your friends, for a couple of hours and be done with it. Which is a shame, because, as i said, the base technology is sound. It runs smooth, i encountered no bugs (except one (!), a disconnect during a mission, which i suspect was an issue on my end) and it's overall competently made and  rhe setting is interesting (felt very Transformers-like)But, don't look for any kind of innovation here. It's the usual ""level-up"" and ""unlock this"" while you progress through linear levels.Also, the game is waaaay too easy. I just picked it up and me and a buddy rushed through it until we got tired and quit. A little more punishment for defeat and thus, a need for more careful tactics, would have been great.As it stands, it's an orgy of lasers, an experience your rush through with no real skill needed. Which is a shame. I feel like great potential was wasted here.You see me giving this a a thumbs down. Don't take this as a ""the game's bad"". It's just not really worth your time nd money as it is. Buy it at a sale and only if you're bored and got a friend or two to waste some time.Still, props to the devs, who obviously put a lot of work into this.Man, never felt harder to decide whether to give a recommendation or not.

												The story is rather dull and after the first half hour highly predictable. For everything else, it's superb and it has quite a high replay value. I would love to see some kind of successor going fully ARPG in (pseudo) open world in such a setting, that would be very promising indeed!			"

												The game is really good for being what it is, a twin stick shooter. The graphics are incredible, the gameplay feels smooth, and there is a good bit of versatility in which character you use and which weapons you equip with them.  The only downside is it is pretty short.  There is replayability in going through the campaign with three different characters, all feel different than each other, also three levels of difficulty.Overall, at full price its a good game and will provide a lot of fun for fans of the genre, if you get it on sale it is a great deal.

												I'm playing with a friend and we really want to like this game.  It's fun while it works, but during almost every mission, we get out of sync.  I die, and on his screen I'm alive.  I lose the mission and he's still in the game fighting.  Crap like that.  When it's actually working it's great, but we can't seem to get through a mission without losing sync and becoming unplayable.  I don't see anyone else having this problem in the other reviews, but it's certainly ruining it for us.			"

												Do not listen to all the people whining about no local co-op. The Steam page for this game has never claimed to have local co-op (unless that tag was added by a community member), and a cursory glance at Google would allow for anyone to find out instead of buying the game and then complaining.Livelock is an incredibly fun Twin-Stick Shooter, with likable characters and some humor. Even with only having played the game a few hours (Waiting on friends) I've had tons of fun playing the game with them, as the co-op is done absurdly well. Livelock follows the tales of three humans who have been inducted into a project to transfer their mental state into artificial bodies, thus earning them the name of ""Intellect"". Tasked with ridding the scourge on the planet, the intellects set out with their semi-anonymous AI guiding them as they go. Explore through massive cities and wasteland as you small massive robots and quell bosses.Pros:- Well done Co-op, with each character within the game having a specified role, and none seeming underpowered.- Customizable skins for each character, allowing for you to customize your character with specific head slots, capes, and colors.- VERY WELL DONE HARD DIFFICULTY. Tuque has done an extremely sensible thing with their difficulties. Enemies don't become bullet sponges with each difficulty increase, but instead they do higher amounts of damage, so the game still seems extremely fair. If you die, it's your own fault.- Extensive controller support for Xbox 360 (unsure about PS3) with remappable buttons for controllers.- Drop in/drop out Co-op play.- Extremely satisfying weapons arsenal, and extremely satisfying skills for each character.- Massive Robots to smash.- Well done (however limited) weapon arsenal which has downsides and upsides for each weapon. All weapons seem very well thought out and balanced.Cons:- Storyline is nothing amazing. Whilst there are Codex's and whatnot for world building, the setting is rather generic, even though it seems the developer put a lot of time and effort into it, as well as much love. - Limited Upgrade system which allows you to only increase weapon powers/abilities with bonus effects as you level and unlock their upgrades.- Limited weapon arsenal. Whilst the weapons are extremely interesting, there just sadly aren't enough of them.What improvements could be made?: - Access to Steam Workshop for mods such as new characters, levels, storylines and so on.- Better upgrade system.Overall: 7/10. The game is nothing amazing or innovative, however it is incredibly fun, and has left me clamoring for more after each session with my friends. Don't listen to all the whiny people downvoting the game due to no local co-op, which the Steam page does not claim that the game has. If you're looking for a game which is several hours of fun, wait for the game to go on sale once more and pick it up.Worth $20? No. Whilst the game is fun, I'd suggest waiting for a sale.			"

												I would not recommend this game in its current state...It needs alot of work on balance before its actually gonna be enjoyable..for one the most squishy character is the so called tank his first weapon has over 6000 dps at level 1in comparisson to his later weapons that are around 500...as a test i tried playing with the tank at level 12 and Hex at level 1 and hex took on average two more hits from the same enemy before he died ... and he is the ranged dps ...the first ability that the support has (some sort of defense turrets) do more damage and has ALOT more hp then the tank...i was realy looking forward to this game and in its current state i would not even play it through if i got it for free ... and that is realy a shame ...i hope that this game gets the care it deserves and at that point i might try it again ... but for now ... its a major dissopointment...

												I have really enjoyed playing Livelock. It's a shooter where you choose one of three types of robots that each have their own specialization; the usual tank/DPS/support. From there you unlock new changes to your abilities and appearance which is really when I started to get into the game a bit more. I found myself thinking that the ""chassis"" (robot)- Which was catalyst(support)- I started out with so good that I wasn't too tempted to try the other types. However, my friends said the same about the robot types they were playing.Which drives home the real value of this game, in that it lends itself to a fun co-op experience and an absolute blast to play with buddies.

												Review of Livelock ( This game is almost entirely dead now... )--------------------PROS----------- Great graphics- Fun gameplay- Long and highly replayable storyline ( With a decent story. )- Great sense of progression ( Go from a random purple robot guy to a GOLDEN ROBOT GUY WITH A TOWEL AS A CAPE AND MICROWAVE OVEN FOR HIS HEAD! )- Good mix of difficulty- OST is the best thing ever. ( We're talking WildStar levels of music here... )- Great community ( I didnt get called a ♥♥♥♥♥♥! Thats more then I can say for every multiplayer game on Steam! )- Tons of achievements.  - Its a lot like Helldivers, Which is also a damn good game thats just like this one. ( Except its amount of DLC is on par with those greedy d**ks at Overkill. )- Its basically Destiny if they didnt f**k it up.CONS----------- Awkward keyboard controls ( You can remap them though, Thank god... )- Death is a bit too forgiving in this game, You go down faster then a paper airplane taped to an anvil, But you come back literally 8 seconds later with how fast the respawn timer is.- Dev's abandoned the game after only a few months, Only one update was made before they forgot about it.- Nearly dead playerbase.Thats it, Get it now plz.

YouTube™ Video: Livelock Preview and Gameplay (Xbox One) 

			Views: 1,275		

			In this video, we show a preview of the game ‘Livelock’ for Xbox One. Video was Recorded and Voiced by The Hidden Levels one and only Manic Ado.		

 Livelock is an online and single player top down co-op shooter. You control one of the last remaining ‘human’ robot in an attempt to save humanity from its ultimate demise and end. Positives:Lighting Effects and Level destruction – Throughout the level you are fed amazing eye candy with the great lighting and visual effects. To make the levels even more entertaining there are a ton of destructible such as walls, tesla coils and lots more!Visual upgrades to the Robot – In each mission you can find ‘body parts’ to visually enhance the look of you robot. I liked this aspect because it added to the customisation side of the game which I felt was mostly shallow.Weapon upgrade system – In the game you can collect resources and spend them to upgrade your weapons. The more powerful your weapons get the more resources you need to upgrade. They are capped however after 5 upgrade stages.Level design constantly changes - My biggest qualms with most twin stick shooters is that the majority of levels and level design stays the same. Livelock does an amazing job in switching up the level design and missions and sub missions. Throughout Livelock you will be required to defend, rescue, escort and even destroy enemy equipment. Leaderboards and scoring system - At the end of each level you are given a score which is then multiplied by the difficulty and then bonus is given for a less amount of deaths. Negatives:Robot statistic progression – When levelling up it would be nice to add attributes into each stat, such as X amount of points into Speed or Health. Maybe this is just the “RPG” warrior coming out in me but I would love to have extra customisation in the robots to make it feel even better.Different choices when levelling up – When levelling up you’re stuck with learning what is given to you. It would be nice if you could choose between two weapons or two buffs and perks creating a more unique and personal build. Instead you’re given a timeline with preset weapons and buffs.Lack of animated cut scenes – I absolutely loved the animated cut scenes in the game. The problem was the lack of them. I feel they were so good that I wanted more but in fact they only show up towards the end of each ACT. I would’ve loved to have them on each mission really filling us in with story. Hopefully there could be an animated series or movie in the future.Slight drops and freezing of gameplay particularly in act 2 – Particularly in ACT 2, the screen starts to drop  some FPS and even locks up when the big bosses show up. I had this one instance where the boss showed up and it locked my screen for around 20 seconds and then unfroze.Scan and protect – Towards the end of Livelock, it falls into the trap of scan target, defend the target and it starts to get a bit tedious unless you like those sub missions. I am not a big fan of them and seeing them repeat a lot more towards the end is not so great as it appears they are running out of ideas to spice the game or they wanted to rush it.Just the tip – A lot of the missions you are introduced to the levels boss quite early but upon beating him he will just retreat and appear back again as you progress through the level. I understand the idea with one or two bosses doing this, but with the majority of bosses doing it you feel as though they are not a challenge and it ruins the secret of what’s to appear at the end. Instead, the boss comes back whimsically after you beat him once or twice and has exactly the same moves and patterns with the idea that he will definitely beat you again.Personally my biggest problem with twin stick shooters is that they often or not lack content and end up being repetitive and quite shallow. Although Livelock misses out a trick with more in-depth customisation, it definitely makes up for it in changing level design and often changing up enemies keeping the game from not going stale quickly. The story line is quite vague and by this I mean I understood what went on but most of the context between main characters and enemies were mostly very cryptic which ironically made it lose its value of context.If you’re a fan of twin stick shooter games I would definitely recommend this game. I however, am not a big fan of twin stick shooters but Livelock kept me engrossed the whole play through and after the completing the main story I felt as though the main course had filled me up. However I did not have any space for desserts			"

												Good game, Too short. Dev said they are an indy company and have no intention of adding to the game and they feel the cost/content is justified and that it has a lot of reply value (which I disagree with. To me its a one and done game. Survival mode is a bit of a joke.. It's on a little tiny island*, and you don't get anything out of it other than bragging rights.). Content is about 8 hours long.  I returned the game but if they ever announce that they are going to work on editions, expansions, DLC, Content, etc then I will pick it up again because it is actually a good game.Very shiney and polished. Plays very well. Skills and upgrades were cool (though I wished there were more than 3 classes/characters).  I had no probs** with it at all other than it was short and the survial mode is kind of pointless and lackluster. Someone recommended Helldivers since I complained about content. Which I actually had on my wishlist but forgot about it. I'll probably look into that next.  I think my perfect vision of a game like this would basically be Starcraft in Diablo format. If that is ever made I will probably get fired from my job.*When I said tiny I meant TINY. You could fit the entire width of the island in two screen shots. **Day one there were some controller issues and freezing at the title but they patched it like 2 hours after it was reported to them which was pretty impressive. So kudos to the devs on that one.			"

												Pros:- fun gameplay- unique abilities and upgrades- fun co-op- decent story- diverse enemiesCons:- way to easy (I reccomend hardest difficulty first play through)- kinda slow matchmaking- price (I think it should be 14.99, however 19.99 isn't too much of a stretch)Overall I am enjoying the game, would recommend.

												Amazing game, i have not found any faults with it, the graphics are brilliant for what the game costs, alot of players say they find the story predictable and this puts people off, my advice is don't listen to that and try the game out for yourself, you might think its costs alot of money but i assure you, you wont regret buying it once you have become addicted to its great mechanics. I have to say it is one of my favourite games and i will continue to play it for many more hours.			"

												Overall it's a good game. But it's just strictly worse than Helldivers. Helldivers has a lot more variety in gameplay and enemy design. Livelock is very short. It's a 3 hour game and then you never play it again.If you like this game, get Helldivers. You'll like it better			"

												Livelock is a simple, but yet a great game that doesn't consume much of your time.Achievements: 100% completePositive+ Story is decent+ CO OP campagin (3 players)+ NO GAME OVER - which means that there is an instant respawn when you die. Awesome feature!Negative- Short game- Short customization on the chassis- Only 2 modes (campaign and survival)ConclusionThe game is totally worth the 20 euro pricetag. It's cheap, and it offers fun gameplay. Not to mention that it's easy as well, so if your into CO OP, you should definitely give this a try. I highly recommend it - especially to those players who doesn't want to play games that consume alot of their sparetime.			"

												I wanted to like it... I was a huge fan of helldivers, huge fan of Gauntlet, and these kinds of games and everything started off great. It's visually pleasing and colorful, you can track your character through the madness with the smart color schemes. The sounds were above average... and unlike my biggest gripe with helldivers you can't friendly fire (thanks random trolls that killed me and whomever I played with countless times). I even liked the campaign but it was awful when I tried to play online. Everything took such a big dive over and over again, and I ran into bugs. My controller would not work (I thought it might be the controller so used a different one and same and tried other games and no issue) and lastly I didn't really like the tank player. It seems like no one ever wanted to play him either. The shield is just really underpowered and it's like the tank was the most easily killed and that didn't sit right with me. It felt like I was on the cusp of many balance issues, and already have had many people tell me how short lived the game is. You do the campaign, some of those horde modes, but what's next?I think this game is a solid wait a month or so and see what the dev's do with it. Some balance, some bug fixes, maybe something more fun to do after the campaign and I'll try it again.			"

												Wonderful hack’n’slash and with robots All here is good, the action, first thing in a hack’n’slash, is captive, but easy is really easy, so try balance the difficult to your taste, easy mode is a piece of cake. Graphs are good, and sound is good, and history, not a strong point in hack’n’slash, here is good, with a decent voices on narrators. So it is fun. Just one thing with the design, they made a female robot with a bottom!?! What are they thinking? Female is bottom and breast, this kind of thinking at 21th century is just sick. Yep, this offends females and males. "

Livelock is a very decent top-down shooter that generally performs well as a whole but doesn't present anything spectacular enough to seriously distinguish itself.It offers well-executed classic core gameplay supported by generally decent production values. Looks good and feels good, except it never gets really exciting, save perhaps for its satisfyingly colourful visual effects.It's post-apocalyptic future is explained through a standard and predictable story line, where mankind has more or less been replaced by autonomous machines waging an endless war over conflicting evolutionary ideologies. So, time to shoot anything that moves.Partially destructible environments laid out across linear levels provide a minimum amount of exploration and a surprising diversity of enemies. Your arsenal likewise features interesting but basic upgrades and configuration options. The game's smooth progression is nicely set up to essentially give you one new upgrade per completed level up until the end of the campaign.Relentless action in some areas sometimes cause too many robot parts exploding all over the place that make it hard to distinguish the action. However, these segments are perhaps the most empowering portions of the game and the accompanying fireworks and light show are quite entertaining.Technically competent, except for the occasional sound cuts and overlapping dialogues. Unpolished camera work in some sections feel abrupt. Some collectibles for those interested.Character body parts very often intersect during their animations, and while this is not completely uncommon on biological character models it certainly clashes on futuristic war machines made of solid armored metal.Some missions may be too challenging to play alone but unlimited respawns at normal difficulty nullifies the problem. Playing with the rare occasional online player makes the game a lot more enjoyable but unfortunately the community is more than slim.Play this game if you like to blow stuff up and ask questions later (or not at all) but don't expect to get that ""just one more"" craving. Provides approximately 5 reasonably enjoyable hours for one playthrough with a single mechanical chassis, presumably three times that if you intend to play and fully upgrade all classes.			"

												It is a good game in co-op campaign mode, which took us around 6 hours to complete on normal (without rushing anything). During that time we had 2-3 bugs related to multiplayer networking. The weapon and robot customization options are alright - enough to keep me going at least. Story is rather predictable but music, graphics and general look and feel of the levels are pretty cool. Especially the parts where you explore underground areas with your flashlights. Also liked the voice overs.Controls felt tight and the skill visualization is top notch so I could always see what was going on in the heat of battle. Played the ""healer"" robot mostly which also felt very rewarding.Would give it a ca. 80% overall score. My only major disappointment was the rather short campaign.			"

												Hello and welcome to this review, lets get started!I played the whole campaign under 5h and i must say it was pretty interesting, i loved the hordes of enemies coming at you from all directions sometimes it was really challenging, most bosses was actully kinda lame i must say just an bigger version of an normal enemy,but then there was the speical bosses was really entertaining they had different special moves so  you could not stand in one place and shoot you had to move around and dodge their attacks or you would be killed instatly, about deaths i actully think the devs went too easy on it, for people who dont care about the score that much they dont have to think about it deaths, you have infinite respawns but i would actully like more of a challenge. One of the best Top down shooters i have played :)			"

												Livelock is a Scifi Top-Down Shooter in which you play a Machine implanted with the personality of a Human being called ""Intellect"" and after awakening from your glorious slumber you get sent off on your  merry journey to revive Humanity.The Game currently features 3 ""Intellects"" to choose from : The Catalyst which has the Ability to go for Healing but also features a Damage oriented Playstyle skillset.The Hex whose entire build is revolved around Flatout Burstdamage , Crit , High DPS and Mobility . but very squishy.The Vanguard who is designed as the Frontline with the ability to soak plenty damage , gain invulnerability , steal aggro in a radius , stun enemies etc.The Main Campaign features 20 Missions and two Survival Modes which are 15 Minutes Scorebased or Endless Survival Killbased which are most likely what u'll give a try after playing the campaign be it alone or with friends.The Game itself runs great , looks amazing , has a few FX that tank frames and a fairly well told story to offer.The Issues with this title are pretty simple , there is simply not enough content for the price charged in addition to a few Personal Complaints here and there.The Co-op occasionally refuses to build up a connection to open ported hosts , the game in multiplayer occasionally freezes up during loading screens in addition to the Predictive Online Mode what people tend to call desync. It is fun to play don't get me wrong , but the content for longtime replayability simply isn't there.It has a great Design with beautiful graphics.The Combat feels satisfying.You aren't forced to play 1 specific set of skills (even though the selection of 2 out of 4 isn't a wide variety)The Character lines are hilarious.There is a Variety of Enemies to fight.Now to the sorta meh parts.Ai Occasionally gets stuck out of bounds.Bosses can be circled , cheesed , stunlocked.Statserver isn't syncing for certain Maps.Some weapons are just outright broken while others are exponentially worse.Multiplayer without friends to play with is pretty much dead.( Taking Desync into consideration .)The thing with these kind of Games is that you have to like them , if you consider yourself a fan of this genre i recommend you to give it a try just for it's beauty and combat despite the lack of content .

												My normal weekly gaming group was looking for a new co-op game so I took the plunge and convinced 2 others to do so. I enjoyed the game play, artwork, soundtrack and voice work, however, finishing the co-op game in 5 hours was just so disappointing, especially since we didn't rush through it. My personal rule for gaming is you should at least get 1 hour per dollar spent (unless its a bundle/sale situation) and this fell way short.Also, in my opinion, replayability is not really there because there's only so much you can do with the weapon/ability upgrades per class. They top out way too fast and there's not a lot of depth, I guess you would say. The damage output and tolerance variance between classes is pretty crazy too.I hope there will be some DLC or other content on the horizon and if so, I may give it another spin and possibly change my recommendation. Until then, I really can't recommend you spend your cash on this title.			"

												Livelock is a refreshing top-down action game with super sweet 360 degrees of action. The attention to detail, soundtrack, and most importantly the gameplay, is locked down for enjoyment. I really enjoyed Livelock. The sci-fi references, cartoon intermissions and soundtrack make Livelock feel like a classic rebooted with beefy graphics and slick animations. But it’s a new piece of action gaming that I highly recommend to gamers who want to enjoy something fun and different to what is out there today. Two bits up for Livelock!

												When I first saw the trailers, I *really* wanted to like Livelock. As a longtime Dliablo player, and  Hell Divers player as well, I was hoping soemthing fresh and new with Livelock. I've played it for a couple of hours so far.When I initially got into the game world, I was really impressed by the quality of the graphics and the destructable environment. However, once I saw past that, the game began to seem relatively thin. The game now appears to be a grind of the same mobs in similar cirdcumstances - battlign in war-torn city scapes.Although there is some plot: a goal to find the encryption keys that would let us unlock eden, it feels more like an excuse for the action than a true motivation for the character. The characters and combat are pretty, but something about the controls feel sluggish. I can't manage to precisely maneuver, beyond combat roles. It seems nearly impossible to avoid taking damage with the melee character, and the long delay between his keypresses and actions makes him feel bumbling. If you're looking for a limber coop shootemup, turn to Assault Android Cacus instead.Your characters get stronger as you level up, which automatically gives you new weapons and abilities, but I'm already most of the way through upgrading one of them. I was disappointed - it doesn't offer a shadow of the customization of any other RPG.I haven't met any other NPCs, and the only players I see are in multiplayer. The apocalyptic world manages to feel especially devoid of intelligent life in Livelock, and I struggle to maintain the interest level to carry on.			"

												Not a bad game, but littered with bugs. Some are some serious game stoppers, In fact I find it unplayable on windows 8.1 unless I use a controller - lucky I own one. If I use the mouse, due to have duel desktop configuration the game loss's focus, and as with alt tab, I am left with no choice but to end the game via the task manager - reload.. start again, with 0 xp or progress.so buy with caution.

												I received a free code through winning a contest at Partymatching.com (a great social place that is growing everyday, by the way! check it out).This is an initial review that I will come back to eventually, and it currently only covers CAMPAIGN MODE.Livelock has a lot of great non-stop, action gameplay, with (thank goodness) the occasional story/transitional pause in between levels.In simple terms, it's a 3D Diablo/MOBA/DOTA type shooter set in a futuristic world - a world that you destroy piece-by-piece in an effort to free mankind from evil AI.In a more complex sense, there are collectible units that you can use to upgrade a small suite of weapons, and abilities are unlocked on a set level-based timeline.For the negative (and this is to be taken with a grain of salt), I find the action a little too chaotic for me, and the controls are quite difficult without a controller - I'm using only mouse and keyboard. It's a shooter, no matter how you flavour it. Increasing difficulty with each level means your weapon progression is negatable for the most part. The classes are simplistic and although interesting.Now, that being said, I'm not the 20-something player I used to be and in my 40s I generally look into more casual gaming like MMOs and self-paced, story-driven games, or FPS games that I can control at my own pace.I still give this title a firm thumbs up for its action, upgradeable weapons, and unique class abilities. Special thanks to partymatching.com for the contest-winning code.  :)			"

												My review of LiveLock after getting all 50 achievements and doing everything in the game finishing it in 24 hours and the story campaign in 8 hoursGame Play________________________________________________________________________________________________________Pros/Cons--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Difficulty: This game is very easy but in this case I believe it *also counts as a con depending on game play style and likes and dislikes* is a boon to the game as it give this non-stop action feel and a feeling of I’m super powerful nothing can kill me--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------replayability/value:has replayability/value but the type of replayability/value it is very repetitive collection of audio logs leveling up the other characters completing on hard/er difficulty  achievement hunting *also counts as a con depending on game play style and likes and dislikes*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------the game play is very fast paced explosions everywhere characters dying left and right and respawning left in right very fun experiences single player and CO-OP this game only allows 3 way CO-OP i think i'll edit that if I’m wrong also survival mode is amazingSinglePlayer:is very fun but dose the best job at keeping immersion very high and you highly engadedin to the storyCO-OP: this is extremely fun and yes CO-OP has a chat CO-OP in this game is very good very fun the only thing i have to complain about is that all you get for matchmaking is a quick join and no detailed room select with mission type etc but the lobby system is much much better and very detailed compaire to the quick join buttonSurvivalMode: this is not all the best thing in the world but far far from the worst it is in the better then good but not quite amazing category it has balanced waves that scale in difficulty nicely it all in all it a solid experience and the arena is big but not huge nor small but big or slightly above average--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Controls: this game controls very well it is amazingly good but not quite the tier of literal perfection and you can remap the keys and use a controller *I have not tried a controller as I do not own so I have no input for it that part of the game*________________________________________________________________________________________________________Story: Spoiler freeVoice Acting:each character you play has unique speach voice and some unique lines the voice acting of good but not the most amazing i have seen so soild voice actingPlot: the plot of the game well is good if some what generic/cliche but all that means it was done a lot by other games etc but that dose not make the plot any less good and engadeing (and if you are a huge HUGE transformers mecha robot anything fan 99% chance you will fallin love with the plot as it is literal wishfullment for some mecha fans well it was for me)________________________________________________________________________________________________________Graphics:the visuals where amazing all around and the customization was extremely good you could make you robot look like 1000s of things or it gave me that feeling i personally loved all the visuals about this game and i would say yes it is beautiful and pretty and it looks as good as tera and crysis 3 in some of the aspects of the game but not all ________________________________________________________________________________________________________Bugs--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------this game dose have bugs and that can be game braking but you most likely 99% chance won’t get them as I had to do some pretty wonky things to get them to appear _______________________________________________who is this game for--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------it is for people in my opinion who love easy relaxing challenges that are fast paced people who loves robots mecha loves transformers that loves customization of the cosmetics and who love top down twin stick shooters and who don’t mind games only 8 hours long but love to replay to get all the side stuff done.________________________________________________________________________________________________________who is this game not for--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------people who love lots of unique content people who love a extreme/hard challenge people who don’t like robots of any kind people who people who demand a long open world campaign people who demand a deep detailed level skill crafting system akin to the witcher and fallout4/new vegas________________________________________________________________________________________________________do i recommend this game--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------myself as a gamer yes I do defiantly and if you are on the fence then wait till its for 10$s then get it as if you liked anything about the game i told you then chances are you are going to love it or at least mildly enjoy it________________________________________________________________________________________________________For a score of 1/10-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i give it a 8 and that is mainly due to the price tag of 20$ if it were 60$ that would be a 5 out of 10 as the game is amazing but it and if it had triple/penta the content at 60$ i would give the same score/maybe a better one depending of how much a improvement it was to this current version of livelock________________________________________________________________________________________________________Thus concludes my review of LiveLock very good game and a must buy for any mecha robot and transforemrs fan			"

												The game is solid coming from a little-known developer, but the main issue I have with the game is being unable to find other players. Is the multiplayer matchmaking not working, or are there simply not enough players? I have finding it hard to be the latter though.			"

												Game completed in under 3 hours. Game doesnt run smoothly all the time especialy in multyplayer. Once you complete the game there is no point playing it anymore unless you find doing the same thing 2 more times with 2 different champs insteresteing.Also make sure youve played under 2 hours of this game to get your refund otherwise youve lost your money and given your money to somone that doesnt deserve a penny.

												Predictable storyline, lackluster gunplay and the levels all play out in the same way. First section you're chasing the boss through the level while defending scanning points, second you're destorying key points or defending against 3-5 waves of targets, then a final run through to that boss character.The overal design and the soundtrack are ok, but in the end at this price for a 3-5 hour campaign I cannot recommend it.

												The artwork and story telling is awful aswell as the voice acting, however once you get past that, the game is highly enjoyable. Co-op is seemless, graphics are good (would have prefered humanoids rather than robots) game runs smoothly.If you want a hectic blaster and enjoy lots of things blowing up then you will enjoy this. Best enjoyed with friends though.			"

			Views: 46		

			This game is available from Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/251230 A quick look @ 'Livelock' My Thoughts: This game is Superb!		

My Thoughts:This game is Superb! The graphics and effects are really cool, the gameplay is fast and frantic. Response and controls are spot on. If you're afan of top down shooters like 'Helldivers' I think you're going to love this.... In fact it feels more action packed than 'Helldivers'.Game Details:Livelock is a co-operative top-down shooter where you play solo or with up to two allies to break the cycle of infinite war between machines. As one of the remaining Capital Intellects, your role is to unlock Eden and revive humanity.			"

												I want to thank Tuque Games for sending this game to me so I could review it on my channel. If you are looking for a good co-op game to play with your friends this is the game for you if you're more of a solo player give this game a pass because co-op is a lot of the fun to be had in this game. The story is not the best, but I am someone who would take game play over a story almost any day in the end this game does not deserve 74% but probably about 85% thank you for your time I hope this review helps you decide if you want to pick this one up or not : )My YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl2uCgZlmmWrkPnPJs6xGSg "

When i complained on the french forums, a french guy called me a liar, think it was a alt dev account trying to discredit the obvious they are trying to hide..Steam won't refund after 2 hours.. so i would wait for the 80% off sale before wasting hours on this...

												I absolutely adore this game, it's near perfect for me. Amazing graphics, sound, story, gunplay --the works. BUT IT IS BROKEN. Keep trying to play online co op (because there's no couch co op RIP) and it keeps falling out of sync. Yep, can't really play online properly if your dead but your friend is still seing you run around shooting...It is that bad.DEVS: FIX IT.			"

												Pros:-Livelock is an immersive post-apocalyptic dystopian twin-stick shooter with RPG and psychological thriller elements. The main story asks the question, ""what if all of humanity depended on the collective consciousness of tumblr made manifest in the form of three teenage robots?"" What ensues is a deep introspective journey into the heart, as three friends find out what it means to be human. This coming of age saga delves with almost uncomfortably keen insight into the struggle for self-actualization that lies in the no man's land of middle school angst. Forget everything you thought you understood about the human heart, since this game will take you on a masterful journey through every high and low of the human experience.Cons:-Just slightly too long to get your refund.

												the game itself is alright. but if you intended to play it on ps4 controller this game is NOT support.not only the default ps4 controller is not playable bcause you can't aim and shoot, you CANNOT bind like half of the button yourself because they cannot be binded by still functioning in key binding screen. i.e. O will cancel your screen so you can't bind it, R1 L1 will switch to next tag/page so you can't bind it. up down arrow will switch to next item so you can't bind it.and don't expect dev will respond at all, just check the discussion page. assume this version is what you are paying for.

												I found there was really no gameplay of interest in Livelock, charge forward and shoot. I hate the visuals, extremely bright neon effects while enemies are dim and often have dim weapon effects. I often found myself taking damage without realizing what from, of course it didn't matter because challenge is non-existent. The plot adds nothing but cutscenes that beg to be skipped.Extremely poor performance, there are very few enemies on screen and very little data to communicate but both frameskipping and net latency occur fairly often. Runs like it's made with the terrible Unity engine in other words. "
