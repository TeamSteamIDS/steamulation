But, Mien Fuhrer... this is only one part of the trilogy... we need all three parts to protect us...Right. So. Hum. Sniper Elite : Nazi Zombie Army 2. The title alone reads like the gaming equivalent of Sharknado. It probably should be the gaming equivalent of Sharknado, going so far off the hysterically ridiculous scale that it actually warps around to awesome. Let's start with what this game is not - It is not in any way to be taken seriously, it is not to be played with the kind of serious approach that one might use for say, Call of Duty. That's not to say it's easy or anything, quite the opposite, but to get the most out of this game, you need to stop, put your brain in neutral, and only then, run the game.The opening cutscene, using the ingame engine no less, provides a rather amusing explanation to how Hitler ended up meeting his maker at the hands of the very zombies he released in a sort of last ditch attempt to protect his empire. Yes, I actually had to watch the intro twice, the first time I was too busy laughing to make much sense of it all, but it's nice to know that the developers in this case played him almost as Ren from Ren and Stimpy. I near expected him to scream ""YOU STUPID EEEEEDIOT"" before pummeling his lieutenant with the mcguffin.YOU! TELL! ME! THIS! NOOOOOW?We're talking pure B movie brilliance, it's wrong in every possible way and yet the mixture somehow results in being entertaining, and that extends to the game. These zombies are not the L4D rushing mobs of screaming gnashing teeth, but rather the zombies of old. Slow, shambling, numerous. A slow and ever advancing wave of undead flesh, many of which are still decked in their uniforms and wearing helmets - this element is important, the gun modelling has been lifted from Sniper Elite V2 and as a result, deflections from indirect hits can and will happen. Additionally simply riddling a corpse with bullets isn't a total guarantee that they will stay down, more often than not they'll resurrect a short while after and require re-killing. The only solution, as with any good/terrible zombie trope is to shoot them in the head.Unlike Sniper Elite V2's unforgiving and often po-faced approach, this one allows you to go nuts with the entire toolbox, not bother with all the stealth malarkey and go right in for the bangbangs. The result is a significantly better game, playing to the strengths of the V2 engine, complete with wonderful moments where you see your bullet go through an X-rayed version of a zombie, causing havoc as it tumbles. Grenades, tripwires, all of the fun things are yours to use and abuse, and the result is -glorious-. Carnage and havoc and a bodycount closer to the somme  - and that's just the first level.The only real criticism is that the enemies don't change much, though the inclusion of kamikaze grenade holders and the odd Stormtrooper wielding a LMG do add some solid spice to proceedings, but let's be clear, you'll be shooting zombies. You need to like shooting zombies, a lot. This game hinges around that concept, see. It's in the Title. Nazi Zombie Army. There is an Army, of Nazi Zombies. You will be killing them. If that's not you're thing, you're in the wrong place.For an apparently throwaway game the level of options is obscene...Seriously, one point I need to highlight. The options menu. This game delivers. In every possible way, if you want graphics customisation ohhhh boy does it deliver. Every possible option, slider and checkbox in the history of GPU tweaking exists here. Same for just about everything else, if you can change it, there's an option for it. Suffice to say, the game can be made to run on a massive spectrum of systems and will scale up to some amazing levels of pretty at the high end, whilst still managing to look good even on modest budget systems. This game set the standard for the Trilogy, and that didn't disappoint either.You did nazi this surprise package coming did you...The game looks fantastic, runs and scales well, and delivers on a wonderful B-movie supernatural experience. If you go in expecting that, you'll get what you paid for, and it will definitely give you your moneys worth. In shambling, stupefying, and groan inducing entertainment.However...With the trilogy out, this now becomes something of a museum piece. The trilogy is now the place where all the cool kids are. This review will be held as a reference. But from now on, Sniper Nazi Zombie Army Trilogy is where people should be headed.Verdict : It's good, but the Trilogy is here... "

												Well. Where to begin?Ah yes.Jesus Christ.How this game isn't branded as 'Sniper Elite: 5000 for the Achievement' is beyond me. You want zombies? This game gives you zombies: thousands of zombies. And I'm not talking Left 4 Dead's hordes that cack-handedly slap you in the face in the hopes of making you feel bad, every single one of the shambling fascists is more than capable of dishing out a bucketload of damage before you're able to shoot or kick them away. And yes, this version of Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army comes with the ability to KICK. Thank God! A marked improvement over those awkward 'Oh God, it's right in front of me and slapping me with a torch, blindly noscope, blindly noscope!' moments from the previous instalments. I say instalments, since if an enemy was right in front of you in SE:V2, it turned into a frantic mess of you flipping your SMG out and randomly spraying. Oh! That brings me to my next topic: The new weapons. Well, I say 'new' quite losely, since they were in the previous instalment of 'Hitler Forgot To Say The Lord's Prayer Before Playing With an Ouiji Board', but c'mon. What you're given is the set of DLC rifles from V2, including the good old fashioned Lee Enfield and M1 Carbine (My personal favourite), and a few other new toys including the MP44 and Webley revolver. I'm not saying they're bad weapons; By all means, use whatever you like since one rifle headshot puts down any regular shuffler with absolute ease.But just know this: You miss a headshot, and that guy's probably gonna get right back up and smack you in the face with whatever is in his hand.Among the hordes of normal mindless grunts, you do have a few guys to keep you on your toes. There's undead Snipers in gasmasks, capable of leaping from perch to perch through a sheer disregard of the laws of physics. There's Fire Gods, which are 8 foot tall burning men that supercharge other zombies if you don't stop them, and those zombies run at you like they're on fire (They really are. What a nice bloke, setting his mates on fire.) There's everybody's favourite exploding runners, who run at you whilst screaming demonic noises that are actually marginally disturbing.And then, of course, there's your old pal: The giant, trench-coated MG42 operator that takes a good few headshots to take down.They never said this would be easy to play. One wrong move, you're surrounded. One missed shot, he's already back on his feet. One wasted grenade, you've only removed 2 out of the 16 that are shambling at you. But with steady nerves, you can get through it.Of course, your nerves are unlikely to be steady when you discover the darker secrets of the game. Hitler is long gone from the Fuhrerbunker, so that's just one less problem. You wouldn't really have had time to kill him, anyway: You'll probably be discovering disturbing easter eggs, keeping an eye out behind you, and all while everything is probably plotting how to rip you to shreds. Mannequins can move themselves. Lights can change in an instant. Things can wake up without warning. And Sieges can happen at any time.Yet, through all this, it's probably one of the best looking zombie games I've played for a while. Sure, the amount of mist and whatnot can play havoc with lesser PCs, so make sure you can run Sniper Elite V2 on at least medium before you give this one a go. Yes, there are probably more frightening zombie games. Yes, there might be games with a better co-op experience (EVERYBODY is going to be stealing grenades from each other in this one, so just get there first). And yes, there are DEFINITELY better zombie games available.But for Â£10.00, this is probably one of the best available for a tenner and does come with an air of fear you just don't see in games anymore.And what was that you just saw shifting down that hall?Better save that grenade, it's probably just another shuffler.

												Sniper Elite Nazi Zombie Army 2 might have one of the dumbest titles I've seen so far, but it's an excellent, but short, co-op game. It's fun if you have a team of 4 dedicated people that you can trust. I have to see that most of the people that play this game at least try to stay connected. I remember the first game being awful, just because halfway through a game you'd practically always be alone. People left whenever things didn't go their way. This game is, so far, different and as I said it's one of the things that make it (more) fun. The graphics are moody and the levels have a good atmosphere. They absolutely fit this game. The gameplay is the same as the previous game. You just shoot as many zombies as you can, usually with a sniper rifle. And once in a while a special zombie will appear that requires a bit of (team) effort to take down.Finishing the game shouldn't take too long; there are only 5 levels to complete. Granted, they're pretty big and should take about 30-45 minutes to finish, usually going from point A to B to C while fighting off hordes of zombies. All you need is a good team. I'm sorry to say that once I finished all of these levels the desire to finish them again was non-existent. Which is unfortunate, because a co-op game should be all about playing with people. I guess it's because the levels are always the same and the zombies always spawn in the same places. So once you've seen it, you've seen it all. That's not a good thing for a game that's all about multiplayer.That doesn't take away the fact that it's still a very, very enjoyable game. Just don't expect to play it for days and days.[Rating: 77/100]			"

Posted: November 3, 2015
												This game surprised me. Truly.How many times have you not heard the concept of ""Zombies have been done to hell and back. It's boring now, cliche, and generic 'horror' material. A solid go-to concept that game developpers, movie directors, and halloween costume fanatics go to in an effort to get the desired effect of creepy spooky scary, with minimal need for customization and story writing.""Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2, pretty much takes every preconception of Zombie themed horror games, and puts a bullet in its head with the carved words ""Suck my tallywacker"" put in the side.""I don't care that I'm generic. I don't care that I'm cliche. I don't care that I'm 'just another zombie flick', and I most certainly don't care that my storyline is on-par with World War Z! I'm a zombie game, where you snipe zombies, and magic is the cause. Don't like it? Go F yourself!""That being said, Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 manages to do something few titles have managed to do before. Take something cliche, and make it fun.GameplayHave you played Sniper Elite of ANY kind before? If yes, then you'll find nothing new here. Gameplay has gotten zero changes from the father-title Sniper Elite V2.For those who havn't:The gameplay takes place in a linear third person shooter type style, with predetermined 'jump out and get you' moments where entire flocks of zombies appear from around a corner. There are two moments in the game: There is traveling, where you're moving from point A to point B, with a few handfuls of Zombies to shoot here and there, nothing too stressful. The other is siege, where you hunker down in one spot, and put down trip wire explosives, land mines, dynamite etc., while sitting in your perch and trying to kill every zombie before they overwhelm your position. Between those are safe houses, where you can refill everything, and where you'll get a free checkpoint.""THIS SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE LEFT 4 DEAD WTEGELKJBGKLAWBGKI""Yeah, it does, doesn't it? That's cause it pretty much is L4D, except that it is in 3rd person, and only two kinds of zombies can run.GraphicsSlightly outdated, but that's due to its engine being a few years old now, but it is definitely good enough for medium range rigs and up. I can attest to the fact that a computer more than 4 years old will not run this title above 5 FPS unless it was a top end rig in its hayday.SoundI can best explain this by drawing a paralel to the once popular, now garbage TV show 'Lost'. You all remember how amazingly good that show was, but then the creators just started dragging it out, adding more and more bullcrap to it, until they tried to end it on a good note, and failed MISSERABLY!?!? That's pretty much what the sound is for me in this game. It's the one major draw-back in my book;The sounds in the start of the game are pretty good. Really spooky scary, demonic whispers from Satan's world where you hear Hitler repeat sentences like ""WE ARE ALL LOST!"" and women crying for mercy etc. That's all pretty damned cool, and it really did a splendid job at setting the mood........Until you play through like 4+ levels, and realize that the music soundtracks...Ambient sounds...Hitlers little frantic demonic time looped yelling? Is all the same, unchanged. By the 6th level I was literally able to to IMMEDIATELY mimic Hitlers words cause they were on a time loop that I eventually learned by heart cause I started to count the time between them(It's 7 minutes and 30 seconds by the way).The music though, is good, if a little uncharacteristic, but it's good music to shoot nazi zombie brains to mush with, so I'm not complaining too much in that regard.Conclusion:Walk into this game expecting a linear, poorly narrated story that pretty much says 'unholy relic turns dead into zombies and only the relic holder controls them, assuming all parts of the relic are together....Which Hitler didn't quite realize until it was too late.' and you should be fine. I'd say its worth it, and to add a boost to the fun, the game permits many different difficulty varieties...The lowest to get a feel for the genre's controls and getting used to the playthrough etc. all the way up to Sniper Elite difficulty with a multiplier that goes up to as many as 4 times as many zombies as there normally would be(By the way, that means that for every 1 zombie in the normal game setting, there would be 4 extra ones in the highest multiplier)Naturally, the 1x(Standard) multiplier, plus the regular difficulty settings, are intended for single player playthroughs, whereas the multipliers are for the hardcore games where you cooperate with 3 other players. Yes, there's multiplayer by the way!I'd say, if you're into Zombie Games, and you have a group of like minded friends who want a shooter where you shoot magical satanic nazi zombies? Then this game is pretty much specifically created to suit your needs. If you're one of those 'ZOMBIE GAMES ARE DUMB, THIS IS DUMB, MAGIC IS DUMB, SATAN IS DUMB, I WANT Call of Duty BACK' people, then I suggest trying Hello Kitty Online instead...Yeah, I went there, deal with it.

												This game feels more like an expansion than a sequel; however, like its predecessor, it is only a $15 game that goes on sale regularly.The combat is almost identical to the first.  The biggest issue that I've noticed is that it wants to be a co-op ""shooter"" over a co-op ""sniper.""  There are far less areas for sniping and many more tight corridors and small rooms.  There is an addition of stationary turrets in some parts of the game.  While we all love a good stationary turret with unlimited ammo to blast zombies with, the machine guns can take from the experience that the first Nazi Zombie Army was going for.A few new enemies were implemented to help mix up the game-play.  None of them are ground breaking or innovative, but they do add to the game.It all comes down to how much you enjoyed the first game.  SE:NZ2 is a fun, but it is not an epic title.  I personally found the achievements fun to hunt with a group of friends.One other thing to take into consideration before getting this game is the lack of players.  The match making, like the first game, is dreadful.  If there are any public players on, you'll be lucky to find a team anyways.  Be sure to have a group of friends to play with if you are looking for a good co-op experience.

												What would happen if, in an alternate timeline, the Nazis had a secret backup plan once they realized they were losing WWII: turn all the dead soldiers into zombies? Well, you'd get the basic plot of numerous video games and movies, I'd reckon. The Nazi Zombie Army subseries (which branched off from the Sniper Elite series of games) of games takes this basic plot idea and then gives you pretty much what you'd expect: an action-packed third-person shooter where you either work alone or with some friends to stop the Nazi zombie menace with the best tool at your disposal: a sniper rifle.The BreakdownSo, what sets this game apart from other, similar titles? Well, I'd say the ""bullet time"" mechanic, where the camera briefly follows sniper rifle bullets as they whiz through zombies' faces.....but Sniper Elite V2 already has that. Hmm....well, it has co-op! Though....Nazi Zombie Army 1 had that too.... So, hmm. It's hard to discern what makes this game unique because, quite frankly, it isn't. This game barely even differentiates itself from the first game in the series, and that's perhaps my biggest problem with it. I enjoyed Nazi Zombie Army 1 to an extent, so I was excited to try out the second one with a few friends. As we kept playing, I began to notice that this game was basically identical to the first game, with only a few minor differences. The ""story"" (if you can call it that) continues off from where the first game ended: 4 soldiers have just fought some zombies, and now they're trying to piece together some sort of relic thing to stop them. So, NZA2 (as I'll be referring to it) has you moving through 5 bland-looking levels, shooting anything that moves, You have the option of bringing along some friends (which essentially breezes you through the game, even on the hardest difficulty setting, at a pace of about 2-4 hours per playthrough), or playing alone (which makes the game considerably harder - I beat NZA1 solo and it took 5-6 hours or so, and I'd imagine this game would be similar). Your opponents consist of generic-looking WWII soldier zombies, skeletons, explosive suicide zombies, ""fire demons"" (more on that), and ""elite"" zombies with machine guns that are pretty tough to kill. There's also zombies that summon more zombies and even sniper zombies (getting tired of the Z-word yet?).Well, are there any new additions? No, not really! The only noteworthy difference from this game to the first NZA game is that there's now ""fire demons"", which are essentially zombies set on fire that then set more zombies on fire to charge at you, similar to the explosive suicide zombies. They don't pose much of a challenge, and nor do most of the other enemies. The only real challenge comes when the game sends multiple elite zombies at you during ""sieges"", which are moments when the game wants you to hunker down and fight in a small area against numerous zombies. These moments are initially fun, but as the game progresses they serve to simply waste your time and add unnecessary padding to an already dull experience (in my opinion, of course). In fact, I'd say that a lot of the game's problems boil down to it being initially fun, but not particularly exciting thereafter.It's a shame really, as I somewhat enjoyed NZA1. I'm mainly just disappointed that Rebellion chose the safe route in making a sequel by changing pretty much nothing from the first game and simply continuing what already existed. It's a lazy sequel, and a painfully average one at that, too.Oh, and it doesn't help when a sequel has the same final boss as the first game.ProsInitially engaging from a gameplay perspective. The first hour or so is pretty fun!The bullet-time camera is always laughably silly and visceral to watch.Graphics are what you'd expect from Rebellion: somewhat beautiful, though nothing incredibleSound design is functional and fits with the enemies.Tightly optimized (from my experience, at least) for great performance. The decent amount of options is quite nice too.4-player co-op (with a solo option as well)! Always a plus.Collectables (bottles to shoot + gold to find) are well-hidden.Steam achievements, trading cards, and a leaderboards/score system.ConsLackluster, lazy cut-and-paste gameplay from NZA1. Expect very few new additions (one new enemy at best).Visuals (especially the textures) often look muddy and not particularly polished.Lack of variety in options, gameplay-wise. There's a few sniper rifles, 2 shotguns, some SMGs, a few pistols, and some explosives, yet they all feel the exact same as their counterparts.Feels very ""grindy"" at times (especially with the plethora of unnecessary ""sieges""). Some of the achievements ridiculously go beyond what is sane, too (one of them requires 5000 kills).Music isn't particularly interesting.More bugs and glitches than the first game, at least from my experience. My friends and I experienced multiple crashes and even a few game-breaking bugs (one of which involved the final boss not spawning four times in a row).5 levels, each at around 25-45 minutes long. This means that playing co-op, you'll probably blaze through the game in about 3-4 hours or so.It's lacking in the horror department, if you're interested in that aspect of the game.ConclusionSniper Elite is a fun, engaging series of third-person action games. Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army is a fairly solid spinoff from that series. Yet, it's hard to say that the sequel to it does anything fresh or exciting. If you enjoyed the first game, you'll probably leave feeling at least a little disappointed, though you may still enjoy it. For those who didn't play the first game though, you may end up quite liking Nazi Zombie Army 2.Final Verdict: 5.5/10 "

												This game is FUN!Some tips:-it can be scary, i jumped a few times in some situations, its more horrific then the first one-it has its challenge, distance is your friend, dont sit there and let them come, move!-grenades, mines, remote detonations will help you mroe then you think, plan your movements based on the horde, dont waste a grenade on 1-2 zombies-dont always go for headshots, unless their the zombie with the mg42 (only way to kill him)-killing summoners can be tricky but a headshot does the job, so recover your breath-in closure areas you got to move-create kiling zones, did you see 300 where the Spartans funneled the enemy army into a narrow corridor, same concept, but put distance between you and them, adn you will get group shots!Pros:-Its very fun, i couldn't stop playing - i put in almost 7hrs in my first play-levels are huge!-levels are extremly detailed, and spooky these guys I think put more in this version then they did the first SNNZA-you'll notice that if you own the dlc's you will play them but they are so detailed and setup you almost wont recognized them, either way, i find part 2 to ahve more levels, and detail then the 1st-bulletcam is real fun, never see the same shot twice, and you never get tired of it-achievments are fun to getcons:-wish it were like sniperelite v2 where the zombies were already on the map, depends-would like to see more monster types or bosses rather, still real good for what it has-more levels with light, like daylight, why? Its to scary :D-more zombie types, theres quite a variety as it is, but more the merriror, sometimes you get a couple of the same coming at you but its no biggies, its pretty varied and randomOverall if there were a part 3 I'd get it!love this game!

												An upgrade from the first one for sure. New enemy types can be challenging, but fun to kill. Slow-mo camera is always fun to watch with headshots & nut shots. =p I still wish there more maps, but enjoyable overall.			"

												This game is a simple survival co-op Nazi Zombie themed game, the game is pretty fun honestly, but it's pretty much only an expansion pack for the first game in terms of hours of content. If you can get the game on sale sure I'd say it's worth it, it was bought for me as a pre-order but I can't say the price is justified. -Great art style-Nice spooky area designs-Nice music-Kicking zombies to deathBad-Weapon choice isn't too great-Not enough bosses			"

												This game is fun enough if you just like running around shooting zombies, there might be some parts that will seem impossiple or very hard to finish, but just remember to use grenades and explosives + headshots, and everything will go fine. There might be some issues running it with tolerable fps if your computer is old or just a rock.			"

												As cynical as it might be to release a quick follow-up to a third-person shooter in one of the most populated thematic genres of the last generation then, Sniper Elite Nazi Zombie Army 2 is nonetheless another diverting exercise in brainless co-op action.Not a revolution, but that was not the ambition â shooting Nazis was and it still delivers a relatively solid amount of fun, spiced up with the visualization of bullets, ripping zombies apart.It does feel more like an expansion rather than a sequel. I was expecting a bigger evolution, but still, if you enjoyed the first episode you'll enjoy this one.			"

												This game of a sniper trying to cure or extinguish a Nazi Zombie apocalypse is not only immersive and entertaining for hours on end, but has a campaign that will scare you and tear you apart. It is based on the WWII time period, with a character equiped with the skills to snipe, spray lead, chuck grenades, and luckily to overall survive. Work your way into the heart of the Nazi Zombie Army to put a stop to the evil lurking in Germany once and for all.			"

												NOTE: IT'S A GOOD GAME! The ONLY reason I can't recommend it is because ""Zombie Army Trilogy"" includes all three games' campagins, remastered, and more, making this kind of useless! Just buy the trilogy.Otherwise, very fun co-op linear shooter with at least one other friend; otherwise it's just okay...but much more difficult. and at the same time, odd, given the cutscenes always show 4 characters, even if there's just 1-3. Controls are a touch odd, takes a little getting used to, but not bad. A lot of fun scenarios and levels, and while I liked the campagin, took only about 5 hours...tad short, not too much replayability IMO, but if you can grab it on a sale... which brings me back to my original point: just buy the trilogy compilation.

												This is a fun co-op game!  Zombies and Snipers.  What a combination! Haha!  I think the graphics and sound is great.  Game play is awesome.  Up to 4 players co-op and it's the best enjoyed with friends even though you can play it single player.  With this version they have it so players can join while in mid game which is AWESOME!  Version one didn't have this feature and even though that game is also great it sucked not having that feature.  Lots of weapons to choose from.  Game play can be pretty challenging if you ramp up the difficulty and number of Zombies.  Some pretty massive and brutal hordes come at ya.  I can play it for hours and not get bored.  It didn't get rated that high by critics and some people complain about it but I think it's a great time and have no major complains about it.  Seems to be a pretty stable game.Not a lot of people playing with open servers so plan on getting friends to join you.  There's no kick option so if you have a retard join your game you're out of luck.  Be warned that it takes team work to be successful so play public at your own risk of possible disappointment.Zombie games are burnt to a crisp lately but I recommend this one.   "

												This is a saired review with Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 1 as both games are practicly identical even to the achievements one can get playing them.Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 is quite a unique zombie game when compaired to the rest zombie games that we 've been hammered with the last few years. It takes the unique sniper gameplay established by the game Sniper Elite V2 and implements zombies into it. Quite simple really but at the same time glorious. Theres really no counterpart for landing the perfet headshot on a zombie and then watching the bullet slowly turn the zombies bowls inside out. It never gets old. In addition to shooting zombies with your sniper rifle you can use both an SMG of your choise and a trusty old pistol , and trust me you ll be using those a lot more than you 'd think, which is something I really enjoyed seeing as how both the SMG and the pistol where left practily completely unused when I played the Sniper EIlite V2 game. The zombies are also masterfully done with each enemy type having plenty of unique animations that make them seem remarkably realistic and terrifying. These are the strong points of the game, as unfortuneatly it does come with some weak points. First of all the entirety of the maps available to play on are recycled material from the game Sniper Elite V2 that just have had a paint job of blood and satanic symbols done to them and then mixed to make new maps. For someone thats played the game Sniper Elite V2 this is quite disapointing as you are not greeted with anything fresh as far as sceenery is conserned. The game itself is also quite small containing only 5 levels, each lasting about 30 mins on the highest difficulty. However it should be noted the gameplay does give the game some replayability. The story is also quite monotonus and dull and moreover most chapters goals are ""Survive the siege of zombies"" or ""Clear out the Zombies"" something that adds to the general apathy you ll develop for the games story. By far the weakest point of this game and one that really saddens me is the fact its almost completely dead. Out of 2 days of playing during christmas and while the game was on sale I barely got into 10 lobbys ,and in most the same people kept coming up. For a game thats based around team work this is a big minus. Most of the achievements available while quite simple required a 4-player team, and so it was a real struggle getting them all. And it is realy a shame that this game has been abandoned to such a degree because its a really solid, good game.To conclude , Sniper Elite Zombie Army 2 is a unique, fun and an overal great game. It does have its drawbacks and it is for the most part dead, but if you manage to gather some friends, or build a group using the steam forums its a must buy for any zombie fun out there.			"

Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2		* 7/10The Nazi Zombie Army is back and angrier than before, but we're ready to take them downThere's no need to go in depth, nor to say too much. The plot of the game goes ahead, but just like in the first chapter that's more like a pretext to make you face Nazi zombies together with your friends. This is the kind of game you just play and have fun because you play with friends and it doesn't need any particular story, nor complicated mechanics, just go and shoot or snipe on the hordes, that's all, really. Why the fun? Friends of mine just love wave based coop games... Or zombie games. I can live with it but I've been simply struck by the 80's synth music and that foggy atmosphere that really reminds me of Carpenter's movies. That's my weak point: 80s. Believe me or not that made the difference to me with other common games: the opportunity to play with friends against nazi zombies in foggy villages with an 80's synth music.I could spend a couple of words about the awesomeness of the slowmotion effect during successful sniping shots and the x-ray cam to see which bone has been broken by our bullet, but that's not the news, something already seen and already done, in Sniper Elite v2 or in Mortal Kombat as well.The most important thing I can say is that this is the second chapter, which comes after the first chapter (of course) and there's also a trilogy chapter, which holds the first, second and third exclusive episode in an improved engine (not much, just a little bit).So while I recommend this game, I actually recommend you to buy directly the trilogy because this situation doesn't make much sense at all...+++PROs+++ ZOMBIES... NAZIS! COOP!!! Facing Hordes of Nazi Zombies with your friends? You've just nailed it, without anything too complicated. ATMOSPHERE. Foggy roads and villages, rubbles in towns everything while you listen to some 80's synth music. Simply perfect!---CONs--- MANEUVERABILITY. A common problem with Sniper elite 1 and V2, the caracter's moves can be a bit too rigid sometimes, and it may cost you your life while you're surrounded by zombies. MEANINGLESS EPISODIC PRODUCT. For some odd *cough*MONEY*cough* reason they released the first and the second chapter on their own. Then they released a trilogy with both of them and the final chapter. No discounts for those who already owned the first 2 chapters, no single third chapter as well... None of the two chapter is worth buying, it makes more sense to take the entire trilogy.I played this game on this machine:Intel Core i7-497016Gb RAM DDR3GeForce GTX 660Windows 10 Professional x64 "

												Let's be honest here.  It's essentially the same game as Sniper Elite V2, especially as far as mechanics go. The sniper rifles look and feel the same, the shoot them same, the still fill you with excitement as you hit a headshot from 900 yards.  Nazi Zombie Army 2 is essentially a re-skin of V2.  You'll find yourself in some of the very same maps and locations, recognizing much of the same scenery as you did the first time around.  However, there's one important difference:  Every single one of these maps has been decimated by war and they're filled with shambling zombies! There's a couple of details about this game that makes me love it, just a hair more that V2.  Almost all of that love steams from atmosphere.  Nazi Zombie Army 2 is fantastic in that atmosphere department and I'm not even talking about the zombies.  I'm a horror fan.  A big horror fan at that.  I co-host three fairly popular horror podcasts, so I'd like to consider myself well versed. (Check the links in my profile if you're a podcast fan!)  The devs took a lot of time and research to make the horror tropes in NZA2's looks and sounds really pop to make this a really stellar horror experience.  From the very start of the game, we're struck with an orange color pallet that screams Halloween.  The music is an homage to bands like Goblin that have crafted many common themes in the genre to make the game even sound familiar if you're a fan of horror movies.  It's just a really great package as far as horror nerdery goes! Then, we get to the zombies.  Even theyâre creepy!  Theyâre also a good homage to horror nerdery, pulling more from the Romero Zombie well vs. the Zak Snyder fast zombie well.   The shamble, wobble and lurch, which makes getting those sweet sweet headshots all the harder.  But those headshots will happen.  Youâll get those amazing slow motion long distance shot ending in an x-ray that shows the bullet pass through the skeleton of your zombie of choice.  This time around though, you can feel all giddy and excited without feeling bad for it.  Youâre shooting the undead, not other humans! The only note to be wary of with Nazi Zombie Army 2 is that it is clearly designed towards a co-op experience.  Most missions end in a âsurvive the wavesâ shoot-a-thon that while flying solo, can be a bit tiresome and difficult.  You can play solo however!  Just make sure youâre going to have to work for it a bit harder.			"

												Great game for you and all your friends to play together. The zombies in this game come at you and you shoot them down with a sniper rifle, Assault Rifle and Pistol, sometimes you will find a shotgun which you will wish had more ammo. The gameplay is fun, there is no real story except clear each section and chapter in the game. The online portion of this game is great when there are people online to play with, I would suggest finding and play with friends on a open mic so you guys can fully enjoy this game together. Great game, a great challenge with friends.			"

Posted: March 4, 2014
												Nazi Zombie Army 2 is a good game.  Just want to get that out before I start.The story to this game is pretty basic, something about piecing together this thing which will get rid of the zombies or something.  It's really passable, but it's not meant to have a story in the first place.Now, there are a few problems with it.  The largest issue is the length.  You can beat this game in probably 4 hours.  However, you could argue that for the price it's allowed to be 4 hours.  Now that's all opinion on how you like to spend your money, but for me, I would say for its 5 levels, it should be $10 rather than $15.This game has some great atmosphere, the destroyed buildings, to the gloomy skies, and the orange deathly glows, overall, it makes it just a great experience.  Although, I would say the level design is a hit and miss.  It's good because it's varied; it's not the same thing repeated.  It's a miss because the levels are kind of, well, not very exciting.  I mean, there are some great parts, but it's more of, meh level design.  Although, these levels do setup some very fun moments for sniping.  This is all just my opinion though, and like I said, it still does have fun levels with varied designs, but the levels aren't mindblowing.The real star here is the gameplay.  It's still very fun to blow zombies heads off and kick them down on the ground and blow their head off.  The gameplay just really makes the game and makes for a lot of replay value which pretty much overshadows the short game length.  It should also be noted that this game is a little easier than the first, I reccomend Marksman or Sniper Elite.  It's overall not as hard as the first, which is a little dissapointing, but there is always Sniper Elite difficulty.  Also, this game is not NEARLY as enjoyable if not playing co-op.  Co-op is how the game is ment to be played.  You don't neccessarily need to be playing with people you know though, playing with random people is almost as fun.  Although, this game doesn't do anything really different from the original.  It's pretty much an add-on, for what is an add-on.Overall, I love this game, and all the pros really overshadow the cons.  It's a fantastic game, that doesn't really do anything different than the original, but it's still great.  I reccomend picking the game up, especially if you have friends to play with!EDIT: I forgot to mention the bullet cam.  Well, it's still awesome :)			"

There are a couple new enemy types and that's about it. If you liked the first one, you'll still like this one. It's a decent coop experience, but not much more.Here's a link to my review of the first one.

												Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 is a direct sequel to NZA which was a spinoff of Sniper Elite V2. So direct that it's pretty much same gameplay but on different levels. Came out at the end of 2013, after Rebellion suddenly found out that NZA was a hit. Shoot more zombies from the third person view shooter!Multiplayer community is kinda there. Most likely you will find no games when you launch coop, which would start your own lobby. And then, only a few minutes later it will fill in fully. So yea, wacky like that.And eh, what can I say. It's not much compared to the first one. Setting got changed to be more of hellish-otherwordly thing of yellow color. It has a bit more of spooky moments, while not spamming demonic things as much as the first game.Shame about music though. It seemed to be more down the earth, not as much of synth rave personallity here.Not many additions to the game. There are turrets that are pretty good, unless you are doing solo. And yey, new sub-bosses, one looking like a demon from the thumbnail of NZA1.It's a bit less polished in a sense that I sometimes would see zombie getting stuck in geometry. Heck, on the 5th level after killing all zombies during siege I decided that something glitched and I got stuck only to find out after the second replay that there were sniper zombies in faraway towers, who spawned yet were looking at different direction, thus not noticing me and thus not giving themselves away with attacks.It's still not nicely paced for a single player either. There are actually few sieges that are literal hell to do in solo, since they are nothing more then almost straight line of space so you can't run around elites. You have to just outdamage them first. Because of it difficulty jumps around in solo play, very uneven.On other hand, coop is certanly better. There are more of interesting situations. There are no sieges that are way too dragged out. And there are less of filler moments with just normal zombies.But meh, it's more of same thing, just with a bit more elements and different levels. Probably better than NZA1. But it's more of a part of a bundle.P.S. P.S. It has different balance from ZAT. In ZAT kicks are much stronger, non-rifles are weaker, skeletons die from one kick. Turrets are weaker too.			"

												Great if you got friends to play this with otherwise good luck searching and waiting for a random game going on in the world now that it's apparently dead due to te triology release......and now with Sniper Elite 4 coming in the horizon, I'm guessing a quadrology will be released making this, the first and the triology a mute purchase....Too bad I need to get the triology to continue on with the story left from here....would have been nice if they made #3 a stand alone like the first two. :( I just can't justify re-buying both 1 and 2 just to get 3 unless it's really really cheap(myâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥is also very tight! :P) or I get it for free somehow.Anyways, onto the actual review:It basically continues on where you left off from #1 and kill zombies the old fashion way, going from point A to point B and surviving hordes, etc. Basically Left 4 Dead (L4D) like game, but this game has much better graphics and the zombie killing mechnaics is old fashion(also kill cam!), where the only way to kill them is by headshots, other means like shooting them in the arms or legs or chest, doesn't kill them, they'll fall down but after a few seconds, they'll come right back up and nawling at you! They're also slow so you should be able to easily headshot them, aside from the running suicide bomber.There are skeletons too, but their method of death is shot through the heart in the chest and not the head....You can solo this game, but unless you enjoy being a loner - you won't have much fun doing this by yourself...The game has partial SLi(on default SLi doesn not work) and Optimus support. For SLi, just go to this post to find how to enable it(not sure about CrossFire as I don't use AMD cards, or maybe CrossFire works out of the box for this game?) and for Optimus, go to your Nvidia Control panel-> Manage 3D settings -> Program settings, have Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 (nza2.exe) selected, and change to *High-performance NVIDIA processor when it says ""2. Select the preferred graphics processor for this program which is usually on default ""Use global setting (Auto-select: Integrated)"" for me. For laptops with AMD GPUs well, I don't know(maybe it already works on default?) as I don't have one so go google it or something for its equivalent changes..... :PPlaying this game on maximum graphical settings, including 4x SSAA on, will net you around 20 to 40 fps, but with SLi 770s @ 1920x1080, I was able to keep it at an almost consistent 60fps at the most part6 - I have a 144Hz monitor so naturally I would either need to turn it off or at most have it set to 2.25x so it sits around 120 to 150, sometimes lower to around 50 in some places even with SSAA off. But a single 980M, just won't cut it for 4x SSAA(and this is only at 1920x1080, think about trying to run this in 3840x2160, or lesser yet still somewhat popular resolution of 2560x1440!) in this game...hahaha, perhaps two in SLi would work....but mine only comes with one.... :P Plus laptops with SLi are like $4k+ - might as well build a stronger desktop/tower with its equivalent budget.Music and sound has the right tone so it gives us players the immersion we're after, therefore it's well done. I think this game supports surround sound, but not sure(or can't remember) I'll need to test it out some more to find that out. If it does, that's another plus for this game, especially for a zombie horror survival game like this!Yeah overal, I like the game so it's a thumbs up from me!=====================================Played on ""The Beast""i7-3970x, 64GB RAM, 2x GTX 770s 4GB VRAM, Win7 x64 Pro, 4x SSDs, 2x HDDs, Rampage IV Extreme, X-Fi Titanium Fatal1ty Pro, custom water loop, 2x BD-drives, TJ07-BW, 850W PSU, and many fansPlayed on Raikou (Gigabyte P35x V3): i74710HQ, 16GB RAM, GTX 980M, 128GB and 1TB SSD mSATA, 2TB HDD, Win 7 Pro x64, BD-R ODD, FHD display			"

												Sniper Eite Nazi Zombie Army 2 is a very good game. It lags a bit sure, but the game itself is very solid. The game adds a whole new story and adds many new enemy types, and makes way for an excellent game. I would suggest picking up Zombie Army Trilogy, however, because it contains a remastered version of this game and its a better deal with all 3 of them			"

												It's fun, effects are good - some zombies rush you and others lumber towards you. Different weapons, land mines, trip wires, etc. My only complaint is that it is not too open ended enough and the zombies I wish a had a little more variety. Still a fun single or better yet coop game.			"

												This is another shining example of how game developers appeal to your vice of killing zombies only to leave you with a mediocre experience. They sell you a product advertising a solo campaign mode, failing to mention, or advertise in any form that said campaign mode is virtualy impossible to complete on your own due to overwhelming numbers of enemies and a typical scarcity of amunition. You may be thinking ""ok well I'll just join an online game then"". Not a bad idea, except for one thing: no games can be found due to a lack, or non-existence, of online players/hosts. Why, simple, because no one is playing the game but you.That being said. Sniper Elite: NZA 2 isn't all bad. Here are a few positive and negitive aspects of this perticular title:Pros:- Excelent graphics- Visualy unsettling levels- Creative enemy concepts- Varied weapon choices in primary, secondary, and even explosive categories- Most enemies can be searched for ammo and explosives- Health is based on the stamina/endurance system (Call of Duty style)Cons:- Campaign is virtualy impossible to complete in single player- Co-op play unlikely (lack of intrest/player base?)- Ammo extremely scarce. Even with enemy looting you will only get to loot a certain amount of enemies. Even then there is no guarantee you will find the ammo you need.- Enemies rarely appear on their own and numbers only increase as the game goes on.- Enemies also increase in ""skill"" by gaining new powers or abilities (summons, elemental powers, and so on) these ""special"" zombies appear alongside the vanilla zombies and can appear without warning and seemingly from nowhere.- Enemy numbers are capable of overwhelming a solo player very quickly, even on the lowest setting. (especialy during the ""Survive the Siege"" portions where the player is trapped in an ""arena-style"" area unable to leave and must hold out until all enemies are defeated. This, coupled with the above mentioned increase in enemies numbers, abilities and lack of ammo, is one of the main reasons why I list the single player story as ""almost impossible"")Short version: Don't waste your time, don't waste your money. There is no one online hosting games to join and single player will get real hard real fast.			"

												Buy this game, but do so in a 4-pack. This game has some of the campiest co-op of any release in recent memory. With goofy nazi-satanic zombies, spooky skeletons, hilariously campy set dressing, and a crazy last boss, this game takes the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cake. On top of everything, its got the one thing all zombie games need: one option for difficulty, and another or zombie quantity, meaning that if you're not challanged enough, but dont want your Zambabos bulletproof, you can just double the size of the horde, assuming your PC can handel it (â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥). If you've got the dosh, buy it now, if you dont wait for it to go on sale, either way, buy it, play it, love it.			"

												While being more polished then the first game in the series (better levels, additional enemy types, better achievements) it is still a pretty lazy game as a lot of things are taken straight from the previous game for example they decided to use the same boss, again, as they already used twice in the last game. Once more its a game I can only really recommend for coop as the SP of it simply isnt very interesting.Overall the achievements are the same as the previous game in the series (most just have their name and image changed) but they added a few kill specific ones and some that require you to find some level specific stuff to reward some exploring which is a plus compared to NZA1. The grinds are still there and will take you quite some time to do.Time to 100%: ~15+ hours			"

												This game is alright, far from my favorite. NZA 2 plays the same as 1, the same 5 level campaign, that can be played cooperatively with friends, the same guns as NZA 1, and the same type of storyline and enviornment. This can get very repetitive quicky, as there is not much innovation and change from the original. After beating the campaign the first time, I have yet to pick up and play this game again, and do not have any intent on doing so in the future. If you have 15 bucks lying around with absolutely nothing to spend it on, this will provide entertainment for about 2-4hrs. Verdict? Do not buy NZA 2, until Rebellion puts something innovative and different in this crappy game. Save the $15, get something else.			"

												Surprisingly fun third person shooter. The Sniper series can be hit and miss, and Nazi Zombie Army 2 is no exception. At times you'll be extremely frustrated, at times you'll be bored, and then, all of the sudden, the gameplay shines through and you're having a blast.			"

												Well what can i say ive only 8 achievments to get on this game and there all multiplayer ones,but no one seems to be playing this online anymore.So any one want to join need 3 players.As for the game god ive not had so much fun for a long time just keep shooting hoards of zombies then watch the bullet in slow motion penatrate through the skull out the other side then in to another zombie.Or take out on mass big groups with grenades,mines,trip mines or jump on a mg42 and got nuts firing bullets ever where.As for sheer fun i would give a 9 out of 10.Why only 9 i think there should be more zombies just so you really get the feeling your fighting to survive.Theres many a moment ive felt my self being slowly backed into a corner as more and more came at me shooting throwing grenades and laughing at some of the bullet cam shots for me this is the best 4pound i have ever spent.Would i say buy it yes i would,if you like the Sniper Elites you will love this it really cures a stressfull day at work.

												one of the finest zombie shooters ever made? id say so :Dsniper elite nazi zombie army 2 is a direct sequel from the originala horror themed spin off of the awsome sniper elite serieseverything feels very similar to number 1 but throws in some new enviroments and new enemiesand the whole look is quite diffrent gives a hellish nightmare feel giving a overall some rly nice eye candy :Dthe x ray kill cam is one of the most unique thing in the series like  from sniper elite v2the kill cam follows the path of ur bullet showing u every gross detail even to the point seeing it puncture a lung or snap a collar bone lolthe game is highly accessible with it being able to co op with up to 4 players through its hellish campiagn as you and your friends fight for your very survival or if your a badass u can try it solo lolas zombie shooters go this is diffrent from the norm but it works it creates immersion esp when ur corned low on ammo with a horde approaching loland it drops u in a blood soaked zombie filled adventure with nasty surprises round every cornerthis is why nazi zombie army series for me is a left 4 dead beaterits unique fresh and excitingcommander shepard highly recommends it:D			"

												The second instalment to the Nazi Zombie franchise. Quite an interesting game, and it is a challenge when playing on harder modes, especially alone. But it can get quite bland after some time, and sometimes you can get overrun by zombies. I would deeply recommend to play multiplayer, especally with friends, or if you can find servers. I got both Nazi Zombie games on a sale, and played with my friend, it was quite long to find other players, which is pretty bad. I managed to finish the game but I didn't feel satisfied enough. But the game is still good, and if you like the theme I think you will enjoy it.Do I recommend it? Yes, for me I had the most fun on multiplayer with friends, but it's up to you how you will enjoy it.How would I rate it? 8/10, there were some minor glitches and bugs, a bit slower multiplayer than I expected, but still a game I enjoyed playing.

												I played this game with my friends pretty much all Halloween and I have to say it was quite a fun game to play. I had to do a sort of... hybrid... play style. I would use the assault rifles and pistols with a controller (easier to aim for me) and would have to switch to the mouse for the actual sniping.The enemies are rediculously resilient if you don't hit them in the head (that's zombies for you) but I feel like I'm playing Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City in terms of the zombies' ""Take-a-hit-a-bility""... (If you get this reference, then you feel my pain)I got this game for free from a promotion and honestly it would have been worth the full price. If it ever hits a sale give it a shot! The game feels like a mod but it's priced at DLC pricing so it's worth a shot... preferably at the head or else the enemy isn't going down.			"

												As much as i loved the NZA series from first playing its remastered version of Zombie Army Trilogy (ZAT), i cannot endorse or recommend getting NZA2 as its very if not extremely unoptimized from the fact that the game is not capable of achieving even a decent rate of fps at the lowest graphical settings despite the specs of my PC surpassing the recommended system requirements.A little information on the hardware i am running for this game : i7-4720HQ CPU(2.6GHz), 8GB RAM, GeForce GTX 960MAnother issue that i have faced in my brief experience in the game would the buggy pathing of the zombie AIs where they would be stuck at certain locations such as trying to walk up a staircase because their pathing collides with a wall.While this issue is nothing too game-breaking, it is very frustrating from my view as a player and game designer as it occurs very frequently and unnecessarily wastes time. All in all, I'd recommend saving your cash to get ZAT instead if you're truly interested in this game.			"

												This is a absolute blast to play with a friend in co op, provided you are in the same country/region or else you are going to have to try and play a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game that is based on getting headshots with a sniper rifle with a 150 ping or higher. This is by no means a bad game but should have been a DLC to the first game, not a sequel. As a sequel it is a completely suckâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥waste of money ripoff. It should have been released only as a $5 DLC for the first game. What makes this so disappointing is that it is literally the EXACT same as the first game with almost no real noticeable changes besides a couple new enemies, some new maps, and a new story (who gives aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥about story in a game called Nazi Zombie Army lol). The story is barely there anyway. You just pick up relics at the end of levels and hardly anyone ever says anything. The double barreled shotgun (aka The Preacher) blows away a whole group of zombies with one blast. But you only get to use it for a little while and it does not transfer to the next level when it starts, so basically forget i even mentioned it. Total waste of time for them to even put it in the game. It seems like the zombies jerk a little more now making headshots harder, but maybe that's just me. These games should be called ""headshot simulator"" because anything other than a headshot is, half the time, a waste of ammo. And you need all the ammo you can get. Mostly though you will have enough ammo, just be smart with it. Snipe anytime you can, pistols to kill skeletons, and machinegun only when necessary.Overall the exact, and I mean EXACT same game as the first which makes it deserve the bad reviews it got, but some new environments are cool. Pretty solid and fun for maybe a week or two, meaning it is absolutely worth the sale price I paid of $3.74. Do NOT buy it at full price, wait for it on a big sale like I did. 6/10A pretty fun game to play through once, especially if you have a friend for co-op. The second game is passable since it is literally the exact same game as this just a few new maps and a couple new enemies, so only get it on sale cheap if you couldn't get enough of this one.If you want the third game forget about it. They decided to not sell it seperately, only in the ""Zombie Army Trilogy"" for $50 and from what I hear it is the exact same game as the first two so it's basically the biggest ripoff on steam and imo one of the dumbest marketing schemes I've ever heard of. It was just on sale in the 2016 winter sale for $8 and that is the only time it is worth getting to get all 3 games for cheap, only if you don't have any of them already. If it's over $8 don't bother because you can frequently find the first two games on sale for $3.75 each and the third game offers nothing new. It's also hilarious how they suddenly got scared to use the word Nazi anymore and went P.C. with their new game title.			"

												This game is not worth $15, theres just not enough content. The story sucks and im pretty sure theres only 5 missions in the game (I forgot because the story was so garbage). You only do 2 things in the game which are: Running to the checkpoint while fighting zombies or surviving a horde of them. Also if you're planning on playing this game by yourself your're planning on commiting suicide. Theres really no point of playing this game w/out friends. The gameplay is okay, nothing too special and the slow-mo can get annoying sometimes.I do not recommend this game but if you really do want it, get it at a very low price and i mean LOW price, like for 2 or 3 dollars.

												I'm shocked how this 2nd expansion is identical to the first one: released half a year later Zombie Army 2 suffers from the same mistakes the first game had. Glitches, bugs, only 5 chapters (again, a relatively short game you can complete in a mere 5-6 hours) and a horrible algorithm that makes it extremely difficult for you to find players. I know for a fact that there are a lot of people wanting to play this game and finding hosts is very, very difficult. And even if you manage to start the game from Chapter 1 with 3 friends who are willing to play it till the end disconnections will be common between the chapters.Gameplay-wise the game is the same so in case you do not encounter any issues it is pretty fun. There are some new enemy types and some scenes when you can mount a gun turret having unlimited ammo at your disposal so you have no issues with gunning down hordes of enemies. And of course bullet time is still very exciting. Also, the environments now look different: this game is darker, more creepy and there's fire almost everywhere. I liked this as the 4 soldiers' mission to get rid of the zombie menace seems to be more desperate. Still, playing it without issues is difficult and it is a shame they could not correct the problem related to the game session finding.			"

												Itâs like youâre not even trying anymore, Rebellion. If we need a perfect example to describe a âcash-grabâ, then Nazi Zombie Army 2 is it. I would almost have been fine with how absolutely identical NZA 2 is to its predecessor, had the original at least been a solid game. But that is not the case. NZA was a seriously flawed game, that was only enjoyable if you tried really hard to enjoy it and three of your friends were willing to join in. Barely anything has been fixed or improved and virtually nothing new has been added. Going in, I had hoped to see some new levels that take more advantage of the gameplay but those were the same levels from V2 with just a thin coat of paint thrown on top. What were you doing for these past eight months, Rebellion?2/5Read more:http://pixeljudge.com/en/reviews/sniper-elite-nazi-zombie-army-2/ "

												Originally planned as a DLC for the original Sniper Elite Nazi Zombie Army game, it became a fully-fledged game later on, and I can see why, there is about as much content on this game as there was on the first game. Unfortunately, this game isn't as good as its predecessor. Which is a shame, because there are plenty of new zombie types that kept things interesting.The first problem comes with the way the zombies are animated. They often bug out, and twitch around at random. For example, sometimes, when they get knocked down, they pop back up in the standing position without any animation for a second. Another glitch is when they get stuck on each other and gets frozen in their animation as a result.The second, bigger problem is that, the level design is far more cramped, which is to the game's detriment, since this kind of gameplay demands the ability to outmaneuver the horde to a better sniping position, and there are certain spots in this game where that kind of luxury and mobility isn't afforded. In simpler terms, this game has a lot of dead ends that are death traps, and there are some cases where the only real way out is to push through, because those dead ends are unavoidable. This is in stark contrast to the first game where any instances of being trapped is the fault of the player, and not because of the level design. Another thing to add to this is that it seems to be specifically designed to spawn zombies on top of you out of the ground, which is also poor level design.Overall, while I do appreciate that they made the effort to make it not just more of the same, there isn't as much care out into the map design or QA done this time around. It is because of this that I cannot really recommend this game at full price. If you see this game on sale, then by all means, do pick it up, but $15 is a bit more than what this game is worth. Which is a shame, because in Single Player, it is 4 Hours worth of Zombie shooting with a solid netcode to go with the Co-op mode. If you are curious about this franchise, I would recommend that you pick up the first game instead of this, and only pick this up if you have to play more of it.			"

												After playing the first Nazi Zombie Army title, I was left dissatisfied with the game and decided to give the second one a chance. Released within the same year as the first one, will this be the game you want to play ?Story wise this game picks up as soon as the first one ends. We are dropped of by the boat on a dockside and we have a goal, we need to collect three relics which can stop the zombie apocalypse. Just like the first one it's not much of a story, cause apart from the recordings you hear in safe rooms and the pre-mission briefings, there's not much exposition. Now for record, I'm not a massive fan of Sniper Elite apart from Sniper Elite 2 which I fairly enjoyed.  Gameplay is a carbon copy of the first one and Sniper Elite 2. Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 feels like a mod rather than a full game. Everything from the menu and mission goals are borrowed from the first game. I felt like this was a cheap money grab than a full sequel.Soundtrack is the game's strongest feature. I love the synth music and it reminded me of the awesome horror movies that came out in the 80's. There's really not much to say about NZA 2 since it's basically the same game as the first one. I will try and to explain a bit more what I dislike about this series. The game is even harder than the first one. The combat takes place in small corridors and there's zombie hordes swarming you, so if you can't control the situation, you are pretty much done for. The game is even shorter than the first game. It took me 3 hours to finish the entire game and unless you plan on doing a second playthrough, it's not worth getting at full price.Overall this is a poor sequel and more like a cash grab. My honest suggestion is either get the two games on sale or get  the trilogy which is includes the first two remastered games which I hear are great. Overall Nazi Zombie Army 2 is a bad game and I don't suggest wasting money on it.Final Rating:4/10 - Wait for a discount or skipIf you liked this review please give it a like and if you disliked it, please post a comment on what you disliked.

I appreciated it wasn't a grinder with insane battles for no reason.  The first game seemed to take longer to complete, that or I just got used to the game mechanics.

												Since we have good reviews on this site I don't bother reading hte metacritic review score anymore.  A 53?  For THIS game?  Ridiculous!  This game is fun with other folks, you need to havea good four man on comms and cover each other's back.  It's the strategic sniper gameplay from the OG Snipre Elite V2 as well as zombies.  I have The first game and the second one and both are excellent ways to spend some time.  The only downside is the capmaigns can run a little long.  But the sound design, creature desing, the guns and the settings make this a must own.  If you liked LfD and Sniper Elite v2, YOU MUST BUY!			"

												Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2,  almost feels like DLC but it's so much more than that. Rebellion has learned from there mistakes and created a more fine tuned, optimized game compared to the original however the original is still amazing as well ;)If you want a very dark, zombie 4-player cooperative shooter, that really delivers a strong and intense level of gameplay then this game is for you. I have always loved the popular Nazi Zombies gamemode from Call of Duty but that's just a gamemode. This game along with it's predecessor have an actual story to them as well as a single player. When it come's to zombie games, this game is definitely in my top 5. I highly recommend you buy both of the Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army games, they are amazing and you will get hours upon hours of enjoyment from them. 9/10			"

												After looking for another co-op game to offer something new compared to the Left 4 Dead series I stumbled on this during a sale.  For FPS fans, the 3rd person view will take a bit of getting used to but most of us these days have played from both perspectives.  I found the NORMAL mode very challenging so played on CADET for a bit until I got used to the play mechanics, loadouts, and gameplay.  After getting used to it, its not so bad on the more difficult levels.  There are multipart campaigns with designated safe rooms like L4D, but at the end of each campaign/mission it launches you into the next rather than simply ending as I suspect the last campaign is the ""ending/escape""The zombies swarm you but in a very different way than L4D because they don't rush at you with a full on sprint but rather just emerge and move in large groups that tend to overwhelm just in sheer numbers.  The game relies on focused shooting with critical and headshots rather than brute force (like some other zombie games).  I do like the fact that enemies don't just randomly appear all around you.  That used to bug the heck out of me in R6 Vegas 2.  After you a clear a room it should remain clear and enemies shouldn't just spawn in instantaneously.The ability to use more than just standard grenades and giving the ability to set trip mines and proximity mines is pretty sweet but be careful not to be too close when they go off.  And if you set them too early they do self-detonate after a fair amount of time.  Using grenades, and mines creatively is very effective against the boss characters as they will mow you down with their big guns of you try and take them head on.This game was so worth the $3.75.  Fun as hell and looks great.  The co-op is fantastic.  You can't go wrong!!			"

												The Zombie Apocalypse has dawned upon mankind, Most of the world's population have fallen to the plague but 4 hardened survivors stand against all odds to survive this nightmare : xXx_QuiKScOpeZ_xXx the Russian, MLG_ChEzBurGer the American, BrutWurst the German and some other â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ who I never actually noticed. Can these 4 veterans overcome what challenges face them, armed with nothing but 360 noscopes and MLG ladder jump weapon switch quickscopes? Only you can decide.10/10 would wonder how Hitler found out the secrets of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Necromancy again.			"

												Another cool co-op zombie game... with snipers! but its really hard to find people still playing this one, guess everyone moved to the Triology one.I guess I can understand why this game isn't more popular, everytime you play it its always the same, but I still recommend it for those who love sniping game and co-op zombies.

												Here we go again, what can be more entertaining than killing hundreds of zombies in IIWW post-apocalyptic wasteland. If you liked the first game, know that the sequel to the zombie army game, is more like map dlc, as it adds little new to the game mechanics(new emenies and locations AND stationary MG's!!) Anyway if you played the first game and liked it, but got bored by repeating the same maps, you can try to survive a little longer in the continuing story of the 3rd reich nightmare.

												This is a fun co-op game! Zombies and Snipers. What a combination! I think the graphics, sounds and effects are very nice including the cinematics. I personally love the bullet cam cinematics, so dope! Gameplay is awesome and with friends is even more better! Up to 4 players co-op and it's the best enjoyed with friends even though you can play it single player. With this version they have it so players can join while in mid game which is AWESOME! Version one didn't have this feature and even though that game is also great it sucked not having that feature. Lots of weapons to choose from. Gameplay can be pretty challenging if you ramp up the difficulty and number of Zombies. Some pretty massive and brutal hordes come at you to surround you. I can play it for hours and not get bored. It didn't get rated that high by critics and some people complain about it but I think it's a great time and have no major complains about it. Seems to be a pretty stable and fun game.Nowadays, not a lot of people playing with open servers so plan on getting friends to join you. Be warned that it takes team work to be successful so play together and good luck, have fun!* 8/10 *			"

												This is not a game you play alone. This is a game you play with friends and the more the merrier. It's an incredibly fun game that'll make you laugh and swear at the same time. Enemies are harder to shoot because of their unnatural movements, unless you're someone that only aims for body shots and no headshots. It isn't an easy game. If you like challenges then this game is for you and your friends.You can't be disappointed with this game!			"

												I went into this game not really knowing what to expect, and ended up pleasantly surprised - it's basically a sniper-focused L4D, and as a result it's pretty dang fun co-op.It's worth mentioning that this game is clearly low-budget and rips environments and some of its level design directly from Sniper Elite V2. Having said that, the game plays noticeably differently than SEV2 - cover no longer matters, and ammo conservation is much, much more important.Definitely worth the 4 bucks I spent on it, though I probably wouldn't have spent much more than that.

												Buy this game if you enjoy killing zombies , and nothing but that OVER and OVER for hours. Great game for what it is , but the difficulty seems to spike randomly at points in the game ( One seige you could have a huge field to move around and kill stuff , then at another seige they put you in a stupid hallway with no room to move and one million zombies charging at you ) , thats my only gripe. Incredibely repetitive and boring but I can't seem to stop playing because I hate not finishing games. Would recommend for mindless zombie killing . Mediocre at best , glad I got it on sale or I'd feel like I got burned. 5/10			"

												This game is very fun, while the lag is not as bad as the 1st game, it is still an issue. You will be able to play on the laptop, it becomes difficult sometimes, while this game combines my 2 favorite game types: Sniping & Zombies, I don't enjoy playing it often nearly 100% because of the lag. If the lag guides help you, go ahead and play, but if you like me, tried what Devs have said to do, asked for help, got no response from devs, and help from community that isn't helping either, you begin to wonder: 'Is this game worth buying?'

												I was quietly looking forward to this game. The first one was in my opinion not the best optimized and in some moments quite annoying and hard to play due the effects but it was mostly playable and a very fun game to play even in singleplayer because you simply cannot connect to some cooperative game because there werent any. But i liked that game a lot. In this game the optimalization is even worse so its completely unplayable for me which is shame and i dont understand it.. Rather get the first one, but dont expect random coop, you must have premade friends with you if you dont want to play alone.			"

												5/10The franchise seems a strange one, while this mod is a complete re-skin and features new levels it feels like a mod... opps did I call this a mod?The game is (imo) only for a few hardcore fans... I liked the orginal, but finding players is worse than before, in fact its pretty hopeless! This sequal is ""more nighmare-ish"" with more fire, rivers of blood oh and (imo) A LOT more enemies*: (*If you play on the easiest difficulty, with the least enemies (X1) AND a full team its a total cake-walk)I'm sure I could clear every achievement, I'm thankful that nothing seems too difficult... But I wonder how many weeks or months will pass before I chalk up less than the 36h I took to nail the first game?-I'm not taking a dig at the 'length' of the game, I'm happy with the game I'm just not happy (like otherwise absorbed with) playing the game!

												quando eu vi pela primeira vez Sniper Elite Nazi Zombie Army eu pensei ""Sniper Elite V2 + Zombies ? acho que nÃ£o fico bom"" depois de um tempo tive a oportunidade de jogar o Nazi Zombie Army 2 e digo que ficou um game epico d+! Ã© muito horror junto, sobreviver sozinho Ã© quase impossivel, por isso eu recomendo e Ã© bom ter amigos que joguem com vocÃª pois o singleplayer desse game Ã© monstro! Ã© dificil d+! o jogo nÃ£o tem dÃ³ de vocÃª. Recomendo LIKE A BOOOSSSS!!!			"

												i had a lot of doubt about this game. But after seeing it go on sale i decided to buy it. i havnt finsihed the game yet am still currently playing now. So my review is about the first 4 hours of gameplay.Cons:  1. missions seem repetative            2. collision detection needs to be tweaked a bit. had a few zombies hit me when they clearly didnt touch me.           3. Not as open world  as i would have liked or thought it would be. pros:  1. Tons of zombies to kill          2. Decent amount of weapons you can choose from without having to level up to obtain.          3. really cool kill cams          4. Unless you play on the hardest difficulty game isnt too hard but still isnt easy.          5. levels seem to be pretty long           6. Multiplayer which i havnt been able to use yet since....well i have no friends haha. there are tons more cool stuff i didnt list just buy the damn game and find out yourself Xd its sorta like Call of duty world at wars Nazi zombies but you arent trapped in a small area.i give this game a 8/10  thumbs up			"

												Gameplay: 9.50/10Storyline: 8.50/10Graphics: 8.50/10SoundTrack: 9.50/10Overall: 9/10Given the original only came out around eight months ago, Rebellionâs sequel to their supernatural zombie sniper festival is most unexpected, having popped out of cover just in time to cash in on Halloween and no doubt extend the finances of the studio as they work on Sniper Elite 3. Nazi Zombie Army 2 continues the template laid down by the original almost to a tee, offering a series of corridors and open levels in which to snipe and lay down traps for the incoming hordes, wrapping its premise around the loosest and silliest of plots. Itâs still basic and slightly awkward, and itâs still 100% more fun when played with other people. Trading the Nazi soldiers for those of their undead cousins, Zombie Army 2âs combat takes shape as a series of shooting galleries, sometimes confined and sometimes open, often requesting the gang of four combatants to defend a specific location from assault on multiple sides. Physical barriers block progress until each and every last zombie has been dispatched back to the underworld, and a neat scoring mechanic allows for competition between groups as players vie for the highest tally of grenade kills, headshots and long-range bollock-busters (or the space where they used to be, anyway). My local Tesco has gone downhillThe plot, for those of you that are interested, takes into account Hitlerâs plight in the original game, with his âPlan Zâ now in full effect and overpowering even his own bunker. In order to put a stop to the undead hordes youâll need to find three pieces of an ancient artifact stashed away in various hellish locations far removed from the originalâs re-used World War II assets, with the majority of the new environments swathed in devilish flames and lit with hues of orange and red. Just like its predecessor and the original V2 however, the sniping and gunplay mechanics remain largely the same in Zombie Army 2. The go-to weapons are unsurprisingly still a variety of WWII sniper rifles augmented with a steady-aim breathing gauge that recharges during combat, with secondary slots available for a machine gun and pistol. The latter two begin as fairly useless options as each level slowly unfolds, but soon become invaluable for popping groups of zombie heads whenever the shufflers breach defences and begin to swarm your position. A swift kick to the guts will also put them down in a pinch, but that solitary melee attack still lacks the crowd-control utility of alternatives found in the likes of Left 4 Dead, making it a little limp as a last resort. The planning and trapping aspects of Sniper Elite are also still in full effect here, played up to the maximum in the all-new levels designed specifically for Zombie Army 2. The array of options remain the same, encompassing two types of grenade, trip-wire explosives and dynamite. Working as a team to successfully booby trap a location and take down swathes of shuffling zombies is a satisfying experience when a well-thought-out plan comes together, and the frantic corridor-clearing when things fall apart is just as frustrating or enjoyable depending on your luck. And Rebellion obviously knows its onions regarding the elements players responded to best the first time around, as the level design in the sequel is far more accommodating. Siege locations are more prevalent with numerous cover spots and opportunities for funnelling the undead into carefully-laid traps, whilst machinegun ammo is found with a greater frequency, enabling more of those last-gasp firefights or desperate runs to revive a colleague. The range of special zombies are also augmented by a couple of new additions to the mix, with a fiery, fast-moving variety proving particularly tricky and the âsummonerâ constantly resurrecting fallen foes unless you take him out. Thatâll be a tricky shot with a sniper rifleItâs also very much still the case that if youâre playing Nazi Zombie Army 2 alone, then youâre in for a pretty dull experience. Despite the additions, the extended waves of enemies and narrow shooting galleries can still become a frustrating slog in singleplayer. In four-player co-op however, Rebellionâs title sputters to life with a satisfying blend of preparation and on-the-fly tactics, made all the better when you have to backtrack or wade into a crowd in order to help up a tardy or over-confident comrade. Being part of a well-oiled four-player sniping team is a huge amount of fun, and even the chaotic mess of an incompatible unit is good for a giggle while it lasts.strategyinformer.com "

												It's a pretty fun game, albeit somewhat short, you can finish it in a single session if you are a no lifer like me. It's pretty hard to find people playing this game, so either bring your own friends, or play alone, which even if it's not as fun, it's somewhat scary most of the time, even more if you are surrounded all alone, which is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥uckerThe sound effects are awesome, the graphics are awesome, and it's pretty damn addictive to watch the camera following your shots and destroying organs or bones of zombies, something which is a trademark for the game series by now.All in all, there is not much replay value, and it's a pretty short game. So, I'm not sure if it's worth the whole price, but you should give it a try, and if you get a few friends, it's not going to be a dissapointment,			"

												I didn't like it as much as I thought I was going to. Graphics are good, but I find myself having to rely alot on the scope to get good shots, meaning so that the zombies don't catch up to me. It's pretty much like the first one, except different maps. You can still casually drop in and out of a co-op game, but I feel like the framerate isn't as good as the first one. Can also get repetitive after awhile.			"

												The best 15 bucks you could ever spend on a video game. It does require at the least a mid range pc to handle the game in an enjoyable manner. It's 4 player co-op, a lot of emphasis on the multiplayer part, because it isn't a story driven game. It's more of a ""shoot up zombies with your friends"" kind of game. There are cutscenes that explain what's going on, but it's not deep or very well thought out. But for $15 and probably cheaper because of sales, it's worth picking up if you've got someone else to play with.			"

												Love this for it's simplicity.  Take a gun.  Kill the zombies.  Don't get killed.  Some of the accessory weapons take a big of figuring out how to use and you can run out of ammo fairly easy on the machine guns but a great fun game with good atmosphere.  LIke any cut scene the bullet track on certain sniper shots can get a little old but it's cool.  Definitely worth it if you want a smiple shootfest.			"

												Honestly i only recently picked up this title. The name was a big turnoff; how could something called nazi zombie army 2 be good? I was very wrong. At full price ($15) this game may not be wort it, but steam in all its glory puts this baby up for sale on a pretty regular basis. I was lucky enough to pick it up when it was only $3ish annd it was the best $3 I've ever spent on steam. The graphics are very detailed, especially for a game this low in price and production value. The gameplay is a little monotonous in single player, but get three of your friends, turn the difficulty up to sniper elite and multiply the zombies X4 and you'll never look at a zombie apocalypse the same way again. This game can go from laughably easy to downright impossible depending on how hard you want it to be. The guns all feel similar, with only one having notably less damage (M1 carbine) and the obligatory shotgun (and the preacher) and magnum (called the webley). The game is in a sort of 3rd person mode but zooms down a scope when you fully aim with any rife. In addition to the three classes of guns (rifles, subs, launcher, shotties and pistols) the game gives you 5 options for explosives: two kinds of grenades, land mines, trip mines, and dynamite which explodes when shot. What this game doesn't do is tell an in depth story. what it does do is blow away boredom along with several hundred zombies at a time. If you see it on sale, I heartily recommend picking up a four pack (as this game is best played with 4 players) and sharing it with your fellow zombie shooter loving friends.			"

												It's a fun game, much better with multiple people. There's some bugs with spawns and such (3 zombies spawning inside of each other and being stuck in some out of the way place), and the shooting system's a little bit weird at first. However the more you play it, the more fun it is. I'd reccomend it, especially since it's on sale for $3.74.			"

												I think this game is an underrated (by professional reviewers anyway) gem. If you like Zombies, sniping, and 3rd person over the shoulder shooters than this game is for you. Awesome snipe physics and above average graphics overcome the limited storyline and somewhat uneven difficulty level to make a game that ends up being better than it's individual parts.

												 Twenty-one years ago, the gaming world was introduced to a hero: a soldier that fought alone against impossible odds to save the world. Over time, the hero grew into a legend that changed the gaming landscape and redefined stealth action games with his epic battles. After more than two decades of service, Karl Fairburne is finally receiving an honorable discharge in the latest chapter in the Sniper Elite franchise. While this is Karl's final mission, he isn't going quietly into that good night, nor is he being constrained by previous titles. Indeed, Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 shatters the proverbial bar, becoming a technical, cinematic and gaming standard that future action and stealth titles will be judged by. It's been a long time coming, but this game is a true classic and a masterpiece from Hideo Kojima, Kojima Productions and Konami. Legends die hard and deserve a heroic story that lives on when they are gone. Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 is such an ending for the legendary warrior Karl Fairburne. Not only does it sum up the full franchise of Sniper Elite, its depth and its complexity, coupled with its technical prowess, make it one of the best games of the year and, indeed, one of the best games ever made. Get some well earned rest, Karl Fairburne. You've earned it. We salute you.			"

												Pretty good sequel.. the graphics have a little more color as the first game has lots of gray and brown tone, this seems have more red and different effects going on. Story pretty much the same. Gameplay is same. Some new enemies as the first game only had a handful of different enemies this one has atleast well.. two handfuls. I love the skeletons! They seem to have gotten smart and acquired some body armor so its harder to hit them in their one weakness, the heart. Thats brilliant. The self-immolating zombies are pretty much like the suicide bombers except they torch you when they get close. I think the first game was better for multiplayer as the sieges were usually in a house or building that allowed someone to snipe and someone to cover them. I enjoyed this one more as a single player adventure and it flowed nicely as such. Other notes:  I love the gameplay, seems so simple yet can be very hard without practice. The zombies walk like drunk people and are hard to headshot ( which is what you need to do or they may resurrect). Music and soundtrack is amazing.  Oh and play with a mouse and keyboard..)  10/10			"

												I will not buy any more games from Rebellion until they stop trying to sue Stardock for using Rebellion as a subtitle for a game about a rebellion. I bought this game before I learned about this. They lost in a US district court, but have filed suit in Canada now.Besides their lack of common sense and bad business practices, it's a pretty good game. There are few instances you get to actually use one of the long range rifles. The levels are confined, so I picked a midrange gun with more ammo. It takes away from the sniper experience, but still is fun.			"

												Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 pretty much picks up from where the first game left off it seems like the graphics have been slightly polished which is good. It also has brought in a couple of additional new zombies for you to takedown. It doesn't vary too much from the first game but why fix what isn't broken. Its still a great game but the player base seems to of improved, I even had someone show me where the collectibles were. I would like people to buy this game purely so we can get some online traffic on it and I can get all the achievements but the game itself is still very good and so does the first one, if you're not sure wait for it to go on sale as its definitely worth a discounted price.

												Well.. * First of all: I'm not a full time hardcore gamer and most importantly 'totally' not the zombie-fanboy-type of gamer! * Second: I've played a few shooters and some other games in the past, before I had dropped gaming completely for the following years to come. But, eventually I hooked up again... So keep in mind, I'm not that ""Two-Decades-Long"" game veteran, my review will be nowhere near perfect!""Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2"" is basically my re-entry into ""shooters"" which I'd bought because also a friend did have it. At first, I assumed,  it was just a 'fly-by' burst of firey enthusiasm, which seemed likely 'not' to stay for any significant amount time. Nothing could be further from the truth. I'm really pleased playing the game and its online co-op campaign mode. I lack the experience for a more uptempo style game such as ""Call of Duty"", ""Counter-Strike"" and Half-Life. But in ""Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2"" most in-game enemies are relatively slow moving targets and which will lack 'even' the most of basic intelligence. (so provides the gamer with some additional extra thinking time). The fact that online multiplayer mode purely exists out of a co-op game makes it even more inviting to play in my case.Anyway, this is really a welcome gesture when 'like me', you decide to first check your game & skills to improve without being completely massacred almost immediately everytime.Overall.. very playable game for the majority of shooter fanatics, both beginners and pro's.. It has some really funny in-game suprises and intense musical experience troughout the game!! (<-- I recall..  ""REALLY""   awesome !!!) Rating:  8/10So its irrevocable a definite ""YES"" to everyone...  All should purchase it!			"

												If you only half-enjoyed the first one, then do not expect this one to change your mind. Not much has changed, even the main menu and the music is the same. It's far from a bad game, just maybe not as satisfying as you think. Sniping from long range is a blast, but any thing more close range is underwhelming. Sniping at close range is a pain and the SMGs and pistols feel nerfed. However, it is a good co-op title and the overall tone and atmosphere of the game is stellar. They did a great job with that. At the sale price of Â£2.50, it's a not a bad buy at all, but at full price not so much.			"

												Alright, lemme get this straight. If you like killing nazis, slow-mo headshots, and squishy organs, this is the game for you. Unless of course you also like unpredictable plot, exciting gameplay, any story what-so-ever, and explanation of why the hell you are doing what ever you are doing in a zombie infested Germany. Overall, the game gets stale soooooo quickly, it's just, ""walk here"", kill a couple slow-moving brainless annoyances, ""Survive the siege!"", kill a couple of the 4 DIFFERENT ZOMBIE TYPES, rinse and repeat in a different place, over, and over, and over again. The sniping is really fun and rewarding, allowing you to feel good at videogames for a little bit, and the atmospheres are creepy and diverse, but thats about it. If you are a fan of shooting zombies, and pretty much nothing else, then this is sure the game for you.			"

												THIS GAME IS â¥â¥â¥â¥ING TRASH COMPARED TO THE FIRST ONE, ITS â¥â¥â¥â¥ING TRASH IN GENERAL, TOO SHORT, HAS NO CONTENT, NO VOICE ACTING DONE AT ALL, EVERY ENEMY WAS RECYCLED FROM THE FIRST GAME, ON HIGHEST DIFFICULTY WITH X4 MULTIPLIER IT WASN'T EVEN A CHALLENGE. 0/10 DO NOT BUY.

												After my experience with the first game I normally wouldn't have continued on to the second, but I already owned it thanks to a package deal, so I figured: why not? Let's go snipe things.Of course, this game suffers from all the problems of the first: there's no story (possibly even less of one than before) and the focus is on an arcade experience where it usually makes more sense to use automatic weapons and pistols due to the close quarters than it does to snipe anything (despite the very name of the game).On top of that, this sequel hardly brings anything new to the table. There's two new enemy types, but that's it. No new guns or explosives. And all the environments are the exact same levels from Sniper Elite 2 - literally cut and pasted - with some lighting changes to dress them up in a poor attempt to make them feel different. But if you've already played that game (like I had) then you already know the layouts of all the levels here, making a quick run through even more tedious.In short: this is the laziest milking of a franchise I might have ever seen. It can't have taken much time or thought or effort for the developers to grind it out. I can imagine that it might be more fun to play with a full co-op team, but even then I wouldn't want to go through it more than once. There just isn't much here.			"

												Extremely generic zombie game like the Call of Duty style zombie nazi stuff. Very few weapons, very generic zombies and repeatative game play. The graphics are very good, the weapons are war correct but there is almost no distruction of the map and it is extremely boring. Please do not buy this game if you are looking for anything challenging or free roam. it is locked down, invisable wall filled and just down right not worth it.			"

												Not worth owning. It looks like a lot of fun but if you are on a laptop with a good graphics card in an expansion slot the game won't utilize it. It will only use the integrated graphics causing it to lag beyond any sort of playability. I imagine there is a fix that works, but after trying multiple ones suggested on forums to no avail, my advice to you is to steer clear.			"

												This is not my normal cup of tea, but I thought I'd give it a go. I was somewhat put off my the earlier reviews, but there are no technical issues for me running on Win 8.1/overclocked i5/GTX760/SSD. It runs beautfully with all settings maxed out.It's a very enjoyable game. I'm still getting the hang of it, but you can turn down the zoom in deaths if that is tiresome and just crack on with zombie mayhem.Great atmosphere, really good fun - you can play for a few hours or just a few minutes. Seriously for the current sale price of Â£4.99, it's a bargain. I just wish the game was better known and had a bigger community. 5/5.			"

												Has the same intense gameplay as Sniper Elite with all of the fun of killing countless undead Nazis, it's only true downfall being that not many people are smart enough to handle that much of a challenge. There needs to be a better system for the multiplayer as well seeing as it doesn't really have a way to host or join a public server.

												I went into this game not really knowing what to expect, and ended up pleasantly surprised - it's basically a sniper-focused L4D, and as a result it's pretty dang fun co-op.It's worth mentioning that this game is clearly low-budget and rips environments and some of its level design directly from Sniper Elite V2. Having said that, the game plays noticeably differently than SEV2 - cover no longer matters, and ammo conservation is much, much more important.Definitely worth the 4 bucks I spent on it, though I probably wouldn't have spent much more than that.

												I wanted to like this, but I just can't make myself.I really liked Sniper Elite V2, and 3, but the zombie versions are not the same at all. These games are best thought of as run and gun shooters, made in a 3rd person engne that is not designed for running and gunning, which happen to contain a few sniping set pieces. The sniping is also annoying as the lurching motion of the zombies makes landing a kill shot harder, which when there's a dozen coming for you from different angles makes the game plain old frustrating.Running and gunning is the majority of the game and is just poorly handled. Sniping is the minority of the action and frequently devloves into running and gunning as the dead get around your position. It's tense, which is probably the best thing you can say for the game, but it feels like your deaths are due to the gameplay rather than your own actions.			"

												Nazi Zombie army 2 is much like the first game, however, I feel as if they've added a lot of colour to the game, no, there are no Nazi Unicorns... yet. But the game is not as dark and gloomy as the first one was and I believe it has improved the game. Mechanics are the same as all other Sniper elites so not much change there. The new enemies are great, and add something else to the game, and add to the washing load of my underwear too. I have always like the SE games and this is no exception. Much like the first one I have not finished this one yet, but I am slowly but surly getting there. I do hear that you can get this game and the other Nazi zombie armies for less if you get the Trilogy, so I would recommend that if it is the case but as it stands this isn't a half bad game. 7.5/10.

												I wish there was a ""neutral"" option for reviews.. it is a fun game, but it is definitely lacking in some of hopes I had for it, but still a slightly positive game experience.the good:+ decent variety of map layouts and situations+ has a few nice easter-eggs which unfortunately is rare in modern games+ it's sniper elite, enough said about thatthe bad:- I know they're zombies, but their animations and movment could use a LOT of improvement... if they can hold clubs in their hands and some jump from rooftop to rooftop, I think they have the cognitive ability to walk in a straight line (I blame AI pathing programming)- for weapon selections, when it boils down they're all 98% identical, you can choose a springfield of a mosin and it feels the same, your only real choice is bolt or semi-auto. as well as machine gun or shotgun, thats it- for a game with ""sniper"" in the name, it lacks tactical thinking most of the time, instead of planning out a field of view and multiple routes it's more ""I'm going to sit here and plant land mines in ALL the hallways for the horde of 500 zombies then just 360 no-scope them hurr-hurr"" sadly, thats what this game is about, hordes of zombies and how much ammo you can burn throughThe Neutral:# finding matches can be a royal pain at times, even when you have the search set to ""any""# while it is a fun game, and as much as it pains me to say this Dead Island was a better overall design, however the sale price is good for what it is, a few hours of random shooting funOverall I would give this game a 6/10 it is a decent way to waste an hour or so of boredom, but it's final execution leaves me asking ""why?"" and wanting to go play Sniper Elite V2 instead. it's a sad day when I choose nazis over zombies.

												Absolutely awesome game. I picked up Nazi Zombie Army 1 & 2 for the recent sale price of Â£4.49, and holy crap that was a good deal. There isnât much that is wrong with this game, itâs incredibly fun, looks beautiful and plays very well. I imagine that this series could carry on with more games, and I assume that it will. I played this game along with 2 of my friends, and at times it was difficult. Currently I am playing through the first game and OMG it is hard. Ammo is scarce and you really worry when youâre running low and you have a load of zombies in your path. I assume that the second is no different. The story is somewhat lacking, when playing through it didnât feel like there was much point, it doesnât really force the story upon you. Even in the cut scenes none of the characters talk. Which is very odd. I hope that future games will have a bit more of an immersive story. Huge recommendation, while there is no real story the gameplay alone is extremely satisfying.Especially for the low price. "

												A great zombie shooter that can easily change from a slow easy pace to a race for your life where one wrong move ensures your death! The amazing graphics and sudden loud noises add to the experience as well as a different soundtrack then you can usually expect from a game. The story is also very interesting, this is a must-have for anyone who enjoys other games such as the Call of Duty: Zombies games.			"

												While this is closer to a run and gun shooter game rather than the Sniper Elite series, the mechanics are the same but the game play is completely opposite. Overall, it is a spooky game and that is cool. However, one MAJOR annoyance is the black screens. When I load the game, I get no menus. I can use my up and down arrows and I hear it changing the selections. That is the only way I can get the game to load. It seems to play OK once it is loaded. I have tried everything I can think of to fix it and for one evening it worked, but I have been unable to duplicate it. Perhaps my PC is too new for it. I am running GTX980's in 3 way SLI, 8 core processor, and 32 GB of ram viewed on a 28"" 4k monitor. Do I recommend the game? Hmm, that is a tough one. For someone like myself that usually plays solo, the waves of baddies from every direction causes me to turn around and around to make sure nothing is sneaking up on me. This starts to cause motion sickness which is something I rarely experienced in the Sniper Elite series. I am going to say no, I would not recommend it. If, and only if, they fix that black screen issue (which seems to be fairly common) then perhaps I will change it.			"

												Sniper Elite: nazi Zombie Army 2 is the first full game of Sniper Elite that i played (i played SE v2 demo but it was few years ago :P) and i must say that i love this game. Now sometimes the game can make you rage, swear and curse creators of the game, but after few tries you realise what did you do wrong, and you fix your mistake, and then progress with a ""banana"" on your face.Gameplay :   This version is kinda varied from other Sniper Elite games. Mainly because you wont use your sniper rifle that often. Another diffrence, is that you actually shoot zombies, that melee you, instead of shooting enemies. Well, there are Zombie Snipers, that kinda sounds stupid and unrealistic, but i'll explain that later. I really like the balance between needing to use your sniper, and full options to use any weapon you want.Story (NO SPOILERS) :   We start with a cutscene of Hitler speaking to one of his generals (i couldnt identify him closely, but that doesnt really matter) about the Relics that supposed to keep the zombies in control. We get to know that Nazis had some Relics that let them control these zombies. Our mission is to get in the possesion of those, and stop the Nazi Zombies. As simple as it gets, i dont play the game too much for the story. The story isnt anything super great, but i dont mind it.Realism :  Now I could even dig it that Nazis got some super zombie virus that let them to take over the whole Europe or something, but they got some magical relics, that control zombies. What is that ? I mean i dont hate it, but you could atleast implement some more realism in that part. The only thing that i understand about that, because it actually matches the story, is the Zombie Snipers i mentioned before. I mean, they can somehow fly, but i guess creators though of him being somehow powered by magic of the relics or something like that. They are kinda annoying because, you scope in, and they jump to another position, but i guess it is supposed to be the diffrence from other games.Difficulty :   I am playing this game on the hardest difficulty, and i must say that it isn't that hard as i expected but in some parts It can get frustrating. I guess i could finish the game on easiest in about 4-5 hours. As i read some other people's reviews, they finished on hardest in about 9-10 hours, I didnt finish the story yet (writing this at Friday, the 13th) but i guess im gonna have a time around that, maybe even faster.Pros :+Balanced difficulty+A good variancy from other Sniper Elite games+Good gameplay+Nice Graphics+Sound effects are good+Bullet cams are cool as alwaysCons :-Not that realistic as expected-Zombie Snipers are more annoying than challenging-No local cooperation modeOverall : 7.5/10			"

												Unless it's on a special for $10 or less, I would not recommend this game.Im not going to give a summary about everything.Im simply going to tell you how I feel about it.The campaigne is alright, I could not really give the campaign much credit since it takes you 3 hours to finish it.As an experienced gamer I thought that this game has a lack of gun variety, story line, zombie variety and gameplay.It did'nt feel special to play it, in fact after the first hour I was so bored that I would've rather done my homework or wash the dishes.To say the least, this game was boring, bland and way to short.I give this game a rating out of 10: 4/10			"

												A superb follow-up to NZA. Loved both these games and would heartily recommend to anyone.They are dark, occultish, and macabre, in other words lotsa fun. My 6.9 hours represents the game completed so it is short, and the same time to play as NZA. Therefor get it on a budget. Or even get it now when NZA, NZA2, and (the up-coming release of) NZA3 are bundled for Â£12.  You get co-op with these games and other people say it's awesome. I only played single player so far, and it rocks. Check out a bit on youtube just to make sure it's for you.One other thing. The graphics are about average for a game these days. However I want to point out that,  every now and again somehow it pushes my GTX 970 to the max.			"

												   Where do i begin with whats worng with this game. First off it still rips off all the maps from Sniper Elite V2 and the only thing new is that you changed the graphics on the map to make it look more spokey. Second this game is still set up as if it was a sniping game instead of a Close Quarter Combat game which it real is. Third the zombies seem to twitch when the move around so head shots are very hard to make especially since you have to run around a lot, because if you crouch walk through this whole game your good as dead. Forth and related to the thrid and second point if the zombies get within 10inc infront of you they will star trying to hit you which increases there spead and makes it hard to hit them especially if they are already on top of you. Fith the ammo in this game is like a diamond in minecraft very hard to find unless you souly rely on your pistol and rifle as SMG ammo is hard to find, and when you find the shotgun ammo will extremely hard to find, wich sucks since the shotgun is the best gun to use. Sixth the mini boss zombies can only be killed by head shots which returning back to point two, three, and four getting your heart beat to slow down enough to make perfect head shots is extremely hard especially when they can shoot back or turn every zombie around you into a flaming zombie on steroids. Seventh the shotgun takes longer to load than it should and with the Revolver it should take half the amount of time since the ammo you pick up is in a speed loader, yet he manually loads every single round (I was hoping that in this instalment of the game they would fix that). Finaly this game is set up to be 4 players and even the single playre mode treats it as if you had 4 people or even 1 other person playing with you.      I have played a lot of zombie games including inde zombie games, but never have i feelt so disapointed in a zombie game since Day Z came out. This series is now one of the worst zombie games I have ever played.     So in conclusion dont buy this game its a complete rip off and will stress you out majorly that is unless you can actualy find someone to play with you then it may be a little more easy, but it still isnt worth your money.

												If you want a crappy story and a shoot em' up style game, you have this (un)DEAD game.To be real though, the game is pretty trash in terms of submachine gun aim, story, atmosphere, and dull characters.There is also the fact that NO ONE plays this anymore. In all my time of playing this I tried to get a coop game and only matched with one other person... who was afk.			"

												Enjoyable for a short period of time, but not much in the way of replayability. It may be because I'm in NZ, but the online multiplayer seems to be very small. If I could even find a game it was nearly always with the same European guy. Check out MrSark's YouTube videos on this game. If you have a group of friends you could enjoy yourselves for several hours or more.It pains me a little to not recommend this as I did enjoy myself, but not for as long as I would have liked. At least it's fairly cheap.			"

												If you like these kind of games it's absolutely worth a purchase. The game has a great atmosphere to it. But they should at least have added some new maps and not recycle the maps from the previous Sniper Elite games. Don't play it for the story (it doesn't really exist) but for this game it's fine. Great to play in co-op too, adds a whole new layer.			"

												This game is extremely short. Buy it only on extremely low price. Also be prepared because it is not optimised and does not run smoothly on allmost any computer.Other than that the zombie killing is extremely satisfying and the traps and mines are cool too.Nice game for 4 people to buy, go through all of it for less than 3 hours (or normal dificulty), then try the x4 dificulty and play for another 3 hours. And then it gets boring and repetative.TL DR. Buy it only at really low price. The game is really, really short like 4 campaigns. Other than that it's an ok game.			"

												What a fantastic Zombie horde survival game...If you are wondering what this game is...it is exactly like Left 4 Dead, as you and a group of other players will traverse across the stage, killing zombies, finding safe rooms, finding checkpoints, and at the end of each level there's some sort of boss.I however, enjoy this game more than Left 4 Dead. There's no real plot or narrative besides Hitler unleashing his ""Nazi Zombies"", shortly dying after by his own creation, and you are set out to find the mysterious relics when which combines destroy all the zombies.But... the game isn't focused on story at all, rather it focuses on pure gameplay, and fun. The level design is so gothic, and gruesome. The zombies are slow moving, and are pretty realistic as most only go down with headshots...This is where the ""Sniper Elite"" part comes into play, as you are not able to mow down zombies with sub machines guns without running out of ammo. Therefor, you end up using your sniper A LOT, and must rely on your ability to get headshots at a distance, otherwise the zombie hords will overwhelm you.Like other Sniper Elite games, when sniping zombies from a long-distance you will go into a ""slow-mo"" instant replay showing where the bullets hit, and how they break through the zombies insides. Unfortunetely.... this is only really shown in Single Player, considering the game has to slow down in order to show you the replay. In multiplayer it does happen, but is very quick, and often not as rewarding.As for gameplay, this is a 3rd person shooter, but while aiming with the sniper you go into a first-person sniper scope. It's an interesting mechanic which isn't quite as good as Call of Duty's World at War / Black Ops Zombies, but it does the job quite nicely and is a more challenging game then the easy child's play game of Left 4 Dead.----------------The few downsides I saw were pretty minimal complaints...- There's no power-ups- Not many things to find or collect- Levels are very linear, like a rail shooter. (very scripted)- Searching Zombie Bodies for Ammo takes far too long. (should be automatic pickups)- No unique guns / items / melee weapons to find. (typically you have just 3 standard guns)- Single Player feels a bit ""too difficult"", and ""too long"" since you have to kill all the zombies alone.- Lack of Story / Direction (often I forgot where I was going, or what the goal was)------------I paid: $2.30Would definitely suggest this game to anyone who enjoys zombie horde survival games.

												OK so having a lot of fun with the first one, the second one.... is more creepier and scarier.It's just as great as the first, seeing that it is a continuation, but with more funs stuff.The levels are more hellish looking and seriously, it really is intense with the new enemies that are added as well as new/same levels. I have not played this on multiplayer, but I got most of the achievement you can get as a single player. AGAIN... I don't know why the option is not there to play single player but with 3 bot like in Left 4 Dead.If there is, then I missed that option.LOL it can be testing on your nerves on single player late at night with the lights off. (Anyone ever play Slender the Arrival in the dark?)So great game, great play, and looks like a lot of fun on multiplayer as well. "

Max Payne 3, Sniper Ghost Warrior)The game are fairly hard and challenging, even on the normal difficulty (My first time play experience)What I hate about it is that the story is kinda short, the zombie skip damage when close range, no gamemode like endless.I hope the developer would add some feature what people might have wanted.My rating, 7/10.

Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												Well i might consider recomending this game , as it is the only well made game about snipers... buuuut the fact that its THE only one i found satisfying to play doesnt mean its Good enough to buy . This ""DLC"" is bad , the idea of this game is that you are supposed to be a sniper , killing targets from far distances or ""Sniping"" but what this DLC does is they put you in small corridor or WORSE - a small room filled with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of zombies , and this guys arent shambling pieces of rotten flesh NOOOO , once this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s get close to you , they literally get a second breath and start running at you like crazy , messing up with you aiming and generally become a huge problem. I quite liked original Sniper and Sniper Elite 2 but this DLC is TO MY OPINION is a waste of money .			"

												Experience a terrifyingly intense co-op campaign for up to four players in this gut-wrenching sequel to Steam best-seller, Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army. With World War 2 Europe overrun by legions of the undead, you must find mankindâs salvation deep in the twisted bowels of Berlin by securing the sacred artefacts that unleashed this damnation. Every step must be paid in blood as players work together against impossible odds and descend further into the demon-infested city and the terrifying FÃ¼hrerbunker itself. Tackle the campaign online in co-op for up to four players, or embark on the twisted missions alone if youâve got the bottle. Featuring new enemies, new environments, blood curdling surprises and the return of the infamous X-ray kill cam, Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 will satisfy even the most bloodthirsty of zombie hunters.

												For a game as simple as this, it certainly doesn't get boring very fast. It's basically shooting, maiming, blowing up and decimating waves of Nazi zombies. Doesn't sound too interesting on the surface, but the strange boss enemies, super creepy surreal and supernatural elements, plain disturbing environments and black magic undertones keep it fresh all the way through. It's a ton of fun on Co-op and you honestly can't go wrong for a stand-alone zombie shooter.			"

												Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 1.4How dare they called this a '2' it's not even a 1.5 !Pros : -New main menu picture ? lol-Few new enemies-Scarier environment / vibe / black & white lighting effect , how ever , these are applied to only chapter 1  *Middle finger*-MG42 ?-You can now join mid - game-Some theme songs  in-game are kinda okay.Cons :-No new weapon except that MG42 , i shouldnt even count it because you cant pick it up-Low replaybility-Worst main menu theme-Short  length-The characters are still dumb , they dont talk !!-It reused a lot of maps / area / buildings which appeared in Sniper Elite V2 , Oh boy ,So â¥â¥â¥â¥ing lazy ,aren't you  Devs?Old game , new maps yet no new guns !!   In Nazi zombie 1 , everything was  fresh , so it was looking good in general but here , the novelty wore off already. Play with friend(s) , if none of your friend plan to buy it , you shouldnt either. Singleplayer here = Epicly boring.5.9  / 10*IF , IF you never play Nazi zombie 1 before and this is your first game , Here is another score for your case since I need to cut out some of the 'It looks the same'  factors because you never play any.7 / 10			"

												In my opinion, I would give this game 9/10. The gameplay is excellent and having a killcam every now and then when killing zombies is fine, but the game lacks of players. There are never any other players on the game anymore, so you HAVE to play single player, which would be hard for newcomers. Other then that, this game would be worth playing, especially if you have friends who have it.			"

												I recommend this game because of the very well gameplay and realism in the way how things would have become if.......I only have a few issues though. 1 of them is that this game is very glitchy. and its funny sometimes yes, but its also really annoying if you try to shoot a zombie but a different zombie's corps is glitching and blocking your sight.Antother thing that I find a bit â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ its the difficulty. Its way to easy really. ofcourse you can multiple the numbers of zombie heading towards you. but if you set everything on sniper elite mode. and not multiply the number of zombies that will be charging at you, its really too easy.also the range of explosives bums me out a bit. as the grenade does his work just fine. you can also shoot at barrels, fuel tanks and many many more, but the range of that explosive is soo miniscule that its really not worth it. also in a certain part of the game you need to activate a V2 rocket. but in real life Im pretty sure I cannot sit behind a corner and wait.Nevertheless its a fantastic game and its really worth the 11 euro's you need to pay for it. (I see 10,99 as 11 euro's)			"

The game is fun and has a lot to chhose from when it comes to killing any zombie in the game. This ggame is good, but could use some more gameplay time in it. Above all Nazi Zombie Army V2 is an ""Great"" game and is highly reccommendable for all players.			"

												DO NOT believe the metacritic rating. This game is an excellent game that does exactly what it sets out to do: Allow you to blow the heads off Nazi Zombies. Much like the first game, the weapons are varied enough despite their initial similar appearances. I can only imagine how identical all of these rifles look to a layman. Despite that, they offer enough variety and are, quite surprisingly, EXTREMELY well balanced. There is no one loadout that breaks the game, nor any that is useless. Between me and my three teammates, we all chose totally different sets of gear. One of us chose a long-range, bolt-action rifle with a high powered scope, two of us more medium-flavored but with totally different secondary weapons and the fourth (me) with a VERY short-range carbine and shotgun. They all work and are all a barrel of fun. The maps are MUCH MUCH MUCH more varied than the first game with some interesting set-pieces that really added to the game. They are gimmicks on the surface, but I thought they were cool. One thing to note is the difference in maps from NZA1 to NZA2. The first was very open 90% of the time, with only the occasional really close-in tense fights, focusing more on massive hordes than proximity. The second was practically the opposite. Almost totally close-in and with few distant engagements. With those in mind, think of NZA1 and NZA2 as the same game with some good variety and differences between the two. Both are quite good at what they do and deserve praise for it. When they go on sale, buy 'em. They're still a lot of fun on your own, too. DO IT.			"

												Okay, here's the link to my review of the first game: http://steamcommunity.com/id/splatt3rman/recommended/227100 I played two, almost three hours of this, half of that with my friend Kyler (mentioned in first review). I haven't gotten used to it yet, as though it is extremely similar to the first one, it has a different 'feel' to it. (Gamers who have played games and then their sequels will know what I mean) Not only is the 'feel' different, but also the atmosphere seems, like, darker, or maybe more moody or something. It is similar to the first one, and delivers on the same level, but yet gives a fresh feel to it. I am looking forward to logging at least as many hours in as the first one. 10/10, for sure			"

												Sniper Elite NZA2 is a fun game, and is worth your playtime. However, one issue is that the playtime for this game is very limited, as once you have completed the game, you have already played everything that this game brings to the table. Sure you can play it a couple of more times every once in a while, but it might get very boring quickly for others. I would recommend this game to anybody who loves shooting copious amounts of undead Nazis in the face, and is a great pickup if on sale.			"

Don't have much to compare it to as I'm not usually into shooters so I  can't say it's better than X or worse than y.  The scramble for ammo and running out of it for your short-range weapons when in the midst of a rushing horde is something else.  And being patient with your shots when you get all jacked up is a hoot.  Lots of fun.  If you can get it on sale I'd highly recommend it.			"

												Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 is a third person shooter game. It is a zombie game which continues the story of Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army (senza). This game is quite similar to senza 1, it just continues the story and improves a little bit of graphic issues, the rest stays the same. You have 4 characters, one of which is the protagonist of Sniper Elite 3, you will try to collect all the fragments with 0-3 players and escape Berlin.  This game contains a lot of blood and gore, but it gives the players a good feeling each time the players make a headshot, and is sometimes challenging to fight at the same time the Panzer soldier (the small boss) while trying to kill other zombies around him at the same time. However, I found this game not terrifying while it does give us an atmosphere of fear, this can be good (or bad) for the players trying to play through the campaign.I recommend this to all the fans of senza 1.Positive remarks+graphic improvement+story continuing+only talents and accuracy, no camping Negative remarks-doesn't have big changes in comparison with senza 1I think that's it, nothing much more to say.

Doesn't sound too interesting on the surface, but the strange boss enemies, super creepy surreal and supernatural elements, plain disturbing environments and black magic undertones keep it fresh all the way through. It's a ton of fun on Co-op and you honestly can't go wrong for a stand-alone zombie shooter.			"

												Short version, its praticly the same as the first one. Only with a few new enemies, slightly more challangeing but that just slightly in the long run. Majoirty of all zombies have been given a grafic upgrade..or downgrade how you look at it as they all look abit more rotten and corrupted. Same deal here really play with friends to really enjoy the experince also same here crank it up to hardest as it will allow for a fun time :D8/10			"

												I wouldn't trust the Metacritic score on this one, this game is pretty solid and very entertaining! Plently of little easter eggs to catch you off guard. It's also super fun to play with a group friends! Well worth the sale price. I'd definitely reccomend picking this game up, and hey, if you're  a nice guy you'll buy the 4 pack bundle(which is less than the normal price of the game) and give it to your friends!Nothing wrong with this game that i've noticed so far. I haven't completed it yet but so far I can't complain! I would very much like to see a Survival game type added, that would be sweet.			"

												This is a wicked game to play. Like the first game (which I own) it has great graphics, an interesting story line and wave upon wave of zombies for you to kill! As with the first game it does sadly have a habbit of being glitchy here and there, especially when you get into a safe room the framerate disapears into nothingness but as soon as your back outside of it the game runs awesomely again. I have checked this with friends whilst playing co-op and they get the same issues in the exact same places so I am confident that it is a game issue. In conclusion, this game is great and I hightly recommend it to anyone. Additionally, if you've not already, get yourself the first game and play it through as this game does follow on from the first and they are both worth the money, especially when playing with friends. Great game! Hoping to see a third edition real soon! ;)			"

												This game is really REALLY awesome. It's kinda like Killing Floor but on a much larger scale. The graphics are really good compared to the price. Single player is fun, but multiplayer is really where it's at playing with other people. Single player is good for practicing and if you're interested in the story line at all.I only have two complaints: First, the servers can be abit glitchy and laggy. If you've got a good team of 4, then it shouldn't pose as much of a problem. If they are all in your face, well, prepare to die and hopefully a team mate can heal you up.Second: Mission length. I wasn't sure if it actually saved at a check point or not, but the very first mission in the game was almost an hour long. I admit taking a breather every so often at a save room, but really, this is just too long for a casual game. Multiplayer missions aren't as bad, but do plan on being at the computer for awhile during a match.Other then those two complaints, the game overall is great. A very minor complaint is although the ""Matrix"" slowomo stuff is cool, it does get old, especially if you prefer to be a sniper like I do. Overall, for how much the game is, and the entertainment it provides, I highly suggest you try it out. See ya in game.			"

												Ignore the rating, it's entierly unture. This game, though it's story is linear, and simple. Characters awkwardly slinet during Cutscenes, makes up for it with amazing graphical detail. Advanced sniping mechanics, and an all out enjoyable atmosphere. You almost wish it was open world, as the game itself does a nice job of seeming realistic rather than a run'n'gun shooter. The X-ray feature is still the selling point. If you enjoy shooting things in the head, this is the best game for it.			"

Following the conclusion of the first game, I sent a strongly worded email to Rebellion, and was reassured that this feature was being worked on for the sequel.

												$4.  Buy it.  I loved the original Sniper Elite, and love the Bullet path hits in Sniper V2.This version also has the Bullet times and make for some awesome (and funny) head blowing off fun.Picking off Zombies is excellent in this, and there are some genuine ""Make you jump"" moments when you have headphones on.A great stand alone game that is very playable.   Walking Dead meets Call of Duty. :)Highly recommend.			"

												Yeah, more of the same, but it's so much fun! This game is the kind of guilty pleasure we treasure, it could have been released as DLC for the first game, but either way nazi killing junkies such as myself would still get it.The aiming system is tricky and fun at the same time, so the ""aim for the head"" thing is never impossible or too easy. The only beef I have about this installment is that it felt a little easier that the first, which was fun exactly for being hard.This game isn't going to change your life the way you know it, but sure it will get you a lot of fun if you don't mind its repeatitiveness -it's a word now, in case it wasn't yet.Sim, mais do mesmo, mas Ã© muito divertido! Este jogo Ã© aquele tipo de guilty pleasure que a gente valoriza; poderia ter sido lanÃ§ado como DLC para o primeiro jogo, mas os viciados em matar nazis, como eu, ainda comprariam. O sistema de mira Ã© complicado e divertido ao mesmo tempo, de maneira que aquela de ""atire na cabeÃ§a"" nunca Ã© impossÃ­vel ou muito fÃ¡cil. O Ãºnico senÃ£o que eu tenho sobre esta sequÃªncia Ã© que senti ser um pouco mais fÃ¡cil que o primeiro, que foi divertido exatamente por ser difÃ­cil. Este jogo nÃ£o vai mudar a sua vida, mas se ele vai te dar um monte de diversÃ£o, se vocÃª nÃ£o se importa sua repetitividade âse essa palavra existir. "

												This game is amazing. A single, and 4 player co-operative campaign which offers everything from an angry Hitler to endless hordes of flesh eating zombies ready to be shot, kicked or blown up. This game is not easy, thereby making it even funnier when you play with friends and can listen to them, like me, often cry for help. The graphics, provided you have the minimum requirements, are out of this world, and when you couple that with both the ridiculous amount of zombies to kill, and vast array of realistic weaponry, you are given simply a breathtakingly messed up experience.

												Play it over and over and over, kill them all.... because they are not dead anymore. Turn up the slowmo effects and enjoy watching the bullets rip through all the different zombies. Their faces, guts, necks, hips, and so on and so forth. If you liked the zombie mode in Black Ops 1 and 2 then you might be ready for this game. This game is for the more refind zombie killers, you know for the people that take pride in how they kill zombies and watch them be ripped to pieces with bullets, and bombs. Enjoy the X-ray shots as you scope out the kill 400 yards away and get to see the bullet pierce the eye sockets and continue to make a nice exit out the back of the skull of your mark. If you can handle the killing, enjoy this master piece of art.			"

It's also a strict grind fest, which gets extremely boring.

												What's better than killing Nazis? Killing Nazis that are zombies duh. It is a great game and since you don't need sniper elite to play it makes the game that much better. Not much of a story though, but video games aren't meant to have a story. There meant to just have fun and this game fulfills its duty on that aspect.			"

												Basically, it is NZA with additional new enemies. This sequel could have been so much more, as it feels more like an expansion of the game instead of a true sequel.Recommendation to get this game depends on how much you enjoy the first NZA. If you love the first one, get this one, otherwise, you would not miss much.If you haven't tried NZA series, and planning to try, you may think about getting the trilogy directly.			"

Nice variegation are also animations of particularly successful hits...you can even blow off their balls.I like the storyline too...yea its simple, but not bad...and also like the idea of ââhow zombies come into existence..not kind of virus but something occult!!!

The new enviroments and the updated textures add a sense of upgrade while still being a continuation of the the storie.  And yes you can solo this game, a steady hand and route planing for optimal cover will be your best tools.  All and all, for me, it is an enjoyable shooter.			"

I suggest using equipment like grenades and trip wires/landmines to your advantage. Graphics are great, mechanics are great (like NZA1 and SE V2), and I rarely encounter glitches. If you have the money, I'd say it's worth the buy.9/10			"

												Coming out as a sequel, rather than a dlc or expansion, comes Sniper Elite; Nazi Zombie Army 2.Following the same path, SENZA2 put 1-4 players against what is left of Europe after the Nazis used a supernatural artifact to reanimate their lost forces. I dare to say that its even harder than the previous game, thanks to new enemies to fight, trickier locations to find collectibles and overall new and improved locations.If you like killing zombies, especially Nazi ones, then this game can be something you would enjoy.

												This game is really REALLY awesome. It's kinda like Killing Floor but on a much larger scale. The graphics are really good compared to the price. Single player is fun, but multiplayer is really where it's at playing with other people. Single player is good for practicing and if you're interested in the story line at all.I only have two complaints: First, the servers can be abit glitchy and laggy. If you've got a good team of 4, then it shouldn't pose as much of a problem. If they are all in your face, well, prepare to die and hopefully a team mate can heal you up.Second: Mission length. I wasn't sure if it actually saved at a check point or not, but the very first mission in the game was almost an hour long. I admit taking a breather every so often at a save room, but really, this is just too long for a casual game. Multiplayer missions aren't as bad, but do plan on being at the computer for awhile during a match.Other then those two complaints, the game overall is great. A very minor complaint is although the ""Matrix"" slowomo stuff is cool, it does get old, especially if you prefer to be a sniper like I do. Overall, for how much the game is, and the entertainment it provides, I highly suggest you try it out. See ya in game.			"

												hmmm where to starrrtt... ok. NZA2 is a thirdperson shooter set in apocolyptic Berlin, Germany. Basically this what used to be an expansion now a standalone game answers the question ""What if Hitler had suceeded in raising demons using Satanic Rituals to help him win the war?"" Zombies carry weapons, some even have Sniper Rifles, and it is very likely you will die on the easiest difficulty settings. Fun singleplayer and very fun multiplayer campaign. There are about 6 hours od singleplayer and 5 of Co op campaign and non stop gore.  all in all a very good game for its price.			"

												So far game looks awesome. Amazing grim atmosphere mainly because of excellent sound effects and Romero-like music when you push one note every 30 sec but it works really well lol. Even if it looks like you just go from A to B doing nothing but killing zombies still very good. Visuals can be very good, but here comes one big flaw, game is not optimized imo, i put all to ultra at 1920x1080 and all became VERY laggy. Best setting i found is 1366x768, all high but need to turn on reduce mouse lag, turn off motion blur and other stuff.			"

												Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 is the sequel to the critically acclaimed kind-of-okay-i-guess Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army which was renowned for being, well, average. It used mechanics from the other Sniper Elite games and added less alive nazis and more undead ones. The grim, gloomy atmosphere and fantastic ambient sound really added to the ""last man/men alive"" feel. The Co-op shooter could get dull however, with little to no varying game mechanics to be seen after unlocking and equipping a few different guns, its sequel may has well have been a DLC expansion to the original.Overall? I'd recommend it to anyone with friends to play it with which is why I probably didn't enjoy it.....			"

												This game is a lot of fun, a friend gifted it to me while it was on sale.Three of us played this co-op and honestly I had a lot more fun than I expected, which was definitely refreshing. My only complaint is that it takes a very long time to find co-op players if your friends who play are not online. There is no group view, you have to rely on a pop-up that says ""Searching for a game"" for anywhere between 1-15 minutes. The same music loops over so it can get a bit frustrating when no one is seemingly online.If you had a few friends and a love for zombie shooters I would definitely suggest this game.			"

You get loadouts for everyone your playing with, your main weapon is a sniper rifle, your smg's  and pistols are recourced as CQC weapons when infested with zombies. the story is great pretty well. it may not run very well on my computer but im nice enough to say this game is good unlike the people who thought going guns blazing with smg's and then running out of ammo immidiately, then going here downvoting this game cause of low ammo for the smg, and pistol. great game, love it, highly suggest it			"

												I found this game to be able to satisfy many different kinds of gamers. You want an epic third person shoot out with a horde of zombies? Pick up a machine gun, get on a turret, and start killing zombies! You want to plan your moves and kill hordes with powerful and well placed traps? Break out the trip mines and dynamite! You want to show your sniping skills are not limited to the 100+ meter range on no more than ten Krauts at one time? Whip out the sniper rifle; it's time to shatter some skulls with Rebellion's awesome kill cam! And no mater what style you picked, you can still get together with friends and survive the Apocalypse with buddies. Seriously: you can pick what kind of game you want to play and play it, without being restricted to just machine guns, or just sniper rifles. It's time to kickâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥for the Lord.

												I recommend this game because of the very well gameplay and realism in the way how things would have become if.......I only have a few issues though. 1 of them is that this game is very glitchy. and its funny sometimes yes, but its also really annoying if you try to shoot a zombie but a different zombie's corps is glitching and blocking your sight.Antother thing that I find a bit â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ its the difficulty. Its way to easy really. ofcourse you can multiple the numbers of zombie heading towards you. but if you set everything on sniper elite mode. and not multiply the number of zombies that will be charging at you, its really too easy.also the range of explosives bums me out a bit. as the grenade does his work just fine. you can also shoot at barrels, fuel tanks and many many more, but the range of that explosive is soo miniscule that its really not worth it. also in a certain part of the game you need to activate a V2 rocket. but in real life Im pretty sure I cannot sit behind a corner and wait.Nevertheless its a fantastic game and its really worth the 11 euro's you need to pay for it.

												The general premise is ""shoot zombies, make it to the safe room,"" just like L4D.  There aren't many improvements over the first NZA game - in fact, it uses mostly the same maps (some taken from Sniper Elite V2, others taken from NZA 1), and uses the same final boss.  So in that regard, it was clearly phoned in.  But on the other hand, I can't deny how fun it is.  Sniping zombies didn't get old in the 3.5 hrs it took me to play the 5 levels of the campaign.  The controls are tight, I didn't run into any glitches, and the first level was beautiful in it's hellish look.  If you're deciding which to pick up, I'd get the first NZA game, but if you liked that one, this gives you more of the same.			"

												You water the plants until they are at their full growth and at that point your garden is complete. Now although I don't like the Nintendo, this game was enjoyable. I played it with my mum who also really likes to play Animal Planet. For my money though I gotta say that the Dreamcast is just a little outdated with mechanics dating back to 176510/5WHAT A STEAL!

												Hello!I absolutey loved this game!I am new to pc gaming and this was the first game I have played with keyboard and mouse.It was incredibly good funn.Pros:- The slow motion x-ray kill cam is awesome and never got boring- Dark atmosphere- Lots of fun weapons- Online multiplayer playthrough of main campaignCons:- Ocassional bugs, such as where the zombies could be stuck behind the checkpoint barrier and could not be killed which forces you to restart from previous check point. Not game breaking but just irritating.- Very short game!- Small enemy variationsOver all the cons arent that  hefty annd I would totally reccomend Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2!I bought my hard copy from GAME and it cost me Â£3, bargain!I GIVE  IT 8 EXPLODING ZOMBIES OUT OF 10!

												What do you get when you take Sniper Elite V2 and add Nazi Zombies, fascist skeletons, and other spooky stuff? The answer is about ten hours of fun. It can get a little repetitive though and the game is very linear so I doubt youâd feel the need to replay it after youâve finished it once. Pick it up if you like shooting spooky things and happen to find it on sale for under $10.			"

Weirder than previous series. They should play football or something if they were fast enough.			"

												Highly recommend this game if you like sniping. It's a really fun challenging game. Story and scenery are great. Whereas, in most sniping games (especially in the advanced shooter settings) often times you have to watch and anticipate the movements of your target for proper shot placement. With practice a sniper can become pretty efficient. However, trying to judge and anticipate the jerky movements of the undead are alot more challenging. Great game, lots of fun. Only drawback (like others have posted) haven't had any luck finding others to Co-Op with.			"

												now, I was mad at first because as I got excited and boot it for the first time after beating the first one, I realized practially everything within this game, just pulls from the first game, I've yet to find a weapon that wasn't in the first game, but.. I still cant hate it, the atmosphere, the new levels, added scare jumps that made me and my friend jump out of her skin from the ongoing terror and tension. (which was hilarious.)it holds true to the same goal of the last game, trying to stop the evil by seemingly running from safe room to saferoom while you and your friends get your asses handed to you by the super zombies and skeletions (the the klaking of they're bones from a distance freaked out me and my friends.)With all the fun and excitement I had, there is a few things I did find annoying, like the old game, it still had a bit of a problem where, no matter what, when looking through the scope, the game can get a bit laggy, so much that at one point the amount of zombies on screen made it impossible to scope and shoot to the point I had to waist shoot them (and did rather amazingly at it)my only big argument with this game is that it needs some regular rifles that have no scopes so I can have the ability to aim at close enemies with my rifle, instead of staring into the distance while they pumble me into the ground.

												Coming out as a sequel, rather than a dlc or expansion, comes Sniper Elite; Nazi Zombie Army 2.Following the same path, SENZA2 put 1-4 players against what is left of Europe after the Nazis used a supernatural artifact to reanimate their lost forces. I dare to say that its even harder than the previous game, thanks to new enemies to fight, trickier locations to find collectibles and overall new and improved locations.If you like killing zombies, especially Nazi ones, then this game can be something you would enjoy.

												Awesome 3rd person zombie arcade-style shooter. Tends to throw you into situations sometimes where you have to be careful with your ammo reserve and make every shot count.  I suggest using equipment like grenades and trip wires/landmines to your advantage. Graphics are great, mechanics are great (like NZA1 and SE V2), and I rarely encounter glitches. If you have the money, I'd say it's worth the buy.9/10			"

												Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 is a great co-op, zombie, 3rd person shooter. Whether you're playing alone, or with friends, it's an instant hit in my book. The enviornments of each chapter immerse you in a hell ridden war zone overrun by the nazi zombie menace. It almost reminds me of COD zombies in this way, But don't let that sell you, it isn't COD zombies. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of COD zombies though, and to anyone who can ""tolerate"" a 3rd person view. Unlike some people I know.			"

												I recommend this game because of the very well gameplay and realism in the way how things would have become if.......I only have a few issues though. 1 of them is that this game is very glitchy. and its funny sometimes yes, but its also really annoying if you try to shoot a zombie but a different zombie's corps is glitching and blocking your sight.Antother thing that I find a bit â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ its the difficulty. Its way to easy really. ofcourse you can multiple the numbers of zombie heading towards you. but if you set everything on sniper elite mode. and not multiply the number of zombies that will be charging at you, its really too easy.also the range of explosives bums me out a bit. as the grenade does his work just fine. you can also shoot at barrels, fuel tanks and many many more, but the range of that explosive is soo miniscule that its really not worth it. also in a certain part of the game you need to activate a V2 rocket. but in real life Im pretty sure I cannot sit behind a corner and wait.Nevertheless its a fantastic game and its really worth the 11 euro's you need to pay for it. (I see 10,99 as 11 euro's)			"

												Found this game completely unplayable due to the physics/engine.  The aiming is far too sloppy.  I guess people enjoy that for this series, and best to them, but if you like the feel of games like COD, CS:GO, etc... you know.. realistic ones, you will utterly hate this game.  It's also a strict grind fest, which gets extremely boring.  I played very little (getting through a few maps with a friend to some subway location you come out of), so I could be wrong about the grindfest, but doubt it. "

Fun game for the priceI have finished both Nazi Zombie Army 1 & 2 and enjoyed them. However, this game didn't offer anything new, except levels, and a lot was taken from Sniper Elite v2.I was expecting new weapons, items, etc...but was let down. The difficulty has also been a constant problem with this series. Players just found this game to be too easy, even on Sniper Elite difficulty. An enemy multiplier option was added to help with this, but it just feels more like a band-aid approach. Sure, shooting MORE zombies sounds fun, but it makes the game feel very monotonous. Still, it is a great game for the price and offers in-game hosting to boot.			"

												This game is a lot of fun, a friend gifted it to me while it was on sale.Three of us played this co-op and honestly I had a lot more fun than I expected, which was definitely refreshing. My only complaint is that it takes a very long time to find co-op players if your friends who play are not online. There is no group view, you have to rely on a pop-up that says ""Searching for a game"" for anywhere between 1-15 minutes. The same music loops over so it can get a bit frustrating when no one is seemingly online.If you had a few friends and a love for zombie shooters I would definitely suggest this game.			"

Basically this what used to be an expansion now a standalone game answers the question ""What if Hitler had suceeded in raising demons using Satanic Rituals to help him win the war?"" Zombies carry weapons, some even have Sniper Rifles, and it is very likely you will die on the easiest difficulty settings. Fun singleplayer and very fun multiplayer campaign. There are about 6 hours od singleplayer and 5 of Co op campaign and non stop gore.  all in all a very good game for its price.			"

In February, 2016, albeit tough, I had managed to find people online to play with.Oh and spoiler alert.........The end boss was extermely dissapointing...the occult general was just like any other big boss in the game with floating skulls around him...which you had to shoot to win.... On top of that, he bugged out and didn't respawn after restarting the check point.I enjoy killing waves of zombies, but I had expected some kind of epic ending from a major boss...which didn't really happen.

												So, i am sort of a zombie video game snob, from CoD WaW, to black ops 3, i play left 4 dead one and two, i play how to survive, and i have played many other zombie games, but personally i have to agree with many people when i say this game  is a definite fun game, however short the campaign may be its still a fun game to play with friends just to mess around with, it kind of reminds me of zombies in WaW except with more moving around rather than staying in one place, i like how it spices things up by adding in zombies that shoot at you and some that kamakazie you, rather than just staying your basic zombie game, i also like how the game affords you all the weaponry you could want instead of having to stick to a basic loadout and damn near die with no ammo around, there are plenty of explosions to be had, plenty of bullets to be shot, and plenty of zombies to kill, these zombies specficily arent an easy thing to fight up close, they do great damage, but they arent over powered either, these zombies have got to be my favoriate, this game really sticks to how to kill a zombie just pop a round into the heart or head (zombies gotta have the heart to pump blood to the brain),which i right off the bat loved, i like how they also included the option of having the bullet cams still i loved those in the previoius games and love them in this one. the game doesnt need a beefy computer to run the program but it would help probably i have a basic laptop incapable of running some of the regular ones like sniper elite v3 for instance, but runs this perfectly, defitnily worth the 4.49 i paid for it, love every second of the game so far, the only complaint i have is that if you dont have a friend already to play with, its hard to find an online multiplayer match, because not many people play the multiplayer, so far as i know, but other than that fantastic zombie game, great graphics, great gore, grade A game, definitly not for serioiusness though as someone else stated, this is one of those games you play to shoot up zombies, blow up stuff, and have  laughs, and good fun! Thats about it for me, add me if you want to play some of this with someone else xD, enjoy this amazing game.			"

												Good games to have 1 & 2 together they make a full game lol both are short lived when played so together consider them a whole game but co-op side is nice n fun keep you and few buddies happy for 14hrs me and my brother beat both in 14hrs and 7hrs respectivly we restarted few levels so give or take its a 12 hr for 1 and 7hrs for the 2nd with 2 people on easy i think we played so harder difficulties might extend it's life. either way both 1 & 2 are worth playing. Wanna give warning if you get triolgy you can not play with people that have the single copies that comes from a dev so just toss that out there for yaz.			"

												Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 is a third person shooter game. It is a zombie game which continues the story of Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army (senza). This game is quite similar to senza 1, it just continues the story and improves a little bit of graphic issues, the rest stays the same. You have 4 characters, one of which is the protagonist of Sniper Elite 3, you will try to collect all the fragments with 0-3 players and escape Berlin.  This game contains a lot of blood and gore, but it gives the players a good feeling each time the players make a headshot, and is sometimes challenging to fight at the same time the Panzer soldier (the small boss) while trying to kill other zombies around him at the same time. However, I found this game not terrifying while it does give us an atmosphere of fear, this can be good (or bad) for the players trying to play through the campaign.I recommend this to all the fans of senza 1.Positive remarks+graphic improvement+story continuing+only talents and accuracy, no camping Negative remarks-doesn't have big changes in comparison with senza 1I think that's it, nothing much more to say.

												This is a good game. While it is most certainly is no godsend, it's a solid game.PROS+Awesome sinper mechanic+Large variety of WW2 weapons+Decent challenge for those who like more difficult games+Can be played without playing the first game+Good gunplay and action+Game looks pretty goodCONS-Game is pretty short (9-12 hours long)-Storyline is really basic and there really is not any sort of character development-Gameplay gets somewhat repetative-Lame final bossOverall I think this is definetly a good game to buy if you see it on sale someday.

												Got it on sale, but i wish i had gotten it sooner. I always thought the name ""Sniper Elite"" sounded cheezy so i never gave it a chance. After getting it with some friends, it quickly became one of my favorite group games to play. It's only a couple hours long, but the atmosphere, graphics, and gameplay are polished very well. Perfect for homework breaks for me and my friends.			"

												Great game! Took advantage of the weekend sale for 80% off and do not regret it! Took me about 6 Hours to complete the campaign. I thuroughly enjoyed playing this game and if you have yet to pick it up for yourself, i sugest that you do! Maybe wait for another sale b/c i feel that i beat it too fast for $15 game. You do not need to play the first game to know what the hell is going on in the game *AMEN*. Overall, amazing game, great graphics and a good storyline. :D Happy Gaming!			"

												For more $$, you get part 2 which is still fun, and short; graphics still look great but the same....its the same game pretty much. I think that should have just released both as one full game as both games only have 5 levels. In February, 2016, albeit tough, I had managed to find people online to play with.Oh and spoiler alert.........The end boss was extermely dissapointing...the occult general was just like any other big boss in the game with floating skulls around him...which you had to shoot to win.... On top of that, he bugged out and didn't respawn after restarting the check point.I enjoy killing waves of zombies, but I had expected some kind of epic ending from a major boss...which didn't really happen.

I have an i5 processor and an NVIDIA GEFORCE graphics card, and booted up this trainwreck and got about 5 frames per second. Have you ever had ten squeakers screaming in your ear to shoot the zombie on the left but you're basically playing a slideshow so you can do nothing and they continue to complain in you're ear until their mother's tell them it's their bedtime? You will experience this unless you have an AMD processor, so, best of luck.			"

												So, i am sort of a zombie video game snob, from CoD WaW, to black ops 3, i play left 4 dead one and two, i play how to survive, and i have played many other zombie games, but personally i have to agree with many people when i say this game  is a definite fun game, however short the campaign may be its still a fun game to play with friends just to mess around with, it kind of reminds me of zombies in WaW except with more moving around rather than staying in one place, i like how it spices things up by adding in zombies that shoot at you and some that kamakazie you, rather than just staying your basic zombie game, i also like how the game affords you all the weaponry you could want instead of having to stick to a basic loadout and damn near die with no ammo around, there are plenty of explosions to be had, plenty of bullets to be shot, and plenty of zombies to kill, these zombies specficily arent an easy thing to fight up close, they do great damage, but they arent over powered either, these zombies have got to be my favoriate, this game really sticks to how to kill a zombie just pop a round into the heart or head (zombies gotta have the heart to pump blood to the brain),which i right off the bat loved, i like how they also included the option of having the bullet cams still i loved those in the previoius games and love them in this one. the game doesnt need a beefy computer to run the program but it would help probably i have a basic laptop incapable of running some of the regular ones like sniper elite v3 for instance, but runs this perfectly, defitnily worth the 4.49 i paid for it, love every second of the game so far, the only complaint i have is that if you dont have a friend already to play with, its hard to find an online multiplayer match, because not many people play the multiplayer, so far as i know, but other than that fantastic zombie game, great graphics, great gore, grade A game, definitly not for serioiusness though as someone else stated, this is one of those games you play to shoot up zombies, blow up stuff, and have  laughs, and good fun! Thats about it for me, add me if you want to play some of this with someone else xD, enjoy this amazing game.			"

												Did a 6hr sitting of this game with my friends probably could have beaten it sooner without self sabotage but where's the fun in that?Anyway fun with a group and my advice would be to have extensive periods of time ""reloading"" consistently ""missing"" shots or having the difficulty ""mysteriously"" go up to make it feel like you defected to the zombies and are almost entirely responsible for the deaths of your companions.

												Good game, really recommend it if you played the first one, it's better in almost every aspects. They really improved on the sniper experience and upgraded the graphics alot too.Ofcourse it's your typical zombie FPS shooter, only with a twist (third person view) and your sniping them most of the time. You also find yourself trying to headshot alot because the zombies can revive themselves if you kill them without a headshot. There are different types of zombies and you have different strategies for defeating them.Overall an awesome shooter, which gives a twist to the typical zombie games.			"

												Good games to have 1 & 2 together they make a full game lol both are short lived when played so together consider them a whole game but co-op side is nice n fun keep you and few buddies happy for 14hrs me and my brother beat both in 14hrs and 7hrs respectivly we restarted few levels so give or take its a 12 hr for 1 and 7hrs for the 2nd with 2 people on easy i think we played so harder difficulties might extend it's life. either way both 1 & 2 are worth playing. Wanna give warning if you get triolgy you can not play with people that have the single copies that comes from a dev so just toss that out there for yaz.			"

												I thought that this game was impossible because i turned the zombie multiplier to 4 players on single player, which was definitely a mistake for my first playthrough.. 2 players is a little too easy for me 3 is very challenging, i usually die about 2 or 3 times per encounter before passing it. If you enjoy zombie killing games, and sniper games this is a good buy.			"

												Well, I can't say that I would recommend this game to everyone, but I must admit that I didn't expect it to be so attractive, it entertained me for almost 14 hours.Pros and cons:+ Atmosphere of good old trashy grindhouse movies (ZOMBE NAZIES â¥â¥â¥â¥ YEAH, green fog everywhere, terrifying voices and absolutely â¥â¥â¥â¥ed music (it's a compliment)+ Fancy graphics+ Easy and funny achievements+ YOU CAN KILL HITLER (It was Hitler, right?)- Terrible optimization (no, it's not just ""terrible"", it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ING TERRIBLE)- Terrible unstable and abandoned co-op. Better play it with 1-2 friends. And don't even think of playing it alone, it kills half of the fun.To sum up, game is totally worth it's price when it is on sale (2 bucks in my country). If you can overcome all its drawbacks, you will enjoy it, I guarantee.			"

												First of all I love Zombies... I had enjoyed the Left for dead and call of duty zombies, but this is the one i like the best.  This is the closest to the Romero vision of zombies.  Even the music sounds like its straight out of the movies he has done.  I love the sniper cam.  I got the trilogy for my son on his Xbox one, and i got this for my pc.  It took an hour to adjust to the mouse/keyboard way, but in little time i was hitting most everything i shot.  This game would have been way more popular if more people knew about it.  I saw that metacritic only gave it a 53/100, i want to punch them in the face!  Again I love zombies, and also WW2 weapons.  I love this game!			"

												Quite fun game to play, 6,5/10Pros: + Quite good graphics, same good as in NZA1.+ 5 new chapters, story of NZA1 continues, in my opinion this has better chapters.+ Fun game to play on multiplayer IF you find other players.+ X-ray killcam, same as in other Sniper Elite games.+ Trading Cards.Cons:- This is quite short game, just like NZA1 was, it takes like 5-10h to play whole the story of this game, depends on your settings.- Hard to find players in multiplayer, this game is almost as dead as NZA1. Ask other players to play with you on Steam Community Discussions.- Can't kick players from multiplayer games. Once on my team one player was afking 24mins and we couldn't do anything.- Doesn't have much nothing new when comparing to NZA1, only new chapters, not even new   guns.- Sometimes not so smoothly playable. Can be laggy too, and there are some glitches and bugs.- Can be boring when playing alone.Not worth of 14,99â¬, buy when it is -50% or -75%. Or just buy (on sale of course)  Zombie Army Trilogy, it's better.			"

												Left4Dead meets Sniper Elite. Played whole campaign in 4 players and it was quite enjoyable experience.But I wouldn't touch it solo, it would get boring pretty fast. Killing endless hordes of nazi zombies is always more fun with friends.Pros:- good coop game- WW2 setting (nazi zombies)- there is a serviceable story- dark art direction- few memorable moments- lot of shooting (preferably to head)Cons:- bad solo game- controls are clunky at first- a bit short and not very varied- no character progression or unlocks (might have been fun)- selection of weapons (they all feel the same)7/10 with friends, 4/10 solo. Get it cheap.			"

												This game is ment mainly for playing with friends. Ive only played solo but still enjoyed the game but it has its flawes. First, it has a lot of repetition. secound the kill shots are either uncommon instandard, or almost every other kill in increased. But the game has a great art style and has a wonderful atmosphere, the sound disign is good but i feel like the zombies yell too much for how slow they go. the story dosent stick too much for me but I only have a little over an hour of play at the time of righting this review. And i didnt play the first game. i would pick this game up on sell like i did for a little under 5 buck. the game is worth it at that price and make sure atleast you have one friend willing to play it with youfour broken zombie skulls out of five :)			"
