												Guacamelee is a platforming luchadorean adventure where you must rescue your senorita bonita from the devious and hellish Calaca.I fully completed the game, with all 60 achievements, in 20 hours. The game was incredibly fun. During the normal playthrough, the keys move and feel great, and the abilities are all super fun and responsive and fitting. The bosses were interesting, and the game was satisfying.After completion, I enjoyed going around, completing the area and the zones, which was so enjoyable I decided to just complete the entire game again in Hard mode!Hard mode, however, was a surprise, as parts of it were genuinely hard! Usually, as a longtime gamer, I'll find hard mode to simply be ""normal"" level of difficulty, but in Guacamelee the bosses and, later on in the last zones, even the mobs, are incredibly challenging, which again gives a satisfying edge for further completion.I'd highly recommend this game at any price, but as it's an older game it will undoubtedly be on sale soon, so ensure you pick up this very fun and engaging title when it is!Nilesy			"

												I don't recommend this game, it has a better version located at: Buy that one instead. This one is outdated and no longer supported - shady business practice by the Developer. Should've been either DLC (yuck!) or free upgrades like Trine developers doing. Note: as per 18/1/2015, the new game is on Humble Bundle Weekly Brawler: https://www.humblebundle.com/weekly "

			Views: 6,096		

			We check out Guacamelee, a mash up of Mexican culture and metroidvania goodness from Drinkbox! Please like and subscribe for more reviews, gameplay, and discussions!		

The metroidvania subgenre's popularity has erupted with the popularity of downloadable titles and the burgeoning indie scene. Their emphasis on exploration and character building make them instant favorite for those looking for those looking for retro gaming experiences with contemporary flavor. In addition to that contemporary flavor, Guacamelee is also spiced with chili powder and served with a shot of tequila. It's a south of the border styled adventure packed with plenty of platforming and pugilism as well as a sexy senorita in distress. It also might be, surprisingly, one of the best games you will play all year. You play as a simple agave farmer named Juan who finds himself having the worst Día de los Muertos celebration ever when and evil Charro named Calaca abducts El Presidente's daughter and sends Juan to the underworld. In a small stroke of luck Juan is resurrected and transformed into a luchadore so that he may rescue El Presidente's daughter and stop Calaca from wreaking havoc among the living. The plot is Guacamelee is what pico de gallo is to a taco, it provides color and flavor but certainly isn't the main attraction. The healthy dose of humor and Mexican culture and folklore do distinguish Guacamelee from its contemporaries however and give it a unique ambiance. Unlike most metroidvania styled games, Guacamelee places a huge emphasis on platforming and some optional areas have an almost Super Meat Boy like difficulty requiring quick and precise actions to traverse the obstacles laid out. Most of Juan's offensive repertoire doubles as a means to navigate the environment. A Street Fighter style flaming uppercut acts as a super jump, a charging maneuver that can be devastating to your foes is also effective when it comes to smashing blocks. By the end of the game these abilities can be combined into lengthy, deadly combos and used to reach far off platforms. Juan also eventually gains the ability to swap between the world of the living and the world of the dead and much like The Gianna Sisters, things change between worlds, opening up new passageways and allowing Juan to reach previously inaccessible areas.The fundamentals of combat are simple enough on the surface with one button throwing punches, another dedicated to special attacks and one used to grapple enemies once enough damage has been doled out. Grapples are very effective for crowd control since once an enemy is in Juan's grasp the game slows down and an arrow indicates where your foe will be tossed and throwing your enemies into each other is always a good idea. Special grapple maneuvers can also be purchased at the games save points for additional offensive options. Costumes, health and stamina upgrades are also available for purchase. Combat starts out simple enough but over the course of the game's six or so hours enemy types are mixed up and combined with the platforming ca pose a satisfactory challenge. Some enemies have shields that require a particular special to bring down. Bosses also challenge your mastery of Juan's skills and many offer multiple phases. As with any metroidvania game backtracking is a necessity if you want to grab every secret that Guacamelee has to offer and this is made painless as a result of a fantastic map and plentiful fast travel points. Blocks that require specific abilities to break are color coded and their location is marked on your map making them easy to find on repeat visits once Juan has the proper skills to smash them. Chests are also marked on the map. Rounding out the distractions are a handful of side missions who can be found by talking to the citizens of the two towns you are able to visit. These missions involve everything from simple mini games to talking to every citizen in an effort to gather the ingredients necessary to make the world greatest enchilada. The only problem with these side missions is that they are very centralized and don't really require any exploration. It's easy to complete most of them within a matter of minutes.			"

												Guacamelee is an action platformer that was released in August 2013, published and developed by DrinkBox Sudios. Originally pinned as a Sony exclusive on the PS3 and Vita, it was however later ported to PC before eventually getting the ""Gold Edition"" releasing on all of the platform in mid 2014. Guacamelee is heavily based on Mexican culture and lore. You play the role of Juan, a powerful luchador fighter. You will be fighting various different enemies in this platforming metroidvania style game. You start off with a very basic arsenal of attacks which you can pull off such as a basic three attack combo, but eventually you can work you way up to combos which can consist of eight plus button presses! (I never managed to pull off one of these more than once). Juan will also learn a various number of ""out of combat"" skills, such as wall jumping and the ability to turn into a chicken. The platforming element of Guacamelee was probably the most annoying for me, mainly because I am just terrible at the genre, but I found the jumping puzzles to be just tedious and grew very thin on my patience at times.  The fighting side of the game is done very well; the combo system and special moves you can pull off are all really well done - some fights you will end up getting swamped by enemies, but it won't matter since you can throw together a number of punches which will just knock them out with ease. Graphically, there isn't too much to shout about, it's a 2d side scroller so generally nothing spectacular is going to be seen, however the art style on show is gorgeous. This really portrays the Mexican style of game extremely well, and is probably the game's best feature. It looks very similar to the recent release of ""The Book of Life"" from 2014. Whilst it has a cartoon look to it, there is still an element of maturity and darkness in some of the scenes. The plot in Guacamelee! was nice. It is your typical adventure style story, the humble farmer who is in love with the El Presidente's daughter, the daughter then gets kidnapped, and it is your task to rescue her so you can live happily ever after.  The plot is very well thought out, offers a couple of cliffhangers and interesting twists and turn a long the way. Guacamelee also has a couple of comical moments in too to lighten the mood. Guacamelee is another game which doesn't have voice acting in; I would really of liked to have seen (or heard) it included, because there is quite a bit of text to read through and I would of thought that having voice acting would make people get more immersed into this wonderful world on show. Having said that, the sound track is amazing. It is playing pretty much constantly throughout the game, and it never wears thin. As I said above, the I found the platforming side of the game to be the most annoying, mainly because it is super difficult to progress in the game due to a number of jumping puzzles which had me close to rage quiting a number of times. Eventually you will get past them, it just takes perseverance and a lot of patience (something I am slowly finding out that I don't have very much of).  Most of the fight scenes are easily mastered and you probably won't find your self dying an awful lot in this game. The opportunity to raise the difficulty level may change this though, which is something more confident veteran combo fighters will want to check out. The world in which Guacamelee is set in, is very well fleshed out. There are plenty of NPCs to interact with, loads of side quests to find and complete, most of which are of no relevance to the main story, and is just an extra way to generate funds. Touching again on the topic of special abilities, you will also find your self backtracking to a degree in the game so you can use the new abilities you have just unlocked to reach places which you couldn't before, to unlock chests, health bonuses etc. You will also find a number of shops scattered around the world where you can purchase health and stamina upgrades along with a number of other power ups. A full playthrough of Guacamelee took me almost eleven hours to complete; this was with the inclusion of the majority of the side quests too. I would say that eleven hours is just the right amount for me. The game also has a local co-op mode which you will find adds a whole new element to the game as well and is certainly worth a second playthrough on this mode, easily touching this game up to the twenty hour mark - and then of course there are the higher difficulty modes you can play on should you desire so. There is plenty of content on offer in Guacamelee to sink your teeth into.No technical issues here; played on 4k resolution, at a steady 60 FPS as should be expected from a 2d side scroller. You will need a controller to play this game to any degree of competency though, simple because the jumping puzzles and combos would just be ridiculously hard to counter on a keyboard. The options menu also includes a wide variety of options when it comes to selecting resolutions and frame rates too, which is always nice to see. In conclusion, Guacamelee! is a really rounded out game, which is certainly one of the best indie titles to come out in recent years. The addition of local co-op makes this game even better, and fans of metroidvania style games really need to check this out. The price of £9,99 is an absolute bargain for the amount of content on show here too.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												As great as this Gold Edition is, there is a new Super Turbo Championship Edition. So why bother getting this version when they're the same price?Guacamelee is a joy to play platforming beat'em up done in a Metroidvania style with a lot of flair and fresh ideas for an old genre. The combat is excellent. Easy to play, tough to master. Attack button, special attack, roll trigger and jump are the basics you need to know. You can uppercut enemies into the air, jump and punch them, roll through enemy attacks and hazards, grapple enemies to throw them in any direction you want. There is good stuff here. Then as the game progresses, you unlock special moves, like jumping uppercuts, wall jumps, double jumps, headbutts, frog stomps, wall climbs where you shoot yourself straight until something stops you. All of this is considered combat, but in Guacamelee it is also a means of traversing. Jump uppercut will let you break red walls or its used as an extra boost while in mid air. Now just that, but the game's enemies will eventually have shields that can only be broken by special attacks. The shields are all color coated, such as jumping uppercuts break red walls and red shields. Yellow shields and walls are broken by headbutts and so on. Then on top of that there's an extra layer of day and night worlds or living and dead worlds. You flip through them to traverse or take out enemies that can only take damage in the living or day. They still hit you if you're not in their world, but you just can't hit them.Each world full of bright, vibrant and beautiful colors. The game is a joy to look at as well as play. Great simple story, the president's daughter has been kidnapped and you are killed, but resurrected by a luchadore mask. Everything has a lucha Mexican vibe to it and that makes the game feel so fresh and different instead of space worlds or never ending castles. The world isn't that big and really it feels like there are a few specific combat areas tied together by a major town. There's no real chance to get lost, since you have a map and the map will always point you to your objective, without revealing rooms that you've been in.While the combat is easy and joyful enough, the game really starts getting tricky with your powers. Such as having to wall jump back and forth all while switching between the living and dead worlds. Timing plays a big part in the later areas. There are plenty of side rooms with parts of heart and stamina containers that will really test your skills and timing, but since there are frequent easy challenges, it makes the big challenges seem less daunting and have a 'one more try' mentality.I have completed the game on PSN and it seems like the Gold Edition on Steam is just easier when it comes to bosses. The bosses are simpler and I can't say that's a bad thing. Maybe its because there is no difficulty setting for the Gold Edition. Steam also offers character skins in the Steam Workshop, which is always nice.On PSN I completed the game in 4 or so hours and that's when it was more difficult. That might not be enough play time in some people's opinion, but it was an absolute joy to play and well worth the time and money. I'd much rather have a game be short and sweet than long and boring.			"

												Guacamelee! is a colorful 2D action platformer by Canadian developer DrinkBox set in a vibrant and thoroughly unique world inspired by Mexican folklore. The players take over the role of an agave farmer Juan who becomes a luchador after El Presidente’s Daughter is kidnapped by a charro skeleton Carlos Calaca. It’s as zaney as it sounds, but it just works. The story is basic and presented only in text, the writing isn’t great, but you’ll get a few chuckles out of it here and there.The first thing you’ll notice are the fantastic audiovisuals that set the tone beautifully. The game world is a wonderful fusion of vibrant colors and cheerful music. The soundtrack is simply awesome, it sounds as if a house DJ remixed a mariachi band. Both of these elements come together to create a game world that is simply a joy to explore.Considering that Juan is a luchador, the combat is melee-based – as the game title itself suggests. It starts off very basic with only a few moves, but you will unlock a healthy amount of varied and satisfying special moves during the course of the game. These are mostly wrestling moves such as the body slam or the headbutt. Different enemies will require different tactics and moves and they will sometimes be color-coded which means that only a specific attack can hurt them. Also, the game will at one point introduce a dimension-shifting mechanic which will alternate between the living and the dead worlds. Certain enemies can only be beaten in a specific dimension. Once the game starts throwing enemies in different colors and dimensions, the combat gets incredibly frenetic and intense due to the amount of stuff you need to consider. The fast-paced combat feels good thanks to sharp controls and the variety of moves at your disposal. Guacamelee! is a really tough game and you have to be vigilant at all times as you will often get beaten to a pulp. But it just feels so good that I always felt compelled to keep trying and get it right.Outside of combat, there’s a fairly nice-sized world to explore full of secrets to find. But it will be incredibly hard getting to those goodies. This is where the platforming and dimension swapping come into its own. Certain platforms, walls or columns will only be visible in a certain dimension and the game will often make you switch dimensions mid-jump. It can get pretty nerve-wracking as the game demands pinpoint precision. Once again, the stellar controls make it worthwhile to persevere even though the fiendish difficulty will try its best to break your spirit.Guacamelee’s retro design is both its strength and weakness. There’s no question that the design is strong, but it will at times give in to needless trial and error drowning the player in frustrating repetition. It will also feel cheap at times with enemies that will strike in moments when you really can’t do anything. But the sense of accomplishment is great indeed. I would say that a game like this is more enjoyable on the second run. Once you’ve unlocked all your powers and moves, the level of frustration drops down significantly.In the end, Guacamelee! does what it sets out to do masterfully. Despite the overly punishing difficulty and a few design quibbles, it’s a great game worth playing for its fantastic world, frenetic combat and satisfying platforming.8 OUT OF 10 (GREAT)			"

												NOTE:  Before you start, bear in mind that there's a better version that was released later and can be bought for the same price, more or less. I strongly recommend that you check that one. However, if, for some reason, the GOLD edition is on sale and the TURBO isn't, there isnt really THAT MUCH to miss. Newer release here: Guacamelee! is a game that brings nothing new to the front table. Its roots are pretty obvious, as it's a game that pays a staggering homage to the likes of Metroid and Castlevania. However, it adds nice puzzle elements and blends everything with such finesse and precision that elevates this game way beyond the ""old school tribute"" that many Indy games seem to be around these days, as it's safe to say, the boys from Drinkbox Studios went the extra mile and dwelled way pass their confort zone.The graphics are amazing, the art has that Comic book feel to it and the colors are warm and well put together. Every character has their own feel and, despite their all sharing that Mexican Luchadore vybe with the masks, skulls and marching mariachis, they have their own sense of indivuality so the game wont bore you with that. Soundtrack is nice as well and the sound effects are really retro, part what I like most about this. Apart from the challenging puzzles, the part that I liked most was certainly the bosses, specially the Leopard fight, it was one of the hardest and most fun I've ever faced. Overall, great game with a nice amount of replay-value.			"

												Guacamelee is likely my favorite title of any video game ever, which makes it a good thing the game that actually bares it is so awesome! Drinkbox Studios, developers of one of my other favorites from recent years, Mutant Blobs Attack, has completely outdone themselves with not only their best creation yet, but one of the most fun and charming games of the year.In a world that all but worships Luchadores, Juan is just a normal guy who hope he may one day have a shot with the governor's daughter. But when a band of demon's attack he is sent on a one way trip to the land of the dead, he must don the mask and become a Luchadore to save his beloved (and as it turns out, the entire world).It's a setup seen a million times, but here it's tweeted and turned into a hilarious and unexpectedly engaging tale. Full of terrific and hilarious writing, as well as fantastic characters that while encompassing cliched roles, are all fully developed and likable (even the villains, crazy as it may sound). If this was a movie I'd have been impressed, but when paired with the great gameplay it's truly an amazing experience.For fans of metroidvanias, this is the equivalent of being serenaded by a mariachi band outside your window. The world strikes the perfect balance between size and navigability,making it almost impossible to get lost but hiding tons of secrets to find. In classic fashion certain areas are blocked off until you collect the requisite move, but what Guacamelee does that not many games of this sort do is make almost every move you gain equally usable in combat and exploration, keeping both parts fresh throughout.The combat system is easy to understand and yet full of depth in how you use it. Only a few buttons are used but combining them can produce a wealth of different moves, and it's up to you to make the most of them to rack up huge combos, or just stick to the basics and punch everyone in the face. Boss fights require a bit more planning in how you approach them, and this does present a slight problem as they put up a much better fight than most of their minions. Thankfully it's usually just a matter of memorizing their patterns in order to finally beat them.Platforming is the other half of the package, and the level designs are outstanding. Utilizing familiar moves like double jumps and wall jumping, they place you in new and creative scenarios that proved a joy to navigate. It's not until you begin to use one the most prominent mechanics though, switching between the world of the dead and that of the living, that the levels really take off. Because some platforms (and in combat, enemies) can only be seen in one realm or the other you have to quickly switch between them as you jump from point to point in an amazing display of platforming genius. Even the early sections top anything Mutant Blobs had to offer, and the quality only goes up from their.A couple of minor playability problems do pop up, with the somewhat clunky controls being chief among them. Because you are required to use the stick and buttons in conjunction with one another to pull off most special moves, it can lead to problems where you are pressing the stink in the opposite direction you need to be heading  often sending you off a cliff or into the path of an enemy. They aren't bad, but they could have been better and make some of the more difficult sections terribly frustrating. I also wish that side-missions were highlighted on your map, as there isn't any indication of them in the game and without the achievements informing me of their existence I'd likely have missed them.Despite these minor issues Guacamelee is an all around excellent experience that makes it easy to gloss over the few rough spots. The art style is brilliant and creative, the gameplay very enjoyable, and the soundtrack a freaking incredible blending of contemporary hip-hop and rock, and traditional Mexican Ranchera music. It's a great deal of fun and incredibly charming though and through, and most of all a game everyone should take the time to play. Viva la Drinkbox!			"

												Finally, a Metroidvania-style game I can really get into. The beat-em-up gameplay is simple yet satisfying most of the time, including some challenging and well-designed boss fights. The game's aesthetics are the real clincher for me, though, with the great blocky luchador art and FANTASTIC Mexican-electronic-fusion soundtrack. Totally worth it.			"

												I can tell that Guacamelee is an excellent game that many people will enjoy. The art is great, the music is great, and the game is very clever in a lot of places. However, once you get deep into it, everything sort of devolves into a series of contrived and unforgivingly difficult jumping puzzles. They're not particularly hard to figure out, but they are almost certain to be incredibly frustrating to execute.I think the controls are partially to blame. As the game progresses you earn more and more super moves, taking the controls from tight and simple to needlessly complex. Also, my platforming reflexes have dulled with age a bit, so I'm partially to blame. Either way, this is probably one of the hardest games I've played in a very long time, if not ever.The beginning of the game is simple, charming and enjoyable. As it became more difficult it wore out its welcome quickly to the point that I found myself really not enjoying it anymore. If you're young and have the dexterity and patience for this, I highly recommended it. Ultimately for me it gets a thumbs down because my fat thumbs and I were ready to snap the controller in half by the time I decided to stop playing and move on to something more worth my time.			"

												Guacamelee is a game I can't say enough good things about.  It is a very well-crafted metroidvania game with a great combat system and a very unique setting.  I don't think I've heard of any other games where you play a luchadore.From the graphical style to the music, the writing and the sense of humor, gameplay and combat design, every aspect of this game is top notch.  There are also a lot of references to indie and classic video games such as Super Mario Bros, Castle Crashers, Viva Pinata, and of course, Metroid.  A couple memes are thrown into the mix which may be an issue for some people, but only ones that would reasonably fit the game setting were chosen so I don't think it's a problem.The combat system is fast, fluid, and a lot of fun.  You can pull off some great combos and it even takes some cues from fighting games, adding mechanics like dodge canceling of special moves.  The game also includes a set of alternate costumes you can unlock which affect your combat abilities and strength.If you're a fan of beat-em-up games or metroidvanias, I think you would enjoy this game.  It has definitely become one of my favorites.			"

												I got Guacamelee! in a Humble Bundle purchase and  added it to my library paying it no mind like so many of us do to so many games we get in bundles.Recently something came over PolyVector and me while browsing through our Steam libraries looking for something to play, and as we both looked at each other hovering over Guacamelee!, we laughed and fired it up to brawl couch co-op style.This game was a surprise gem! The combo based fighting (button masher) combined with tons of references, secrets, and jokes made for a enchalada filled adventure we weren't expecting. The side quests and hidden treasures are addictive. The art style is playful. The soundtrack is also fun!If you happen to have this game gathering virtual dust in your library, stop neglecting it and start playing it now! My favorite play mechanic was being able to change into a chicken (later in the game) to navigate the villages and temples.If you haven't picked this game up yet, STOP WHERE YOU ARE! While I think it's worth a purchase, you should go grab the new Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition instead.			"

												Guacamelee! is a solid action-adventure game. I'm feeling lazy so you know what that means?BULLET POINTS!!!!!!!!!2+Combat is good. As you progress you get new moves and can create some wicked combos. It's not at all necessary to win fights, but it's fun to play around with.+Nice bits of exploration. Each area has plenty of secret rooms, some offering different challenges. The game is well-paced and simply getting from place to place is rewarding.+As with any Metroidvania worth its salt, Guacamelee! can be played through in a variety of ways. 100%, Low %, speedrunning, etc. +There are quite a few challenging platforming segments. They make strong use of an ability to switch between worlds and have different platforms appear. Also most of the special moves are used effectively as transportation. It's all very well done.+Good bosses, though you're probably better off playing Hard mode if you want them to be really challenging.+Plenty of side-content.-A couple of optional items are placed in obtuse locations. I'm usually pretty decent at finding stuff in Metroidvanias, but I had to look up a guide to figure these out. More of a nitpick really.-For 80% of the game, hard mode is basically just enemies doing more damage. The bosses really step it up, which is welcome but can also make the difficulty feel uneven.-The Chupacabra's sword-stab does a crazy amount of damage. It's like...I don't know..It just really stands out. Oh and yeah this also counts as nitpicking.-Controller issue. This is an odd one. Basically whenever I hit RT to switch between worlds, there are times when the button gets stuck or doesn't respond. I've read some posts where other posters mention this issue. It's possible that it could just be my controller, but I'm not going to buy a new one when this game and RE6 are the only ones I have this problem with. Besides, this glitch is fixed in the ""Super Turbo Championship Edition"" of Guacamelee.I recommend this game.Oh wait, that's redundant isn't it? I already gave it the thumbs up. Oh well.			"

												I got the game long time ago in the Humble Bundle and found it while sorting my Game Library. Originally I only wanted to farm the Trading Cards and gave it a short try, but I just couldn't stop playing and ended with a 5 hour session. This game is now one of my favourite skill based platformers. The difficulty increases at a perfect pace in my opinion. It's also nice that you visit old areas/levels after getting new skills, so you can reach secrets. At some points it's really hard to advance and you need to combine all skills you have curretnly available. I advice you to use a gamepad for this game, with a keyboard it might be very tricky and cause frustration. At least there is a great soundtrack with lots of different songs and they are not annoying when you are trying this one hard jump for the 50th time. Some things that could imrpove the gaming experience would be more spoken dialogue, it's really alot ot read. Also some cut scenes and splash screens have a really annoying colour flashing, so I needed to close my eyes whenever they appeared before I got an epileptic seizure. :DAs I said earlier, I'm now 5 hours into the game and it feels like I achieveved alot, I would guess I'm at around 80% completion and I can't wait for tomorrow to finish the rest and get all the remaining achievements aswell. The game even has a Cooperation Mode that I will probably never try, but maybe it's interesting for some people. The 'Super Turbo Championship Edition' (a polished version with some more content) is actually on sale now, so I would go ahead and buy it. Definitely worth the money if you enjoy platformers with a certain challenge.			"

												I have a love/hate relationship with this game.  I love the art and design.  I enjoy the light and dark world mechanics.  I like the fighting mechanics (though they can be a bit difficult).  I liked the platforming for a long time too, until I started climbing the Tule Tree…The Tule Tree platforming suddenly feels like I'm playing Super Meat Boy instead of a Metroid-like brawler.  I climbed most of the way up but ended up deleting the game before I thew my controller after failing for the 50th time on a jump/swap/double jump/swap/wall jump/swap/double jump/swap/wall jump/swap/double jump/swap/wall jump/swap/double jump/swap/ move.  Did I mention that if you fail this you probably fall farther down and have to repeat a jump/swap/double jump/wall jump/swap/double jump/wall jump/swap/double jump/wall jump section that is also quite challenging?  (I realize that that long string of moves doesn't make much sense unless you've played this part of the game; just know it's long and requires split second precision).I like challenging games but the difficulty spikes in this one are insane.

												Guacamelee is a really fun Metroid-like platformer with an equipment system similar to Zelda where you earn melee abilities that help you progress through the game. The story is pretty typical ""hero saving the day"" type stuff but its not too heavy so it really doesn't get in the way of enjoying the action of playing. The fighting system is the highlight of this game, and is really intuitive and has a wide set of tools once you start upgrading his/her abilities. Anyone can pick up a controller and join your game at anytime which is really cool, they can also work on upgrading their character as well. The art style in combination with the fiesta style music feels really lively and compelling and is really what helps set this game apart from others like it. The game switches between the real world and an underworld occasionally and that adds some aesthetic complexity. I haven't beat it yet but so far its pretty cool and living up to my expectations, 8/10.			"

												☺ Good Pacing.☺ Smooth controls (Note: Played with an XBox Controller).☺ Great style.☺ Humour and tributes to gaming.☹ Sidequests.Recommended for fans of action platformers.Guacamelee! is a metroidvania style platformer bursting with Mexican flavour as you play a farmhand turned Luchador through beautiful and colourful environments as he try's to rescue the Governors Daughter and attempts to keep the worlds of the living and the dead from combining into one.You'll start off knowing your basics, how to brawl and jump around and steadily become introduced to new enemies requiring different tactics and new skills to help you along your way. The pacing is great, just as you begin to master a technique the game introduces a new ability and a new set of challenges to overcome. By the end of the game, you'll be weaving all of your abilities together, evading traps and fighting enemies from two dimensions through some challenging but fair levels. The controls are solid and the animations are very fluid allowing you to chain combo's together seamlessly whether defeating enemies or manoeuvring through the world.The only slight quibble I had with the game (and certainly not enough that it dampened the experience) were a couple of sidequests, complete with ! Questclamation marks, which while they could have been poking fun...they seemed a little out of place and ruined the lovely flow the game otherwise has.The main game is a decent length for a first run through, clocking in at around 6 hours for me. On top of that, there are a handful of secrets still left to discover and some genuinely tough challenges to attempt to beat, adding to the value.A recommended and enjoyable game from start to finish.  Squeeze into your latex trousers, dust off your mask and get in the ring!			"

												There's a lot more to wish from indy hit Guacamelee but one thing the game does right, one thing from which all other game companies should learn, one thing so important that it got me to start writing video game reviews on a hopefully weekly basis, and that's GAME DIFFICULTY.Game Difficulty is not an excuse to make players redo the whole stage over and over again because you missed a jump. ""Difficult"" is not adding HP or extra damage to monsters. I swear there are still too many punishing mechanics masked as challenge curves  such as forcing the player to wait or rushing to reclaim everything that you've earned in a previous playthrough. ""Difficult"" makes the player think and plan. ""Difficult"" should challenge the game developer as much as it challenges the player.Guacamelee is difficult, especially if you want the true ending, but it's not punishing. I miss a jump, I go back to the last platform, I try again. THIS IS HOW IT SHOULD BE. THIS IS WHAT EARNS THIS GAME THE THUMBS UP FROM THIS REVIEWER. I never felt like I was wasting any time playing Guacamelee. There's variety in the platforming challenges, introduced by incorporating the special moves that you discover as tools to broaden movement. The Rooster Uppercut introduces double, then triple jumps. The Dashing Derpderp (bad name, I know), brings a horizontal dash and so forth... There's no resource management to worry about (and that's including health management), you just have the platform challenge in its purest form.I'm old. Thirty-five years old. I've played the old NES platformers. There is absolutely nothing good to remember from any of these games. None. I'm gushing because I remember ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Castlevania, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ninja Turtles and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Megaman and Guacamalee ISN'T LIKE THAT. Thank goodness. By the way, that's why every review of Shovel Knight has made me wary of it. Briefly considered it, considered the hype, remembered the old days and went NUH-UH.Ironically, the hard mode of this game is a complete wash. Just more damage from the monsters and more hits required to kill 'em. Kinda breaks the whole point of my review but I really wanted to laud everything else about this game.It really does seem like a fun challenging platformer with monsters thrown in because of course you need monsters to smash. A whole combo tutorial camp and none of its lessons are ever necessary. A game built around luchadors and then you have this weak♥♥♥♥♥combat system. It's kind of a bait-and-switch in that regard: the moves you unlock seem to have a platforming purpose first and an enemy bashing purpose second... Artificial purpose at that, what with the introduction of colored shields to force you to use the appropriately colored attack. That's a juvenile way to handle combat. Boss fights centered on pattern recognition? Yes, that is a hallmark from the platformers of old but that doesn't mean you couldn't add some innovation on it.I ain't mad, and this is coming from a huge wrestling fan who bought the game because he wanted to play a luchador protagonist. The rest of the game made it worth it.			"

												This game is the buenoest. I love it so much. Drinkbox is a great developer with a flair for really colorful visual design. (Play Mutant Blobs Attack in case you missed it!!) Also I have a ""thing"" for Dia de la Muerta stuff, so Guacamelee was a no-brainer. Game sat in my library forever because I didn't have time to play it. It's awesome. Stylish, fun, challenging. A couple of the jumping puzzles are just a *bit* too frustrating, AKA no bueno. And I'm not sure how I feel about all the boss fights. But these are quibbles. I beat the game on normal just in time for the Ultimate Edition's launch on Steam. Also don't miss the Workshop stuff. You can reskin the main character as He-Man, the Punisher, etc. Arriba!			"

												Guacamelee is a Metroidvania-style game with a strong emphasis on platforming and brawling. As with other games in this genre, you have some freedom to explore the world, with access to new areas controlled by gaining new abilities. Exploring this beautiful Mexican art inspired world is made easy with the game's great map system and fast travel points. Blocked areas that require specific abilities to enter are color coded and are marked on the map making them easy to go back to once you have the ability to break them.The platforming sections are mostly challenging. You'll be combining precision jumping, special moves, roll/dodge, and switching worlds to reach distant platforms. The combat provides a good challenge as well, and as a luchador you will punch and grapple your way through different enemy types that you'll be facing in bunches. As you go deeper in the game, these enemies will have different types of shields requiring a certain type of move to break. Some will also exist in one world or the other and you must be in the correct world to attack them. It took me around 8 hours to finish this in my first playthrough, but there's some replay value to it as you can play as other characters with different attributes. There are also some side quests, collectibles, and you can continue exploring the world after you've beaten the final boss. Highly recommended.			"

												Finally finished this on Normal mode and found it extremely enjoyable up until 3/4 of the game was done.Unfortunately, the last 1/4 of the game turns into true platform-hell-overdrive, and you'll find yourself dropping off platforms, being spiked to death, and become more and more frustrated as the abuse drags on. It just becomes hard and tedious work and you feel like you haven't got enough fingers to pull off super-annoying 3-4 click combos in the fraction of a second to do the platforming.It really soured the experience for me, but because the rest of the game was excellent up to the final parts, I still recommend this. Perhaps I'm getting too old to pull off lightning fast moves and the platforming will cater to a younger audience.So, play this anyway, just be aware that the casual and really great gameplay you start off with won't last the whole game through, and some might want to watch the final stages and bosses on Youtube to preserve their sanity.

												While the game looks and plays smoothly (with a controller), some of the platforming sections are beyond brutal and to add more frustration they decide to just toss random enemies at you while you are stuck doing complicated jumps. With no difficulty settings it can be quite a pain in the butt trying to complete certain sections of the game.If you are a platform fanatic go for it, but the average player just looking for a stress free game, stay far away.

												Guacamelee! Gold Edition is gorgeous. It's interesting. It's full of pop culture references. It's polished. It's rewarding. It's fun. But most of all, it's challenging, in both good and bad ways.I'm not usually interested in or any good at brawling games where hit combos are the focus and often the key to victory. I gave up on Arkham Asylum for those reasons. But Guacamelee!'s combat system is relatively easy to learn, remember, and execute (with a gamepad), even as more and more depth is added. The game made me work to, ahem, ""get good,"" and my fingers definitely imprinted some muscle memories onto my brain, but it was worth the mental and digital effort. Beating the marrow out of skeletons is fun! Dying a dozen times at the hands of the same boss can be frustrating, but figuring out the attack patterns and necessary reactions and finally beating the bad guy is so... satisfying. And scoring large combos, while not absolutely necessary for victory, provided me with more upgrade money and therefore incentive to play thoughtfully. I felt less like I was mashing buttons and more like I had a plan, even if I didn't always carry it out perfectly.The game does a great job of acclamating the player to the additional combat and platforming mechanics that are introduced as the story is told. I was happy to fail in the face of and then adapt to the new challenges. But by the end of the game I had hit my own personal skill ceiling. If you're more skilled than me, well, carry on, my wayward agave farmer, but I had had enough.The combat and platforming involved in the main story is of moderate difficulty, but some of the optional platforming puzzles and combat challenges are tedious and frustrating, if not almost impossible, especially near the end of the game. While I had failed earlier platforming challenges 30+ times but kept plugging away until I succeeded, I simply gave up on many of the later challenges, particularly in the tree tops and the hallways of hell.I'm typically a completionist when it comes to achievements, secrets, unlocks, etc., in video games. Like collectable pocket monsters, I want to get them all if I can, even if it takes a large amount of time and effort. But not this time. Sure, revisiting areas to explore previously inaccessible nooks was worth my time. It was enjoyable to do what I couldn't do before. But I'm simply not skilled or patient enough to attain a 100% completion rating.Guacamelee! broke my will and spirit. It taught me my limits. But it also taught me I could be successful while playing a 2D brawling platformer. No, I'll never unlock all of the achievements. I'll never access that golden elevator. And I'll never collect all the pieces of the Luchador mask. But I had fun beating one boney♥♥♥♥♥after another after another.			"

												Guacamelee is part beat-em-up, part challenging platformer and part Metroidvania explorer.  Does this sound like an appealing combination to you?  Yes?  Then just get it right now, because you will enjoy it.Every part of this game is well done and polished.  The combat is smooth and gives a good feeling of advancement, doling out new abilities that both add to the fun of combat and give you an extra bit of exploring power.  The main game is challenging but definitely finishable, though I anticipate some people may have trouble with some of the bosses.  I'm not GREAT at beat-em-up type games but I found that I was able to push through some of the harder parts after no more than a few tries, with very few exceptions (and these exceptions were mainly bosses or challenge areas).  Where it really puts you up against the wall are the optional challenges.  Some are incredibly difficult platforming sections (one actually a little too difficult in my opinion, though I did manage it), others brutal combat sequences.  But these are all optional - Though there are some challenging bits in the main playthrough, for the most part it may only take a little practice to get through these.The exploration is a real joy, though, especially once you get the ability to swap worlds at will.  Dual worlds is not a new concept (Zelda, Castlevania, and plenty of other games have used it), but it is not unwelcome and, even more, fits very well in with the story here.  And, by the way, the story is incredibly simple, and yet, tied with the sense of humor this game has, is well done and does not break the flow of the game.Along with this, the visual style is incredibly bright, well animated and just full of visual treats and silly references.  It doesn't rely on these references to get anything across, they are merely little bonus details, but easily appreciated by fans of games in general.The only criticism I have to offer is that I sometimes feel like combat is too hectic to tell what is going on and that the bosses may have a little bit of a difficulty spike, but other than that I heartily recommend this game.  All the pieces fit together into something fun, light-hearted and well polished.			"

												Awesome game! Excellent graphics, very good soundtrack, challenging platforming, brilliant combat controls and metroidvania  like elements. What more could you want from a game? It has a simple but enjoyable story and is very well constructed. The game is a little short, but has tons of replay value with higher difficult, challenge mode, achievements and secrets. The platforming elements are a bit different in the way that you combine fighting moves to traverse the more challenging segments. You can use an uppercut to get to a higher place, or a side kick to get to that distant ledge.Overall, this is a very genre blending game. It's a 2D-action-platformer-beat 'em up-metroidvania. And it somehow manages to be very good in all those elements. Would recommend it to anybody who likes these elements!			"

												Guacameelee may well have been the best game I've played this year.Graphics:It's also probably the most visually beautiful 2D game I've ever played. With the art taking a hard influence from the art style of such things as Samurai Jack and psychedelic Latin motifs. Music:Great upbeat score, electronic Latin is really the only way to describe it.Gameplay:This game does not wear kid gloves. It may seem like a simple platformer but there is a lot of depth both in terms of combat and puzzles, and if you want to finish it with 100% or even the good ending, expect to be thrown into the deep end of that depth. A controller with an analog stick is mandatory. It seems to find a nice happy place between difficulty and frustration (it may just be the lack of death from falling). Also the massive quantity of hilarious references will likely keep you entertained.Overall:Highly recommended, would DerpDerp again.			"

												GREAT!If you're looking for a good Metroidvania-style game, Guacamelee is a great fast-paced, action heavy entry to the genre. The combat mechanics are simple, but execute to look quite flashy and complicated when chaining combos and dodging enemy attacks. Once you begin to feel a mastery for the combat, the game throws in an extra challenge of having to break color-coded enemy shields with specific skill moves.Platforming is at its best in Gucamelee. Skills and jumps need to be chained together to reach heard to reach areas. Late game platforming becomes quite challenging when the dimension switching mechanic is introduced. I wont bother explaning it, but it really pushes you to time your movements perfectly.To top it all off, the art style is colorful and refreshing accompanied by a comical storyline. Even after completing the game, there are several challenge levels available, along with some backtracking to uncover all the upgrades, collectibles, and secret areas.AND there is coop. Its only local coop, but its nice to have that option available.			"

												Guacamelee is a sidescrolling fast-paced-mexican-themed-action-fest where you play as a luchador who must battle to reunite the world of the living and the dead in harmony. The influence of Super Nintendo all-time classics such as Zelda: A Link to the Past and Super Metroid are very obvious in Guacamelee. The GOOD:- The graphics are exquisitely beautiful. The bright colors and fun-to-look-at landscapes create a very rich and visually appealing world.- The action is fast and smooth. You can create some crazy insane combos if you learn how to chain them correctly. It reminded me a lot of Street Fighter where, if you can execute, then you can pull off some very satisfying hurt-filled awesomeness.- The music is pretty sweet. It is Mexican themed and a lot of fun to listen to. I would find myself humming these tunes randomly without thinking about it. That's when you know it's done well.The BAD:- Some of the platforming areas can get really difficult and will require you to have patience and good reaction times. Some people may not enjoy this part as it can get a bit frustrating.- It is not required, but a controller is recommended for this game. I personally completed the entire thing with a keyboard, so it's definitely not necessary to have a controller if you are comfortabe with a keyboard. Whatever you prefer.- I can't really think of anything bad about Guacamelee, maybe just a few things to add/improve on. Like maybe making the dojo always open so you can practice combos, little things like that.As a side note, the boss fights can get pretty difficult. They are are all 100% patterns though and you just need to learn their visual/audio cues and how to react to them. You cannot just try to zerg the bosses, you will die. Have some patience and learn their patterns, react accordingly, and you will take them down in no time!Overall, Guacamelee is a lot of fun, very pretty, and is definitely a current era title with some influences from classic Nintento. Guacamelee takes about 8-10 hours to complete.9/10Please upvote this review if you found it useful :) "

												Guacamelee is a 2-D platforming action game set in a Mexican themed world, with a smaller emphasis on story than pure action (although there's still enough there to make you care). It follows the adventures of Juan, an everyday farmer who is resurrected after being killed by the evil Carlos Calacka, as he punches, jumps, and kicks his way to freeing the daughter of El Presidente. The fighting in this game is superb - there is a great mix of normal attacks and more powerful special attacks that are unlocked throughout the game, and moment to moment action feels great. Trying to chain up a huge combo by pummelling enemies into the air, picking them up and throwing them into other enemies so they all land in a huge heap is fast, fluid, and feels amazing. There is a large variety in the enemies you face - starting off with standard brute enemies, and eventually leading up to giants with hammers, spikey armadillos with deadly, fast attacks, four armed sword wielding skeletons, and flying lightning priests. The game slowly introduces these enemies to match your rising skill level, and starts mix and matching them cleverly which leads to some genuinely difficult fights. That being said, on Normal mode (Hard mode is unlocked only after beating the game, and is much harder – enemies have more health, and you have less) the game is not very difficult, due to a forgiving checkpoint system and it will only take about 10 hours to finish the story. However, there are many collectibles hidden around the maps that can keep you occupied as you try for 100% - again, this will only take an additional 4 hours or so. There are also additional challenges (the El Infierno levels) that test your fighting, platforming, and thinking skills – these are easily the most difficult part of the game, and getting a gold medal in all challenges is a worthy achievement.The art style in Guacamelee is one of the most striking things about the game – the graphics are crisp and look beautiful, all presented in a lovely and vibrant, if clichéd, Mexican style. The soundtrack is much the same – beautiful, and easy to listen to for hours on end. These two combine to form a convincing and engaging that makes the game fun to play for hours on end.Summary:- Beautiful aesthetics, both graphically and musically- Fast, fluid and fun combat- Great boss battles that test your fighting skills- Responsive and challenging platforming.A great mix of platforming and action, combined with a beautiful world make this a must buy, whether you like platforming and/or fighting games. This game is worth full price, and definitely grab it if it is on a sale. "

This is an amazing game. It has platforming, fighting, ability progression, all very well made. Its Metascore is well deserved.I hate fighting games, and the platforming aspect of Guacamelee! is not shown well in the videos and screenshots, so I had very low expectations for it. Aaaaand it's one of my favorite games now.So if you think it's kinda cool, get it and you will not be disappointed. Make sure to give it some time, because the beginning is indeed underwhelming.If you're still hesitating, a description of the gameplay follows. Contains minor gameplay spoilers (like revealing what abilities await you before you unlock them).In Guacamelee! you unlock various abilities as you progress. But there aren't separate ""fighting abilities"" and ""movement abilities"", because they're the same thing! At first you get an ""uppercut"" ability, which is also a poor-man's double jump. Later you get wall-jumping, dashes, smashes, etc. and eventually the actual double jump, and more yet. All these things are very pleasant to apply in combination to reach more and more places and solve (mostly optional) difficult platforming challenges.The parts where you kill enemies are also a lot of fun. You can do combos... throw enemies into the air, punch the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them, dash to the other side, punch some more, slam them down... that's one example.In many games where you kill things I don't see the point in blocking or using different combos, because usually mashing one button and eventually doing that one overpowered combination will do.Here, though, dodging is something you do a lot. You need to block other enemies' attacks while you're dealing with one or a few of them. It's intuitive and accompanied with nice subtle visual effects. It's fun to anticipate enemies' attacks and dodge projectiles just in time. And of course, different enemies need different strategies. Some of them have colored shields, which require you to use a particular special attack on them first. This doesn't sound that exciting but it really adds a lot to the game in combination with other small things.There are many characters/costumes with different stats and traits that suit different situations and playstyles.Local co-op multiplayer... that's very nice probably. But I haven't tried it.Difficulty... Yes, Guacamelee! is quite difficult, although most of the difficult parts are optional, as I already said. If you have some experience with platformers, you will feel right at home: the game won't be very hard, but will still feel rewarding.Controls are nice. You can do a ton of things with relatively few keys. Keyboard is redefinable.But I played with a controller. Buttons are not redefinable, but the controller support seems very, very good, because my very old noname controller worked perfectly, while most games mirror the 4 buttons on it...The duration of the first playthrough can vary wildly, depending on your pace and completion rate... let's say 6-14 hours.To get all achievements you may need 15-22 hours. All achievements are fun to get, not grindy and not missable, but some of them may be too hard for the average player.If you don't like the theme of the game, don't worry, at first I wasn't too fond of it either. But you get used to it and it's quite nice.And if you don't like the main character, you can change it almost right away...★★★★★★★★★★			"

												Guacamelee is so addictive, that it's very hard to put down once you start playing. Besides great gameplay, the game is chock full of charm and humor, it will easily put a smile to your face. The only thing lacking is voice acting as it's nonexistent. Shame, as it could've brought even more joy to this brilliant little game. Speaking of size, it can take up to 8 hours to complete Guacamelee, so it's not very lengthy game. On the other hand, it's probably the only game where a mexican wrestler transforms into a chicken.			"

												Beautiful game, but if you have any level of arthritis, the controls and jumping styles make the game especially unplayable, even with an XBox controller attached. I can do a straight-up jumping/fighting games (I have no problem with most games) but the contorted combinations required for this game just lead to joint-burning frustration. High hopes: dashed.

												I traditionally don't really enjoy playing platformers. Nothing against the genre, I just find it boring. Guacamelee came out of nowhere though and just punched me in the face. This game was a bucket load of fun, the way its action and platforming just blended in so well together made me just love this game.This is of course aside from the fact that the games musical and visual as just so striking and entertaining you can't help but be happy while you play this game. Even if you don't like platformers you might want to give this game a try.A more detailed review can be found over here at my blog: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2014/02/guacamelee.html. "

¡Ay, caramba!I’ve played the original Guacamelee! and now the Gold Edition as well. Both games were fantastic, but as expected, the Gold Edition had more to offer. Guacamelee! is a combination of a beat ‘em up and metroidvania, and boy is it a spectacular combination. Positive:- Fantastic fighting/combo mechanics.- Very well designed dodge mechanic.- Large variety of abilities that are fun to use.- Immaculate control scheme for fighting and platforming.- Very fair difficulty scaling.- Exploration is fun and rewarding.- Very well designed maps.- Interesting side quests and funny NPCs.- Nice music and visuals.- Great use of Mexican influences.- Many video game references made into luchador posters.- Co-op makes it a more pleasant experience. - Plenty of fighting challenges to keep you sharp.- El Infierno offers even more exciting challenges. - Unlock costumes that provide both buffs and debuffs at the same time (good game balancing).Negative:- Not sure if they fixed the co-op dimension swapping issue in this version (if one person presses the switch button, you both switch). Can be frustrating if you don’t coordinate well with your partner.- I wish Guacamelee! was longer.- When will a sequel come out?- You should probably get the Super Turbo Championship Edition.Conclusion:Guacamelee! is one of a kind. A truly enjoyable experience, one that I wish I could relive. I have 100%’ed this game and would do it again gladly. A must buy. "

												I heard this was Metroidvania, so I gave it a try, and found it SURPRISINGLY AMAZING. It has beat'em up combat that rewards you for keeping enemies in the air with super long combos, and the controls are easy to use and the combat is lots of fun. The level design is reminiscent of the levels in Mark of the Ninja, with shortcuts and extra areas added that become usable when you unlock special powers.I found the game to be hilarious. It features liberal abuse of stereotypes and cliches of ""Old Mexico"", and lots references to video games (especially indie games, though obvious Mario and Metroid references feature prominently). You play as a regular dude, made into a powerful Luchadore with a mystical mask, and skeletons are invading the land of the living on Día de Muertos, and the plot basically becomes:EL PRESIDENTE'S DAUGHTER IS KIDNAPPED! ARE YOU A BAD ENOUGH DUDE TO SAVE EL PRESIDENTE'S DAUGHTER?There's a bit more to it than that, I guess, with chicken transformations and a goat-man and stuff... but the details are unimportant.The game has a very generous save/respawn system, restarting boss battles instantly upon player death, which is nice. It does make the platforming sections of the game trivially easy, since if you miss a single jump, you instantly respawn back onto the last platform you were standing on (and the jumps aren't even difficult). None of the game felt frustrating or too repetitive to me (the first beat'em up I can say that about; I gave up on Shank a few levels in, for example). That said, I only got the ""bad"" ending at the end of the game, and I heard that the extra levels required to get the ""good"" ending are rather challenging.If you like Metroidvanias, you should play this one. It's awesome.			"

Other than that, it pretty neat and the mods add some spice to it. One thing to add to it is that theres a 99.99% chance you wont use most of the combos that you have to do in the ring, lol.

												Luchadors unite! I'm not a big brawler fan. Most of my experiences in this genre are games that require painstaking trial-and-error to figure all the moves and combos. Guacamelee was able to break that mold because the best part of the games for me wasn't the combat aspects, but actually the way the game trained me to use each skill along the journey through superior level design. And I thought this game was pretty hard, but mastering the moves became second nature because it forced me to use specific skills throughout each level, so by the time the final boss came around it was a piece of cake.But it's not just the training that made the game fun. There's also the transition between the living and dead worlds which adds a very difficult twist to platforming and combat. Even though the fighting moves are pretty basic, it makes combos reasonably easy to pull off and thus doesn't frustrate. Plus it's always fun to throw enemies around, transform into a chicken and peck them to death, or goat fly across the screen through a horde.One word describes Guacamelee--FUN.			"

												Based on the videos I had seen, and my predisposition towards platformers, I was already expecting to like Guacamelee. I had no idea how much I'd love it.The platforming is not only challenging, but often times requires creative thinking. The combat is fluid and satisfying, especially when you pull off high hit combos or get through a particularly hectic battle without a scratch on you. The addition of a dodge ability adds an extra level of skill to combat and allows for different styles of play. The artwork is gorgeous and does an excellent job setting the mood for the game. And tons of fun video game and pop-culture references are sprinkled throughout the enitre game.One particular thing I love is the optional depth to the game. If you're the type of player that only wants to stick to the main path and beat the game as soon as possible, you are able to do so. But for those who feel they've mastered the mechanics and want a bigger challenge, a little exploring reveals there is so much more lying beneath the surface.I absolutely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys platformers, particularly those in the Metroidvania vein.

												Guacamelee! is a really good platformer with a metroidvania style set in a world inspired by Mexican culture. This game is filled with comedy, and tons of references to other games, which add to the overall fun.The gameplay is excellent, as a ""Luchador"" you make your way through punching: punching enemies, punching walls, punching chickens... As you progress, you get new abilities, which allow you to access new areas, by way of more, diverse ways of punching. There's also an ability that allows you to change between the world of the living and the world of the dead, and it's an interesting mechanics, as there will be sections where you find travelling back and forth between the worlds.The environments themselves are really good: the world of the living is colourful, while the world of the dead has a darker tone.The story is somewhat simple, but even then, it manages to be great. It starts with a normal man living a normal life, but, during the preparations for the ""Día de los Muertos"" festival, a powerful being raises from the world of the dead, and our hero must put on the Luchador mask, in order to save the day.I recommend it.

												Guacamelee is an indie Metroidvania, it has a fantastic soundtrack, unique art style and great gameplay.Gameplay wise, Guacamelee isn't particularly innovative, throughout the game you'll explore levels that are full of various platforming and combat challenges, these elements are polished to a shine. The platforming controls well, and has a lot more variety than one might except from a Metroidvania style game. Similarly, the combat system takes a more traditonal beat-em-up style and infuses it into the game, while it might not be comparable to some hardcore action games, it is a satisfying system overall, and I had lots of fun racking up high combos.In traditional Metroidvania fashion, you'll find yourself gathering new abilities throughout the game and then using said abilities to progress through new areas. The game has a fair amount of optional secrets, which will motivate players to backtrack through previous areas to find powerups. Personally, I liked how the games combat system and abilities worked together. A majority of the abilities you get are multi-purposed, one use being how it helps you explore the enviroment and the other use being how it helps you in combat. For example, the uppercut ability allows you to break various red blocks throughout the enviroment, but it also adds a uppercut to your character's repertoire in combat. This means as you get more abilities, the variety in both combat and platforming increases. The system works near perfectly.My main problem with Guacamelee is a minor one and it has to deal with the games sense of humor. To be frank, I found the games attempt to be awful. The games references to the Metroid series didn't come off as funny, but lazy. The game also has some weird obsession with some bottom of the barrel Reddit memes, they aren't funny or orginial. It's not a major complaint, but it's annoying to me that the humor has to resort to ""lol me too references"" and ""xd reddit memes"" considering the work that was clearly put into the games world design.

												Wow! This is one of the best Metroid-Vania games to come around in a long time. It is well paced. Well polished. Full of humor. And just plain awesome.In this game you play Juan who is in love with the president's daughter. She is kidnapped by Calaca for some ritual (They need a virgin sacrifice; she tries to tell them she isn't eligible; they don't listen.) Of course, they kill our hero. That would be a very boring game if that were the end. But it isn't. Juan is given a second chance and becomes a luchador.Through the game, you will be given new powers such as ""Goat Run,"" ""Goat Fly,"" and the ability to turn into a chicken. Yes, you can turn into a chicken. (If you get the chicken costume, you turn into an egg.) As with any Metroid-vania game, the new powers allow you access to areas you have discovered but couldn't quite reach.One thing I liked was there weren't collectables on the levels per se. Yes, there are chests that hold pieces of heart (for life) and stamina (for special moves) or money. But you don't collect stars or tacos or something meaningless. TThere are some platforming and puzzle aspects to the game. Some of the areas where the orbs are hidden are challenging, but the regular areas are not too difficult.The art is cubist and bright reminiscent of old Mexico. Combat basically consists of two buttons, hit and special. Putting these in combo will increase your combo meter faster and give you a money bonus at the end. Some monsters will put up a shield that you will need to break with the right special move.This game is highly recommended.			"

												I've been playing Guacamelee! for the past few days, not once was it a dull moment. It's like someone stepped in my childhood took all the aspects that made me smile and put into this charming little game.Its got platforming, puzzles, dungeons, mazes, riddled with easter eggs and hidden secrets, its also the first time I've seen a 2D game with a fluid combo system, outside of fighting games. I love how the level design is setup for you to just have each area appear linear and small until you obtain new abilities, its just way way bigger and interconnected. The soundtrack is well done for its Mexican luchalibre theme, you might find yourself humming to certain tunes, I did. Art style is reminds of confetti, party favors, and pinatas, I guess that's what it was going for. Cons? I don't think I really have any, the plot is quite much akin to Super Mario even referencing to it many times, but with its own little twist which to say for the sake of a con: the plot is unoriginal at its core. You won't care anyway though because its a very fun game.5/5 Game of the year? Probably not, but if you want a game that will satisfy with something different, it definitely brings that to the table.			"

												Guacamelee! is a platform game very well designed, everything works nice and everything is super fun. The story itself is pretty simple and common: you must save the princess. It is the weaker point in the whole game, but the fun of play this game and the great work of DrinkBox Studios in every single detail is so incredible that makes you accept the whole story immediately.The gameplay is simple but after a few minutes you will learn some special moves that must be used not only to kill enemies but to advance in the game. It became more and more complex and in some parts you will feel like you are playing Super Meat Boy (and by that I mean, you will have that awesome feeling of challenge).The level design of the whole game is absolutely great. Every map is unique and very well done. The art style is very beautiful and colorful and the sound design make you feel inside that world. And when you switch dimensions you will experience new colors, sounds and music. It is a very pleasant experience.This is a super fun game, has a good amount of collectibles (most of them you will get along the story) and is very artsy in both graphic and music. You really should play it!			"

												Guacamelee é extremamente bem feito em todos os aspectos, requintado e cheio de demonstrações do cuidado dos desenvolvedores com o próprio trabalho. Tudo nesse jogo se encaixa perfeitamente: os gráficos cartunescos e a música ambiente se combinam de modo tal que você sente de fato quando você está num lugar amistoso, familiar e quando você vai enfrentar desafios e inimigos a sua frente.A história é simplesinha e bem batida: o fracote que perde sua amada e ganha poderes para resgatá-la depois de ter tomado uma sova do vilão, mas nada que torne o jogo previsível ou entediante, porque chato esse jogo de fato não é.As piadas e referências a memes e a outros jogos dão um toque especial a esse jogo, arrancando aquele sorriso de canto de boca quando você pesca um referência dessas.A jogabilidade é extremamente fluida e as possibilidades de combo são bem variadas e necessárias até, pois o jogo combina seus diversos tipos de inimigos de modo que o esqueleto mais fraco se torna a maior dor de cabeça apenas com a inserção de uma outra categoria de inimigo, que impede justamente aquele combo manjado que você usava pra derrotá-lo. Logo na tela de entrada o jogo sugere que se jogue com um controle, o que eu acredito ser até melhor mesmo, mas joguei o jogo todo no teclado sem grandes problemas.10/10 peguei todos os achievs.			"

												Guacamelee! is a humorous 2D platformer with a Mexican Día de los Muertos esthetic. Consisting of side-scrolling combat, jumping puzzles and boss fights, the gameplay strikes a balance, being challenging yet fair.Progressing through the game unlocks new abilities and areas. There are also new enemies and puzzles that provide opportunities to use these newly acquired skills, so the game becomes more complex and harder. Compensating for the difficulty, the game allows you to respawn from numerous checkpoints or whatever ledge you fell from. This prevents frequent deaths from breaking the game’s flow, and allows the player to learn from failure and quickly adapt to overcome a hard part.I hate excessive dialogue in games, but fortunately Guacamelee! has just the right amount. It has enough to move the story along and even work in some comedy, but it doesn’t overstay it’s welcome. This is necessary in a game where parts must be repeated until gotten right. Having to scroll through the same dialogue over and over again just to get to the point you failed at before is an annoyance from an obsolete era of gaming.Guacamelee! is not without its flaws. It can be a bit repetitive at times and get slightly boring, but it’s not enough to hinder the gameplay significantly, and the soundtrack and colorful animation inspired by traditional Mexican folklore give it a unique style that almost had me buying this game on looks alone.Digital Logik PC Gaming[dlgaming.net] "

Guacamelee! is one of the finest examples of the Metroidvania genre in recent years (the other being Dust: An Elysian Tale). The combat system has a lot of depth and variety which is something that can be lacking in other games of the genre - allowing for dozens of combo combinations. The controls are very crisp and responsive - though, you will want to use a controller for the best experience. What I love is how the developers designed the wrestling moves multi-purposefully. You use the same wrestling moves in combat as you do for platforming and traversing the environment. It's extremely satisfying and intuitive. They also did a great job of steadily introducing new game mechanics (such as switching between the living and dead world, goat climb and goat fly). The great thing is - you learn these new mechanics via the level design as soon as you acquire them - never taking away control from the player and forcing a unnecessary cutscene. More developers need to design games this way.There is minimal voice acting, but the story gave me a few chuckles with a few well placed memes and references (normally I don't like that in most games). The visuals of the game are quite unique and colorful - and it's wonderfully animated. The soundtrack is also stellar.Guacamelee also provides quite a challenge. The bosses are well designed and there is roughly 20 hours of value if you are a completionist/achievement hunter. Some of the challenge areas remind me of games like Super Meat Boy, requiring fast reflexes and good timing. You can bet you will be raging at some of them.Overall, I highly recommend Guacamelee! as it's one of the most shining examples of it's genre. I'm looking forward to seeing what DrinkBox studios do next, as they clearly have some smart and capable game designers over there.Adios amigos!			"

												Guacamelee! Is based on four concepts:- a Metroid-vania style of gameplay- a semi-complicated fighting system- luchadores portrayed in a cartoonish way- jokes based on modern internet popcultureIt seems that there is pretty much nothing you could dislike. Indeed the first half of the game was very enjoyable for me. Some dialogs are written really clever, and the gameplay itself is enough to keep you playing.But then it all falls in to pieces. The more powers you unlock the more difficult it is to play on a computer keyboard. Soon it becomes unplayable and confusing... and this is the part when someone tells me I should use a gamepad (like the authors told me on the beginning of the game). Well I tried... I have three gamepads and none of them worked... oooohhhh.... it needs an XBOX controller? So now I should pay because the authors are xbox fanboys or because they sold their souls to MS? Not a chance.Releasing this game on a PC (an also Linux for god's sake!) is a mockery.The keyboard and mouse are basic PC controllers , so a game released on WINDOWS/MAC/LINUX should be designed to work with them, or at least allow ANY gamepad to work with it on all operating systems it is available for (I use Linux all the time, and never once had a problem with any of my gamepads in a game that allowed them).There is also something else, that happens after the first half of the game – all the creativity of the authors just vanish (and the jokes from the first half began to stop being funny in the context also):„Erm... I don't know how to make this game actually, so... hmm... let's make it incredibly difficult, and fill it with irritating enemies, internet memes redrawn to look mexican and references to other games!”Give me a break...This is unfortunately a trend in modern indie games .„Don't have an idea to make the gameplay interesting? Make it freakishly difficult.”„Don't have an interesting story? Make it a parody. A parody with a very difficult gameplay!”„We don't know how to balance the gameplay? Let's give the player every ability we can think of! And make her/him use them simultaneously during a very difficult gameplay!”I bet at some point of the development, the creators of games like that think they are smart, and creative. Throwing every idea for a gameplay element in to the final product, redrawing jokes made by others and making obvious references to other games...P.S.Of course the level of difficulty is not only to be blamed on the controller. The game is literally unfair. Exactly like playing a badly designed NES game. UNFAIR. The projectiles thrown by enemies go right through every element of the environment, every enemy and stop only at the player. Every enemy attack is impossible to block and usually it has priority over your attack even if it is a combo, or a special move. Also, some actions work in some cases, and don't work in other (in which logic tells you, they should). The controls feel very awkward generaly, and most actions are hard to trigger.			"

												Cross-Dimensional-Suplex. That's one of the many things you can do in this game. You can beat up a skeleton in the world of the living, pick it up, then switch to the world of the dead and suplex it there. This game lets you do that.But in all seriousness, this is an amazing game, which I enjoyed enough to completely complete, the combat and platforming mesh together seemlessly in a way which makes combat so very satisfying. When you have all of the special moves, you get so much mobility in fight; and this mixes fantastically with the dodge mechanic of the game (which is really damn good, it's pretty much the gold standard of 2D dodging if you ask me). The things you can do in the fights in this game feel amazing; when you clear out a room of blokes without being hit and piledrive a conquistador skeleton into an Aztec skeleton, you feel like some kind of Luchador god.Also the story's real nice. I don't want to go too much into it, but it's a real nice, quite minimal story which really completements the game without getting in the way. So that's pretty much it, I enjoyed this game enough to do everything it had to offer, and considering it wasn't very expensive, I more that got my moneys worth from it.			"

												This game surprised me in a lot of ways, the pacing is spot on, as it introduces new mechanics often enough to spice things up and the mix between platforming and combat was also very well thought out.I thought the length of the game was perfect, maybe it's just because my taste has been moving towards shorter games lately but I felt like the amount of time I spent here was enough to leave me fullfiled, and if I ever want to play it again I have plenty of challenges and side stuff to complete.The writing, humor, art and music of this game played a big role in my interest of this title, it felt like the developers put a lot of heart and soul into this.I strongly recommend picking this one up, even if you do not like Metroidvania type of games, give it a go, as I am not a huge fan of those but I enjoyed this one way too much.

												Great  game all around.Pleasing Visuals, enjoyable audio, slick gameplay and (cliche?) story from the unique perspective of a Luchador. Gameplay is pretty fun. Knocking one enemy into another will force them off their feet (provided no shield), which often makes many fights trivial if you juggle the enemies into each other, giving you reasonably large intervals (for a 2D fighter), where no attacks are coming your way. An enemy who has been knocked down can be supplexed across the screen, essentially every enemy is a projectile used to knock down other enemies, combining this mechanic with juggling makes you feel like a true deity though the resulting gameplay presents little threat.Unlocking new skills throughout the course of the game is done in a Metroidvania-esque manner, though from memory none of the 'backtracking' (hub aside) is required to complete the game. The difficulty ramps up slowly over the game, enemies towards the end of the game usually require one or two specific skills to 'pop' a recharging shield before they can be hurt, in addition they are mure numerous + more damage. However this is largely an artificial increase in difficulty throughout the game, using the knock-back mechanic is less useful in these situations, forcing the Luchador to focus on one target at a time while breaking shields, and trying to combo those enemies into each other before the shield recharges, it makes you feel like much less of a badass chasing one of 8 foes around a screen instead of bringing pain to all 8 at the same time.  Audio is pretty pleasing to listen to, while I'm personally out-of-touch with the genre/nationality vibe they where going for, it seems to fit the pacing of movement throughout the levels pretty well, I could probably listen to this music for a reasonably longer length of time due to the lack of this style in more media today. Visuals are pretty nice and colourful. Simple larger sprites make everything super-easy to tell friend-from foe, including yourself when things get a little hectic with more enemies. I think this refined/simple look suits the world of the Luchador quite well, bright colours + striking shapes rather than many complex details/patterns. Makes it really easy to pick out which enemies (or pieces of environment) need which skills to break them.The only negative about this game, is that some of the side-challenges in an optional areas of the game require nigh on pixel-perfect execution of skill sequencing to pull off a combo/maintain hit-streak. In this regard the game feels very much like a Capcom fighter, finding the sweetspot so that you're skills will juggle the enemy correctly. This level of precision is needed nowhere else in the game so it feels more than a little superfluous. Granted Challenges in games are designed to present situations more complex/difficult than the main game (albeit in smaller packets), so probably not solid grounds to complain about.Overall this game is pretty baller. For fans of other 2D & 3D beat-em-ups It's pretty much a necessity on the list, it may not not cater to the more experienced 2D fighters in the same way it does to the general populus, as overall the game is fairly easy. Its unique setting definately warrants a look when compared with the dark/gritty beat-em-ups we see more often today. 8/10			"

												This is one of those indies that gets a special place in my heartThe fighting mechanics are good and satisfying, the artstyle is pleasing to the eye along with the coloring, as a Mexican, I have to say I love this little mexican themed world.The platforming and boss fights on the other hand might be very frustrating, specially the final boss, but in the end it's the kind of frustrating that feels really good once you beat them, it's hard, it's frustrating, but not to the point of making you want to quit the game alltogetherThe story is also simple but effective, good enough for this kind of game and actually motivated me to go for a different ending on a separate playthroughAll in all this is a nice indie game, well worth getting, i do recommend using a controller though			"

It's thought-provoking narrative and it's fashion-forward use of mechanics as a metaphor give the game that authentic feeling of being a luchador wrestler which no other luchador sim has been able to encapsulate so well since the early days of the Atari Jaguar. It's also important to note that I like tortillas. Don't forget fajitas as they are also good to eat.			"

												If cave story took the metroidvania style and added in shooter elements, and Steamworld Dig took it and added the minecraft/terraria thing, Guacamelee is the brawler take on the same genre. It has a fun story and style to spare. The art and animation in the game are incredible, it has a great sense of humor (plenty of tongue-in-cheek references to be had throughout) and the fighting/combo system is surprisingly deep. I absolutely love this game, and I say that upfront because I have to be harsh about a handful of things that hold the game back from perfection.As good as the fighting system is in Guacamelee, it could have used some more love- specifically recovery time and cancels. If it sounds incredibly petty that I'm asking for such a 'deep' feature in what is essentially a beat'em up game, it really starts to make sense toward the end of the game when enemies start doing shields that you need to break with specific attacks. Often times, you'll break a shield and get knocked down by another enemy and before you can get back up the shield you took out has regenerated. It ends up making for a handful of really frustrating encounters, and one boss fight that is absolutely infuriating (javier jaguar). Your special moves take so much time to wind up that the situation can change while you're in mid-animation with no way to cancel it, so you have to watch in what feels like slow-mo while you get smashed in the face. This leads to a lot of situations where you die and feel completely cheated because you weren't in control of the character and could have avoided the attack if you could cancel.This is exacerbated by the fact that pretty much every enemy attack in the game interrupts your special attacks. As I mentioned, you have to use these special moves to break shields, but in a room with multiple shield types, you can wind up your super long uncancellable special move to break a shield, only to get smacked in the back by another enemy (with a different shield). While your recovery animation is playing, the enemy's shield is regenerating. On the flip side of that, bosses are pretty much immune to special attack stuns and knockbacks, so the combos you've been practicing for so long are basically worthless in a boss fight. Specifically in the Javier Jaguar fight, you'll have to break his shield with a special, but he'll attack simultaneously- guess whose attack knocks back and whose doesn't? You will find yourself wanting to throw your controller through the wall during this fight because so much of it is beyond your control. It just seems intentionally punishing and doesn't reward the player for the skill they've developed over the course of the game.To add to that, lots of end-game encounters have you fighting not only enemies that are shielded in a multitude of colors (which require completely different moves to break), but also enemies that are phased into the living/dead worlds. Here's another situation where it feels like the balancing is slightly broken or in need of adjustment. Enemies can hit you regardless of which dimension they're phased into, but you can't hit them. I would have preferred a system where opposite dimensions would give/take more or less damage than the dimension you're currently in, which would have made it more interesting and less frustrating.Overall, like I said- this is a fantastic game and totally worth the full asking price, but it does have some frustrating moments later in the game due to some issues with the finer fighting mechanics.

												Damn, where do I even start... Guacamelee is just outstanding. I love every tiny bit of it. I love the graphics (lovely cartoonish style), the Mexican flavour, tight platforming and suprisingly deep combat system. I simply ADORE the music, which is a mixture of classic ""La cucarachas"" and whatnot peppered with some modern beats & synths. The outcome is more than highly enjoyable. DrinkBox's masterpiece overflows with sparkling humor, the characterers are instantly likable and the story is as ridiculous and outlandish as you may expect :) There's not really much of a plot to be found here but the dialogs are witty and full of easter eggs and innuendoes.Having completed it twice I must say that it certainly gives you more than enough bang for your buck. There's a lot to do here and the adventure is fairly challenging (especially on hard mode; oh, Jaguar Javier, you were a worthy opponent). So if you are into Metroidvania formula and not afraid of dying a couple of (hundred) times you should definitely try Guacamelee.I give it a 9,5 / 10			"

												Guacamelee caught my interest as soon as it launched on Steam, I still remember that day because on that day Spelunky and Papers, Please were also released on Steam. Having previously played Dust, I think that these two games are very similar yet very different. Guacamelee takes place in a mexican town and tells the story of how you save the world of the living from merging with the world of the dead. I found the graphic style to be really nice and it certainly looks pretty well considering the world in which the game takes place along with the soundtrack which actually made me remember of Total Overdose because it has that very specific latin/mexican feel to it. Now, for me the best part of Guacamelee was the combat, executing combo after combo using different skills and rolling in order to avoid each enemy attack felt really satisfying and that's where I think the game really shines and was probably one of the main reasons why I kept playing it in the first place. Overall I think that if you played games like these, so called ""metroidvanias"", which have alot of backtracking such as Dust An Elysian Tail which I also loved you will certainly have a great time with Guacamelee, I highly recommend it specially if you enjoy some brawler action yourself, either solo or co-op.

												Guacamelee is a game that mixes a lot of game mechanics at once. It has platforming, exploration, combat, dimension-swapping and more.The game does a great job of introducing new abilities and mechanics to you as you progress, so the game never gets repetitive.The combat feels fresh and unique because of the ability to perform your own combos and the ability to grab your opponents and throw them in any direction.The dimension-swapping mechanic adds some neat puzzles to the game, but it also adds the ability to see 2 different dimensions of the same universe (the ""dead"" dimension and the ""real"" one) at any time, which is really cool.One thing I didn't like about this game is that all these mechanics don't always blend in so well during combat. This is more complicated, but I'll explain.As you unlock new abilities, the combat gradually becomes more interesting, but it also ends up being more tedious. Near the end, it almost becomes an annoyance. They give you more moves, which are very fun to use for platforming and puzzle-solving, but since they constantly add more depth to the combat, they end up just throwing tons of enemies at you at once. But it doesn't stop there. They make it so that you can only hit enemies if you break their shields, which will only break if you do certain moves, and these moves cost stamina, which takes time to regenerate. Also, all enemies can damage you in both dimensions, but you can only hit them in their dimension, etc. It gets overwhelming.Some enemies even throw objects at you, but even after unlocking new attacks, you can't even break them. Like, you can't punch or kick a flying bone to break it. It just hits you anyway. Ranged attacks are literally indestructible, so you HAVE to dodge them. But the thing is, this isn't a shoot'em up: you can't attack and dodge at the same time. So you'll inevitably end up getting hit. The thing is, I shouldn't feel weaker as I progress through the game. I should feel stronger.The game is pretty forgiving, so you won't necessarily die too often, and even if you do, you'll respawn just before the fight. But getting completely stopped because of a random little flying bone or an enemy from the other dimension? That completely breaks the flow of the game.Also, when you use a controller, the button to dodge is R2 and you can't rebind it. This might seem like a minor complaint, but when you make a game about accurately dodging things, you don't put the dodge button on an analog trigger...Anyway, I'm being overly critical here. I actually enjoyed the game a lot, it's just that combat gets pretty tedious and less fun near the end. The visuals and the characters are always charming, the humor in the dialogue and presentation is genuinely funny (except when it resorts to memes, but that rarely happens), and the music is fitting and pretty catchy!I'd give this game an 8 out of 10.

												When my friend first gave me this game, I wasn't sure if I would really enjoy the game to the end. However, I was completely wrong and am truly in love with it! Guacamelee is a simple fighting adventure game that takes Juan in a journey to save the girl he likes. It uses a luchador theme that hasn't really been used much of anywhere making it refreshing and more fun. There is a nice combo system where you can chain attacks which is nice for those Street Fighter experts out there, but you can easily play through the game without doing combos or chaining your attacks. There are 3 unique mechanisms which I cant really talk about without spoiling except for the attack skills. There are many skills to learn in the game that are used in order to unlock secret areas and progress in the game. The attack skills were very well made and are controlled easily. They are fun to use and experimenting with them in order to create your own combo to defeat the enemies and bosses is very fun. Bosses are also all unique to each other. They each try to force you to use certain skills to win, but are not necessary. Additionally, each boss is completely unique making the gameplay fun and non repetitive. The soundtrack is good and worth a listen, but there was one problem that I had with the game. That is when you receive a skill, the game likes to strobe bright colorful lights at you, making your eyes hurt and sometimes giveing you a headache. But besides that, this game has a great fighting mechanic, good soundtrack, good art, and a cliche story with a refreshing theme.Overall I highly recommend this game to everyone as it is short but has a good replayabliliy value. With a hard mode that actually changes the games text and NPC actions due to it being unlocked after beating the game once on normal. They also have challenges and other small mini games, secrets and side quests that help in exploring the world.			"

Both the combat and platforming providing a solid challenge that does veer into frustration quite often, particularly with some of the optional rooms. It's hard to complain about it because the controls are tight and there isn't a huge amount of skill required to reach the end of the game even with some light exploration.The humour and dialogue is a bit tiresome but thankfully there is very little of it to wade through.

												This game is a pretty solid platformer with unique Mexican theme, good combos, nice but sometimes overdone humour, well created enemy types and some decent gameplay mechanics such as dimension swapping.The bad part is that the game is not designed for people that don't have over average reflexes and platformer history. Tule Tree became a major problem for me and I couldn't get past it. I did a quick Google search and read the negative comments on Steam reviews and found out that it's not only my problem.Also another thing to note is even though I used to be able to do every single combo in a Mortal Kombat game on PS2 and could get to some decent Fatality stages, the challenges that Giant Chicken (I don't remember its name) give became undoable after some point.My Logitech F710 had some minor lag issues throughout the part I managed to complete, which I haven't experienced in any other games I played with that controller, but it wasn't that much of a problem except for hardcore platforming parts, such as in Tule Tree and the game had some problems reading the diagonal movement input.I can only recommend this if only you're deeply into hardcore platformers or you want to enjoy a somewhat different artistic setting for a low price (I think you might be able to purchase it for $1-1key on trading sites and on different retailers). Otherwise, just stay away from it.			"

												This game is a love song to Super Metroid played by a nerdy mariachi band. Instead of an arm cannon, you use your fists. Instead of a morph ball, you turn into a chicken. Instead of color-coded doors to be opened with the appropriate weapon, there are colored blocks to be smashed with your varied slam attacks. You even gain your powers by destroying precious Chozo statues (more on that later.)The best part of this game, hands down, is the combat. The multitude of useful attacks at your disposal, combined with the responsive dodging mechanic and the fun and powerful grapples means that the combo system is both useful and rewarding. Battles in this game just resonate with me as being really fun, as you can bash some skeletons around, throw them into other skeletons, and just keep it going as the numbers on your screen go up and up and you get a bigger money reward when the fight is finished. It's just really fun, and the enemies are well designed to let you take advantage of combos and such if you're good.The level design is nice, and they manage to keep the levels fresh with mixtures of new and old elements that let you make use of your powers. Backtracking when you have new powers, a staple of any ""Metroidvania"" game, is present in this game, but also quite simplified. Areas that are blocked off from you are marked in bright, unmistakeable colors on your map, and correspond to certain powerups. While this is unfortunate if you enjoy more subtle or clever ways to impede progress, there are a few secret areas scattered about that have very little indication on the map, meaning you have to be perceptive to find them. The art style and design of the levels are also overall pretty good, but while the backgrounds are vibrant and creative, the walls of the levels are all dark and square, making areas seem kind of cramped, and it's just not as visually entertaining as it could be. Unfortunately, there is a lot of untapped potential in Guacamelee. There were a few levels that were pretty barren as far as secrets and backtracking goes, which sort of made them simply linear puzzle dungeons. The last few hours of gameplay for me could have been a lot better if I had more reasons to revist older areas. Due to the linearity of how and when you get your abilities, most of the secret areas just contained health and stamina upgrades. I would have liked if there were optional powerups or attacks that I could find, or perhaps more villager sidequests that required you to visit other areas. There are only two towns in Guacamelee, and all of the ""quests"" are pretty much just completed inside those towns, when there's no reason not to use other areas for them. My main gripe with this game is how shallow the world feels, and there is one big reason for this: instead of worldbuilding and lore, the game opted for silly references and jokes. I think that the developers got kind of lazy in this regard, because the world concept is a pretty cool one, and the art and character design is top notch. But even though the game was inviting me to care about the world inside through its visuals, it just completely falls flat whenever it wants to convey information about the world directly. The towns are littered with posters of famous luchadores and advertisements, and 100% of those are jokes or references to nerd stuff. They were cute and funny the first couple times I saw them, but then I realized that these areas that could have been vibrant with character were just a platform for showing me some mexican versions of memes. I mentioned that you gain your powers by smashing Chozo statues, and I mean really. There are Chozo statues laying around in the dungeons, like, actual Chozo statues from Metroid. And you smash them, and then the goatman cometh and yells at you for smashing his rare Chozo statue, and gives you a new power. Again, this was funny the first time, like, haha, we're trying to make a Metroid game guys! Haha! But really, that's a missed opportunity for something more creative or fitting for the game's world. You could still make a lazy Metroid reference, but instead of it being a Chozo make it a Luchadore or something. I hate saying this, but the over-reliance on jokes in this game smashes ~my immersion~. I know, I would roll my eyes if someone told me that, but it's true. It just ticks me off because the lazy world-building sours what would otherwise be a fantastic game. Despite all that, I really do love this game. It's a blast to play, and I had a good time exploring and taking on the secret challenges. The game can get pretty tough when it wants to, and those difficult areas are really satisfying to beat. The music is great, and the gameplay is superb. I would only write such a big effortpost review if I actually cared enough about the game, so at least there's that. I highly recommend you give Guacamelee! a try.			"

												 Guacamelee! is an awkward mess of a Metroidvania-like desperately trying to appeal to its demographic. And while it has some interesting art direction, you'd struggle to see it through all the memes and video game references. Levels are plastered with the out-of-place likenesses of characters from much better games while towns are hampered by such comedy gold as Me Gusta Guavas and Pedrobear Maraca Academy. Power-ups are retrieved from shattering Chozo statues while X'tabay (literally ""female ensnarer"") informs you that your princess is in another castle. At least Retro City Rampage was honest about what it was selling: I bought this game expecting lucha libre and ended up getting the inside of a Hot Topic. Gameplay starts as a fairly simple brawler-platformer but ranges from bland to frustrating with a mountain range of odd difficulty spikes, mostly caused by odd decisions in enemy and level design on the part of the developers. For instance, you often need to use your color-coded special moves to navigate, but special moves have a cooldown that means waiting for them to recharge. For the jumping puzzles this means waiting to try again after the first inevitable failure, but it transforms later battles into an annoying game of Simon with the introduction of colored force fields, only breakable by special moves of a matching color. That's on top of the light- and dark-world mechanic making it so you can only hit the enemies in the same world as you. The end result turns what could be a fun beat 'em up into a game of Bop It for your thumbs, if Bop It used siezure-inducing patterns and religiously browsed Know Your Meme. In the end, I think Guacamelee! tries to be a lot of things, but I certainly can't recommend trying it for yourself to find out what it ended up as. It certainly isn't a good game.			"

												Drinkbox released an enhanced version of this game as ""Super Turbo Championship Edition"". That version is Windows-only, so only buy this Gold Edition if you're a Mac or Linux user.In addition to that, there are some serious issues with Xbox pad controls which can't be customized (only keyboard controls can). I don't think my thumbs are that fat but on several occasions the player is forced to hold the Y button to grab, then while holding Y, move and hold the left stick, jump with A and mid-air tap a left shoulder button. I don't know about you but I can't perform that while holing the controller regularly and have to resort to a cramp-inducing grip involving placing both my right thumb and index finger on the front-facing buttons, while placing the ring finger on the shoulder button.Luckily that grip is not used all the time, so playing the game is otherwise fun but man, that's such an unnecessary inconvenience. No clue if the Championship Edition fixed that. No way I'm paying the full price again just to find out.			"

												Guacamelee is one of the best Metroidvania games in years. I immensely enjoyed it. The game's graphics are just perfect with tons of detail and color. The gameplay is great, too.You'll unlock moves by buying them or by completing parts of the story. These new powers will help you find secrets in previously played parts and open up new parts of the story. There are a couple of sidequests, but they can be finished rather quickly. One or two of them are fairly lengthy, however, all things considered. Guacamelee is not a long game, I think I completed it in 8 hours or so, so I hope that a possible sequel will be longer. It's just so much fun.  Drinkbox's previous game was also kinda short. A real shame, because their games are great and feature the same kind of graphical styles.But the game's not perfect. Battle arenas can become frustrating because they're limited in space and a few of them are timer dependent. The arenas do help you practice for bossfights though; those can get pretty hectic and intense.This game was released on the same day as Papers Please and Spelunky and if I had to pick one of these games Guacamelee would be my first choice. Papers Please would definitely grab the second place.For those guys that think: 'TL:DR'; let me say this with my best Star Wars voice: Guacamelee is the game you're looking for.[Rating: 88/100]			"

												Edit - 29 April 2014. I completed the game once again, but this time on hard mode. Fortunately, the button pressing mechanism gets a little familiar and easier over time. But make no mistake, it is still brutal to any new player. This game would do world a favor if it didn't have any puzzle but there's nothing anyone can do now. It should have been Mark of the Ninja type combat game if the description in store page is read correct, instead it tries to be a super meat boy with combat. I would give it a thumbs up if the devs wrote the truth in the store page. But it isn't what anybody will expect since the devs speaks nothing about frustrating brutal puzzle which deserves a definite thumbs down. Old review-All of the puzzles are designed for gamepad. Most of them require timed button press which seems frustrating with keyboard. Not recommeded if you don't own a gamepad.			"

												This game is aimed primarily at people who enjoy really intensely challenging, lightning speed beat-em-up combat and also really challenging precision platforming at the same time. You absolutely must enjoy both of those things or this game WILL increasingly♥♥♥♥♥♥you off as it goes on.For me, I enjoy side-scrolling beat 'em ups and also enjoy platformers, but I am not the type of person who particularly enjoys intensely punishing difficulty in either one (maybe in a challenge mode, but not in the campaign). I picked up this game mainly because I had heard it had strong metroidvania elements, and I was very interested in exploring a mexi-metroid. The game started off super enjoyable and very much mexi-metroid, which I loved. But I started getting super frustrated at the game once I got to the Tule Tree, where the game first revealed its unwavering fetish for spamming dimension shift challenges in prolongued wall jumping segments. (If you think it will be over after the Tule Tree, you're wrong.) I stuck with it, though. It was infuriating, and I cursed a lot, but I stuck with it for a long time. I was disappointed that the metroidvania elements increasingly dwindle away and the game becomes more and more intensely focused on infuriating cage match challenges and infuriating platforming challenges where you have to execute a specific sequence of jump extenders (while dimension shifting ever other step, naturally), and the game just turns these up more, and more, and more as you advance. I kept feeling the frustration rise higher and higher as I progressed, but I kept on going.I made it all the way to Javier Jaguar. I'm now quitting forever, because seriously: F**K THAT. Talk about a sudden and maddeningly huge difficulty spike. (Especially considering that the previous boss battle, Flame Face, is incredibly easy.) There comes a point where one experiences furious anger more than joy with a game. Javier Jaguar is the deal breaker for me and Gaucamelee. But I won't say that makes it a bad game. It is a beautiful game that I think was just not made for me. I recommend it to those of you who enjoy a game that invites you into its house with promises of cake and candy, but instead just holds you down and punches you in the balls over and over again, laughing and shouting surprise, until you cry.

												Guacamelee! Action! Romance! Thrills! No, really. This game is bloody fantastic, especially when it's not amazingly frustrating. Core gameplay is solid, simple and to the point. I don't think I've ever had this much fun with a game before. It benefits from a solid, distinct soundtrack, and a pleasing visual art style. This one's for the subscribers of the arts. When it comes down to the game itself, story is solid, perhaps short, maybe a little spent, but every now and again, a classic hero story is all we need. It's paced accordingly, and catches the eye, and at times, the heart. *sniff* Combat mechanics are reminiscent of a super watered-down Street Fighter. It's simple, and with practice can become devastating and fast. The upgrades are simple and to the point, just like the rest of the game. All in all, this is a splendid use of money, as far as games go. It provides hours of fun if you're willing to deal with it, and some serious, but rewarding, challenges. Prepare to curse, though.

												Even if you're not a fan of the Mexican Lucha Libre culture, I would classify this game as a must-buy. With tight controls (I played through it with a keyboard and a controller, with the latter being superior), a nice to look at angular art style and intuitive fighting mechanics this game earned it's place as one of the best Metroidvania games out there. Guacamelee has Steam workshop support where everyone with experience in Flash can upload their own costumes for the heroes Juan and Tostada.The only negative aspects I could find were the lackluster story and only one save file. Many gamers fell afoul to the difficulty of the game, and although there are definitely parts considerably harder than others - most of them optional - Drinkbox aimed to appeal to the hardcore gamers.After getting 100% completion and all achievements you can still perfect your game time/speedrun to earn your place in the leaderboards. For players concerned with replayability, there is lots to do.You're still reading? If you have the money to shell out, buy and play Guacamelee, the sooner the better!			"

Stylish, fast paced, tight controls, difficulty, appealing characters, a good sense of humor, and a great sountrack are only some of what this game brings to the table, which is a lot. This game grabed me in its' steely luchador grasp and didn't let go until it had played out its story in full glory. The tight control scheme is the ground work for this awesome action side scrolling title. The easy-to-pull-off combos and simplicity of linking them together makes this games fight sequences not only enjoyable to play, but also to watch. The controls don't only extend to the fighting, the platforming is also top notch. Coming from a platforming background, I was pleasantly surprised with the difficulty in some of the optional areas. It definietly put my skills to the test, but fear not, the controls are such that any mistake is on the player and it's pretty obvious when you make an error. From the comical characters and their interactions, to the endgame battles and platforming, the only thing this game doesn't nail, is it's name. Other than that, do yourself a favor and buy this game. You won't be disapointed!!!			"

												I used to see this game advertised on Steam and think it couldn't be any good. Boy, was I wrong.This is truly a little gem. I got it from a humble bundle and decided to try it out just for the hell of it. Ten minutes later, I was hooked. The game plays extremely well, and it's just a LOT of fun. Combat is very satisfying, controls are responsive, artwork is lovely and full of references and humor that'll constantly put a smile on your face.I started playing with my girlfriend, an aspiring gamer, and Guacamelee proved an immersive, delightful, and easy enough experience (the simple parts at least) that she REALLY enjoyed, and so did I. Even when the game got quite tricky - which it does - and she couldn't help, she stood there, rooting for Juan. Truth be told, we actually ended up going to a mexican restaurant after a playing session, that's how much addicted we were (and still are!) to the whole setting, almost immediately after starting the game.I also don't think I've ever felt interested enough in getting all the achievements before Guacamelee. They are not too many, and are quite feasible, which I find a very smart strategy: it makes me want to come back again and again after having finished it, instead of putting me off because of the sheer impossibility of completion.This is one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had.

Yet to earn all the achievements, it will force you to be more skilled than just button mashing your way to victory. The only con I can think of is how long it took me to beat it. I've gotten gold in every challenge, found every chest, and gotten every item needed for the true ending in just under 15 hours. Now all I need to do is beat that game on hard, and I'll have 100%.

												Guacamelee is a fun 2D adventure platforming game with different fighting moves and a variety of enemies and bosses. The game is very heavily based on Mexican culture. You play as Juan, a luchador fighter. He is trying to rescue the president’s daughter who he also is in love with. Across your travels you’ll unlock different fighting moves that also double as a different way to get around the levels. This also allows you to get to certain chests to increase your health and stamina meters. Gameplay is fairly straightforward. Advance through the levels and locations while fighting off enemies and the occasional boss. It will take some time to get used to using all of your attacks but the more fluid you get, the quicker you can kill the enemies. You are also searching for life and stamina chests that are scattered around the levels. Getting 3 of each will grant you a boost in health of stamina. The characters and NPC’s are all well done. Even though there is no voice acting in the game, each character had their own voice in my head. They are fleshed out well enough for this type of game. The NPC’s may also contain side quests. The dialog is well done and is pretty tongue in cheek. Graphics and music are unique. The art style of the game is very minimalistic and extremely colorful. They nailed the Mexican feel they were going for. Using a controller is a must. You’ll be fumbling around on the keyboard very quickly. Controls are generally ok, but probably is one of my few gripes with the game. They seem floaty and unpredictable at times. Platforming with narrow areas to jump on really shows this. I feel they could have been tighter.Two other gripes deal with fighting. First is the recovery time after getting hit. It’s too short and can lead to some combo attacks from the enemies that feels cheap. Second, certain enemies seem to deal way too much damage. (The enemy with multiple swords comes to mind)Pros+Visuals and music+Solid 60fps+Combat system+Mexican cultureCons+Imprecise controls+Recovery time from getting hitThis is a solid platformer. The awesome Mexican based environments, visuals, music and characters really makes this stand out. 7/10 Good			"

												Fun mechanics, solid platforming. Overall I feel like the minimalist approach (no voice acting among other things) takes away from the ""epic action"" feel this title is going for. For me the elements didn't gel that well.However, I can't bring myself to ""not reccomend"" as this is a solid Metroidvania that's very well put together. If you're into that sort of thing get it, it's just not personally for me.Here is my review via Youtube:

												I'm not usually a fan of Beat-'em-ups but the game is amazing, the gameplay,the soundtrack, the art-style, catches the stereotypical mexican town but adds in the true mexican culture within. I loved the addition of challenges, you can't never win all of them. The speedrun mode is really fun. The combos you can pull are amzing as well. The game is also really hard at times, reminds me of Super Meat Boy, since you have to do parkuor, which also can be done with your fighting moves. Go get this amazing game. You won't regret it.			"

												""Chickens are some cocky motherf*ckers""- Me when I was beating up the chickens (pun is intended)Guacamelee! is about a mexican agave farmer named Juan Aguacate, who becomes a luchador and sets out to save the world when El Presidente's Daughter is kidnapped by an evil charro skeleton named Carlos Calaca. Though the strong point in this game is the combat. But as I always do, I'll start off with the story.Storyline:It's alright and other than that there's nothing else to say about it. It's not special, but not bad. And that's all what I can say about the story.Characters:They 'aight. There's also is a goat/guy who I would be alright with if he was my dad......but then I would be Daniel Bryan.......Nevermind then.Platforming: It's hard and it challenges you how to beat it. It could be simple as jumping to small floating platforms to changing dimensions and dashing herpderping, rooster uppercutting, double jumping, goat climbing, goat flying, turning into a chicken, jumping, and then landing on the checkpoint. Hard, rewarding, and good at the same time.GG, Drinkbox Studios, GG.Wham! Bam! And Slam! Combat:(They dont actually call the call the combat ""Wham! Bam! And Slam! Combat"", but I just thought of it and had to put it in)Anyways, the combat is just awesome. Grabbing my enemies and piledrivering them to rocks was more fun than I imagined. And booting them off a cliff to their deaths. You just have to see how good the combat is. Fun and hard enough that's it's not a breeze. Abilties:Fun to do and usefull in combat. Goat flying into a skeleton's skull has never been more satisfying.Easter Eggs:This game has alot of them. If you want to see some just go into my Guacamelee! screenshots and see them, but if you're thinking of getting this game. Dont spoil all of them for yourself. I loved each and every references this game had in it. Ending statements: This game is fun, hard, challenging, rewarding, and good game to play through in your spare time. So If you're looking for a small game where you're a luchador in a 2D world that can bashing skeleton's head in a f#cking wall. Then this is your game, senoir.6.8/10*Mexican Gaben voice*Gracias! y divertirse!			"

												Metroidvania at it's finest, mixed with crazy platforming moments.Amazing art-style, and crisp hd vector graphics; very skewed towards mexican folklore, so it is clearly not for everyone. Plagued (literally) with references to other games and internet culture.The atention to detail it's remarkable, without any copy and paste material, or mirrored levels, a problem that plagues the genre, ie: the last nds Castlevania iteration. This gives really fresh content for the entire game, but it comes at a price, the length of it. The length is little short for any major genre enthusiast, with just a little obvious backtracking here and there.The game copes with this by presenting you with amazingly difficult platforming challenges, mixed with insta-death and insta-respawn.I assure you that 2 sections of this game will get you stuck jumping the same platforms again and again for about an hour. For me that sounds like fun, been an old gamer from the NES era, but i am sure that many new fellas will feel ripped off by the platforming difficulty of this title. Some of this rooms are just for item-grabbing, but others are mandatory and un-skippable. Go watch some youtube vids of it, to get an ideaAnother thing to mention is the combat system. This game hides an amazingly complex and robust combo system, that you can learn through the game, and test in the Hell challenges.It took me about 11 hours in my first run, and then about 4 on my second run.

												Buy? Likely,Guacamelee is a pretty competent metroidvania with a focus brawling ""luchador combat"" and some moderate platforming. String combos together, weaken enemies and grapple them to throw into other enemies or perform various slams that can be purchased from money gained from killing and finding chests. It's fairly simple and the towns are filled (almost too much) with various video game and internet Meme references - though, it's one of the first times where I've been able to recognize practically every reference in the game since it's not a bunch of obscure book and movie references like the Fallout series. You gain new moves from busting Chozo statues, giving you basically color coded power ups, which makes the game on the surface feel a bit simple, even absurdly so (why can't my Super punch break the same things my head butt can...because of it's color effect?!). Though, it makes for interesting combat sense some enemies have shields that can only be broken by certain attacks (but still is sort of silly). While the game is fairly easy, since arenas are fairly short and enemies don't have a ton a health, but in the later parts of the game, it's a often a wonder on how I can avoid damage with multiple projectiles and assailants at times - the controls are mostly competent to keep you alive, but I sometimes wish there was a block and switching directions wasn't ""Mario Slidey"". Bosses fight in typical ""learnable patterns"" but you might die a couple times in the process trying to figure out when the game expects you to jump, dodge, or know how an enemy is telegraphing attacks. Bosses don't take too long to kill or have super crazy attacks like similar games. Platforming puzzles are scattered here and there, which offers a bit of challenge and sometimes frustration. They often reward you with health/stamina upgrades or cash used to buy more slams or health/stamina benefits. I finished the game around 5 hours, and I think I got the bad ending. I'm not quite sure what would cause a better ending, except for doing it faster (and I may have missed a town quest or two now that I think about it). I've seen leaderboard speed runs around an hour. If you care to, you can replay on a harder difficulty. If you like to play all the content of the game, $15 is a fair price, if you're like me and just want to get to the end and get the gist of the game, you may want to wait for a sale.			"

												Part character brawler, part puzzle platformer with optional precision platformer sections, Guacamelee! is thoroughly enjoyable as a whole.Drinkbox Studio masterfully combined movement and combat abilities in this lucha libre-themed metrovania. While requiring dexterous fingers at times, a perfectly executed series of moves that solves a puzzle room often results in what can only be described as pure joy.Beyond the numerous references to video games and Internet memes, Guacamelee!'s clean and vibrant portral of Mexican culture and folklore stands on its own. Combined with the delightful soundtrack, my senses were pleasantly engaged throughout my playthrough.It's a nice touch to view both endings without actually requiring to complete the optional objectives. At 6-8hrs, Guacamelee! didn't outstay its welcome and I'll probably return at some point to chip away at more of its side-content.			"

There, a mysterious wrestler named king gives Juan a mysterious mask that transforms him into a powerful wrestler and brings him back to the world of the living.

												A visually pleasing game. A few funny references here and there, but not over-the-top too many.  You can unlock different costumes in-game that best suit your favorite style of play. My favorite is the chicken suit; in the middle of a tough fight I can hide away and regenerate some health.  The Skeleton suit lets you do endless supermoves. Another suit makes your slams really strong. And so on.  When you get into some of the really hairy fights you'll almost wish the slamjam song were playing.The gameplay is fun, beat-em-up with strategy involved, but also platforming.  In fact once you get about halfway through the game some of the jumps and platforming tricks you have to do are a little frustratingly difficult.  With a little practice and patience (you get as many fall-off-the-screen deaths as you want), you can make it through.  Except maybe a couple of the secret items... getting them (tula tree and sierra, I'm looking at you!) are fairly insane no matter how much you've practiced.  Don't speed-run, at least not the first time. Take your time and enjoy the game.  The boss fights each have their own flavor and they each seem fairly impossible at first, but then you clue in on the boss's strategy after a couple tries... almost reminds me (not really) of the old NES game Punch-Out... the bosses are HARD at first but they telegraph most of their moves and once you learn to read the tells and react... presto.  And oh. Make sure you have a controller for this one.  You *can* play with the keyboard... but don't do it.The only con I can think of, is that if you're a completionist, you might throw your laptop across the room (then kick it a few times for good measure) at the Tula Tree...  that and you can't decide to marry X'tabay.

												Guacamelee is a great game. It's like Metroid mixed with a beat 'em up game but done so well that I'd definitely say it was a must have game, the Steam community also enhances this experience by adding tons of customised skins like Batman, Johnny Bravo and even Samus (who I played as, of course). The world is well designed, consisting of towns with villagers and sidequests, big open explorable locations and then temples. It plays just like Metroid but with less back tracking and is easier to navigate through the diverse areas. There are many hidden chests all over the world, I found them all without much trouble, so seasoned Metroid Veterans will likely find them easily. The combat is also very fun, all of your attacks are general melee based attacks, as you could probably guess from the title. You will unlock special attacks and upgrades which are used for both battle and for navigation; they use up some of your stamina as you use them so you can't over use them to kill all enemies easily. The twist on the combat is that once an enemy is weakened, it can be grabbed and then thrown at other enemies or into walls using the analog for direction. A lot of challenges revolve around good use of this throwing ability and it does make the game feel different from other side scrollers. The game has great sound design; the music is also greatly composed and enchanced the atmosphere of the areas. The sound effects fit perfectly and make the game feel cartoonish and matches the art style perfectly.Once you're finished with the game, there is still a hard mode to play through, lots of achievements to get and an online normal and hard speed run leaderboard for both clearing the game and clearing the game with 100%. There is also an area with 17 challenges to test the limits of your skills and to attempt to best your hi-scores. Giving plenty of replay value for those who enjoy the game. All in all, a fantastic game that I recommend very highly. Why wait for a new Metroid game when you can play this?			"

Guacamelee! is a very fun platformer. You try to rescue a princess while defeating a skeleton and the humor along the way is worth a chuckle. It is highly considered by the developers that this be played on a controller and I agree. The controls on the keyboard might need a re-mapping before you start doing all the combos. I had trouble combo-ing the enemy in the air but maybe that's cause I'm bad at this game. Overall, this game is very fun and casual. "

												Diamond in the Rough, this is the best phrase I can come up with to describe this game. Stylish, fast paced, tight controls, difficulty, appealing characters, a good sense of humor, and a great sountrack are only some of what this game brings to the table, which is a lot. This game grabed me in its' steely luchador grasp and didn't let go until it had played out its story in full glory. The tight control scheme is the ground work for this awesome action side scrolling title. The easy-to-pull-off combos and simplicity of linking them together makes this games fight sequences not only enjoyable to play, but also to watch. The controls don't only extend to the fighting, the platforming is also top notch. Coming from a platforming background, I was pleasantly surprised with the difficulty in some of the optional areas. It definietly put my skills to the test, but fear not, the controls are such that any mistake is on the player and it's pretty obvious when you make an error. From the comical characters and their interactions, to the endgame battles and platforming, the only thing this game doesn't nail, is it's name. Other than that, do yourself a favor and buy this game. You won't be disapointed!!!			"

												Guacamelee! Action! Romance! Thrills! No, really. This game is bloody fantastic, especially when it's not amazingly frustrating. Core gameplay is solid, simple and to the point. I don't think I've ever had this much fun with a game before. It benefits from a solid, distinct soundtrack, and a pleasing visual art style. This one's for the subscribers of the arts. When it comes down to the game itself, story is solid, perhaps short, maybe a little spent, but every now and again, a classic hero story is all we need. It's paced accordingly, and catches the eye, and at times, the heart. *sniff* Combat mechanics are reminiscent of a super watered-down Street Fighter. It's simple, and with practice can become devastating and fast. The upgrades are simple and to the point, just like the rest of the game. All in all, this is a splendid use of money, as far as games go. It provides hours of fun if you're willing to deal with it, and some serious, but rewarding, challenges. Prepare to curse, though.

												Even if you're not a fan of the Mexican Lucha Libre culture, I would classify this game as a must-buy. With tight controls (I played through it with a keyboard and a controller, with the latter being superior), a nice to look at angular art style and intuitive fighting mechanics this game earned it's place as one of the best Metroidvania games out there. Guacamelee has Steam workshop support where everyone with experience in Flash can upload their own costumes for the heroes Juan and Tostada.The only negative aspects I could find were the lackluster story and only one save file. Many gamers fell afoul to the difficulty of the game, and although there are definitely parts considerably harder than others - most of them optional - Drinkbox aimed to appeal to the hardcore gamers.After getting 100% completion and all achievements you can still perfect your game time/speedrun to earn your place in the leaderboards. For players concerned with replayability, there is lots to do.You're still reading? If you have the money to shell out, buy and play Guacamelee, the sooner the better!			"

												Guacamelee is an action platform, of the Metroidvania variety. You play a Mexican Luchadore, fighting the forces of evil to save your love and the world. Along the way you will explore varied areas, learn new abilities, and fight a multitude of enemies.Guacamelee is a game that is just oozing style. Everything from the artwork, to the sound, the writing, the characters and the world at large mesh so well together. You will want to spend time exploring the world and talking to its inhabitants. The towns are packed with humor and things to find.The controls are as tight as they need to be for an action platformer. I played using a 360 pad, and would recommend using a gamepad. After learning new abilities, you will have to combine all your powers to advance in the later stages. I was really amazed at the combinations I could pull off toward the endgame.I do have one complaint, which falls under performance and controls.

												El Presidente's daughter has been abducted by a band of thugs lead by the notorious Calaca, and Juan is the only one who can stop them!  This modest (and soft-spoken) agave farmer becomes chosen by an enchanted mask or... something.  I don't know, the story isn't why we're here.  Point is, you (as Juan) become a powerful Luchador and must fight your way through legions of undead soldiers.  Guacamelee is a Metroid-themed game, having you exploring a wide open world; only instead of Morph Balls and Grappling Beams, Guacamelee! emphasizes it's brawling focus by giving you special attacks that will break-open various paths that lead to power-ups or money; if not the way forward in the game.What the game lacks in variety, it makes-up for with it's fun music, bright colors, and in-depth fighting system; which is augmented by various costumes that the player can unlock, each giving it's own pros and cons.  If there are any gripes with the game, it's that the inconsistent difficulty can sometimes spike-up without warning, but it was never to such a degree that the game became suddenly unplayable; at worst it just meant having to retry an area a few extra times to adapt to the new difficulty.  There is also a bit of a heavier focus on platforming challenges than some might expect from a game like this, so players should be mindful of that if platforming is a turn-off.While the game can be very challenging during the later bits, players who can tough it out will find plenty to do during the endgame.  There are various achievements that are rewarded for completing certain tasks with each outfit, and players who explore enough can find themselves in El Infierno which has several ranked challenges to test your mettle.  All-in-all, Guacamelee is a great deal for $15, and a steal when offered at a discount.			"

												This game features the following elements :1 - A very well designed 'Metroidvania' experience with a strong focus on challenging 2D platforming & a satisfying combat system designed around combos, special moves & throws.2 - A sense of humour mostly centered around references to other video game franchises & occasionally internet memes.3 - A nice, sharp, angular artstyle that manages to fit the Mexican 'Luchador Wrestlers crossed with Day of the Dead' theme really well.4 - Chickens.This game was great fun to play & I'll probably revisit it at some point in the future, the main quest isn't very long (about 4-7 hours depending on side quest investment) but it is absolutely worth your time & money.

												This game is a bunch of fun, and thus should be played. The level design is solid and generally works well to suggest the tactics you should use to overcome its challenges. The open-world-ness functions well, with basically very few changes from the old metroid dynamics. Which is definitely not a bad thing, because it works well.The combat is just great. It's never too easy, and never too hard. It's rare to find a game that has that good a balance, but this is one of those games. It's also fun, and pretty smooth to control and chain up combos.The art design is fantastic. Every area is brimming with tons of details which fit in perfectly. Excellent work on the levels and also the characters. Hell, especially the characters.The addition of tons of things to do off the beaten track (see previous notes on metroid open-worldyness) is very welcome, and while some games would be comfortable to not put a lot of effort into these bits this does not do that. They are all still meticulously crafted. And often very tough. Which I heavily approve of.The story's pretty boring, but it doesn't tend to crop up very often so it's not really a problem. That's pretty much the only negative I can think of about this game. The characters aren't really ever explored that much either, but yeah. Perhaps that's just a leftover from the metroid style - because they were all about isolation (and the story developing through your actions alone), so adding a bunch of other characters and extra story into that just doesn't fit too well. But yeah. A very minor negative.Summary:A very fun, challenging, open-world 2D puncher-platformer, with excellent art, good level design and great combat mechanics. It's a joy to play, and you should totally get this in your hands and face right now.			"

												Guacamelee is an action platform, of the Metroidvania variety. You play a Mexican Luchadore, fighting the forces of evil to save your love and the world. Along the way you will explore varied areas, learn new abilities, and fight a multitude of enemies.Guacamelee is a game that is just oozing style. Everything from the artwork, to the sound, the writing, the characters and the world at large mesh so well together. You will want to spend time exploring the world and talking to its inhabitants. The towns are packed with humor and things to find.The controls are as tight as they need to be for an action platformer. I played using a 360 pad, and would recommend using a gamepad. After learning new abilities, you will have to combine all your powers to advance in the later stages. I was really amazed at the combinations I could pull off toward the endgame.I do have one complaint, which falls under performance and controls. Originally it felt like the game moved super fast, and I was having trouble pulling off basic combos and fighting some of the early enemies. One sequence in particular, where you must run in sidescroller fashion from a destructing environment, felt like it was moving way too fast. I was only able to pass it after about 20 attempts. Later I learned that there can be a bug with the vsync that basically doubles the speed of the game. Turning off vsynce solves the problem, however it will lead to some graphical glitches along the way. I found it a small price to pay for a playable game. After playing about the first quarter of the game at double speed, later platforming sections felt pretty easy in comparison.Beyond my one small complaint above, I was enamored by everything else in Guacamelee. It was fun to explore, fun to see what was next, fun to fight the enemies, and just plain fun overall. I would welcome a sequel, since it feels like there are so many places for this series to go. I see that a rerelease just came out with some new levels, and while I would prefer an entirely new game, eventually I may give that a shot as well.I completely recommend Guacamelee. While it has received heavy praise so it wasn't a complete surprise, it really exceeded my expectations. At this point you may want to purchase the newer version if you haven't played it yet, but if this game is already sitting in your backlog, move it to the front of the list.Grade: A			"

												Guacamelee, without a doubt, is the best Metroidvania I've ever played, excluding any Metroid or Castlevania games. From the get go you're presented with a cool Luchadore theme, and tight controls. The game picks up heat pretty fast, and soon you transform from average farm worker to a luchadore, a hero of the people. This game follows the metroidvania tradition very well. You have areas to revisit, powerups unlockble through the game, and a 2D world to explore. The game is so much fun, you'll lose hours jumping and punching enemies. This game also has a great sense of humor, and has tons of references, like nods to Castle Crashers, Mario, Metroid, Mega Man, and even TF2. It also references a bunch of memes, which kinda get on my nerves, seeing things like Insanity Wolf or Me Gusta staring back at you.However, every game has faults, and this game is chock full of them. First of all, the platforming will frustrate you to no end. Some of the platforming requires a lot of timing and fast reflexes. There were many times I almost went insane doing it. The game is short, but the time you get to have is great. I recommend using a controller for this, as a keyboard can really frustate you. I mapped all my keyboard controls to odd things, whicvh made the combat harder and the platforming as hard as well. Some things, like the sparring bot, just get ridiculous to use when you have your keyboard controls mapped to wild locations. Despite its flaws, this game is very enjoyable, and easy to play. I'm looking forward to whatever this company puts out next. It may be hard to believe, but this is easily one of the most fun games I've played this year.			"

												This game is a very well done game that was ported over from the consoles to the pc. The controls are very fluid,the graphis are easy on the eyes, the combat is fun and the adventuring keeps you wanting to play.Game runs very smoothly at all sections in it and the music keeps up with the pace of the game.The story is not great but not bad, is something kids might find more entertaining than adults,but better than nothing at all.The combat in the game works like a beatem up where you can do combo's and after unlocking, use various skills which become part of your arsenal to take down mobs.There are boss fights which are a lot of fun and entertaining and though out quite well. Outside of the combat moves you can unlock there are different outfits which give different stats when you wear them.The adventuring is fun because all of the locations are unique to one another including the other dimension versions of each.Great care was done to the enivornments and locations to make them not reptitive in looks ,feel and play styles. The only thing and I mean the only thing about this game they I cannot stand are the very few , and I mean very few puzzle-platform areas that will keep you doing them over and over again. I encountered three areas in the game that thanks to my patience I manged to do but two of the area's took me 30-45min to do soley because of constantly messing up. The third area is an area in which the puzzle is a long vertical jump,run,jump,climb,etc portion.After trying my hand at it for literally 5 hours of total gameplay time I decided I had enough with the game and uninstalled it.Aside from the three area's I ran into I loved the game, but I will say this as a warning about those areas.Final ThoughtsIf you want to play a very actiony beatem up, platform puzzle game,can deal with a few sections you will have to try and try again to do, you will enjoy the game. I got about 2/3 the way finished before I had enough of the 3rd puzzle are that had me at bay and uninstalled. Enjoy my time with the game and it was lots of fun. You will have a blast. "

												The short of it: Guacamelee delivers a satisfyingly solid metroidvania experience while maintaining an aesthetic and an identity all its own.  Mechanically, It's a relatively simplistic game that never bothers to introduce much in the way of equipment or character upgrades.  Beyond the obligatory health and energy boosts, there are scant few abilities to be found as you scale impossibly tall trees and chicken your way through ruins saturated with lava, but the game draws out its platforming sections to such a frankly absurd scale that what abilities it does give you never start to feel tired.  In that vein, the level design is demanding, but also quite forgiving.  Falling off platforms never puts you back more than a few seconds, and the intuitive map makes backtracking for hidden items surprisingly painless.  Combat is frantic but solid, the soundtrack full of energy.  The references to nerd culture populate the latin-styled environments like elderly people at a nude beach, but unlike Old Man Wallace, they remain happily in the background, never forcing you to appreciate them, and the game's off-beat humor holds up all the way through the end credits.Buy it full price or on sale, whatever fits your budget.  You'll be glad you did.			"

												This is exactly the kind of gem that flourishes from indie companies. Never before have I played a game that fuses platforming, metroidvania, and combat together so well. There's secret passages and hidden collectibles to encourage you to explore and revisit areas, and even a whole secret ending if you explore enough. The combat is quick and simple, but has a lot of depth and flexibility, which is basically perfect for a fighting game. Hard mode is a legitimate combat challenge at times, too, which makes it feel like you really had to fight through the game.What sets this game apart from other metroidvania games is...its humor. I've really not found a game that actually made me laugh more than this. The writers really knew what they were doing with the characters, and all the jokes are sort of off-hand remarks that you don't expect. Plus there's tons of video game and pop culture references, but almost entirely in the background on signs. Seeing strong bad as an actual mexican wrestler is nice to see, and you have to laugh/cringe at the Rage Comic Era Memes™ set up to fight each other in a wrestling match. And it has co-op, too! This entire game is a real breath of fresh air from standard stuff, and I wish there was more of it.			"

Want to punch a dude, uppercut him into the air, punch him some more while you float together, slam him back towards the ground, catch him before he lands and then suplex him into his evil friends? You can do that.It is the only game I've ever cared to 100% in terms of achievements, because they were fun and (at times) challenging.This is a game made for me, and you don't even go to space.

												Guacamelee is a short but satisfying Metroidvania for the PC. If you don't have a controller, I can't necessarily reccommend this game to you though. Guacamelee is unique in that the abilities you unlock to progress through the games aka the powers used for platforming challenges are also used to chain combos and fight.Also, Johnny Bravo.

												One of the best Metroidvania games ever. Platforming is tight, pacing is great, light/dark mechanics are slick, combat is fast and fun, art is amazing, sound is good. Probably in my top 10 list for the year.			"

												Best game if you want to become a real Luchador!This game is really nice, with plenty of geek culture references, Mario, Super Meat Boy and other Memes!The beat-em-up gameplay is really fun, the different platform parts bring a real challenge to the adventure (especially if you want to see the alernative end)!To conclude, nice, fun and cheap with the holiday sales! Don't hesitate, buy this game and become a brave Luchador!For The Gwak!			"

												This game is hard.  Very hard.  Playing it makes me angry.  Will not say that I totally recommend it, but I'm warning you that the game will push you joystick skills to the limit.  These types of games do not usually keep my attention for long.  This one does simply because it ticks me off and makes we want to beat it out of spite or something.  Still working on it.  Will update when/if I ever complete it.			"

												Prós:Excelemente mistura do estilo plataforma com ♥♥♥♥♥daria. Os gráficos 2D estilo vetoriais são de muito bom gosto e cada fase é bem distinta da outra, é um show de cores vivas e bem utilizadas. Em relação a jogabilidade é muito fluida e o combate é divertido e intuitivo. A curva de aprendizado de cada novo poder e dos combos é perfeita. O game é um mergulho na cultura mexicana, isso é legal, visto que a maioria dos games só explora a cultura americana, inglesa ou japonesa. E o bom humor é presente o tempo todo.Jogar single player já é bem divertido, a é diversão é muito melhor jogando com outra pessoa ao lado. Pena que o game só dá suporte a coop local, e não online.Agora vamos aos contras:- É um game desaconcelhado para quem não curte: games de plataforma, games de ♥♥♥♥♥daria e games bem humorados.- Os gráficos apesar de bonitos, são limitados e tem poucas cut scenes. E os dialogos são todos feitos por balões de texto, sem dublagem.- Não possui coop online, somente local.			"

												Guacamelee is gorgeous and fun metroidvania game. Reminds me somewhat of Outland, with the switching between light and dark worlds, but Guacamelee has less of the bullet hell and more of the titular melee action. I'm not a huge fan of backtracking, but the world is laid out so smartly that even as it expands, your accumulating powers allow you to traverse the world more and more rapidly. Combat is challenging, but fair. Cetain fight setups felt cheap and unfair on first attempt, but after some careful observation and thought (and a few deaths), they were actually quite reasonable. Checkpoints are relatively generous, and placed in all the spots you'd want them. The boss fight thankfully actually uses the same skills honed during the rest of the game, rather than throwing in something out of left field. All in all, a total pleasure.			"

												Guacamelee is a fresh, very well made ""Metroid-Vania"" type of game.Drikn Box Studio gave us a little gem.The game is a sidescroller set in a fictional, yet charming, Mexico, and the whole game deals with the theme of ""Luchadores"" and mexican myths and legends regarding death and the afterworld.As a ""Metroid-Vania"" the main character (Juan) has to travel across a variety of stages, fighting enemies and avoiding traps by platforming.The thing that keeps the game fresh is the variety; the maps are very complex yet easy to navigate once you uncover the whole map, and the game perfectly balances its difficulty, starting very easy and getting harder closer to the end (yet not impossible).Speaking of platforming, i have rarely seen such well made platforming sections in a very long time.The developers really went crazy (in a good way) offering double jumps, moving plaftorms, flying powerups, portals, walljumps, wallslides, levers ecc..., and some puzzles are very challenging, yet very rewarding and well designed (note that most of these can be avoided if preferred).The combat is an other thing that differenciates this game from the others; unlike other ""Metroid-Vania"" games here you have a very intuitive yet complex combo system, with the ability to throw enemies away and do some devastating chain attacks.Enemies are well differenciated and you need personalised attacks to beat them.The design of the game is great, featuring a charming 2D vector style; the characters are gorgeously animated and drawn, as well as the levels, each one colorful and very well drawn.An other thing that makes this game original is its unique humor, the game is filled with an incredible amount of funny easter eggs regarding the whole ""Internet/Memes"" and ""Videogames"" worlds and the game offers the chance to use custom skins built by the community (available through Steam Workshop).Guacamelee is a must-buy for everyone who likes 2D side scrolling games with a personal touch.One of the best of its genre.Pros:- Charming Humor- Fresh Design- Complex Maps- Amazing Platforming Action- Deep and fun combat/combo System- A ton of amazing easter eggs- Varied puzzles- Balanced Difficulty- Balanced Lenght (Not too long, not too short)- A lot of ""developer made"" and ""Community made"" custom skinsCons:- A couple of stages could have ""dared"" more in therms of visual designTo Keep In Mind:- Some Orbs very very hard to get (Not necessary for the game completion)- Inferno Challenges (endgame content) sometimes incredibly hard /frustrating- Some achievements very hard to obtain (Not necessary for the game completion)- Need a bit of grinding, if willing to collect all the treasure chests (Not necessary for the game completion)			"

												So a bunch of people got together one day and made the most casual game ever, one that appeals to the lowest common denominator. This is not that game.If you've played henry hatsworth it's a lot like that except instead of puzzles and gentlemen you have a double world mechanic and luchadores.  Gameplay invovles actively switching back and forth between the living and dead worlds while juggling an ever increasing set of attacks and skills that cleverly maneuver your character through the intricately built terrain. It's manly, colorful, difficult, constantly developing, and lasts up to six hours or more if you explore everything this wonderful game has to offer.			"

												I deleted my rage quit recommendation, here's the more coherent version.Had great promise as a Metroidvania style game, but the ridiculous amount of platforming and level design that is very dependent on really great reflexes and tricky fingers kill any passion I had toward this game. If the option to remap the keys is available, I probably wouldn't have so much gripe to the interface and actually recommend this.  Any type of action/platforming game relies on good control, this one feels tremendously lacking becaues it tends to break the flow/rhythm I've built up.  Combat control works, but anything that involves quickly switching light/dark world becomes awkward due to button placement.  This is even more annoying when the game ACTUALLY recommend you to use a controller for the game but won't give you the option to remap the buttons.  It's only 1 controller profile too, no alternates either.  If you have a distinctive play style and prefer certain button mapping, consider checking out how this one is mapped first before making your purchase.My general sentiments after I first completely beat the game with good ending: It took the Meat Circus of Psychonauts, the speed bike in Battle Toads, the disappearing blocks in Megaman and haphazardly rolled all the frustration bits into this.  Really not a fan of the gimmicky part of the level design.  Just. No.			"

												(Note: I originally bought this game through Humble Bundle and played it directly through them, hence the lack of Steam play time here.)As a big Metroidvania and brawler fan, I expected this game to be a homerun for me. And the first few hours I played were excellent. I loved the freedom of the combat and the ability to chain together lots of moves in new ways. I also appreciated the wealth of references. But as the game progresses, you get flooded with new abilities (OP and unnecessary abilities IMO that ruin the rhythm of the game) and the once precise and tight controls become way over-saturated. The combat becomes muddled and convoluted.On top of that, the game rapidly shifts its focus from combat to platforming, which is not its strong point. I had a blast in the beginning of the game chaining huge hit counts in very satisfying and visually appealing fights. Then some way into it, I have to make my way through almost Meatboy level platforming, only without the precision and quick respawn that dedicated platformers like Meatboy have. Where games like Meatboy and Dustforce are VERY hard, they don't feel unfair, and they focus on platforming mechanics so they can perfect them. Guacamelees platforming has terrible controls, and the platforming feels thrown-in. The game becomes crazy frustrating and promptly sucks all the fun out of it. If you're looking for platforming, leave Guacamelee on the shelf and go get Dustforce.This game suffers from over-saturated mechanics and identity crisis. If you love brawlers and Metroidvania style games, you might get some enjoyment out of this, but my advice is don't get too invested.  If you want something that does brawler/Metroidvania really well, I suggest Dust (if you can get past bad story/voice acting), or even better, go buy Muramasa for about $12 on Wii or just emulate it. You'll have more visually unique game with better mechanics and longer campaign.			"

												Behold, horrible boss fight simulator.When I first get my hands on Guacamelee! I though this was a great and awesome game. And it is for some things, but not for many other.The story is pretty weak and not much worked on: the princess has been kidnapped, you gotta save her and beat the crap out of 4 bosses.The art style as the location is very sweet, probably the best thing of the game. Great animation, and good looking characters.The only thing that this game miss a lot is a personality: there are many, LOTS of game references from 80s-90s, some gameplay sistems are just fully recicled from those kind of games, and some of those are almost stolen with the excuse of ""easter egg"" (http://nerdreactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/guacamelee-metroid-chozo-statue.jpg).The humor is pathetic, there aren't many good jokes, maybe you're gonna love it if you're a 9gag kid or something. It has lot of memes, that's all I have to say about it.The controls are pretty good, and the map design it's great, but still, with those gameplay elements, there isn't much difference between a level and another one.The boss battles are just ridiculus, most of them are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ kid level, and the last one it's a ripoff of many other games battle. Also, that last battle is total bullcrap, cause the level designer just went ""screw this"" and probably made that in about 5 minutes. There aint no plot twist, you can see everything coming. After I've finished the game, I just didn't care about the characters or what it was gonna happen.Final Score: 5/10Games like these needs to stop living into the past. You wanna make a game that has the same feel of a SNES game? Fine. But at least add something new to it, don't give me the same crap with a different color.But wait, there's more! If you complete the game normally, you'll get the sad and boo-hoo final; if you wanna see some happy engings, get your♥♥♥♥♥back into the game, find every collectable, and then beat the final boss again! Like a big ♥♥♥♥ you into my face! Wow, and I though this game couldn't get any better!			"

												I really...really...really want to recommend this game. It's got a great musical score, great artistic style, humor, interesting and seldom-seen-in-a-video-game Mexican-theme. And I've always loved Metroid style games. ** BUT **The platforming sections of the game are ridiculously difficult. Needlessly difficult, I'd add. I'm still stuck on the section in the Tuli Tree, where you must do a series of wall jumps combined with flipping in and out of the land of death. I cannot do it. And I'm no stranger to platformers!I wouldn't have a problem with this kind of difficulty if it were only used sparingly in areas of the map with hidden power ups or bonus content. But to make just getting to the next dungeon/temple/castle/level this ludicrously challenging is too much to ask! I play games to be entertained; if the gameplay turns into a repetitive series of failures that's no fun at all!Part of the problem is that the controller layout isn't ideal. A few glaring control issues: One, Right-Trigger to switch between light and dark worlds!? Bad button mapping! Also, when playing two players, we often accidentally enter the bubble mode, which is disaterous if we both do it at once! And the button placement for ""chicken mode"" isn't so good either. Rather than doding (left trigger) I sometimes bump the left button for Chicken mode. And on top of all that, there's no way to re-map the buttons.So, DEV...  before I could recommend this game to anyone, PLEASE fix the level designs and button mapping!EDIT: I changed my mind on this one. I gave it rest for a while then came back to it. As I had previously said, it IS insanely hard! But I did finally manage to make more progress. I'm now all the way to boss fight with Calaca! It's definitely a good game, although, I still wish they had made a easy mode!			"

												Guacamelee! is a Mexican-themed beat em’ up platformer with puzzle solving elements and a very silly sense of humor. I don’t usually dig beat em’ up games, but I’m glad checked this game out, it’s pretty awesome. You play as Juan Aguacate, a Mexican farmer who dons a magical luchador mask to become a superpowered wrestler in order to save his kidnapped girlfriend. The game can be played solo or co-op, a second player can assume the role of the female wrestler “Tostada”. I played through the game both solo and co-op. The co-op makes the platforming sections a bit more frantic, but makes the beat em’ up sections and boss fights quite a bit easier. The game has some Metroidvania elements as well: as you progress through the game and unlock new wrestling moves, you’ll gain access to areas you previously unable to reach. As mentioned before, Guacamelee! also has a very silly sense of humor. It’s chock full of “nerd jokes”, internet humor and direct references to other video games. It was kind of a fun “can you spot them all?” subgame within Guacamelee!; trying to catch some of the more subtle video game references. There was even a Zelda II reference in there! How many people are really going to get that one? Guacamelee! is a bit on the short side, but it’s quite good. Check it out.For more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/ "

It's a great platforming beat-em-up style game with catchy music and just the right amount of difficulty for the dedicated player; not enough rage to make you want to stop playing, but not easy enough to be a joke. Hard mode is a fresh playthrough as well. This is probably one of my favorite indie games to date (if you can call it that), and you should try your hand at it if you get a chance. And if you see this as soon as I post, there's a Humble Bundle that you can pay for to buy the game for only a dollar! (Though I think it's worth much more)			"

												A really cool platform adventure game. It is quite similar to the free game N in its gameplay and can be very addictive and really quite tough in places just like N. Has some similarity to the likes of Prince of Persia (1989) and Deadlight but has a much more advanced combat system and much more intricate puzzles making it really superior to those two. There's loads of side quests and ways to upgrade and change your character's abilities. Has a great story all the way through and superb presentation. I really recommend Guacamelee! highly.			"

												Guacamelee is a great metroid style platformer with great gameplay and aesthetic. There is plenty to do from finding secrets to upgrading costumes and moves. Its a well thought out game.Initially i didn't play much of the game and then revisted quite a long time later. Looking back now i think the reason for this is that you aquire moves as the game progresses. Once you have all the moves it has a great feel to it but starting out the game you don't have too much and this probably set my interest back a little.			"

												It's hard to talk about this game without talking about Metroid or Castlevania. It's an obvious homage to the older games of Metroid and Castlevania, what many would say is a genre in it's own right. (Metroidvania anyone?).Guacamelee has enough cojones to stand shoulder to shoulder with these older titlesThe game starts you off as a as a regular amigo ""Juan Aguacate"" who becomes the otherworldly super Luchadore to save El Presidente's Daughter the love interest of Juan. She has been kidnapped and whisked away to the nearest Casa de Muertos by the evil, Carlos Calaca and it's up to Juan to save her. As you explore through the huge expanding and beautifully designed areas you earn powers and skills to help you fight of a number of different enemies and to reach areas previous inaccessible. It's the standard formula for Metroidvania games and it has been executed very well here, the game takes it a little further with the Dark and Light side switching that reminded me of Legacy of Kain, which does make for some great brain bending platforming puzzles. The art design in this game is nothing short of stunning and there are pop culture references and meme's galore. It's packed with detail, especially when you start to see the game from both light and dark themes.At first the fighting feels very shallow but it isn't until you gain all your powers and had enough training with the Combo Chicken that it becomes apparent there is a lot of room for creativity in the combat. Knock someone up into the air, jump after them and overhead smash them to to group, pursue them with a ground slam, catch them mid air from a bounce and pile driving them to oblivion. It's a very satisfying experience! Too long? Didn't read? If you're looking for a Metroidvania game with kick♥♥♥♥♥combat, good laughs and beautiful artwork, you should play Guacamelee!			"

The music is good (mexican techno-ish.) While if you only play on normal it'll only take you 6-8 hours to complete, if you play hard it'll take much longer.Overall, a extremely enjoyable experience.			"

												This game is possibly one of the best 2D platformers I've ever played. It's a hard game, but not too hard, well......not on levels used in order to advance the story anyways. There are several hardcore levels in this game, but they are mainly for side-quests like collecting all the orbs or the Inferno challenges. But otherwise, the difficulty is pretty fair.The graphics are really nice-looking and stylish, even if the characters and monsters are Flash-animated, the Mexican-themed art-style is what made this game so gorgeous. The music is astoundishing and the trumpets and guitar fits perfectly with this game's environment.But what really makes this game shine is the gameplay. It has the style of a Metroidvania platformer mixed in with a beat-em-up. You perform different kinds of combos to beat up your enemies with and can add them up together much like a 2D fighter game. The game has plenty of areas to explore in, lots of side-quests to accomplish, and even has it's own arenas if you're interested in completing the game 100%.My only downside is the story, which isn't anything new and intriguing, and is pretty straightforward. Other than that, I highly recommend this game to anyone that loves 2D side-scrollers and loves to explore.			"

												Easily one of the best indie games i've ever purchased.  If an action platformer, a beat em up, and metroidvania had a child this would be the child.  In this game you fight and grapple the enemies, as well as using moves you unlock throughout the games.  All of your moves can combo together.  For example, I can use my upward punch, then jump up and rooster claw(upward attack that shoots you up too.  This is useful all game to help you platform as well.), attack them multiple times, then either groundpound them, headbutt them away, or grapple them and follow up with one of my throws.  I could always piledrive my enemy, kick them 20 feet away, or do a deadly suplex to help wipe out the enemies that might await below me.The enemies have a good variety, even tho I wish it had more.   I felt like with a little more variety amongst the enemies, this game would have been so much more fun.For now, I'll give it a 8.5/10.  I truly recommend this gem of a game, on sale or off.   "

												This is my first review. It’s for a game that really deserves the effort. Guacamelee. It tells a classical story in which you (Juan, a former agave farmer and now luchador) have to save “El Presidente’s Daughter” from the evil charro Carlos Calaca.The game features a mix of platforming, combat and exploration. You start with a few basic moves and learn better ones throughout the game. Juan is able to switch between the two worlds of the living and the dead. This also changes music and environment. Both are brilliant and you will discover many details and references to other games.One of the best parts of the game are no doubt the dialogs. They are hilarious and contain many Spanish words. I don’t know the Spanish language but had no problems understanding everything. I think I might have missed a few jokes but that’s ok. For the first time, while playing the game at home alone, I read out aloud every dialog. They are fantastic.It took me about 6 hours to finish the game. The difficulty is appropriate on normal. If you get the chance to play this game make sure you don’t miss it. I had great fun playing it! Enjoy!			"

												Without a doubt, one of the best games ever made.  I could try to describe what sets this game apart from so many other platformers, but you have to experience it to understand.  These days, there are a lot of games that pay homage to games of the past, but Guacamelee takes everything from the past and builds on it.  Sure, it isn't the first ""Metroidvania"" game, but in my opinion, it is by far the best and most creative.  Everything from amazing animation and visuals, tight controls, and an awesome sound track, make this the best game I've played in the last five years.If you are wondering whether you should get it, get it.  The only thing that might disappoint you is when the game is over.			"

												After joining Steam recently, I thought that I should buy an indie game as a sort of ""inaugural"" purchase. I quickly stumbled upon Guacamelee! Gold Edition and seeing it got good reviews, I quickly bought it.  And after having playing the game for around 7 hours total(I haven't really played any Metroid styled games before), I really enjoyed my self with this. Love the art style, smooth controls and wonderfully designed combat even with a keyboard which I am using, and last but not least, the music is AWESOME! Certainly one of the most memorable things about this game. Where the games takes place and how the story line handles it is well executed, but this is definitely not the reason to buy this game. My only true complaint with this game is the lack of voice-overs. All the characters are charming, but I feel they could really benefit from voice-actors. So over-all, an amazing game and a great buy for anyone looking to have a good time.			"

												This is the only game this year where I couldn't put the controller down.  All I wanted to do was to play more when I was away from my computer. Guacamelee has superb game mechanics and extremely responsive controls.  Although you can fail a lot of times at a given mission, there is zero frustration.  Best way I can describe Guacamelee's gameplay is that it has a ""flow"" and once you are in the zone it's a joy to play.  There is no point where the game cheats, and every error is due to the player not mastering the controls.  Being Mexican, this game had me smiling at a lot of things, the humor, the surprisingly authentic portrayal of a lot of Mexican folklore, the subtle way that is was playing with telenovelas tropes. Drinkbox clearly did their homework. It is also by far the funniest game since Psychonauts.			"

Seriously, just give it that much, I guarantee anyone will be hooked by the fantastic combat,  familiar yet developed metroid level design, and engrossing aesthetic. At very minimum the game is entertaining for all of the visual puns concerned with video game culture, putting the player in somewhat of a ""Where's Waldo?"" position in the game's environments. "

												Guacamelee! is an action-platformer with a strong emphasis on combat. The fighting mechanics are easy to pick up right a way, but still deep enough to remain interesting. You'll need to use your special attacks to traverse the environment and the game merges combat and platforming very well. This combined with a dimension-switching mechanic makes for one hell of a platformer! The humour in the game was also spot on for me. With references to other games, movies and various internet memes scattered all over place.I strongly recommend this game!			"

												I absolutely love this game, buy it now!That being said, this is a really intelligent, polished and fun metroidvania game. Metroidvania is probably my favorite video game genre, and this one gets it right. While the game doesn't have a large focus on exploration, its still there. The combat is legitimately fun, and is not just tacked on like in many games of the genre. The platforming sections are very interesting and can get challenging. The atmosphere and setting are very unique and cool. The music is beautiful and fitting. The humor is quite good, I laughed out loud a good deal at some of this game's jokes. I think the coolest thing about this game is the way that platforming and combat are integrated. As you progress in the game you gain combat moves, powerful punches and such. These moves are used in combat, but also are the backbone of platforming. For example the first move you learn is an uppercut that launches you upwards in the air. And while useful for combatting enemies and sending them skyward, the uppercut can also be used as a ""double jump"" of sorts. Highly, highly recommended.			"

Posted: April 16, 2014
												You probably have a good idea of what Guacamelee is by now. A Metroidvania with a Mexican Wrestler/Luchador theme, where the stamina-draining moves you learn are what unlock new areas. This is mainly done through colored blocks that require a specific skill in order to be broken. And that's the extent of the Metroidvania.It's simple enough and proves to be a lot of fun in the largest portion of the game.However, several things in the end come together to create a frustrating experience unless you're the sort of player who's perfectly accustomed to every trick in the brawler book. And in fact, die-hard brawler fans are the only people I would really recommend this game to, at least to completion.In the near-end game, you run into enemies and a few bosses that like to 'shield' themselves. A bubble fitting their shape that can only be broken by a specific stamina attack, which uses the same color coding as the aforementioned blocks. This actually starts out as a great idea as it throws around the way you think and need to approach a combat situation.But therein lies the first problem: The 'yellow' attack, being headbutt, requires you to stand still and press the B button (on the controller).However, it takes about half a second before the game apparently registers you standing still, meaning you're spamming B while nothing happens but you standing there.Obviously, in a high pace brawler, this means you are immediately punished for it by being attacked.This headbutt lag only becomes more frustrating when you are going up against bosses that constantly change their type of shield. So whenever headbutt is required, you can count on it that you are going to get punished for it. It requires a compensation the likes where you feel like you are compensating for a bug.Another technique that you must master in order to progress is the art of blocking. In the beginning, that's only required to jump through thorn vines. But eventually you will run into situations where the amount of melee and ranged enemies make it short of change of perspective to make it a bullet hell. Blocking is essential, period.And this is where another problem sets in. As someone trained by 'Witch time' in Bayonetta, I expect my blocking in a brawler to be instant. Many are the times where I had blocked a moment before being hit, yet it did not register. Frustrating.But the biggest issue are the 'gauntlets' you are forced to partake in. These are single rooms where you are shut in and are forced to beat all the enemies that spawn. Most of the time these are pretty fun, if not challenging. But every now and then you find a gauntlet that simply does not belong in the game. In one, you were forced to constantly pop the appearing timed 'balloons' because otherwise, upon exploding, you receive significant damage. In the middle is an obstruction that has a hazard on top. And the balloons constantly appear on opposite sides of the room, AND you have to deal with other spawning enemies. Meaning you not only have to run like mad at each timed balloon, but you need to dodge any other ranged attacks and then survive the other enemies.One other that I vividly remember is being forced to fight enemies that like to throw columns of light at you, and for some reason their AI likes to constantly throw these in sync where the distance between both columns is too great to overcome with one dodge/block, meaning you get hit regardless. But the biggest sinner is the gauntlet is the one where you have to kill a series of instakill exploding balloons with the moves they're obviously lined up for. But this brings another shortcoming: The special moves have a deceptively shorter range than they appear to have.But my biggest gripe with these gauntlets is that they are non-optional. You have to do them, no matter how ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they are. There's no going around them, meaning you have to suffer their punishment for as long as it takes for you to master whatever (usually pointless) lesson it wants to impart. Because I can guarantee you, most lessons you will take from these will not help in boss battles.Not to mention that the throwing-invincibility frames are deceptive as well, there's no telling in a split second when you are vulnerable at the end of your throw. Yet at the final boss, this is exactly whats required to know.All in all, the game likes to maximise the abuse out of your weakness, even when they are being forced on you by the game itself. It's unfair and harsh and maybe that's why it's not the sort of game for me. I can take difficult games, very difficult games. Games like Bayonetta (when going for Platinum), Super Meat Boy (A+'ing everything) and Ninja Gaiden (because, game) all are enjoyable for me because their responsiveness is perfect. Any mistake you make in those games are your fault alone. Failing because of an uncontrollable contender, however, makes for something very frustrating. Which is exactly the thing this game sins to.Storywise... it's cheesy. But what do you expect? The game itself likes throwing joke after joke at you, referencing many things that are Gaming related. It doesn't take itself too serious and neither should you. It's okay.But with me having a bunch of frustrations with this game, I can't get myself to collect the other hidden mask pieces for the 'Good' ending or even replay the game.Yes, I have to say the game is pretty good at what it's trying to do. Nowhere near the best, especially with me having so many irks around responsiveness. But if you can get over the gripes I have (or somehow manage to not experience them at all as a rare few do) then yeah... maybe you'll enjoy it. It won't be easy, even on Normal, so make sure you bring some alcohol to mellow you out. Because this game won't let you off the hook that easy.			"

Supports co-op, gamepads, and has Workshop features.Haven't completed the game as of this writing, but i've been enamored with what i've played so far. The game has an opened combat system and encourages exploration, so I feel once I've finished I won't mind playing again and again on ocassion. Additionally, I've purchased this game more than once (due to game bundles), its safely worth the asking price, and definitely worth the sales price. Hope this helps, cheers!			"

												This game was so amazing! The jokes and puns scattered through out the game don't really seem forced and you get the feeling someone had a lot of fun making this game. The storyline isn't nearly long enough, I really would have loved play more and that is really my only complaint. The variety of moves allow for satisfying combo chains that aren't just given to you by mashing one button. All of of the moves you aquire are satifying and have multiple purposes and keep you exploring the enviorment. Some obstacles have multiple ways to be passed by combing move chain. Other times some of the puzzles and platform timing will have you wanted to snap your remote over your knee... but if it didn't you wouldn't feel like you accomplished anything. There isn't an intense and detailed leveling up system, but the progression and gains in power still feel substantial. The music is incredible and goes so well with every detail of the game. Honestly, can't reccomend this game enough.			"

												I'll let you in on a little secret: my favourite game is Metroid Prime. Prime 2 and 3 probably rank second and third respectively, but before I get longwinded: I love Metroid games.As such I also have the poor habit of buying Super Metroid every time Nintendo rehashes it just to get some more of that sweet exploration action. Consequentially, I also love the Castlevania series...basically for being Metroid. Enter Guacamelee, an indie game that basically is Metroidvania, but dipped in taco sauce and smothered in chili's. You are Juan, a agave farmer who one day finds his town in peril and recovers a mask that gives him mystic Luchador powers. Along the way he learns new moves from peculiar looking statues and supplexes baddies into the ground to save the woman he, supposedly, loves. I don't know, the game doesn't care much about the whole love story. It wants you to play Metroid. And it does. Really well. In fact, the number of references to Metroid (and any other game for that matter) are so abundant, you might consider the developers lazy for not trying harder themselves. I'm poking holes now, cause Guacamelee is hilarious and fast and it certainly is excellent while it lasts. It channels that old-school spirit very well. Ugh, now I want to play some more Metroid.

The music is good (mexican techno-ish.) While if you only play on normal it'll only take you 6-8 hours to complete, if you play hard it'll take much longer.Overall, a extremely enjoyable experience.			"

												Playing this game single-handedly brought my dead cat back to life. Just moments after I defeated the final boss through sheer will power and determination, a sound came from the backyard. I don't know whether it was the adrenaline from just beating this beauty of a game or the multiple coke cans I had drank, but I decided to attack the intruder head on with my fists. So, with my fists raised, I stomped over to the backyard where, lo and behold, my dead (or at least I thought) cat was standing before me! ""Praise The Phil!"", I shouted. Literally the entire neighborhood soon arrived to witness the miracle for themselves. LITERALLY the entire neighborhood. Not just the people, no, but every piece of matter showed up! Praise Phil!

												Guacamelee! is a Mexican-themed beat em’ up platformer with puzzle solving elements and a very silly sense of humor. I don’t usually dig beat em’ up games, but I’m glad checked this game out, it’s pretty awesome. You play as Juan Aguacate, a Mexican farmer who dons a magical luchador mask to become a superpowered wrestler in order to save his kidnapped girlfriend. The game can be played solo or co-op, a second player can assume the role of the female wrestler “Tostada”. I played through the game both solo and co-op. The co-op makes the platforming sections a bit more frantic, but makes the beat em’ up sections and boss fights quite a bit easier. The game has some Metroidvania elements as well: as you progress through the game and unlock new wrestling moves, you’ll gain access to areas you previously unable to reach. As mentioned before, Guacamelee! also has a very silly sense of humor. It’s chock full of “nerd jokes”, internet humor and direct references to other video games. It was kind of a fun “can you spot them all?” subgame within Guacamelee!; trying to catch some of the more subtle video game references. There was even a Zelda II reference in there! How many people are really going to get that one? Guacamelee! is a bit on the short side, but it’s quite good. Check it out.For more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/ "

												I didn't even know what this game was as it came inside a bundle with another game I was looking to try (which by the way I haven't played yet, after learning what this game was about). Wow, I had a lot of fun with this one. I highly recommend for players that like getting super fustrated trying to get past the same platform puzzle for an hour. This game is super hard and fustratingly so, but its so much fun you just need to keep trying. Eventually I tried to complete as much as possible but then I just said eff it on some of the inferno challenges, this game is better suited for 10 year olds with super fast reflexes than old timers like me. Regarless I still recommend if you have some patience and love sidescrolling adventures in the vein of Metroid and Castlevania. PS. there are a lot of hilarious game references in this game, i must have seen at least 10 some blatent and others hiding in the background.			"

												Guacamelee is a Metroidvania style (i'd say maybe a light variation though, as it features no backtracking) game that lets you play a farmer turned luchadore, back from the realm of the dead to save to world. You fight about 15-ish different enemies, learn various special attacks which also offer movement tricks required for some platforming elements in this game. The last key feature is that you can switch between the realm of the living and the dead. You'll have to use the world shift as well as the special moves to deal with your enemies, who can attack from both planes of existence while also being protected by some form of shield that requires a particular attack to break first.Personally I liked the graphic style, but I can see that it might be offputting for others. I did experience a graphical bug that caused a very particular form of screen-tearing, regardless of Vsync options.I found the combat pretty satisfying, and I can say that a controller is required to get the best experience possible.The game isn't all that long; It takes about 6.5 hours to complete a playthough to start to finish, solo (the game support Co-Op, but I haven't tried it) on Normal. It offers some challenge modes and harder difficulties, as well as speedrun leaderboards, in case that's your cup of tea. Definately get it when it's on sale!			"

												Easily one of the best indie games i've ever purchased.  If an action platformer, a beat em up, and metroidvania had a child this would be the child.  In this game you fight and grapple the enemies, as well as using moves you unlock throughout the games.  All of your moves can combo together.  For example, I can use my upward punch, then jump up and rooster claw(upward attack that shoots you up too.  This is useful all game to help you platform as well.), attack them multiple times, then either groundpound them, headbutt them away, or grapple them and follow up with one of my throws.  I could always piledrive my enemy, kick them 20 feet away, or do a deadly suplex to help wipe out the enemies that might await below me.The enemies have a good variety, even tho I wish it had more.   I felt like with a little more variety amongst the enemies, this game would have been so much more fun.For now, I'll give it a 8.5/10.  I truly recommend this gem of a game, on sale or off.   "

												Do you like quick melee sidescrolling combat and adventure (and tacos). Then you'll love Guacamelee! This Mexican themed action platformer is set in in the colourful world of luchadores and the not-so-colourful world of the dead (which is still nice to look at anyway). The fighting is fast paced with plenty of moves and enemies to mix it up. There are also puzzle solving elements, where the player (that's you!) has to utilise the new techniques you have learned and quick reactions to solve them all. The music is also beautifully well suited, as are all the sound effects. The game can be a bit challenging at times when you're facing multiple enemies in different dimensions, but by no means is it impossible. There is a hard mode available after completion of the game if you found the first run through too easy. The game however, is quite short unfortunately. I finished it in 5:15, though that was with completing most all of the puzzles along the way (which probably made it easier for me anyway). That said, there are a number of side quests that I did not complete, and with multiple costumes also available, combined with the hard mode, there is some replayability in this game. Another feature, though I have not tried it out, is co-op mode. Could be fun, but not necessary anyway. The story isn't too bad - typical save the princess stuff with a Mexican and underworld theme mixed into it. The dialogue can be funny at times, but I think the only decent material was when references to other games were made. I feel like the developers tried too hard with this, and perhaps should have been more subtle most of the time - to me it seems they relied upon it too much.Guacamelee is fun, beautiful to look at, and engrossing, which is why I recommend it, but considering it's length, I would wait for a sale so as to get more bang for your buck.

It's like a entertaining luchadore-inspired Mexican yarn complete with switching between the real world and the tierra de los muertos (on the fly once you beat the first boss) with solid beat-em-up action. And an ungodly amount of pop culture references. Expect to see Strong Bad, Mega Man, Metroid references, Link (Zelda series), troll faces, sriracha references, and who knows how much more...And oh god, the soundtrack... Most all the tracks are done in a true Mariachi style, with horns and acoustic guitar.Seriously, buy this game if you like beat-em-ups or humor.

												This game is amazing. It is hilarious, it has an amazing art style... and the best of all! it can be hard as hell, especially on the first walkthrough. The game has amazing music and a really nice combo system forcing you to hit literally every botton on your gamepad, yes I recomend you use a gamepad if you wish to clock anywhere in the leaderboards for speed runs.I cannot say anything about the story or dialog because I don't care enough to read it. This game is right up there with Muramasa Demon sword. If you loved that game then you have to try this one.I can't say anything negative about the game because there just is nothing to hate. Although if you simply do not like the side scroller action  games in general then avoid this game. As you can see most of the negative reviews are mostly rage quitters or people who simply did not own a controller to play with. I cannot say anything about the co-op because I'm forever alone. (jk). This game is worth the try. 9/10 is you will love it. I loved it we shall all love it GOD DAMN IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT WITH GUACAMOLE!			"

Heck yes.The story is funny and if you enjoy the world of memes, and nods to other games you will love it. the controls are pretty nice, and the use of special abilities to alter your movement through the world adds some interesting puzzles.The one downside to this game, and I feel its a large oversight from the developers is the ""Real ending"" To achieve the proper ending you  need to collect ""5"" pieces of mask through challanges. *the sixth one is automatic* Now while this isn't so bad the level of difficulty on two of the challanges is insane and turn your hair white...or pull out the rest of it. So by the time I completed all the challanges I didn't care what the ""Real"" ending was. It wasn't worth it. Overall an amazing game. Well worth whatever deal you get it with.

												A surprisingly solid platformer. I love the visual style and the countless video game references are pretty funny. The biggest reason why this game is so enjoyable is its ability to mix platforming and combat together. While it is a bit too short story wise, it has a lot of secrets to discover, and the well designed levels are an encouragement to explore. If you want to get 100% with a good ending, get ready to suffer as some of the challenges, platform puzzles in particular, are ridiculously unforgiving. One of the challenges nearly drove me insane and I couldn't count how many times I failed. Nevertheless, very enjoyable metroid-style platformer.			"

												Hmm, where do I start? There's a whole lot to say. I've never been into platforming, but after completing this game, I've found out that I really like the platforming genre which means I'm going to end up buying more games like this in the future. Anyways, over to the review. Guacamelee is and has everything that all platformers should be/have. Drinkbox Studios have been able to mix the platforming itself, exploration and combat along with each other perfectly. A reason alone to buy this game if you're into platforming is all the funny and immature comments all the different npcs, placed in the world has to say. Besides, who doesn't want to run 'round in Mexico as the great Luchador, beating up silly enemies while listening to mariachi backgroundmusic. It's been tons of fun completing this game and if you're on the edge of buying Guacamelee; You sure have my recommendation.			"

If you like the genre, this one is definitely worth your time. It's recommended to use a controller, but it's fine with a keyboard as well. If the game feels hard, bring a friend.

Guacamelee is extremely fun and refreshing with funny dialogue and an abundance of easter eggs to other games. There is something about the cartoon graphics that makes this game look so well made and polished, while also making it beautiful to look at. My only major problem with this game is that if you're using the keyboard instead of an Xbox controller you can mix up the keys sometimes and actions can become confusing and sometimes frustrating. However, if you can get past that, this game is spectacular and deserves so much more credit than it has.8.5/10			"

												I get a strong Shantae vibe from Guacamelee; both games exist in a fantastic setting with an atypical occupation (Bellydancers in Shantae, and Luchadors in Guacamelee) and offer a constant stream of upgrades with corresponding puzzles. However, unlike Shantae, Guacamelee has a strong emphasis on combat, and the controls are completely tight.Guacamelee doesn't seem to be a particularly long or challenging game, but it is incredibly fun and well made. There are dozens of references to other video games, both classic and obscure, and this is clearly a game made with a love of the craft. I definitely recommend this game, especially if you catch it on sale.EDIT: I believe I spoke too soon as to the difficulty of this game. While the main quest may not pose much of a challenge, getting 100% complete requires split second combo reflexes the likes of fighting game professionals. If you are looking for a challenge, you will find one here.			"

The actual fighting with combos and special moves is enjoyable, and the gradual difficulty increase will not have you hitting a wall early in the game.That being said, as the game progresses there are points where you will have to pull off some tricky moves to make progress, but don't give up. They are easier than it seems at first and generally rewarding with frequent checkpoints, steady progress and achievements.			"

												This is easily one of the most engaging games I've seen on the market. Up front, the journey to 100% the game can be infuriating at times, but the casual playthrough is filled with interesting platforming, just enough mechanics to avoid being cumbersome or confusing, a striking art style and presentation, and a comedic style in the dialogue.The game never seems to drop mechanics it introduces. Many games will put a mechanic on display for one or two stages. Not so with Guacamelee! Throughout the game, the designers constantly throw both old and new at you. It even has things for the hardcore audience with a particular attention to speedrunning.Things I would have liked to see1. Tighter input reading: I felt like the game responded slightly late on my button presses at times, though this could be atttributed to my monitor not being top of the line in latency.2. Controller editting: It seems like a huge oversight in a game this polished for you to be unable to assign any controller button to any action.			"

The game can be a bit difficult in the later levels as timing is very important. The game has a good sense of humor and many cities to explore. From teleporting via talking olmec heads, to an emphasis on the day of the dead, roosters, and pinatas, I felt like a mexican luchador hero while playing. Adding the Steam Workshop is a nice bonus. All in all it was a 9/10 for me, and I dont usually play platformers.			"

												You probably have a good idea of what Guacamelee is by now. A Metroidvania with a Mexican Wrestler/Luchador theme, where the stamina-draining moves you learn are what unlock new areas. This is mainly done through colored blocks that require a specific skill in order to be broken. And that's the extent of the Metroidvania.It's simple enough and proves to be a lot of fun in the largest portion of the game.However, several things in the end come together to create a frustrating experience unless you're the sort of player who's perfectly accustomed to every trick in the brawler book. And in fact, die-hard brawler fans are the only people I would really recommend this game to, at least to completion.In the near-end game, you run into enemies and a few bosses that like to 'shield' themselves. A bubble fitting their shape that can only be broken by a specific stamina attack, which uses the same color coding as the aforementioned blocks. This actually starts out as a great idea as it throws around the way you think and need to approach a combat situation.But therein lies the first problem: The 'yellow' attack, being headbutt, requires you to stand still and press the B button (on the controller).However, it takes about half a second before the game apparently registers you standing still, meaning you're spamming B while nothing happens but you standing there.Obviously, in a high pace brawler, this means you are immediately punished for it by being attacked.This headbutt lag only becomes more frustrating when you are going up against bosses that constantly change their type of shield. So whenever headbutt is required, you can count on it that you are going to get punished for it. It requires a compensation the likes where you feel like you are compensating for a bug.Another technique that you must master in order to progress is the art of blocking. In the beginning, that's only required to jump through thorn vines. But eventually you will run into situations where the amount of melee and ranged enemies make it short of change of perspective to make it a bullet hell. Blocking is essential, period.And this is where another problem sets in. As someone trained by 'Witch time' in Bayonetta, I expect my blocking in a brawler to be instant. Many are the times where I had blocked a moment before being hit, yet it did not register. Frustrating.But the biggest issue are the 'gauntlets' you are forced to partake in. These are single rooms where you are shut in and are forced to beat all the enemies that spawn. Most of the time these are pretty fun, if not challenging. But every now and then you find a gauntlet that simply does not belong in the game. In one, you were forced to constantly pop the appearing timed 'balloons' because otherwise, upon exploding, you receive significant damage. In the middle is an obstruction that has a hazard on top. And the balloons constantly appear on opposite sides of the room, AND you have to deal with other spawning enemies. Meaning you not only have to run like mad at each timed balloon, but you need to dodge any other ranged attacks and then survive the other enemies.One other that I vividly remember is being forced to fight enemies that like to throw columns of light at you, and for some reason their AI likes to constantly throw these in sync where the distance between both columns is too great to overcome with one dodge/block, meaning you get hit regardless. But the biggest sinner is the gauntlet is the one where you have to kill a series of instakill exploding balloons with the moves they're obviously lined up for. But this brings another shortcoming: The special moves have a deceptively shorter range than they appear to have.But my biggest gripe with these gauntlets is that they are non-optional. You have to do them, no matter how ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they are. There's no going around them, meaning you have to suffer their punishment for as long as it takes for you to master whatever (usually pointless) lesson it wants to impart. Because I can guarantee you, most lessons you will take from these will not help in boss battles.Not to mention that the throwing-invincibility frames are deceptive as well, there's no telling in a split second when you are vulnerable at the end of your throw. Yet at the final boss, this is exactly whats required to know.All in all, the game likes to maximise the abuse out of your weakness, even when they are being forced on you by the game itself. It's unfair and harsh and maybe that's why it's not the sort of game for me. I can take difficult games, very difficult games. Games like Bayonetta (when going for Platinum), Super Meat Boy (A+'ing everything) and Ninja Gaiden (because, game) all are enjoyable for me because their responsiveness is perfect. Any mistake you make in those games are your fault alone. Failing because of an uncontrollable contender, however, makes for something very frustrating. Which is exactly the thing this game sins to.Storywise... it's cheesy. But what do you expect? The game itself likes throwing joke after joke at you, referencing many things that are Gaming related. It doesn't take itself too serious and neither should you. It's okay.But with me having a bunch of frustrations with this game, I can't get myself to collect the other hidden mask pieces for the 'Good' ending or even replay the game.Yes, I have to say the game is pretty good at what it's trying to do. Nowhere near the best, especially with me having so many irks around responsiveness. But if you can get over the gripes I have (or somehow manage to not experience them at all as a rare few do) then yeah... maybe you'll enjoy it. It won't be easy, even on Normal, so make sure you bring some alcohol to mellow you out. Because this game won't let you off the hook that easy.			"

Guacamelee is a well rounded game with challenging platforming and a satisfying combat system. The soundtrack, artwork, and in particular the animation are all pleasant and cohesive.Combat is intuitive and flowing, and Guacamelee does a good job of forcing you to use your full range of powers by the variety of enemies and their weaknesses. The abilities you acquire find use both in combat and in platforming/exploration, so you end up really looking forward to discovering the next powerup.The local co-op mode works well during the fighting sections; flinging a hapless enemy across the screen to your partner who then slams them into the ground doesn’t get old. Unfortunately, the co-op platforming is a mess. The sections that use the environment-shifting mechanic are great fun in single player, but in co-op it's impossible not to get in each others' way. On top of that, the camera essentially only follows one player, which means it is inevitably more efficient to just let one player attempt the jumps while the other player watches.Guacamelee’s smooth animations, upbeat soundtrack, colourful backgrounds and enjoyable Luchador theme all contribute to a polished feel. Other than the weak co-op I don’t have any major complaints. I wasn't blown away but I definitely enjoyed my time with it. Recommended for fans of metroidvania games, worth a look for everyone else.			"

												This game was so amazing! The jokes and puns scattered through out the game don't really seem forced and you get the feeling someone had a lot of fun making this game. The storyline isn't nearly long enough, I really would have loved play more and that is really my only complaint. The variety of moves allow for satisfying combo chains that aren't just given to you by mashing one button. All of of the moves you aquire are satifying and have multiple purposes and keep you exploring the enviorment. Some obstacles have multiple ways to be passed by combing move chain. Other times some of the puzzles and platform timing will have you wanted to snap your remote over your knee... but if it didn't you wouldn't feel like you accomplished anything. There isn't an intense and detailed leveling up system, but the progression and gains in power still feel substantial. The music is incredible and goes so well with every detail of the game. Honestly, can't reccomend this game enough.			"

												With no expectations at all, I was prepared for anything. And I was positively amazed. This game is a fireworks display of creative level design, challenging old-school platforming, classic beat-em-up (with a thight combo system), high pulse races against the clock, magnificent artwork, and a bunch humourous pop-culture references (especially funny if you know a little spanish and mexican culture). I recommend this game to anyone. Yes, anyone.			"

												A really cool platform adventure game. It is quite similar to the free game N in its gameplay and can be very addictive and really quite tough in places just like N. Has some similarity to the likes of Prince of Persia (1989) and Deadlight but has a much more advanced combat system and much more intricate puzzles making it really superior to those two. There's loads of side quests and ways to upgrade and change your character's abilities. Has a great story all the way through and superb presentation. I really recommend Guacamelee! highly.			"

												This game honestly surprised me. At first, it looks and feels just like any indie Metroidvania game. However, Guacamelee is actually extremely polished and the control scheme is one of the best I've ever seen (using an x360 controller). The game offers a ton of fun and unique mechanics, solid combat and all the usual maps to explore and bosses to fight, pretty much what you can expect from a solid platformer. all done with very cute graphics and a cheerful soundtrack. This gives Guacamelee a certain sense of lightheartedness, despite getting quite difficult at times. After the main storyline, there's still more to do; a hard mode that makes the combat a bit more challenging, and optional challenge rooms in the Infierno, which will put your platforming, creativity and reaction skills to the test.Definitely my game of the year.

												I uninstalled this game in disgust!, BUT I'd still recommend it.I uninstalled Guacamelee Gold! because the game became entirely about complicated wall jumping combined with phase transitions, and that just ceased to be fun for me after several progressions in challenge difficulty.  After looking ahead on YouTube to see how much more jumping I was in for, I got the feeling that, if I practiced enough, I probably could have eventually pulled the sequences off, but no thanks.  After one last time of getting near the end of a long jump sequence only to miss the last button, I sighed and uninstalled the game.  I'll own that, but I'll also put some blame on the controller mapping, which doesn't seem to be editable, at least with a 360 controller on the PC.I'd still recommend the game because it has a truly excellent sense of style: great art, great humor, great animation, etc.  For a few bucks I think that's worth it even if you don't get to the end.

												I fully recommend Guacamelee! it is  a good game, it is a metroid-esqe game. It is a 2d side scroller beat-em-up, it has a lot of exploration and there is some backtraking to places when you get new abilities. The combat is pretty basic at the start but once you gain more abilities the combat is very fun, it involves a lot of combo juggling, but mashing buttons works too albeit less efficient. The platforming in the game is pretty decent and fairly managable, however many of the optional areas can have really hard platforming puzzles, but these are optional. The setting is very vibrate and has a lot of sense of humor, the game is littered with indie game cameos and references. Guacamelee! is an execellent game filled with exploration, combat and platforming. I recommended purchase.			"

												Hey, hombre, you're probably looking at this game wondering if it's worth your hard-earned pesos.  Why else would you be reading a review from a perfect stranger?  'Cause if I know you, I've probably already told you to pick this game up.  And if you haven't already done so, why not, Ryan??However, for a short time (as this is being written), the game is just under $4.  There is absolutely NO reason to pass up this game at that price.  Hell, even at the full $15 it's worth the ride.What you get is a beautifully-animated luchador-flavored Metroid romp in a massively sprawling world that was so good, they made it TWICE!  That's right.  Twice.  That means two times, you idiot.  You know how like in Symphony of the Night they flipped the castle upside down and you went through it all over again?  Well, it's kind of like that except the other version of the map is the DEATH MIRROR world that you can flip between in REAL TIME... after you unlock the ability, of course.  You are, after all, only a lowly masked luchador brawler to begin with, but as with all Metroid-style games, the more you play, the more powerful you become.Not convinced?  How about you can play this game co-op with a friend?  No?  How about you can buy costumes for both characters that change the way you play the game?  Still no?  How about the game has amazingly realized mariachi-style music throughout the entire journey?  Not yet?  How about there is a MASSIVE screen-filling boss in the first third of the game that will scare the bejeezus out of you??  How about brain-teasing platform puzzles coupled with an insanely deep, yet simple-to-execute combo system???!  IS THERE ANY WAY TO PLEASE YOU?!?!  MUST THE GAME BE MADE IN UNREAL ENGINE FOR YOU TO BE SATISFIED?!?!Listen, let's talk writing, then.  Are we going to talk writing or are you going to break my balls?  Good.  The writing is fantastically whimsical and funny.  Some of it is very cheesy, but it's always intentionally so.  The story is all about standard heroics - your lady friend has been kidnapped and you're out to save her.  But there's other things going on as well, in the background.  You'll meet the bosses long before you have to fight them and learn about them.  You'll find out that the main baddy, who is like Manny Calavera dressed as one of the Three Amigos, is only the main baddy because [MINOR SPOILER] he told the devil that he didn't have a job anymore.  What are you going to do about it, hombre?  Nothing?  Nothing?!?!  Aw, man, you're breakin' my balls here, you're breakin' my balls.Look, do yourself a favor and get this game.  If the obvious references to Metroid aren't enough to convince you, maybe the endless meme-posters and indie-game tributes, hidden easter eggs, and odd obsession with chickens might be able to convince you.  And if you're still not convinced, then I suppose you can go back to your cookie-cutter AAA games that you've played a million times over.  Try something new, muchacho.Seriously, you're breakin' my balls.			"

												This game has great charm, a fun combat system and is just the right length, about 3-4 hours. The game also does a great job balancing challenging platform sequences with fun combat sequences ; the nice thing is that the same moves you use in combat are the ones you use for movement as you traverse the platforming stages. I highly recommend this game, especially at 75% off, like I got it during the Holiday Sale!			"

												So, I finally took the time to give my opinion about this game in more than just a like.Guacamelee definetely was one of the best games I was able to experience in the last two years, it´s artstyle is just one of the things that keep me thinking exactly that. The artstyle gives room for a lot of different and wonderful colours and creative charcters and definetely fits the crazy topic very well. It also allows the game to have a fast and smooth gameplay and keeps you interested all the way. As it has been said previously, the gameplay certainly does its job more than just good and allows a quick fighting and (for the most part) good platforming. The special moves that you learn through the game are all useable in both aspects and are shown especially awesome within the fighting of the game as they provide different combos and awesome ways of torturing your enemy. In the platforming most of the moves are placed very good, though there could have been better ways to include some of them even better.The soundtrack of the game beautifully underlines every single place you´re in, wether it would be the human world or the world of the dead. It makes use of many mexican styles and can even be quite complex at times, giving every instrument a wonderful job to get you even deeper into the game.The last part to discuss would be the story, and as there is of course not much of it due to the game´s genre being an action platformer, it is certainly supported by a lot of good humor and sympathetic characters and forms a nice setting for the game as a whole. In addition there are a lot of little references to other games that you are able to find in the game which do cary a great humor too. To sum it all up, I really liked this game a lot, it always kept me excited and had something that I was interested in. It has a very good and smooth gameplay which never gets too slow or boring, given by the feedback you get.So, long opinion, short message: Buy the game!!!			"

												Well, one thing this game has in spades is style. It's a very well done game. Unfortunately, it's a console game. And with that comes, you guessed it, awful controls. First thing you have to do is remap your keyboard, because the default layout will make your fingers bleed. I am assuming, of course, that you don't own an XBox controller (otherwise you're better off playing it on your XBox). My Thrustmaster didn't get detected by the game, so I had to suffer through half of it with a keyboard until I gave up.The initial impression was great, I instantly fell in love with the characters. I liked the puzzles and the fighting mechanic. The game progresses at a steady pace, gradually ramping the difficulty up.But at some point (when you get to a certain tree level) it switches from a fighting/adventure hybrid to a straight platformer, and that's when it broke me. The platforming parts become so difficult, that getting through them on a keyboard felt like hitting my head against the wall.Do I recommend it? Absolutely, at a bargain price it's a great game to have and to play in coop with a friend. WIll I be playing it ever again on Steam? Absolutely not.			"

												Well, I have no complaints with this game.This game is a metroidvania, with a simple but good combat system and a lot of plataforming. Maybe too much platforming for some people, but I don't have problems with that.Like in other metroidvania games, you adquire different powers to advance. The great thing is that those powers are wrestling moves. You even use them for platforming.The game as a mexican theme, at takes all the good things about it.The music is great.It took me 7 hours to beat it. There's a bad and good ending. I took the good ones but I saw on the internet where to get what you have to get for it. I didn't get the 100% of the items, neither beat the Inferno's challenges, so you can take more hours from it. Anyway it has the correct length, on sale is totally worth it.Maybe you want to buy the Super Turbo Championship edition, but I don't really know if it's worth it.			"

												Bottom Line :A platformer with lots of personality, a warming aesthetic, and ""deep-enough"" combat mechanics that make it an absolute joy to play from start to finish.This one was completely overlooked when it was first released and just finding it now seems like an injustice unto itself. There is so much character within this game, from the enviornments, the creatures, the artstyle, everything seems to be birthed from a powerful imagination that knew exactly what it wanted to be in the end. The store description ""a Metroid-vania style action-platformer"" is absolutely spot on as you will find yourself coming back to completed areas to utilize new abilities you have learned to access new locals and secrets. It feels very rewarding but, also demonstrates and inherent skill in level design. The combat too is very easy to get into but, surprisingly deep for what it is; I found some combonation attacks to require a fair amount of skill to pull off, should you ever choose to dig beneath the surface of the basic attacks. If you enjoy platformers, buy it.If you were ever a huge fan of Super Metroid for the SNES and want to break more Chozo statues, buy it.If not, wait till it goes on sale, then buy it.			"

It also allows the game to have a fast and smooth gameplay and keeps you interested all the way. As it has been said previously, the gameplay certainly does its job more than just good and allows a quick fighting and (for the most part) good platforming. The special moves that you learn through the game are all useable in both aspects and are shown especially awesome within the fighting of the game as they provide different combos and awesome ways of torturing your enemy. In the platforming most of the moves are placed very good, though there could have been better ways to include some of them even better.The soundtrack of the game beautifully underlines every single place you´re in, wether it would be the human world or the world of the dead. It makes use of many mexican styles and can even be quite complex at times, giving every instrument a wonderful job to get you even deeper into the game.The last part to discuss would be the story, and as there is of course not much of it due to the game´s genre being an action platformer, it is certainly supported by a lot of good humor and sympathetic characters and forms a nice setting for the game as a whole. In addition there are a lot of little references to other games that you are able to find in the game which do cary a great humor too. To sum it all up, I really liked this game a lot, it always kept me excited and had something that I was interested in. It has a very good and smooth gameplay which never gets too slow or boring, given by the feedback you get.So, long opinion, short message: Buy the game!!!			"

												A very good Metroidvania Brawler Platform Game that's also pretty challenging.PROS-Open World to Explore-2 Playable Characters-Local Co-Op-Challenging Platform Puzzles-Fun Brawling Combat-Great SoundtrackCONS-Backtracking-Some High Difficulty Segments -No Online Co-OpGAMEPLAYThe game plays like a usual platform game with brawling style combat that works very well.  You unlock special moves like you would any other Metroidvania style game & you will use those new moves to solve more puzzles & reach areas that you couldn't previously.  If you ever wondered what a Metroid game would play like with melee combat well then this is the game for you!OVERALLThe game is fairly short but all of it is enjoyable.  The fights are fun & can get pretty tough later on.  Same for the platform segments.  The only complaint I have is in order to get the best ending you gotta do these insanely hard challenges that take a while.  I managed to do them all & the satisfaction from beating them was pretty sweet.  The ending is worth it.Also, if you don't own or ever played this game you're better off getting the new Turbo Championship Edition.  It is essentially the same game with extra features & more content.			"

												I fully recommend Guacamelee! it is  a good game, it is a metroid-esqe game. It is a 2d side scroller beat-em-up, it has a lot of exploration and there is some backtraking to places when you get new abilities. The combat is pretty basic at the start but once you gain more abilities the combat is very fun, it involves a lot of combo juggling, but mashing buttons works too albeit less efficient. The platforming in the game is pretty decent and fairly managable, however many of the optional areas can have really hard platforming puzzles, but these are optional. The setting is very vibrate and has a lot of sense of humor, the game is littered with indie game cameos and references. Guacamelee! is an execellent game filled with exploration, combat and platforming. I recommended purchase.			"

												This game is a solid action platformer. I love the mexican art style it actually reminds me of samurai jack crossed with mucha lucha. It's bright and colorful, and the writing is pretty funny too. The combat is simple but fun, and throwing enemies always feels satisfying. I will say that this is a legitimately hard game, and that is mostly due to the platforming. There is a light world/ dark world mechanic and depending which world you are in some of the platforms will not be solid. What the game does is alternate between light world and dark world platforms, meaning taht you have to jump, then switch worlds in time in order to land on the next platform. If you fail it usually brings you back to the beggining. So the game pushes you out of your comfort zone in order to advance and starts you back at the beginning if you fail. However this game never rushes you and encourages you to take your time to master each area. Also this game is by no means short. There are plenty of secrets and the game encourages back tracking as you unlock special abilities that let you access previously innaccessible areas. This game also comes with 2 player drop in/ drop out co-op so you can bring a friend. Just make sure to bring a controller though.I highly reccommend this game with a 8/10, great game.			"

												I actually completed this on Vita, not Steam but... it's the first Platinum I'd ever obtained!  Silly achievements generally mean nothing to me, but I enjoyed this game so much that I immediately started a new game on hard difficulty after completing it just so I could continue playing.  I'd never have thought that a Metroid-style game that focused on melee and throws would become one of my favorite games of the year... silly me for doubting.  While some of the internet memes get kind of old (though Casa Crashes did crack me up at first), everything else about this game has a flavor of its own that never makes me tired to pick up and play some more.  The platforming can get challenging, especially for the secret orbs, the combat is fluid with responsive controls (especially important in harder difficulties where you can die in a couple hits), and the skill progression works well with the expanding world.  In fact, I feel like this is one of the best ""Metroid"" style games I've played in years.  One of the things I love about Guacamelee compared to other Metroid-likes (i.e. Dust) is that the path-opening skills also serve double duty as combat skills, unlike boring double jumps or keys that unlock doors.  They threw in some ideas from the DMC series by requiring you to use different skills to defeat tougher enemies, and the boss fights were unique and proved as a good ""exam"" for everything you'd learned up to that point.  I loved the story and music too, as unobtrusive as they were.  I'll probably double dip on Steam once this hits 75%, as I'd already purchased it at full price on Vita.  There I said it, a game that was so good I paid full price... and had no buyer's remorse!!!  (hands over my CAG badge)			"

The story is funny and there are many eastereggs and various things to collect (old platformer style). Beware though: the game is VERY hard sometimes, I mean if you try to finish it on hard mode with 100%! All in all yes, I do recommend.			"

												That's right fools! It's my first review.Guacamelee feels like a mix-tape of ""best-of"" 2d side scrollers. It's one part hardcore platformer, one part open metroidvania, and one part action game. The parts make greater whole, which a fantastic game. Levels are interesting. The jumps are great. And the combat is emmaculate and meaty. One of the best combat engine to be found in a 2d game.The music and visuals are most definatley a highlight. While most video-games go for a try-hard ""epic"" score or bad butt rock, Guacamelee draws on a unique source of inspiration (traditonal Mexican music) and fuses it with a very classic video game sound for a soundtrack unlike anything else. The Mexican inspiration  also carries over the visuals. The results is very aesthetically excellecent complient to the some great mechanics. The humor and reference are hit-or-miss. The video games tend to be charming as hell, while the meme ones are cringe-worth, in my opinion. With that said, Guacamelee is excellent game in nearly all regards. It the type of game that's not afraid to have some fun. If you like 2-d action games at all, buy it. You won't regret it.			"

												This is a tight, well-tuned metroidvania with spectacle fighter beat-em'-up combat. The combat scales from the trivial to the relentless: - Some attacks can be dodged, others cannot. - Enemies can be shielded with barriers that make them invulnerable until one of four specific attacks is used against them, or until they are pummeled with several attacks quickly. - Enemies can be in either the land of the dead or the land of the living. They can attack you from either but you can only attack them if you're in the same world as them.But you have several tools to outmaneuver them: - Daze your enemies and then smash them around with wrestling throws to use them as projectiles or area-stun effects. - Four distinct special attacks that launch you or your enemies in different directions. - Turn in to a chicken and peck the bejebus out of your enemies to rack up higher combos. - Freely phase between the living world and the land of the dead. - Dodge through enemy attacks to rack your combos higher and negate damage. - Lock enemies in aerial combos for a moment's respite from the earth. - Unlock outfits with special powers.If the game was only a beat-em'-up it would still be nearly worth the price of admission - but the various combat tools you attain are also the methods by which you unlock additional areas to traverse. The game strongly rewards exploration with both practical benefits (more life and more whuppin' fuel) and significant soft benefits (a better ending than the default for finding five main secrets).All of this is backed by a crisp sense of humor, good writing, and a consistent mythology based in incan myth and mexican folklore. Critically, the controls are very tight - at least with an XBox 360 controller, which I had - which allows you to play with confidence that it won't glitch you out. If you have interest in metroidvania's or spectacle fighters, Guacamelee is well worth your time.			"

AUDIOPeppyVISUALAuthenticDIFFICULTYToughVIBEBeat-Em-UpCRAVINGMetroidvaniaON SALEFrequentlyPROS: The art and color in this game are gorgeous. A lot of love has been put into it, as well as research into a culture that could have otherwise been summarized sloppily. The gameplay is satisfying as hell, and the metroidvania aspects will keep satisfied in the world for quite a while. You can have a local second player to help you if you're having too much trouble with enemy waves!CONS: Creators voiced that the ""memes in this game may have gone too far"" and their suspicions were correct. Some of them are cute video game-oriented homages, but others are nauseating Reddit vector and ICHCB trash that date a game that is gorgeous otherwise. WORTH: There isn't much of a point of buying this version when you could get the Super Turbo-charged Championship edition. Still, it sees frequent sales up to 90% off. If you're looking for the best deal on Guacamelee regardless of updates and extra features, keep an eye on both this copy and Champ Edition!OVERALL: You may want to go with the Super Turbo-charged Championship edition to receive support. Why is there no price difference if this one is completely unsupported? That being said, this is an amazing game that I've had a lot of fun with.SCORE: 9/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

												Guacamelee is another one of those action platformers set in quirky colorful world with an over the top story and a silly sense of humor. If you are like me and you are sick and tired of this genre I sincerely recommend you to try out Guacamelee.At the first glance Guacamelee really seams just like any other game from this genre. What saves it from the awful fate of mediocrity is it's gameplay. While most games concentrate on one or two unique mechanics, in Guacamelee you have a wide variety of special moves that are use both for combat and traversing the environment, and sometimes for both tings at once. Which is cool, but isn't the thing that made me love this game. The awesome bit is that while the platforming is simple at first and requires you to use only one or two special abilities at once, later on you'll need to be able to preform very complex  combinations of you abilities. The satisfaction of pulling off some of the more challenging platforming segments is wonderful. And the same goes for combat. The only thing I didn't like about it is the pace at which you acquire new abilities. It's slow. I didn't notice the first time I played trough the game, but on my second run on hard mode in the beginning of the game I felt handicapped. Another thing I noticed only ind hard mode is that the boss hit boxes aren't all that grate. Every now and again fighting a boss I got hit by it's attack when the animation of that attack had already played out. If the game had been more combat oriented this had really been a big problem for me, but since I only noticed it a couple times on hard mode it's only a minor annoyance. And wile the games artstyle doesn't  set it apart from all the other indie games, you can't deny that it looks quite nice. Simplified blocky shapes and the bold color pallet works well together. Wen it comes to the visual part of the game I only have tow criticisms. First - I have no idea why would anyone think that it's necessary to have a thick black line always present on the top of the screen. There definitely  has to be an more ascetically pleasing way to make the health and stamina meter always visible. Also there is no reason to have pause button prompt always be displayed at the top of the screen. Second - every now and again there ware situations when the color of a particular enemy matched the backgrounds color which made identifying their attacks difficult at times. And wile for the most of the game it's a non issue since health enemies aren't that strong and give a lot of health orbs once killed, if you are fighting a boss on hard mode where it can kill you in 5 or 6 hits it's a bit annoying not to be able to see it.When it comes to the games story I really can't tell you anything. I read just the first four or five dialogs, realized that I absolutely didn't care and stopped reading. I really hope that there will come a day when indie devs will realize that many people don't care about the story in a game like this and will start to put in options that allow to skip story at faster pace. Because in Guacamelee you have to press a button for every line a characters says. It takes ages to click trough some of the more lengthier dialogs. And it absolutely enrages me when there is a conversation before a boss fight that is repeated every time that you try to defeat the boss. STOP THAT! No one wants to click trough that♥♥♥♥♥♥again and again. Good thing this game only has four instances of this. All in all it's a surprisingly competent action platformer. It may lack the design elegance of games like Super Meat Boy, but it's grate no the less.			"

												This is a lovely game. The graphics are really nice and give a really nice feel to the environment, and it has a great contrast between the two ""worlds"" available, and the various levels within them.The story is a good one, it doesn't go into too much incredible detail (short cutscenes and dialog).Combat mechanics are good, with a wide variety of combos for your moves, and movement makes good use of the dynamic environment, in both ""worlds"".Tried with keyboard, and it works great. Some of the move combos might be easier with a controller, I imagine, but the keys can be remapped however you want.The music soundtrack has a great mexican feel to fit the game.Well worth a buy.

												Guacamelee is another one of those action platformers set in quirky colorful world with an over the top story and a silly sense of humor. If you are like me and you are sick and tired of this genre I sincerely recommend you to try out Guacamelee.At the first glance Guacamelee really seams just like any other game from this genre. What saves it from the awful fate of mediocrity is it's gameplay. While most games concentrate on one or two unique mechanics, in Guacamelee you have a wide variety of special moves that are use both for combat and traversing the environment, and sometimes for both tings at once. Which is cool, but isn't the thing that made me love this game. The awesome bit is that while the platforming is simple at first and requires you to use only one or two special abilities at once, later on you'll need to be able to preform very complex  combinations of you abilities. The satisfaction of pulling off some of the more challenging platforming segments is wonderful. And the same goes for combat. The only thing I didn't like about it is the pace at which you acquire new abilities. It's slow. I didn't notice the first time I played trough the game, but on my second run on hard mode in the beginning of the game I felt handicapped. Another thing I noticed only ind hard mode is that the boss hit boxes aren't all that grate. Every now and again fighting a boss I got hit by it's attack when the animation of that attack had already played out. If the game had been more combat oriented this had really been a big problem for me, but since I only noticed it a couple times on hard mode it's only a minor annoyance. And wile the games artstyle doesn't  set it apart from all the other indie games, you can't deny that it looks quite nice. Simplified blocky shapes and the bold color pallet works well together. Wen it comes to the visual part of the game I only have tow criticisms. First - I have no idea why would anyone think that it's necessary to have a thick black line always present on the top of the screen. There definitely  has to be an more ascetically pleasing way to make the health and stamina meter always visible. Also there is no reason to have pause button prompt always be displayed at the top of the screen. Second - every now and again there ware situations when the color of a particular enemy matched the backgrounds color which made identifying their attacks difficult at times. And wile for the most of the game it's a non issue since health enemies aren't that strong and give a lot of health orbs once killed, if you are fighting a boss on hard mode where it can kill you in 5 or 6 hits it's a bit annoying not to be able to see it.When it comes to the games story I really can't tell you anything. I read just the first four or five dialogs, realized that I absolutely didn't care and stopped reading. I really hope that there will come a day when indie devs will realize that many people don't care about the story in a game like this and will start to put in options that allow to skip story at faster pace. Because in Guacamelee you have to press a button for every line a characters says. It takes ages to click trough some of the more lengthier dialogs. And it absolutely enrages me when there is a conversation before a boss fight that is repeated every time that you try to defeat the boss. STOP THAT! No one wants to click trough that♥♥♥♥♥♥again and again. Good thing this game only has four instances of this. All in all it's a surprisingly competent action platformer. It may lack the design elegance of games like Super Meat Boy, but it's grate no the less.			"

												All together this is a great game, the music is great, the combat is great, the visuals are great and the bosses are great (Can you see a pattern). I played this game using a keyboard and found that some parts were pretty difficult and the last two boss battles were super hard, this game pretty much requires you to play using a controller unless you want to try the same puzzle over and over again. But overall this is worth ever dollar.			"

												Great Game! Truly. Its great fun and super addictive. The story is: cool, funny and entertaining to say the least! True it can be very frustrating at times when you can't get past an area, but if you keep trying you are guaranteed to eventually get past it! It also has some truly great easter eggs and funny references. There is even a Minecraft reference in there. Most people will tell you that you Need to play it with a controller, this is not true! It is easier with a controller but playing it on the keyboard is just as good. Brilliant game an absolute must have! Also I just want to mention this game just holds up and will as time goes on. In 10 years this game will be a classic no doubt!			"

												Well executed combination of two awesome classic genres - side scrolling fighter and platformer. The linux version is really good compared to what other developers have to offer (looking at you ronimo!).The game is hard enough to be interesting while not being annoying. Battles in normal mode are a little boring, except maybe few boss fights at the end. Dialogues and characters are well written, but the story isn't taking to much time - and that's great, reading is for wusses.TL;DR one of the best platformer ever, will entertain you for ~6 hours minimum. Plenty more if you want to hunt achivements, gold medals and try hard mode.			"

												STORYSo you play as your typical Joe (or should I say Juan?) who lives in his house on the desert near a Pueblucho, so forth you get called for help on the church and stay for a fiesta, but everything goes wrong and an evil dead lord called Carlos Calaca comes from the underworld to take the princ... governor´s daughter as a sacrifice. You get to know a lot of quirky characters along the way and transform into a LUCHADOR gaining abilities throughout the game and unlocking new costumes.PRESENTATIONThe game haves a very stylised look, very sharp and cartoony, which goes great with the Mexican theming, also is simplistic and runs at a great 60fps at all times with no delays or slowdown even if the screen is filled with enemies and enemy bits, also the game haves a great amount of references to other games ranging from indie titles to well known titles such as Zelda and Metroid.GAMEPLAYThe game haves a really tight combat system wich lets you do huge combos, with few enemies but they get different mechanics and presented so differently throughout the game so the game feels always fresh unless you have to backtrack, also there are miniquests and hidden items for you to discover making the replay value go even higher.CONCLUSIONProbably one of the best games out there, quiet a great experience and saticfying, leaving you wanting for more at the end.Cons-Cheap Last Boss Battle-6 hours long to beat the main gamePros+Tight game+Intuitive design+Overall great game8/10 GO BUY IT NOW			"

												My favourite genre is probably the Metroid-vania type of games. Mostly because they have just the right amount of combat, action oriented gameplay, and then also some necessary exploration! Seeing Guacamelee, it interested me greatly, both because of its genre, and also because it ""draws from Mexican culture"". Why make it all up when we have cultures full of interesting folklore already? So, I was pumped. And I now stand really impressed. This game blew all of my expectations out of the window, and here's why.First off, the presentation. The game looks gorgeous and unique. Enemy and character design overall was very detailed, and it looks really great. Everything else isn't anything to sneeze at either, it looks pretty good overall, although the characters were what stood up for me. Some parts of it can look to same-y, but it has a bunch of different areas to keep things interesting.The music wasn't something that I'd listen to out of the game, or is stuck in my head. But it fits the setting really well. and makes the experience more atmospheric. Another note on the presentation: there are tons of stylized references to multiple videogames, specially in the form of posters in town. Those are all ""revamped"" to fit the setting, but anyone can see who/what they're referencing. And the most important thing: those weren't just references because ""it's cool"". One can clearly see that they've seen what made those games great, and they've managed to put most of those aspects in their own game. More on that later.So, gameplay. In Guacamelee, you have a lot of combat and platforming, and they both behave very closely to one another, because the special moves you use in combat, you'll also need to platforming, be it to reach an higher platform, to stand in place until a platform moves, etc. And platforming scales really well, starting out pretty easy, and getting more and more difficult as you progress. The same with the combat, and here's my biggest complaint: the game was way too easy. The harder parts were actually ""optional"" as part of secrets, and exploration. I'll explain it in more detail further.As you progress the game, you gain several abilities (by breaking Metroid-like statues) and those will help you in both combat and platforming. Combat was surprisingly good, as the player could pull some really long combos, and it wasn't too hard to make. And the combat never felt like a button-masher, and dodging is also an essential part of it.The Boss Fights were also impressing. Each Boss has several phases with different pattern that the player should memorize. Unfortunately, once more, they were way too easy and didn't provide much of a challenge, despite the fight being enjoyable in itself. Also, the last Boss fight had a weird hitbox that messed it up a little bit. Nothing game breaking though, it just felt weird.To keep going forward, besides unlocking new abilities, the player should also explore to find Money (to buy Costumes for different playstyles), Health and Stamina (what is used for special abilities) around the world. These are the sections that usually provide the biggest challenge in terms of platforming, and they were really enjoyable!These require the best use of all the abilities the player had learned up to that point. And this is what mesmerized me: this game does a lot of things right! Platforming, Combat, Exploration, the World, and I could go on. They've taken some of the best aspects of previous game and made it their own, and they've done an amazing job here!They've taken a similar respawning system as in Super Meat Boy for the hardest platforming sections, and a Metroid-like transformation to reach tighter places, just for two very obvious examples. The point is, the references are there not just as a nice poster, but also deep in the mechanics of the game, and I'll applaud the developers for that. Great job!On the exploration side, there are also some mysterious ""Orbs"" that are very well hidden, and present the most hardcore platforming in the game. Nothing is told to the player about what they're in the game for, and it made me go all in to find them. Some of these challenges could get somewhat frustrating, but it's good that they're there! Some challenge, at long last! Well, unfortunately, I only went to find them after I had 100% each zone, and the reward wasn't very useful to me. So, I won't spoil it, but you should try to find all of them right away. The last one you can only obtain after defeating the last Boss. All in all, they were worth it.The DLC provides 17 challenges that are also very enjoyable, ranging from combat to platforming and rancing. They were all well done and provide additional challenge and add new suits with different attributes which is always nice to keep things fresh!So, overall, I really enjoyed all of my time spent with the game, and have found explored 100% of the game's areas, and it was all worth it. The sidequests all had character to it and were pretty amusing, adding a bit to the world and setting of the game. It did more things right than it had the right too, which was impressive! Sometimes, it felt too ambitious with it, but those feeling were far minor compared with the positive aspects of it.Now, I'll get on with the bad parts.The first one is one I don't understand, and almost despise. They've decided not to include Hard Mode until the player finished the game. And there was no NewGame+ option. What the hell? Why? Seeing as the developers went deep into many games to see what they did and didn't do right, how did they reach this conclusion?Normal Mode was by far too easy! I barely felt challenged at any point, and it highly detracted from the experience, specially after seeing ""You've unlock Hard Mode!""... It's not very enjoyable repeting the whole game, specially from the 0! If there were a NG+, I might've done it, because I still needed to unlock some Suits and Explore part of the world. But having to do everything all over again just harded didn't really feel very nice... So, I've done almost everything to do in the game, with the exception of playing the game in Hard Mode. A game that I've found too easy... I don't understand this decision, honestly. I just hoped the developers realize this mistake and don't make it in future games, because I sure look forward to them now! If I'm the one missing something with this, feel free to reply and tell me, but I really hate to have to repeat the whole thing to play the game as it was intended.Another thing, is the fact that the exploration isn't all that rewarding, since the player doesn't really need to upgrade to beat the game. And, specially after the end of it, exploration was mostly there for the achievements (except for the SideQuests, which were genuinely amusing, and some optional secrets along the way).I'd also like to make 2 constructive critics.One of them is about the Map System. It was pretty good, letting the player know where previously encountered coloured blocks were in the map (these were areas blocked until the player gained X ability), but some areas were not as direct or evident and easy to see by looking at the map. As such, a nice addition would be a sort of ""Note"" system in which the player could right Notes and a certain point in the map for further reference.Another one, is about certain achievements. There were some for beating the Bosses or Arenas on certain conditions. These made the fights harder, and more interesting, which is a plus! But there was no way of knowing about them without browsing the achievements. many players probably missed enjoyable content because of that. So, a cool addition would be to add a Tab for Optional Objectives so that the player always knows what can be done.Well, that's all from me. I loved this game and I certainly recommend it to everyone who likes the genre! Cheers!			"

												Comedy, Drama, memes, and Luchadors! WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT!! Oh okay, Guacamelee is a platformer, beat 'em up, set in Mexico on the Dia de Los Meuotos, you play as Juan, a lowly agave farmer who dies, so you get sent to the world of the dead, and that's where the game picks up, on you're journey you'll be beating a lot of bad guys, and trying to platform, yes I said trying, the platforming can be a bit frustrating, but that's neither here nor there. The art style is beautiful, the music makes me want nachos, and it's got a lot of tougne and cheek refrences to memes, and pop culture. Did I mention co-op? Yes if you have an extra controller you're buddy can drop in an out anytime during the game, which more games need. If you're still reading this why haven't you bought it yet?? Seriously it's great, great replayability, and I promise that you will chuckle at least once in this game			"

												This game is actually a top notch platformer, which may not be apparent from the screenshots and video alone. The well thought out level design and game mechanics will push your thumbs to the limit and make you feel like playing Twister on your gamepad. The game is very well paced, and in combination with an original aesthetics and humor, kept me glued to the controller for hours on end.If you're into games like the Megaman series, don't think twice about this one!

It was pretty good, letting the player know where previously encountered coloured blocks were in the map (these were areas blocked until the player gained X ability), but some areas were not as direct or evident and easy to see by looking at the map. As such, a nice addition would be a sort of ""Note"" system in which the player could right Notes and a certain point in the map for further reference.Another one, is about certain achievements. There were some for beating the Bosses or Arenas on certain conditions. These made the fights harder, and more interesting, which is a plus! But there was no way of knowing about them without browsing the achievements. many players probably missed enjoyable content because of that. So, a cool addition would be to add a Tab for Optional Objectives so that the player always knows what can be done.Well, that's all from me. I loved this game and I certainly recommend it to everyone who likes the genre! Cheers!			"

												Great art style and fighting mechanics. Some of the platforming is insane, but not impossible. Can't say I didn't scream in frustration a few times, but with some practice I got through to the end. Well worth it.			"

												Guacamelee is a really great 2d platform game and if interested in these types of games its deffently recommendable. The graphics are alot of fun and stylistic very fitting as you play as a luchador, a mexican wrestler trying to save El Presidente's daughter from the evil calaca. Just as the visuals the soundtrack is also great and fits the game very well. I have played alot of platform games back in the day on amiga so i would say im pretty good at them but this game is deffently not an easy one some of the parts are actually pretty difficult until you understands the mechanics well enough. I havent completed this one yet after 4 hours of play but i'll deffently play this one to the end but im sure it will be done over time as some of the stuff quickly drives me crazy. From what ive played yet i will give the game 8.5/10			"

												What can I say about this game that has not already been stated in other reviews? Let me start by saying this started out as an extremely fun platformer. It has a great art style and the music is great for this style of platformer. The game mechanics involve turning into a chicken (yes, that's right) and bouncing between the Land of the Living and the Land of the Dead while trying to wall jump and not fall. The problem is the game gets entirely way too difficult way too soon. I found myself screaming at my keyboard at moments. I can't remember the last time I felt so infuriated by the dificulty of a game. Don't get me wrong once you get past certain annoying parts this game has the bones to be one of the best platformers this year. My only advice to those who decide to play this game is to bring anti-anxiety medication along for the FUN but extremely DIFFICULT game. All the best!!			"

Ideas are great in the first 80% of the game, but at the end it turns into an absolute cluster♥♥♥♥. The developers basically thrown everything in the game into the end and it was just not fun when trying to finish it. But it still gets an OK from me.7/10			"

100% complete and I still want more!Guacamelee! is just too much fun. The combat is fluid and fun with tight controls. Platforming is kept fresh throughout the game with steady introductions of new techniques. Its story is well written with a good sense of humor and enjoyable Mexican setting. Quite simply, it's everything I'd want in a Metroidvania style game. Combos, special moves (one of which is hilariously named Dashing Derpderp), double jumps, dodges, throws and grapples kept me engaged with the combat the entire way through. New moves are unlocked at such a pace that I never felt overwhelmed with too many options, nor bored with too few. Many of the new abilities also double as platforming tools. So just as you gain a wider range of battle skills, the platforming sections also evolve to require their use. There is a lot of great level design featured in Guacamelee! complete with plenty of enticing hidden treasures. Even as a backseat element, the story shines with likeable characters and heavy doses of comedy. In particular, I enjoyed seeing some of the villains fleshed out enough to know a little of their backstory and how they came to follow Calaca (the primary antagonist). Guacamelee!'s soundtrack does a fair job of matching the setting and action but never hooked me enough to look into buying it. There is a nice atmospheric shift in the music as you swap between the world of the living and the dead. I think a person with very little familiarity with Mexican culture and the Spanish language will have no problems having a blast with this game. That being said, this is one case where I'm glad I took 2 years of Spanish in High School as I think it helped me understand or see the humor in a few situations. I only have a few complaints with the game. The first is its native controller support, or lack thereof. From what I can tell only Xbox controllers will work automatically. I use a PS2 controller hooked up with a USB adaptor. This is the first game I've ever played where I had to use the external program x360ce (found online) to emulate an Xbox360 controller. Most games either work automatically or I can simply go to the in-game control options and set it up that way. Neither of those worked with Guacamelee! which is really unfortunate for a game that was designed for a controller. Secondly, while I hesitate to call this a complaint, the platforming can be really hard at times. Whether that bothers you or not is entirely subjective. By and large I found the challenge to be gratifying except for just a couple of frustrating sections. And finally, in a lot of ways calling a game too short can be both a critique and a compliment. For me Guacamelee! clocked in at 12 hours to achieve 100% completion on a normal difficulty playthrough. For an inexpensive indie game that's actually pretty good but as this review's title said: I still want more!			"

												Guacamelee is a 2D high-flying combo action and platforming game. The overall theme, music, and graphics are all blended together to make this game a very memorable and fun experience. Some levels or areas can be a bit frustrating as you will need to have precision control and some puzzles can be very tricky, just check out a walk-through or a video to get you passed these areas. There's a ton of content with unique achievements, challenges, hidden goodies, collectibles and costumes to unlock. The game also has a two-player option for local co-op bashing!			"

												9/10 An inovative Jump'n Run game with a beautiful and funny atmosphere. The complex Movement and Fighting- control is introduced step by step, and after a while of playing you find yourself handle the complex control with easyness. (Controller recommended)A nice Open World Jump' n Run full of jokes, hidden chests and of course a bunch of little sidequests/minigames you find in several citys. My favorite was the challenging Combo Chicken House :) When you are into Jump'n Run OR Beat'em Up games with a high Combo spectrum, you have to experience this game.Why 9/10? The game is great, but 13 € are a little bit too much in my opinion for a game like this with a pretty short main story. I bought it on the Canadian Devolper Sale, when it came out new. That they didnt drop the price again since its on the market, tells you about the quality and popularity of the game.			"

												A great game that is metroidvania and shows cultural values from spanish culture. The one thing i really like about this game is the cultural aesthetics from spanish culture. The game is quite enjoyable too, but i really like games that delve into other cultures and enrich the gamer with the experience. One great example of this is how the hero uses a luchador mask to cover his real identity..that of a simple farmer. There are many things that pop out of this game that are like that, but i don't with to ruin your gaming experience by delving too deep into them in this game. I hope you enjoy this game as much as i have. Thanks for reading!			"

												There are one or two exceptions but generally I don't play platformers. Guacamelee! is one of those games that if I saw a friend play I would say ""Balls to that, it looks blummin' infuriating!"".And I'd be right. It is infuriating. Jumping from wall to wall, all the while shifting dimensions to ensure that the wall you are jumping to actually exists else you'll have to start the whole darn climb all over again! It is blummin' infuriating... but IT WILL NOT BEAT ME! I will keep playing this game until I have beaten it!!!... and that I suppose is an endorsement...

												Guacamelee is the latest competitor to enter the 'Metroidvania' wrestling ring (see what I did there?)... har har. Ahem. So it is a worthy descendant of the classics? In a word, yes. There's a lot to like about this one. First of all, the Mexican style/setting is something I can't recall ever seeing in a game before, and it actually works really well. The characters are cool and the writing is decent. Secondly, the combat is surprisingly deep and can be challenging at times. You play as a luchador and mainly utilize wrestling moves to take down your opponents. After beating on a guy for a bit, you get the option to grapple and toss them. This ends up being really fun, especially when you start racking up huge combos by throwing dudes into a group of other dudes. It's not simply a mindless beat-'em-up, though. There is a deeper layer of strategy and skill required, as certain enemies can only be defeated with careful timing or by using specific special moves to break their defenses first. It's not too hard versus 1 or 2 enemies, but when the game throws a screen full of baddies at you with projectiles flying all over the place, it can actually get a bit challenging. Aside from combat, the game also mixes in some classic 2D platforming. Some of these sections will really put your skills to the test, as they require precise coordination of various moves to be strung together very quickly. This could have potentially been very frustrating, but luckily, the game is very forgiving when it comes to the platforming. If you fall to your ""death"", you just end up back on the most recent platform you touched with no other penalty. While this may seem dumbed down, you'll be glad for it... trust me. Overall, the game does a great job of tuning the balance of difficulty between its various systems. The toughest parts are probably the boss fights, which require patience, observation and exploitation of patterns. You'll be challenged, but with a bit of practice, you'll eventually get by. Depending on how quickly you play or how completionist you want to get, the game will last you anywhere from 9-13 hours, and many more if you plan to go for the best ending or complete all of the challenges in the ""El Infierno"" DLC level (included for free). So it's a good value for the money (and I haven't even touched at all on how many gaming references and other neat touches can be found throughout). Guacamelee is a serious love-fest for gaming fans and especially those who love the Metroidvania sub-genre. If that sounds like you, then pick this one up without hesitation.Technical notes: I know I say this for almost every sidescroller, but seriously, I mean it this time - you are gonna want to use a gamepad for this one (specifically an Xbox360 controller if you have one). I suppose it's possible to play this with a keyboard, but I sure as hell wouldn't want to. Some of the platforming and combat sections need split-second finesse maneuvering, which is hard enough even with a controller. The developers even put up a note at the start of the game that they recommend using a controller. Whenever I see those warnings in a game from a developer, I have learned to heed them. You probably should too. So think twice about buying this if you don't have a gamepad with the standard layout of buttons/sticks.			"

Combat gets boring pretty fast, most jumping puzzles are tedious, bosses feel unfair and are pretty unsatisfying to beat. During a normal playthrough there are no real unlockables and/or upgrades. Positive points: Art style, fluidity of movement and combat and the soundtrackNegative points: Short, repetitive, tedious, ""unfair"", lots of unskippable dialogue, only like 5 different types of enemies, also highly overrated			"

												Charming and with a lot of style in every way.I would gladly recommend this game if you are a semi-hardcore or more platformer.However for everybody else, be fairly warned,The game has a tendency to have one or two basic ideas (world switch and color shields) and then mercilessly repeat them again and again and again and ... absolutely endlessly again ... in ever more cumbersome ways, which is it way of adding content and ""difficulty"".It becomes painful over time and in some ways punishing.Add to this that it also creeps into fights (color shields, warp between worlds, white shields, bombs, bombs with shield .. you get the idea) and it becomes mindnumbing.Also if you do not own a controller save your self some headaches and pass on this game. It is excruciating without one as the keyboard setup sadly makes the above even worse.Frankly, the game badly needs a bye option where it lets you pass after a certain amount of attempts  or deaths, to appeal to a larger crowd and not to mention provide more entertainment and less annoyance.

												TL;DR I closet love this game. The music is great, the gameplay is solid, and it is intentionally silly. Not only that, but it's also got a really fun combat system and it actually forces you to learn how to play the game so that, by the end, you know what you're doing; it's not like other games where you can more or less wing what you're doing and just follow the objective marker to get to the end. I'd give this game something like an 8.5/10 or so. Not quite as high as a 9 or 10, but also slightly ahead of most 8s.Guacamelee is a game where you play as some Mexican guy to avenge the girl he closet loves after being smashed by the guy who stole her away from the village. You do this by dawning the a mask that has the soul of a former luchador or something. Look, listen, I don't care for story, I like gameplay, visuals, and sounds.Guacamelee is a beat-em-up influenced by Mexican culture. Simple premise. You, as a luchador, can learn grabs, throws, combos, and other things to help you get though the legions of baddies sent to delay you from getting to the final boss. Not all baddies can be dispatched the same way, though. Some require you to break their shield by performing a special super move (using your meter), some require throws, and some just need some knuckles to the dome. Perfect. Exactly what you'd expect from a beat-em-up.But wait, that's not all of the gameplay. There's also some platforming. What? Platforming? Yeah, I know, listen: each of the special moves that you learn influence your character's movement. The TOTALLY NOT SHORYUKEN moves your character up so you can get some vertical movement, there's a belly flop that moves you down to the lowest platform (or breaks blocks that can be broken), and there's a dash that moves you sideways...  Look, listen, basically you're forced to use the moves you learn not only in combat, but also to get around. It's pretty neat. There's also this concept of the netherworld or whatever that is merging with the human world, so, sometimes, things change to reflect how they are in the other dimension. This becomes something that you can control and offers some interesting puzzle-platforming like things where you have to pusha da button real fast and stuff to get to another area. The game also rewards you for going back to revisit places and stuff, so that's cool. Always gotta give shout outs to games that reward players for going back and experimenting with newfound powers.That's really all there is to the gameplay. It's not terribly difficult to learn, and getting the combos off from the chicken's gym will be pretty satisfying because some of them are lengthy for a beat-em-up. Everyone that plays fighting games knows the satisfaction from getting off a lengthy combo. What else is there to talk about after the gameplay? Oh yeah, visuals. This game is 2d and feels like how Samurai Jack would be if it were a video game. 2d with not too many circles. A lot of things are obviously overdone. It's not a bad thing by any means. That said, I wasn't too impressed with it. Beyond the simple graphics, though, the game has a ton of references to internet stuff in the background. One thing that makes me love games is being silly and this game is totally silly. It doesn't detract from gameplay and isn't in-your-face narration from a character you don't care about, but it's mostly harmless jokes or references to things. Then there's the music. Ok, look, listen, I'm Mexican and I grew up listening to some pretty ethnic music. Most of it I didn't really care for, but this game took all the good parts of the music I didn't like and smashed it together to form a REALLY REALLY solid soundtrack. Like, holy crap, I actually listen to some of the songs from this game regularly because they sound so nice. You'll get some pretty stereotypical accordion and brass instruments playing, but you'll also, for example, in the jungle area, get some fast drums because fast drums are associated with jungles because reasons. Yeah, but what's not to like about this game? It offers solid beat-em-up gameplay, neat platforming, and even some puzzles. The graphics aren't anything highest-end, but they get the job done and look just dandy anyway. The game doesn't take itself too seriously and this game is just genuinely fun to play. It also has a fantastic soundtrack. I'd highly adivse anyone to pick up this game. Also, this game tends to be on sale pretty often, so there's almost no reason to pick it up if you don't already own it and it's on sale. I personally got mine off a humble bundle and it was great. One thing I would have really liked was if this game had online multiplayer or something, but it doesn't, and that's I guess permissable. It offers local co-op, so I guess that'll have to suffice.

												Great action-platformer... One of the best games I've ever played!Having said that, I feel I should warn that the beginning is somewhat weird,, a bit slow paced at first, but it soon gets frantic and challenging.It's a very colorful game and I don't mean just the graphics. Even the mexican-inspired music feels colorful (somehow), while the gameplay experience is like a cross between Street-Fighter and Super-Mario. How awesome is that?The platform puzzles are nice and challenging, while a Metroidvania structure will have you explore the game for upgrades, etc. Get it!			"

												I love metroidvania games, ever since I first played an import copy of Symphony of the Night way back when, and I've played every Castlevania or other major title in the genre since. I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that Guacamelee is one of the very best games the genre has ever seen.The game really has everything; excellent graphics with a healthy serving of style, wonderful music, tight and well-executed controls and combat and a world that's simply fun to explore. That's really the key word here; this game is FUN! Everything from juggling enemies and racking up a 300 hit combo to exploring every nook and cranny of the world is constantly and consistently engaging and entertaining. The game also keeps things fresh by throwing a curveball or two your way, mostly in the shape of balls-hard platforming segments, almost on the level of something like Super Meat Boy. This is actually something I think the game does well, because most entries in this genre have pretty uninteresting and frankly lame platforming, Castlevania included. Guacamelee wears its platform roots on its sleeve and demands some tricky, technical jumping from you, and it's all the better for it.As you can see, I have nothing but praise for this game. I could ramble on about how much I love it all day, so I'm just going to summarize and say that if you have any interest in this genre and haven't played this game yet, you absolutely have to. Like right now. Do not pass go, do not wait for a sale; play it immediately!			"

												Guacamelee is an enjoyable action platformer, in which you'll play as a Wrestler on a Quest to save a girl and yeah that sounds like Mario - This game likes to reference a lot of different games, but also some real life stuff, I found it very satisfying to find eater eggs in this game.Although this game doesn't have a perfect pacing, due to one point in the game, where the plattforming starts to get really complicating and you suddenly have to use a lot more abilities at the same time, which gets you likely stuck on a quarter of a level about an hour or two, it's annoying, but at the same time the only real negative point about the game.Gameplay wise is the game divided into plattforming and brawler-like combat. What makes the plattforming really interesting is that you can use your wrestling moves you'll learn over the course of the game, to reach your destination. In combat you use as already mentioned wrestling moves to defeat your enemies, apart from that you can throw a damaged enemy, who can be thrown onto other enemies, which is not only efficient, but is very satisfying to do.Even though you are very limited with the throwing when using a keyboard. Because I still don't have a controller I used a keyboard for this game and personally I found that the keyboard controls difficult to get used to, but didn't feel at a disadvantage because of the limited throwing. Apart from that the PC-Port seems fine.Overall I didn't see any major flaws with the game, it was just challenging enough, it doesn't have a perfect pacing, but cool Easter eggs, I'll recommend to people, who are looking for a challenging platformer and like to find references/Easter eggs.

Had no technical issues with it despite still being on a pentium with Windows XP so it should run smooth as well for most others. It's length isn't as long as I would like it to be but its still good length, especially if u find yourself busy or not finishing games. I highly recommend it.			"

												Guacamelee is an under-rated gem! It is a fantastic side-scrolling metroidvania style game set in a Mexican luchador themed world. I highly recommended playing it if you're looking for a fun coop game to play. It's stylish, comical, and has a great soundtrack, and although it can be fiendishly difficult in parts it doesn’t penalise you for dying (which you will do ALOT of!). For such a simple game there is quite a large array of special moves, which once mastered allows you to backtrack over previous levels and unlock hidden areas and challenges. The 'Gold Edition' also features an extra level of challenges which definitely increases the replayablity value. Because of the accuracy needed to succeed, I would personally recommend playing this game with a controller, rather than keyboard/mouse.			"

												Where do I even start on this? Guacamelee is a metroidvania-style action-platformer based on luchadores and different bits of Mexican culture. It's stylish, funny, and fun. For the most part the game is just a great romp where you beat up bad guys in awesome combos and explore new areas, getting new powers and abilities as you go. The difficulty curve is... mostly okay, though there are a few spikes of really really frustrating platforming at times. Some of these spikes are optional, but some of them are mandatory. The story isn't deep, but it is fun and the characters are all nifty as well. Overall, pretty damned solid game and one that I recommend despite a few blemishes.			"

												An excellent beat-em-up metroidvania with some very difficult challenges. Combat fun and chaotic, once you get the hang of dodges and comboing up your special moves you'll be knocking entire crowds of enemies around the room with style. The bosses, while difficult, did not feel as fun as the more mundane fights. The art style is very asethetically pleasing and perfectly compliments the game's near perfect gameplay. Overall, I give this game nine buenos out of ten possible buenos.			"

												I'm going to feel like such a nitpicky jerk talking about this game's flaws, because everything else is just really good. But we'll get to them.Guacamelee! is a muscular Metroidvania, a world where the mask is a very literal symbol of strength and the powerups are sealed behind openings that only ancient body-press techniques will open. Its world is a bit more linear then some Metroidvania-inspired titles, but there's still a pretty solid amount of nooks and crannies to break open and revisit with new tricks. Just about all of your movement or ""unlocking"" abilities are combat-oriented-the blue doors are unlocking by dash-punching, for instance, giving you regular new tricks in fights. Things that don't move you tend to move enemies, so you're almost always able to keep a combo going, either by reaching someone or hurling someone into a distant group. The fights are fast and fluid, and a little bit of dimension-changing thrown in offers a manageable issue that'll still keep you on your toes.The platforming's fine, too-just as some enemies only exist in one of the dimensions, so do some blocks and walls, making you keep switching to get past things, have safe landing points, etc. When it flows, it's a real joy to bounce around the game.Problem #1 is that it doesn't always flow, though. Hazards (spikes, nasty water, thorns, etc.) tend to have a pretty big hitbox, and even nearly-but-not-quite grazing something can send you spiraling to the ground below-this is a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥on vertical segments, especially since there's no safe-fall. Thankfully, these are few and far between. Still, though, landing in water or falling off into a pit teleports you to solid ground, immediately-it's actually worse to land on a platform below where you were. A strange choice.Problem #2 is that our hero, Juan, presumably a técnico, has a pile driver move. He really shouldn't-that's for rudos.Those are nitpicks, though. Overall, the game's just fantastic. If you need a sidescroller, this thing deserves a place in your library.			"

												This game does a lot of things well. It has a very unique dual world warping mechanic that is used throughout the entire game, is very intuitive, and meshes well with the other game mechanics and storyline. Unfortunately, it deceives you with one game and replaces it with another. The sound, art style, combat mechanics, and metroidvania ability mechanics are all very well designed, but it also has many flaws. Most important flaw is the use of color-coded puzzles and combat mechanics without a colorblind-friendly mode. This makes the already difficult combat a dice roll for the colorblind.The game starts off as a very good beat-em-up metroidvania, but at the end it becomes an extremely hard (super meat boy level hard, no exageration) platformer with a few combat sequences in between. Though a lot of the very hard platforming is optional, they are very unforgiving and require godly levels of coordination with very very sparse checkpoints.The combat at later stages also border on unfair levels of difficulty. Enemies can exist in another world that you can't hurt, but they can hurt you. A lot of later enemies also have unblockable attacks, so you end up with half the screen full of enemies you can't hit or block.  You have to swap worlds to deal with these two types of world enemies, and they can overlap each other and not hit or shoot one another. Getting hit is also a major punishment as you are knocked out for a fair amount of time. The worse thing, though is being knocked far away from your enemies. Being a melee only character, not being able to get close to enemies who are charging for unblockable attacks is bad. The hit stun is way too long and punishing when there are large numbers of these enemies. Although it's rare, it is also possible to be stunlocked in some arenas that have a large number of enemies. The DLC shows you just what the developers had in mind for this game as they are all platforming based with little to no combat. This is a puzzle platformer disguised as a combat metroidvania. If you like supermeatboy type platformers with very difficult combat, then this game is for you. For anyone like me expecting metroid or castlevania style gameplay, you probably won't find this game very fun after the first half.			"

												I wanted to recommend this game because it has style and attitude and charm galore...But...There are too-many aspects of it which are amateurish and they mar the game to an ever-greater degree as you progress.We're talking about things like unstoppable player/enemy animations which interfere with combat/movement, slow-to-respond controls (probably due to the aforesaid animations), areas you have to repeat if you make a mistake and lazy/buggy AI behavior ExampleYou can't always thread-together combat moves because every move has an animation and you have to wait to wait for those to take place.  Thing is - you have to do this VISUALLY in a game where you/the enemies often obscure each-other - this isn't a brililant idea...Other issues appear in terms of what simply badly tested/lazy scripting/designExampleYou can hit an enemy, they'll fly away and then the missile they were about  to throw will appear where they were standing anyway (likely hitting you).  You'll also hear the sound of an enemy's move  DESPITE the fact you should stunned or killed it and thus stopped the move from taking place!?Maybe you can tolerate those things for a while - I did - but sooner or later you will realise the game is really ""working against you"". ANDBefore you buy, ensure you have a joystick/pad with a decent DPad.  Playing this on keyboard is impossible and the a 360 pad left stick isn't precise enough/DPad is a joke.			"

												The first time I tried playing through this game, I gave up for almost 2 years. I wasn't quite sure why. I recently retried, because this is a good game and I didn't understand why I disliked it. I did figure out why, though, as I got to a certain mechanic that turned every platforming incident into a timing and reaction dependent stress-fest with massive consequences for failure. Didn't help that the fighting gets progressively sloppier as you get more combos. I happen to not like combos. Also for some reason, the grappling speeds up as you progress. This makes it harder to do the grappling combos, even though they're simple as hell.Ultimately, I didn't like the combo based fighting and the platforming turned into an unduly frustrating experience. I think it's actually a good game, still, but I don't like it and I won't recommend it as such. If you like combos and super meat boy platforming, go for it.			"

Add a side of simple but not unique visuals, and serve lukewarm.Target audience: Reddit.  I think i counted the word ""awesomesauce"" at least 4 times now, along with oh... 12 epic maymay pictures ranging from GENTLEMEN to grumpy cat.  Stylized, of course.

YES. GET THIS GAME.It's got intense platforming challenges, post game content, solid Metroidvania action. Almost all of your abilities have movement and combat utility, lots of variety in the action... it's just fantastic overall.			"

												One of the few good 2d Metroid-style games available on PC, although it's melee-based (if you couldn't tell by the title) instead of shooting. Good: Combat is fun with all the combos you can pull off. Game is full of humor and video game references.Bad: Has some really frustrating jumping puzzles where the game seems to turn from Metroid into Super Meat Boy. Certain bosses are really tough in comparison to the rest of the game's difficulty.			"

I did figure out why, though, as I got to a certain mechanic that turned every platforming incident into a timing and reaction dependent stress-fest with massive consequences for failure. Didn't help that the fighting gets progressively sloppier as you get more combos. I happen to not like combos. Also for some reason, the grappling speeds up as you progress. This makes it harder to do the grappling combos, even though they're simple as hell.Ultimately, I didn't like the combo based fighting and the platforming turned into an unduly frustrating experience.

												This game does a lot of things well. It has a very unique dual world warping mechanic that is used throughout the entire game, is very intuitive, and meshes well with the other game mechanics and storyline. Unfortunately, it deceives you with one game and replaces it with another. The sound, art style, combat mechanics, and metroidvania ability mechanics are all very well designed, but it also has many flaws. Most important flaw is the use of color-coded puzzles and combat mechanics without a colorblind-friendly mode. This makes the already difficult combat a dice roll for the colorblind.The game starts off as a very good beat-em-up metroidvania, but at the end it becomes an extremely hard (super meat boy level hard, no exageration) platformer with a few combat sequences in between. Though a lot of the very hard platforming is optional, they are very unforgiving and require godly levels of coordination with very very sparse checkpoints.The combat at later stages also border on unfair levels of difficulty. Enemies can exist in another world that you can't hurt, but they can hurt you. A lot of later enemies also have unblockable attacks, so you end up with half the screen full of enemies you can't hit or block.  You have to swap worlds to deal with these two types of world enemies, and they can overlap each other and not hit or shoot one another. Getting hit is also a major punishment as you are knocked out for a fair amount of time. The worse thing, though is being knocked far away from your enemies. Being a melee only character, not being able to get close to enemies who are charging for unblockable attacks is bad. The hit stun is way too long and punishing when there are large numbers of these enemies. Although it's rare, it is also possible to be stunlocked in some arenas that have a large number of enemies. The DLC shows you just what the developers had in mind for this game as they are all platforming based with little to no combat. This is a puzzle platformer disguised as a combat metroidvania. If you like supermeatboy type platformers with very difficult combat, then this game is for you. For anyone like me expecting metroid or castlevania style gameplay, you probably won't find this game very fun after the first half.			"

												Even though it shamelessly uses many elements from other games like Metroid or Super Paper Mario, Guacamelee would be a great game if it didn't suffer from unfairness and repetition. Controls are straight, there's lot to discover and the setting reminds me of Grim Fandango, which is obviously a good thing. However not letting me past the first boss even after multiple approaches is a no-go. If the core mechanic of a game consists of prohibiting me playing it, there's something wrong. Regrettable, because the developers showed some real skill.			"

												While I like the concept, it is an absolutely TERRIBLE console port. The devs ""recommend"" a controler and cite some flaw with keyboards as the reasons for any problems with the game's controls, but the lack of responsiveness goes beyond acceptable levels. Thousands of other PC games use the mouse and keyboard for controls and most of them manage reasonably smooth gameplay. There is nothing in this game which is so complicated that it would be impossible to make it work with the keyboard, and yet there are some sections which are boarderline unplayable. The problem is that the game is so unresponsive that absolute perfect timing is required to perform even the most basic platforming and combat. This isn't a huge issue when you are fighting one enemy or just hopping up to the next ledge, but there were some sections where I must have spent 20+ minutes trying to complete a jumping puzzle just because the damn Rooster Punch wouldn't work half the time. If you already own a controler, the game seems like it would be pretty good. If you don't, be prepared to spend $8-$30 to be able to play that game you thought was only $7.50.			"

												Guacamelee is a  platformer side scroll - a genre that i really enjoy - here in play the role of Mexican fighter, and he will save his sweetheart, and fight against some weird but fun enemies. Guacamelee is very enjoyable game but is bit hard to play, the combos sometimes don't do well also the controls don't respond on exact time. Also i HIGHLY recommend you play this game with a controller, because with keyboard and mouse you will get a though time. Story is very typical, hero saving the day, rescuing is girl and all bad guys are defeated, but is still fun to play, also this game have a really good jokes between the main charterer and is ""mentor"". The combat system is the highlight for me, very good very nice combos, also during the story mode you will get new techniques and ability to help during your journey. Best of all, if you have friend in your house at any time he can join you - yes because this game doesn't support online COOP - and help you on your journey. Both OST and scenarios are great, the OST really fits the gameplay in general, Mexican and stuff and scenarios are full of colors and well design. About the replay value on this game, you have two choices: after beating the final boss you can collect the rest of the mask and do the side quests witch are few, about 5/6 or you can try the hard mode, witch can be a good challenge. Well that it, with no doubt Guacamelee deserve every cents that you spend on it. Totally recommend it. ~ 9/10			"

												Guacamelee is an under-rated gem! It is a fantastic side-scrolling metroidvania style game set in a Mexican luchador themed world. I highly recommended playing it if you're looking for a fun coop game to play. It's stylish, comical, and has a great soundtrack, and although it can be fiendishly difficult in parts it doesn’t penalise you for dying (which you will do ALOT of!). For such a simple game there is quite a large array of special moves, which once mastered allows you to backtrack over previous levels and unlock hidden areas and challenges. The 'Gold Edition' also features an extra level of challenges which definitely increases the replayablity value. Because of the accuracy needed to succeed, I would personally recommend playing this game with a controller, rather than keyboard/mouse.			"

												Wonderfully responsive controls (controller desperately needed, though), fair challenge, good humour, great art style, fitting music... This game has everything a gamer wants, and - even more important - it avoids everything a gamer hates. One of the most perfect and fun games I have played in recent years. SO MUCH JOY. SO MUCH WIN.			"

												I'm going to feel like such a nitpicky jerk talking about this game's flaws, because everything else is just really good. But we'll get to them.Guacamelee! is a muscular Metroidvania, a world where the mask is a very literal symbol of strength and the powerups are sealed behind openings that only ancient body-press techniques will open. Its world is a bit more linear then some Metroidvania-inspired titles, but there's still a pretty solid amount of nooks and crannies to break open and revisit with new tricks. Just about all of your movement or ""unlocking"" abilities are combat-oriented-the blue doors are unlocking by dash-punching, for instance, giving you regular new tricks in fights. Things that don't move you tend to move enemies, so you're almost always able to keep a combo going, either by reaching someone or hurling someone into a distant group. The fights are fast and fluid, and a little bit of dimension-changing thrown in offers a manageable issue that'll still keep you on your toes.The platforming's fine, too-just as some enemies only exist in one of the dimensions, so do some blocks and walls, making you keep switching to get past things, have safe landing points, etc. When it flows, it's a real joy to bounce around the game.Problem #1 is that it doesn't always flow, though. Hazards (spikes, nasty water, thorns, etc.) tend to have a pretty big hitbox, and even nearly-but-not-quite grazing something can send you spiraling to the ground below-this is a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥on vertical segments, especially since there's no safe-fall. Thankfully, these are few and far between. Still, though, landing in water or falling off into a pit teleports you to solid ground, immediately-it's actually worse to land on a platform below where you were. A strange choice.Problem #2 is that our hero, Juan, presumably a técnico, has a pile driver move. He really shouldn't-that's for rudos.Those are nitpicks, though. Overall, the game's just fantastic. If you need a sidescroller, this thing deserves a place in your library.			"

												This game is awesome.Had a lot of fun with the game references inside it, the memes, and with the Uay Chivo character.The flow of the game is nice. It is a 2D Platformer, Metroidvania style. You don't need to go back a thousand times to some place in order to 100% it. Powerups are nice, and the combo system is good.			"

												Beautiful and fun metroidvania game. Moving around is like a dream and chaining combos with your special moves feels rewarding. Had no technical issues with it despite still being on a pentium with Windows XP so it should run smooth as well for most others. It's length isn't as long as I would like it to be but its still good length, especially if u find yourself busy or not finishing games. I highly recommend it.			"

												An excellent beat-em-up metroidvania with some very difficult challenges. Combat fun and chaotic, once you get the hang of dodges and comboing up your special moves you'll be knocking entire crowds of enemies around the room with style. The bosses, while difficult, did not feel as fun as the more mundane fights. The art style is very asethetically pleasing and perfectly compliments the game's near perfect gameplay. Overall, I give this game nine buenos out of ten possible buenos.			"

												The game was promising at the start but soon i figured out that it's way too much trick-jump involved. The music is awesome and the game-play is great with lots of combos to master. There is a ""shop"" where you can upgrade you character but it hasn't much to offer really and that was a little let down. It's a great game but sadly i can't recommend it mostly due to the insane amount of trick-jump involved to progress and reach secrets. But if you like that, then this game is for you!			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  This game COULD be terrific but the controls are IMPOSSIBLE to use... so awkward I am just astounded anyone would release a game in this condition.  It's almost as if I were running an old 286 game on my quadcore but oddly enough only your characters framerate is 500 times the frame rate it ought to be.  This is inexcusable!  No wonder the game is selling for under four bucks.  Fix this FATAL flaw and the game could be a winner.  I say 'could' because I really don't know.  It's too damn frustrating trying to work these controls - both keyboard and 360 controller - to play for more than 5 minutes.  SAVE YOUR DUCATS for a game thats playable.			"

												Guacamelee, you're an interesting one. When i first started playing you, i was greeted by a warm and enjoyable art style and fun combat to really tie the game together. It was perfect, really - nothing could have stopped me from loving you.Your music was great, your artstyle was great and the gameplay was great too.  And then i saw the memes.It all happened so quickly.On that day, i was given the reminder that we live in fear of the memes.Constantly, again and again - this game is literally littered with memes, they're everywhere.  It's like every battlefield is across a different 9gag page and it doesn't stop there - oh no, the game's dialogue is constant 2007 umad humour and it relies on referencing other games to be funny, which 90% of the time, it is not.  This game had really good potential, but unfortunately is ruined for me because of this. "

												Great Indie Game.. Good mix of Fight your way Platformer action with MetroidVana leveling style and good humor. I did wanna throw my controller out the window on the hardest level but I did want to get 100% and it was really satisfactory once I managed to get thru it. It's not a very long game but it's good fun !! I'm guessing the new ""Super Turbo Championship Edition"" would be the one to get for anyone who doesn't already own this one but whatever version you play I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this game.

												At the beginning of this game, there is a seizure warning. Do not disregard this! Despite having my epilepsy well under control as I play most videogames, the animation here is so quick and jerky I did feel symptoms coming on and I was forced to quit playing.   plus it has controls limited to flat-out running or stop on a dime, I could hardly make it to the chapel to begin the first mission.

SUPER JANKEY apparently!!  You seriously think I would have bought this version if I knew 4player co-op was on the way?♥♥♥♥♥uh-nine.... I don't get it both versions are 15$ so wtf is the difference besides the game name? oh, I guess it was just time to ♥♥♥♥ over all the people who bought the first game by only adding♥♥♥♥♥♥to the new game which is basically the same game but now it has more stuff? Wait is the turbo championship edition a whole new game? NOPE... pay 15$ for a few added features eh? F**k U and ur little Mexican dog too!!! where's the upgrade button/price? there isn't one IT CAN'T BE DONE!!!... Seriously why in the F*** is the old game even for sale still?  So I can't pay for the updated content unless I buy the whole game again? WONDERFUL!! thank god I can still pay the same price for a game with fewer features(gold version)... thank you for the convenience... good job you made a great game!!!! oh, you want to improve upon it? well, I guess it's time to rip off everyone who bought it... real smooth I guess I'll just have to torrent the other version because why would I pay for the same game twice? WHATS AN UPGRADE? anyone ever heard of that? NOPE!!!! Here's a simple question is the old game worth playing when you already have the new game? are they sequels? NOPE same game = improved same game = money making asshats... if you needed more money why did you put your game on the humble bundle? and don't try and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t me and say it's impossible to pay X$ for people who have the gold edition to upgrade to the newer version.... <--- see you still got some money didn't work for free but I guess that would be far too convenient/practical... (Even tho I've seen it done!!!) why don't you just say in the new game description ""we just want all your money!!! give us your money again so you can enjoy the better version"" and in the old version(gold) you can say ""buy our gold edition game it's just like our other game only with less stuff and you can't play 4player. its limited to 2 players but it's the same price because we r farmers dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb (music or is it?)

												Having seen two of my friends finish this game,I thought maybe I had been too harsh in my assessment of the product. Turns out I was right to begin with. The first level is nothing but running back and forth, holding stupid conversations with the locals and jumping up and down while punching some barrels. WOW. Mario has been there and done that already. Then all of a sudden you are dead and there are no clues as to what that giant green sparkly thing in the floor is and can I go back and do something with it? OOPS, no I guess not!  Or why am I being attacked by skeletal Mexicans in ponchos and sombreros and why, why, WHY? I probably have less than an hour in this game and was hoping for more but I found the story to be flat and without real substance and the gameplay to be less than fun (for me, anyway). The colours are nice, and the game appears to be professionally developed but that being said I am glad I only paid $3.00 for this game. Only buy this game if you truly enjoy twitch action side scrolling platformers with repetitive action. Otherwise save your cash. 3/10			"

												I wanted to love this game, I really do!The art is great. The music is great. The story is great. Why not everyone love it!?May be this is just me, but I really hate the way you map default controller button, it's the most hardest thing to mastering.- Dashing can be done by both {RS} and {LS}+{LT} ... why?!?- Special move require {B}+{LS} (or sometime, just {B}), this is very troublesome, since {LS} is analog, most of the time the game interprete my action wrong.- Some time you will need to hold down {Y} and then press {A}, such position is not easy to perform at all. I think its too complicate rather than challenging and fun.I also think some achievements are too hard to be done under the game design. For example, Heroine-ism: require Juanita (standard female character) to win final boss fight. This is almost impossible since she can not throw object too far (main attack), and object that she can throw just appear randomly everywhere on the screen, not optimise to appear near the boss. (I know it meant to be hard, but why too hard?) After all, the most importance point is, this achievement state that we need to use a female character to win the game, there are plenty of female characters, but why limited it to be completed with only this standard-lowest-tier female character!?My conclusion is:- For perfectionism who want to complete all achievements, just skip this game, it will made you screaming in F*** word A LOT.- For non-expert platform gamer, just skip, its too hard to completed.

												I really want to reccomend this game, it has an authentic sounding soundtrack, charming graphics, references to other video games (Castle Crashers, Team Fortress 2, Super Mario Bros. etc) and casual fun little story. BUT the controls are way too glitchy. The first combo move you learn in the game is Rooster Uppercut which is performed by pressing up and D at the same time. The problem is, the vast majority of the time you press up and D (and I'm not exageratting when I say VAST MAJORITY. It means at least 95% of the time), your character will either jump (up) or do a normal attack (d)This wasn't much of a problem (yes it was) until I learned another combo move, this one is activated with just DNow, whenever I try to Rooster Uppercut, I'll end up doing the new move instead, which takes away a stamina block. Meaning every second time I try to Uppercut, I have to spend a couple seconds standing around doing nothing waiting for my stamina to refill itself. A couple seconds might not sound like much, but it adds up overtime.Included is a YouTube clip I recorded of this. A note: I was trying to get past this part where you need to jump into an Uppercut into a portal and then walljump a couple more times for almost 15 minutes before I begun recording. And after I ended the recording, I tried for another 45 minutes without ever getting to the other side.Yes. That's an entire hour of me jumping up and down trying to perform a combo move that was as simple as pushing two buttons.And before all the potential angry comments come flooding in, I KNOW ABOUT MICROSOFT GHOSTING. I HAVE DONE THE TEST AND IT SAYS THAT I AM INDEED PRESSING BOTH KEYS. THAT IS NOT THE PROBLEM HERE

UPDATE: Yes, I am aware now that you can simply jump into the walljump without Uppercutting, but that still doesn't mean there isn't a frustrating bug that prevents you from using your moves			"

												+ Charming art style.+ Great soundtrack.+ Good combat...- ...which progressively gets worse.- Frustrating platforming.- Cheap humor which relies on heavy usage of internet memes and references. It wasn't funny. Just stupid.- Plays terribly on a keyboard.I really enjoyed the first two hours of Guacamelee!. But as I continued playing, the flaws started to show. Platforming sequences became rather annoying, the once great combat became a complete mess:As you unlock several abilities, enemies get shields which you can only destroy by using the corresponding ability. Okay, that's not a problem, but when rooms start to get filled with those enemies, all wielding different shields, then it is. Especially when the dimension-switching mechanic is involved. Good luck with that.I can see why people like this game, but the gameplay just feels too clunky and unpolished for me to enjoy. A shame, really.6/10 "

												DO YOU LIKE MEMES? WELL HERE'S A BUNCH, THEY'RE FUNNY RIGHT!?!Have fun doing the same 3 hit combo over and over, because it's all you can do.Music and visuals weren't as bad, but that's not saying much.It's not even Metroidvania. It's a clear path, with a pretty obvious side path here and there. That's like saying Bioshock Infinite was Metroidvania. Just because it has a map and a TINY amount of backtracking and a few optional rooms, doesn't mean it's Metroidvania. Wanna see Metroidvania? Go play Metroid or Castlevania: SotN.Game is terrible. 2/10.			"

Lots of secrets to uncover. Story is entertaining and the humor is okay at times. Very fun and I do reccomend. Short game tho , do not buy over $10Also you can play as bayonetta and thats cool. "

												I hate this game. I've tried it a few times a few months apart and I still hate it. It does metroidvania very well but essentially its just a precision jumping game. I can't stand it. I'm happy having to make a few challenging jumps, but this whole game revolves around making precises button presses to make those jumps. It'd be cool if it was just for extra bonus hearts or something, but you need to make these  jumps to procede with the game. I've given it enough chances and I don't like it.			"

												This is the best Metroidvania I've played in a long time. There are parts that mirror the GBA Metroids really well: Flying across multiple screens for secrets, and hidden 'morph ball' tunnels, to name a few. The nostalgia is incredible, but it is very much its own game.The combat system feels pretty decent: It's not anything groundbreaking, but it never gets in the way, and killing crap always feels nice. Throwing enemies was a neat (And fitting) addition, though. With enough enemies on the screen, you can just keep throwing them around, racking up massive combos and killing them without getting touched.The secrets scattered throughout the game (As any Metroidvania should have) are satisfying to find and oh so numerous. What I really enjoyed, though, was rather than having 'energy tanks' that instantly increase your health cap, you have 'heart pieces,' which are instantly reminscent of Zelda. Some areas for secret items get notoriously difficult, and the platforming skills it asks for have been compared to Super Meat Boy (Which, personally, I love a good difficult platformer). The main game, though, is a nice difficulty to get through: It isn't a stroll through the park, but it's not too tricky. And it's still rewarding to finish.The game is also absolutely filled with very-unsubtle references to... Everything. Classic games, internet icons, memes, you name it. The lack of subtlety makes it pretty hilarious. And lastly- This is a game I will never get tired of looking at. It's so gorgeous.Buy this game. Buy it now.			"

												Super fun game. Very colorful, and easy to follow, but there's no voice acting, which isn't a big deal but it would have been nice. Lots of refrences to other games like mario, metroid, and zelda. The platforming is solid, and controls feel pretty good. The combo system seems shallow at first, but as you unlock more moves it becomes very deep and very fun to pull of extremely long combos. Also, the platforming gets hard quick. You need to be good at jumping to complete this game. Luckily checkpoints are pretty close together so you never have to backtrack much and the jumping feels very good and fair. I got it during a humble bundle sale, but it's easily worth 15 or 20 dollars.			"

It's amazing to me that games can still come out that can't get the controls right.  As far as graphics and story, it was pretty good.  But it's entirely too frustrating to continue playing a game in which you can't advance because the controls are so wonky and inconsistent.			"

												This game has much to offer - quality animation style, bright colours, and a quirky combat system. The game doesn't have much in the way of story, but it doesn't need it. It follows the traditional platformer style - love interest has been captured by some bad guy, good guy pursues bad guy to save love interest - you know how it goes. Anyway, the game starts with baby steps. It can feel slightly frustrating when you first play it, but when you learn all the different ""moves/concepts"" of the combat system, you appreciate why they started so slowly. This combat system is, quite frankly, fantastic. When the enemies start gaining shields that you have to break, or they go into another dimension that you can't attack, you have to think quickly and act accordingly - button-mashing only gets you so far in this game. The difficulty mark-up is erratic, though. It starts fairly easy, and then the last part of the game is wincingly hard. It almost killed the experience entirely as it was so needlessly hard - I like difficult games, but this game's difficulty can offer you little by way of dodging/returning damage. Sometimes, you just get ♥♥♥♥ed over without doing anything wrong. I eventually triumphed, but only after a fair few tries. I'd recommend this game to anyone. It's fast, colourful, funny and challenging. What more can you ask for?			"

Heed the warning I did not. They're not puzzles. You just switch ""dimensions"" that make one wall phase out of existence and the other wall phase into existence while jumping rapidly from wall to wall while having to change directions. It's aggravating and awful, and these jumps are all throughout the game after you beat the first boss. I can tell this would be a good game if not for thes horrible jumps. If you believe you have the reflexes of The Flash, Superman, Spider-Man, and Neo all rolled into one, then go right ahead.

It is definitely a metroidvania style game, with tons of exploration. Controls are tight, and it has a good balance of easy to pick up and play, but challenging. I'd say its about 8 or 9 hours long, but likely has good replayability. Co-op mode also helps with replayability. Glad I bought it.			"

												Guacamelee! is a beat'em-up/metroidvania hybrid. Whilst this may sound like a mouthful and a muddled game, what we get is a fun, cool and decently long adventure romp, that is sure to please many people around.Juan is a farmer who, when his love is kidnapped, takes on the mask and becomes a Luchador! Thus he begins his quest to save his love, smash Chozo statues and kick as many skeletons, cacti and bosses to faces Cacala, a mysterious soul who has the form of a skeleton. Along the way Juan unlocks powers from the Chozo statues and some bosses. What is very cool about this game is that many of the powers translate to combat (which, as mentioned, is in a beat'em-up style), such as the [Rooster] Uppercut not only sending the enemies into the air but also giving up a lift mid-jump. Or the Dashing [Derp Derp] helping you kick multiple enemies whilst going a little bit further horizontally.You can also change dimensions to reveal platforms or passages, or turn into a chicken to go into smaller passages. These are used for some challenging, but fun, platforming and puzzle sections.The soundtrack is also great, mixing Latin music with some techno. And almost all songs have alternate versions, for the Light and Dark dimensions. These transition well, and the soundtrack feels relative the the setting and tone of the game, Mexican, Upbeat and overall fun.I finished the game at around 65%-70% completion, so I still had a lot to collect, and I played the game for a good 6 hours (it says 12 as my file deleted... grumble grumble...). This percentage is made up of Health Containers, Stamina Blocks and Orbs (hard-to-find objects for the dedicated). I finished Cacala's final form with difficulty, but not to a extent where it felt cheap or annoying.Guacamelee! is a fun game, with a good soundtrack and an easy 6 hours of gameplay. Looking for a good game to spend some time with over the weekend? Grab Guacamelee! (and the soundtrack) and you won't regret it.			"

												Definitely recommend this game for anyone that likes Metroidvania style games. Combat is fluid and fun, and although simple at first, it can be comboed into something intricate. I played on the keyboard, but if you have a controller it will be a more enjoyable experience as the analogue sticks will allow you easier platforming and better angles when performing grappling moves. Probably my favorite part of the game was the art direction and music. The environments and characters are beautiful and just ooze style, and the Spanish theme and music helps really solidify the experience as memorable and unique. The game can be beaten 100% in less than 10 hours, and there isn't much replayability other than hard mode. Still a very solid game though, and one that should be experienced.			"

												Great atmosphere, amazing music, tight controls, ♥♥♥♥ing awful combat engine. After two hours of playing my arm was in physical pain. Fights become boring and tedious fast and I eventually found myself skipping fights just so I could get to the next area. The exploration was done pretty well, but it felt a bit light compared to other exploration/metroidvania games. A little too linear and railroady. Also, devs, if you're reading this, your plot was bad and your reference-based humour soured me on the game about as fast as your bad combat did. We get it, you played a video game before. It's not clever.			"

												This game has much to offer - quality animation style, bright colours, and a quirky combat system. The game doesn't have much in the way of story, but it doesn't need it. It follows the traditional platformer style - love interest has been captured by some bad guy, good guy pursues bad guy to save love interest - you know how it goes. Anyway, the game starts with baby steps. It can feel slightly frustrating when you first play it, but when you learn all the different ""moves/concepts"" of the combat system, you appreciate why they started so slowly. This combat system is, quite frankly, fantastic. When the enemies start gaining shields that you have to break, or they go into another dimension that you can't attack, you have to think quickly and act accordingly - button-mashing only gets you so far in this game. The difficulty mark-up is erratic, though. It starts fairly easy, and then the last part of the game is wincingly hard. It almost killed the experience entirely as it was so needlessly hard - I like difficult games, but this game's difficulty can offer you little by way of dodging/returning damage. Sometimes, you just get ♥♥♥♥ed over without doing anything wrong. I eventually triumphed, but only after a fair few tries. I'd recommend this game to anyone. It's fast, colourful, funny and challenging. What more can you ask for?			"

												Fighters are always fun, so if you like something like Street Fighter and something like Smash Brothers combined, then this game is most likely for you. Pulling off combos feels pretty satisfying, and it plays well. There's also numerous secrets, and if you're anything like me, you won't rest until you've found all or most of them.My only downside I have to say about this game is that it uses some rather overused and obnoxious memes, but those are in the background as posters, so it's nothing over the top.Guacamelee! is an awesome fighter/platformer, and you should definitely give it a go when you get a chance.

												Before starting, I must say that I played with a keyboard, and I don´t know how the game plays with a controller.This game controls are one of the WORST I´ve seen. The developers, (that apparently have♥♥♥♥♥♥for brains) want you to play this game with a contoller. If you play with a keyboard, you´re pretty much ♥♥♥♥ed. The game requires you to do special moves that are a combination of 2 keys, move and special, but here´s how it  works: You first press the move key AND THEN the special. If you press the 2 keys, nothing will happen. You MUST press the movement  key first AND THEN you press the ""Special"" key to do the Special move. This can get really frustrating in a fight, since you expect your movements to be quick, but performing them is just frustrating and the combat system is extremely flawed.Then you have the platforming. It is TERRIBLE! The game tries too much to be Mega Man, but the difference is that in Megaman, the controls were tight and precise. In Guacamelee, the controls are slidy and most of the times you will fall off the platform.Developers, how about you fix your ♥♥♥♥ing game AND take into consideration the players that DO NOT have a controller0/10Do not buy this			"

												Absolutely love this game. :-)At its heart, it's a simple metroidvania adventure with melee focus. However, the game shines in everything that it does right. You unlock moves and abilities during the adventure, each neatly fitting in with what you already know. The map makes it clear where you need to go (so it's a bit less exploration), but leaves you enough to encounter. Combat is tight and interesting: you gradually learn how to play without it ever feeling a chore to do.The Mexican theme is nice and (strangely enough) mix well with winks to various games like Zelda (I AM ERROR), Mario (the first boss) and of course metroid (the statues). I probably missed quite some.Also note that like Zelda, there are 2 overlapping worlds (life and death), which add to your arsenal of challenges to overcome.What else is there to say? Bosses are great, the saving and buying is great and there's plenty of chests to explore to upgrade your cash or your life or power-up meter. Enemies can be tough but never frustrating and the design makes use of all the powers you have.Any minusses? Hard to say. I hear keyboard/mice controls aren't that good, but I used a controller, so can't say. And perhaps there was a bit too much storyline at the start, but that's certainly not an issue.All in all: a great recommendation.:-)			"

												This is really hard for me.  This game has charm, fun references to famous classics, beautiful art, interesting gameplay ideas and it belongs to one of my favorite genres (Metroidvania).  But for the life of me, I just can't recommend it.  See the gameplay time I have on record?  I can assure you, without any shadow of a doubt, that more than half of it has been spent losing and retrying.  This game starts great, but at some point it becomes brutally difficult.Now, being fair here, the basic portion of the game is easy enough.  The game only becomes harder when you try to find extras and complete challenges.  You might say I shouldn't complain then, but see... this is a Metroidvania.  Its entire premise as a genre is to make exploration fun.  And this game turns exploration into an exercise in maddening frustration.  This should be the best part of the game, and instead it's so bad in comparison to the rest that you'd swear this game started as two different ones that at some point were mashed together for whatever unexplained reason.See, the more you advance the more abilities you unlock.  That's par for the course for the genre, and it's one of the most fun parts of these games.  The problem is that, unlike for all the other games in the genre, all your abilities are available at the same time.  That might seem like a good thing at first, except that now you're forced to remember an alarmingly large amount of special moves, because the game will force you to juggle many abilities at the same time to advance through many areas, which becomes even worse when you have to deal with Super Meat Boy -like scenery.I mean, a game like Super Meat Boy is fun because while it offers a challenge it relies on the simplicity of the controls.  Here you have to deal with the challenge while mastering an increasingly complex set of moves.  This becomes frustrating really fast and it's exacerbated by the fact that the controls are not particularly responsive.  Push Up and the game will do Left instead.  That's not a problem in the middle of walking, but it's definitely a problem when you're trying to do a special move and the game does a different one instead, which will happen half of the time.I can't help but think that most of the positive reviews come from people who don't try to explore in the game, or that never actually bothered to try and finish it.  Or people that have lots of free time so they don't care how much they lose.  Looking at the game's stats, I think it's quite telling that barely over 15% of the people have defeated the last boss.  Clearly most people are giving up way earlier.I have to be as fair as I can here.  Yes, I had a lot of fun with the game, but the frustration has severely trumped it.  That's why I can't recommend it, unless you're either unemployed with lots and lots of time to waste and nothing else to play.			"

												A fantastic Metroidvania game with direct references to Metroid. The setting and visual style of this game is fresh and unique and while it's not too difficult, the gameplay is satisfying and Guacamelee stands out among other games in this genre. The sights and sounds are a breath of fresh air after the usual guns-and-caves conventions of this type of game. Particularly fun with a girlfriend as the way they've decided to integrate co-op is such that the second player cannot hold you up. Luchador!			"

												This game has a very refreshing feel to it. The gameplay mechanics are innovative and fresh, and I really like all the references to  other video games scattered all over the game. Although the game can be very difficult, you will understand that it is due to your lack of skills instead of poor game design on the developer side. thumbs up.			"

												This is one of the best purchases I've made on steam this year.  At its heart, it's a Metroidvania-style game, but the surprisingly good gameplay mechanics, atypical but highly amusing lucha libre setting, endearing art style (nice change from all of the retro/pixel games lately), and witty dialogue make this a clear winner among similar games.  Combos are easy to string together, but still offer a lot of versatility. The platforming aspects, while at times challenging and requiring creativity, are not completely unforgiving and don't require split-second precision (i.e., Super Meatboy).  There are enough side quests to add some flavor, without turning the game into a massive collection of fetch quests.  And there's no need for constant backtracking and revisiting old areas (although you do get skills that unlock certain secret/optional rooms, those entrances are clearly marked on your map so you don't have to waste hours checking every wall in every previous area for a secret).  Bottom line, it's just plain fun.			"

												Fantastic game! Has a wonderful visual and musical aesthetic, with colorful environments and songs that get stuck in your head for hours afterward (in a good way). It also has a fun sense of humor, with billboards in-game referencing both other games, and memes. There are also a few easter eggs scattered around which i won't spoil. It is definitely a metroidvania style game, with tons of exploration. Controls are tight, and it has a good balance of easy to pick up and play, but challenging. I'd say its about 8 or 9 hours long, but likely has good replayability. Co-op mode also helps with replayability. Glad I bought it.			"

Are you a bad enough hombre to save your bride, defeat the villain and his baddies, and stop the destruction of the world?The platforming and hit detection are iffy ( especially when you are trying to get the good ending by getting all the orbs!

												Guacamelee! is a beat'em-up/metroidvania hybrid. Whilst this may sound like a mouthful and a muddled game, what we get is a fun, cool and decently long adventure romp, that is sure to please many people around.Juan is a farmer who, when his love is kidnapped, takes on the mask and becomes a Luchador! Thus he begins his quest to save his love, smash Chozo statues and kick as many skeletons, cacti and bosses to faces Cacala, a mysterious soul who has the form of a skeleton. Along the way Juan unlocks powers from the Chozo statues and some bosses. What is very cool about this game is that many of the powers translate to combat (which, as mentioned, is in a beat'em-up style), such as the [Rooster] Uppercut not only sending the enemies into the air but also giving up a lift mid-jump. Or the Dashing [Derp Derp] helping you kick multiple enemies whilst going a little bit further horizontally.You can also change dimensions to reveal platforms or passages, or turn into a chicken to go into smaller passages. These are used for some challenging, but fun, platforming and puzzle sections.The soundtrack is also great, mixing Latin music with some techno. And almost all songs have alternate versions, for the Light and Dark dimensions. These transition well, and the soundtrack feels relative the the setting and tone of the game, Mexican, Upbeat and overall fun.I finished the game at around 65%-70% completion, so I still had a lot to collect, and I played the game for a good 6 hours (it says 12 as my file deleted... grumble grumble...). This percentage is made up of Health Containers, Stamina Blocks and Orbs (hard-to-find objects for the dedicated). I finished Cacala's final form with difficulty, but not to a extent where it felt cheap or annoying.Guacamelee! is a fun game, with a good soundtrack and an easy 6 hours of gameplay. Looking for a good game to spend some time with over the weekend? Grab Guacamelee! (and the soundtrack) and you won't regret it.			"

												This is really hard for me.  This game has charm, fun references to famous classics, beautiful art, interesting gameplay ideas and it belongs to one of my favorite genres (Metroidvania).  But for the life of me, I just can't recommend it.  See the gameplay time I have on record?  I can assure you, without any shadow of a doubt, that more than half of it has been spent losing and retrying.  This game starts great, but at some point it becomes brutally difficult.Now, being fair here, the basic portion of the game is easy enough.  The game only becomes harder when you try to find extras and complete challenges.  You might say I shouldn't complain then, but see... this is a Metroidvania.  Its entire premise as a genre is to make exploration fun.  And this game turns exploration into an exercise in maddening frustration.  This should be the best part of the game, and instead it's so bad in comparison to the rest that you'd swear this game started as two different ones that at some point were mashed together for whatever unexplained reason.See, the more you advance the more abilities you unlock.  That's par for the course for the genre, and it's one of the most fun parts of these games.  The problem is that, unlike for all the other games in the genre, all your abilities are available at the same time.  That might seem like a good thing at first, except that now you're forced to remember an alarmingly large amount of special moves, because the game will force you to juggle many abilities at the same time to advance through many areas, which becomes even worse when you have to deal with Super Meat Boy -like scenery.I mean, a game like Super Meat Boy is fun because while it offers a challenge it relies on the simplicity of the controls.  Here you have to deal with the challenge while mastering an increasingly complex set of moves.  This becomes frustrating really fast and it's exacerbated by the fact that the controls are not particularly responsive.  Push Up and the game will do Left instead.  That's not a problem in the middle of walking, but it's definitely a problem when you're trying to do a special move and the game does a different one instead, which will happen half of the time.I can't help but think that most of the positive reviews come from people who don't try to explore in the game, or that never actually bothered to try and finish it.  Or people that have lots of free time so they don't care how much they lose.  Looking at the game's stats, I think it's quite telling that barely over 15% of the people have defeated the last boss.  Clearly most people are giving up way earlier.I have to be as fair as I can here.  Yes, I had a lot of fun with the game, but the frustration has severely trumped it.  That's why I can't recommend it, unless you're either unemployed with lots and lots of time to waste and nothing else to play.			"

												PRO:* Interesting combination of fighting game mechanics and platformer. * Nice theme CON: * Too much unavoidable twitch gameplay at later levels (5 hours in). For example if you were to google ""Guacamelee Tule Tree"", the top non-video results are of people asking for help on how to progress through that section. That section requires 4-5 button combos executed in succession with upwards of over dozen repetitions. Comically, one of the suggested solutions on the forum is to jam a paper under a key in your keyboard, so you don't end up getting carpal tunnel syndrome.			"

												Guacamelee is pure platforming pleasure and perfection. It's fun, stylised and quirky nature shine continuously. It starts off completely accessible and then slowly spirals into higher and higher difficulties by adding new mechanics and scenarios. In the early game you are forgiven for some sloppiness, buy the end game you must be a diety of precision. I really loved this game thoroughly. Highly recommended for people who like old school side scrolling games, an increasing skill curve, ultimately to be challenged, style and charisma in their games, perfect control mechanics, firm but fair solutions based platforming, and occasionally turning into a chicken. Not recommeded for anyone who like hand holding, infinte tutorial prompts, pay to win, one button to win, right click to win, and enjoy endless runners. This is a real bred in the bone platformer.

A lot of the jumps to secret areas can be hard, but the game doesn't really punish you at all for missing any jumps (instant respawn, usually on the platform you just jumped from) or dying from enemies.  It maintains a lot of crucial elements (map system, teleport system, unlockable areas early on that you can come back to later) that have been missing from a lot of other indie games that have tried to replicate the genre.

												This is exactly the sort of game that I usually enjoy, and yet it rubs me the wrong way at every opportunity.The play mechanics are too stiff, so movement and combat just don't feel fun.  When fighting, moves can be utilized in concert to air juggle, to maintain long combos, and to throw enemies at one another, but there really isn't any incentive to use these advanced techniques or even to vary attacks at all.Then there's the Metroid structure, which is too condensed—too simple, too transparent, and too predictable.  You're driven along a very narrow path of progression, and along the way you come across obvious markers for places you'll be able to enter once you receive the proper abilities.  It's just by-the-numbers, and being teased by these blocked-off side paths feels rote when it should feel exciting.  All of the game's puzzle-platforming challenges are characterized by the same workmanlike effort, too.All of this would be disappointing although perhaps not damning, but Guacamelee wears this constant, unfading caca-eating grin that the writing absolutely does not earn.  Many games love to wink at the player, but this one does it while standing over you in an arrogant pose.  The most egregious example I've come across was a hidden QR code.  I posted a screenshot complaining about how presumptuous and frustrating its inclusion is since I don't own any device capable of reading it, and a friend told me that it says ""Congratulations! You successfully identified and scanned a QR code! Great job!""  That's it.  That's the kind of reward you can expect for making the effort to discover secret paths.I wish this game was a person so I could punch it in its stupid face.			"

The keyboard controls are laggy. It is not the problem in the beginning, but later, when the heavy platforming begins, you can't afford to have loose controls. Often there is a pause after you switch dimensions and you are kind of thrown out of action. Sometime you are not sure, if the action was registered already so you press again and the hero does something stupid. Also loading screens in a 2d platformer is an annoyance especially in the modern time where you could load all the asset in ram since they are around ~570 MB.			"

												Dont make the mistake i did with Guacamelee, Dont take it for granted. I thought i had this game all figured out just by looking at it, man was i wrong. Part Platrofmer, Part RPG, Part Fighter, All Fun. The action, art style and humor of this game had me hooked. I overlooked this gem because i figured it was the typical platformer, a genre of game i dont enjoy. Guacamelee offeres a well balanced playstyle that everyone should be able to enjoy no matter your game type preference.			"

												A very fun side scrolling platformer. You get to do all of the luchador(wrestling) moves in this game, that is what makes it original and sets it apart from other games of this type. Also, the setting is in Mexico, so all of the NPCs talk spanglish(look it up if uyou dont know). Nice original setting and combat. Graphics are very interesting as well and the actual controls are tight and responsive, I give this game a stamp a HELL YEA!!!!!!			"

												It's a unique metroidvania game with art and music that has real soul. When you combine all the abilities and dimensional shifts, some sections present a daunting platforming challenge, but nothing that you can't nail in a handful of attempts. The combat system is deep and satisfying, and while becoming comfortable with combos gives you a satisfying advantage in your DPS, it's never something that's mandatory to fully master. There's plenty of bonus content in the Inferno optional stages that dramatically turn up the heat, with a notable section that really pushes everything you've learned to the limit. The bad guys, with an odd exception, are more interesting than the silent protagonist, but that is fine. Light humor and lots of cultural references.If you have a friend, the drop-in local co-op is a lovely addition.			"

												What would be AMAZING game is ruined by the most boring and annoying boss fights I've ever seen. I'm at the final boss stage (somehow I managed to beat the Jagual boss which was simply the most UNFAIR fight ever) and I'm done with this sh*t. First of all, the fight has 2 stages. You have to repeat the stage 1 every time you reload the game. This it literally WASTE OF EVERYONE'S TIME. It's POINTLESS. I'm an adult, I don't have time playing the same thing that I already beaten again and again. I want to TRY the stage 2 as I found it super hard before. But you and completely discouraging me to do so because I have to deal with stage 1 AGAIN. WHY? You don't feel ""I'll try today again, it's going to be fun!"". You feel ""I cannot be bothered with that first stage again, let's just uninstall that sh*t..."".Thanks for ruining the game for me, I'm never going to finish it now. I'm going to watch the ending on Youtube and pretend those 16 hours of my life never happened. ""Amazing experience - would waste my time again""			"

The game is just a poorly-written, badly-directed mess that comes across as somebody's high-school Spanish class project on meth: ill thought-out, incompetently executed and racist.

												Guacamelee is one of the best platforming games i've played the last year.The game is going with a mexican style and everything that relates to it ( Chili peppers, Dias de los Muerto's, Luchador's, Mexican Music, Pinata's) can be found.  Guacamelee is presented in a colourful way and with a very cheery and memorable soundtrack. The fighting system is enjoyable and gets expanded over time with a ton of unlockable moves.  On top of that, it's also possible to earn outfits and upgrades.  To add to the charm, Guacamelee is littered with game referenches to games like Grim Fandango, Super Mario Bros, Castle Crashers and Viva Pinata.Next point of discussion: the puzzles. There are a ton of little side puzzles that are harder than the main-path, but offer small rewards like extra coins for upgrades. These puzzles range from fairly easy to mindbending hard. Sometimes puzzles require you to remember a set of moves to use to get to the end-goal, while other times figuring out which moves you actually need to get the reward is an excersize on itself. To make the puzzles even harder, switching between the living world and the dead world is often necessary to reveal / hide platforms and obstacles. Often you will find yourself thinking about how you will have to tackle a puzzle and learning the muscle memory of the moves before you're actually able to pull it off.The story is fairly straightforward, but because of the small cast of interesting characters and the funny written dialog it feels fun to follow the story. Besides the mainstory, there are always a few little sidemissions to keep things interesting. The aforementioned puzzles are a side-mission on itself.Finally, the bossfights require you to use all the skills you previously learned in the game and are often pretty hard, but you never feel like you will need to google for a solution.

												I have enjoyed this game so far. Nice metroidvania with a Luchador twist!The combat is interesting. It has a strong focus on ""grappling"" with enemies, giving you the ability to throw them around and into other enemies. Combos are a huge part of the game and keeping them going with chaining throws, slams, punches, kicks and headbutts can be very rewarding. The platforming elements are equally rewarding and require you to use an equally large selection of moves to complete some of the puzzles. The game has a nice learning curve. You start off with only a few moves and pick up many more as the the game goes along.  Later on some of the challenges can be a bit frustrating when the controls don't respond as fast as you'd like, but it's nothing that can't be overcome.The map is free roaming, but certain areas are blocked off until you unlock the moves required to access them. In addition going back to areas you've already played through can reveal new secrets to be accessed with your new techniques.The graphics are unique. They look like they could be vector art, the lines are clean and colors sparse but vivid. The many costumes availible keep the variety going. There's also many ireferences to nternet meme and other indie games that are interesting to find.Gameplay: 7.5 Good challenge. Large Variety of moves. Responsiveness can be frustrating durring difficult puzzles.Graphics: 9 Characters with a clean vivid look. Large selection of costumes. Nice backgrounds.  Sound: 7 Nice music and sound effects.Time: 8 You'll get a good chunk of play out of the game.			"

												Very good game, but sadly some parts of this game is broken.For example the 3rd bossfight with Javelier Jaguar is very hard to win.The boss has attack pattern where you cannot dodge or evade, thus you only can take the damage.This leads to ragequit.Sereously, don't buy that game unless you want to punish yourself			"

												More Metroid than 'vania, Guacamelee's greatest strength lies in it's visual style. The lucha-themed world is unique and, with the exception of an unfortunate obsession with memes, is unlike anything I've seen in a game. The fighting is simple, but fun, and the platforming can reach meat-grinder levels of difficulty that will reward sharp reflexes. The only difficulty-related complaint I can think of is that, in order to obtain the best ending, one must complete two platforming segments that are leagues more difficult than anything else in the game. These sections will try your patience, so be prepared!			"

												Guacamelee! Gold Edition is a Metroid-vania style action-platformer set in a magical Mexican inspired world. The game draws its inspiration from traditional Mexican culture and folklore, and features many interesting and unique characters. Guacamelee! builds upon the classic open-world Metroid-vania style of games, by adding a strong melee combat component, a new dimension switching mechanic, and cooperative same-screen multiplayer for the entire story. The game also blurs the boundaries between combat and platforming by making many of the moves useful and necessary for both of these. Travel through a mystical and mysterious Mexican world as a Luchador using the power of your two fists to battle evil. Uncover hidden wrestling techniques like the Rooster Uppercut, and Dimension Swap to open new areas and secrets.			"

												I love this game, but holy crap does it get insanely hard with its button combos that you will need to do (do combo 1-2-3 and 8 to JUMP over this high wallk and ATATCK!), just to advance the game. This drove me to the point I got so angry with it, I went to the main menu to lower the difficulty... only to find there is't a game difficulty settings.wth?So, I left the game for dead and moved on to other games. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this and got it during a sale.For those that love a challenge, you will love this game.Others that want to be entertained, be forewarned, it gets quite difficult later on in the game.I would't recommend this game, on the basis that it does't even have a user set difficulty setting - which I hear only appears when you FINISH the game.*shrug*WTH indeed.

												Its best quality is the art direction of the graphics. You get to play as a Luchadore and beat♥♥♥♥♥with cool wrestling power moves. The jumping puzzle parts could have been left out because they are just frustrating. It should be a pure face beating action game. One does not exactly think of extremely difficult/frustrating jumping puzzles when they think of a luchadore wrestler. Pro tip: spend all of your points on as much health upgrades as you can, you will need them. Most frustrating enemy makes me want to pull my hair out are the fast moving yellow guys.Overall a cool indie game. Not as good as some other indie games I've played but still very well done. 7/10			"

												Not gonna lie, I am not a big fan of the metroidvania genre but this game somehow got me hooked. I think it was mostly because it was a well paced game, it didn't feel either too long or too short, I managed to beat it in about 5 hours but with some extras left that'll probably bump up to about 10 hours. The combat is like marmite, you either love it or hate it. Some find it clunky and others like me find it smooth and fluid. I don't think its the combat itself but rather the animations. Soundtrack is amazing, it really immerses you within the world. I think the best feature of this game is that you can switch between the world of the living and the dead and the style changes dramatically between the two, reminds me a lot of Giana Twisted Dreams, if you enjoy that give this a go and vice versa. Would highly recommend this game.			"

												Do not buy if you dont have lightning fast reflexes.This game is impossible to complete unless you have near-instant reflexes to stuff and can perform multiple complex special moves (with a variety of keys) straight after each other, in sequence. This probably cant be enjoyed by anyone age over 25, as our reflexes start to decline, and the games designers have not accounted for this as there is no skill level setting, you either can do multiple comlpex sequences of keypresses or not.I find this disheartening, as it means I will never complete this game. And it is a fun game, up to a certain point. Then it just asks you to do things which are basically impossible unless you want to sit on one screen for three hours, trying over and over again to master a set of keypresses (and how has anyone even got that much patience?).Up until ""the"" point, where I threw in the towel, I was having a good time, the game is funny, has a good artstyle and besides the hyper-reflex requirement, the gameplay was really nice. Its a shame that it cant be finished due to a lack of difficulty setting.			"

												There aren't too many fighting games on Linux, so this game has little competition right now. It's a solid beat-em up featuring lots of chain moves, an emphasis on out-thinking your opponents and strategies rather than just button mashing and even something approaching a PLOT. As a Luchador brought back from the dead, you must save El Presidente's daughter and defeat Calacas before his plans to rule both the living and the dead can be completed.I will point out that you should pad the walls of the room where you play this because it will, sooner or later, engage your gamepad in high velocity transit from your hands towards some solid object. The platforming in this game requires thought, timing and accurate button presses, and there are times ....Even so, it is doable. You just have to perservere, although it will be a while before I attempt to get the Tule Tree orb again...			"

Guacamelee! was part of the same bundle.I never would have bought it on it's own, but I had it, and it seemed like a low-commitment game, so I gave it a shot.  As it turns out, it's a really, really solid platformer!  Yes, my expectations were low, but it didn't just exceed them... this game is genuinely fun, and I'm making time in my day to come back to it.It's more about pulling off well-timed button combos than it is solving puzzles, but there's a good mixture of both -- especially if you're looking for Easter Eggs.  If you enjoyed classic console platformers, you're really going to enjoy the elements of this game that pay hommage to those.			"

Has a very catchy soundtrack, good combat once you wrap your head around it (tip: dodge dodge doge, protip: get the skeleton costume that let's you have infinite stamina, it's like cheating), and is just difficult enough not to drive you nuts like Dark Souls or the like but still provide challenge, and is just plain fun.  One of those games you can go back to 10 years from now and still have a good time.			"

												Think metroidvania in 1080p, a flat, colorful, and borderless art style, tighter controls, and a contageous sense of humor. This game really shines in its gameplay. The game is a brawler at heart, and its tight controls lend itself to a easy-to-learn, hard-to-master combo system that is satisfying to traverse through as you purchase more moves. The story is not novel-worthy; it involves a few unconnected subplots that eventually lead up to facing the grand boss. The characters, however, are memorable and all have their own unique, though twisted and somewhat ADD, quirks.The bosses are challenging and satisfying. There are moments when the game locks you in an enclosed space and force a battle between you and waves of enemies. Not only do these battles reward you with a pinata and a sense of satisfaction after, they also force you to learn the combos before you proceed (some enemies can only be broken with a certain type of move). There are rooms that are dedicated to puzzle-platform rewards. They're almost always completely optional but yield a nice reward (like a heart piece) and a sense of achievement after.I loved this game to the core.			"

												If you love color, beat-em ups, and metroid then this the game for you. With countless video game and internet meme references, this charming indie title kept me enthralled. You'll journey betewen the realm of the living and dead all to save El Presidente's Daughter from the evil hands of Calaca, whose ultimate goal is to rule over both planes. With many challenges and enemies that aren't oustandingly diverse, but different enough to really test your skills, this title feels like the love child of metroid and final fight. Definitely would recomend to everyone, though you may want to wait for the super turbo edition to come out later this year, at the same time, if this is on sell grab it, it is well worth it.			"

												Super fun, addiciting, beat-em-up gameplay! I love beat-em-up's (this, Castle Crashers, Scott Pilgrim, etc.) and wow this game is insanely good. It's also a Metroid-vania which basically is like the style of a 2D Metroid or 2D Castlevania game basically where there is one map that you stay at that you can explore and stuff, kind of hard to explain but it basically means a lot of exploration and upgrades. This isn't one of those brawlers where you can just walk across a screen and mash buttons. There are actually levels, it's a platformer as well. So yeah I could go on and on just buy this freakin' game. I wanted it before it was released but it was PS3 and PS Vita exclusive so when it dropped onto Steam, I picked it up instantly.			"

												Guacamelee first appealed to me because of the art and humor. Since I haven't played platformers in a long time it took quite a lot of practise to progress once you get halfway through the game. Not that the game is too unforgiving, the progression of difficulty is very well done. The combo system works very smoothly and you need to adjust your tactics according to the arenas ,especially in hard mode; it is very satisfying to chain many attacks into one giant combo. A lot of extra stuff is present in the game like hidden treasures and the challenges, which are very diverse and take persistence and concentration to complete. Some parts were borderline frustrating for me to complete with my skill, a top 5:1. Javier hard mode (skill cancel and quick second strikes, don't try for 3h continuously like me, take some breaks)2. Flame face hard mode (his skills + dealing with yellow skeletons)3. Secret jumping puzzle in Sierra Morena (vanishing platforms of doom)4. Bone on Bone achievement (flying bones and lightning is a deadly combo)5. The 4 lightning shooting skeleton arena in the Great Temple on hard mode (4 x lightning = 256 x the trouble)I really brushed up my platform & beat'em up skills after they gathered dust for some years!TLDR: An awesome and hilarious platformer with a large variety of puzzles, arenas, and tough boss fights, beautiful artwork, and brutal challenges and achievements.

												Just finished defeating the last boss and the game has been amazing. Not only is it a good Metroidvania game, you can't button mash to win, making you think of what to do and discover how to do certain parts through trial and error. The artstyle is also amazing and original, a Day of the Dead metroidvania? Whoever thought of that was a genius. And it also provides quite a challenge. Kinda on the short side, but the pacing was good so I don't really mind.Although there are some flaws, like the fact that they'll gladly throw a room of enemies at you where you get overwhelmed too much if you're not good with the combat, which seems a bit cheap when they do it rather early.Also, with steam workshop, you can play as Johnny Bravo or Bayonetta beating the crap out of dead people. Need I say more? A definite recommendation.			"

												Back in the day I played lots of platformers, and it seems like Guacamelee has taken all the best features from those games, and thrown in some fun new stuff. The platforming and melee fighting seem a bit simple and even quite easy at first, but once you learn all the special moves and attacks, things suddenly get a whole lot more complicated. I suspect that the game might be a little bit on the easy side for some hardcore gamer, but for me the difficulty was just perfect - some of the areas were very tricky and frustrating, but never too frustrating, and while most areas won't cause anyone too much trouble, the game never gets too easy either. The combat system feels really good once you get used to it and the melee fights are fun, especially the boss fights.What I love just as much as the actual gameplay though, is the art design and music of Guacamelee. The whole Mexican theme with some totally ridiculous stuff (crazy special moves such as Rooster Uppercut or Goat Fly, a special ability called Pollo Power that turns you into a chicken, etc...), thrown in is simply awesome. The funny little details and some of the silly dialogue actually made me laugh, I love the humour in Guacamelee. It's not a very long game, even with the DLC and the Hard Mode. According to Steam it took me 30 hours to find all the treasures and secrets and to finish the game in normal difficulty, and then another time in Hard Mode. And thus Guacamelee became the first and only (and probably the last) game ever where I've unlocked all the achievements!Guacamelee! is also the winner of the prestigious Tomiboo's GOTY 2013 award!tldr; Great game, buy it NOW.

												FANTASTIC. Guacamelee = A metroidvania with a mexican luchdor and a pretty damn good melee combat system. Guacamelee is what's called a ""metroidvania"". An open world 2D platformer with certain paths restricted until you obtain new traversal abilities. You can also backtrack to previous areas with your newly aquired abilities and find power ups and other secrets. As far as this genre goes, Guacamelee is one of the best.Graphics  - It's a great looking game. The art is colorful and fits the game perfectly. Whatever outfit your character is wearing, the animation is smooth and fluid. In addition, there are a lot of little nods and easter eggs to pop culture and gaming sprinkled in and it really helps to give the world character. Story - No surprises here. Typical ""rescue the princess"" story we've had since the dawn of time. It serves the game well enough, but don't expect any curveballs. Gameplay - Control is tight and spot on. Moving around the levels feels great and you're consistenly given new abilities so it never feels boring. There's also a healthy dose of combat that has enough depth to keep you interested. Those moves you use to open up new areas? They also function as attacks. By the end of the game, you have a great set of skill at your disposal to take out the bad guys. This bring me to one of my few complaints about this Guacamelee. Enemies will gain one to 5 different types of shields in addition to being in one of two worlds you can switch between, the enemy only being attackable in one world. It can be a bit much to deal with later in the game when there is so much going on, especially when the enemies seem to get their shield back almost instantly. Small gripe, but not enough to ruin the game. One more thing. There are some downright devious platforming sections. Nothing as bad as Super Meat Boy or IWBTG, but they can get a bit hairy. Especially when you have to double jump, wall bounce, uppercut, wall bounce, etc... all in one combination. If you're into that, you'll love this game and you do feel great when you finally nail it. Replay Value - There is a ""good"" ending if you find all the hidden pieces of a certain item, secrets to find and areas to go back and get to 100%. There are also a few sidequests, and a ""hard"" mode. Once you've beaten the game and gotten the good ending though, you've seen just about everything. If you're even remotely a fan of metroidvanias, or platformers in general. Pick up Guacamelee. It's one of the best in the genre and more than that, it's a simply a great game.			"

It is a beautiful, well designed Metroidvania full of style, humor, and imagination.  The impeccable presentation certainly doesn't disappoint, nor does the consistently hilarious writing and thoroughly excellent platforming.Speaking of which, Guacamelee has some unexpected influences, including Wall Jumping right out of Super Meat Boy.There's very little to complain about, short of difficulty spikes that can be overcome with a little persistence.  Overall, it's an extremely well polished game well deserving of your time and attention.			"

												Overall, this is one of my favorite games of the year (and I probably would never have bought it except that I saw it on sale during the Steam sale).  The combat is surprisingly fun given that there really are only a handful of moves, and the pace at which you receive new powers throughout the game keeps things fresh.One issue, though not affecting my overall feeling about the game, is the occassionally frustrating platforming sections (especially some of the Tula Tree sections that are necessary to progress in the game).  As some other reviewers have mentioned, the control scheme can be awkward during these platforming sections.  In particular, the assignment of the light/dark world changes to the right trigger can make it difficult when needing to switch worlds while jumping.  I think it would have been better if there had at least been an option to remap the controls to be able to map the world switch to a face button.			"

												Guacamelee is like a challenging cross between Mario and Super Meat Boy.  It is equal parts fighting enemies and solving difficult puzzles to progress to new areas.  A controller is definately recommended for this game.  There are many fighting and jumping moves that require quick and timely button presses to succeed.  Two player co-op is fun but you'll want to work out an agreement with your partner as to who controls the switching back and forth from living to dead world.  The art and styling of the game is a great bonus.  As you struggle on the next puzzle you can spend a few resting seconds to admire the colorful environments.  Many subtle placed references to internet or gaming icons.			"

												A wonderful Metroidvania platformer brawling game, with vivid and fun graphical styling, a decent sense of humor and a huge amount of references to other indie games and internet memes. Platforming in this open world relies on the use of an ever expanding list of new methods to get a little bit more movement from special attacks, thus allowing further progress into new zones or back into secret treasures hidden in hard to get too places. Failure rarely ever sets you back very far, usually one or two jumps back in most places, but in some more rare and almost always optional content places a mistimed jump or incorrect sequence of joystick motions and button presses can net a frustrating loss of work. A gamepad is really suggested. The brawling elements are pretty fun, combos and special powers are nice and fun to use, but attack button mashing plus the use of throws is all that is needed for most fights early in the game. Overall difficulty is pretty good, and not too hard for all the necessary plot content, with the most difficult jumping puzzles and fights (other than boss battles) being left purely for the got a have it all collectable and achievement hunters.

												Great game!I got it with the humble bundle pack, but if I knew about it beforehand, I would have paid full price. It's challenging, fun, and diverse. I'll admit that after the second playthrough, combat got annoying, but not enough to stop playing. There are references in about every space you travel through. I couldn't help but stop and admire all the thought that went into putting these refernces in. The controls are a bit challenging to get a hang of, but the game does this on purpose. Getting a hang of the controls is usually half the puzzle. And hard mode was was exactly that, hard. Some games will give you lower health and slap on a ""hard"" in there. Guacamelee accually tries to give you a challenge the second time around. The only huge let-downer to the game is there's no reason to go back after you've 100%'d hard mode. That being said, I was pleased with the amount of content. Buy the game, you won't regret it.			"

												This game is a definite must buy. I loved it. It's a platformer/beat em up with a lot of charm. The brilliant colourful animation and great soundtrack really give the game character and it sets it apart from other indie platformers. It's quite a fun and challenging game and while difficult at times it's one of those games where trying over and over again will reap rewards.I'd give this game 9/10. Highly recommended.			"

												Despite the name and how the theme may seem a bit... corny and stereotypical? This game is fantastic. The Day of the Dead and the imagery associated with it has been a popular fashion/photography/art trend for while and it grows stronger with each passing year. This game captures that theme perfectly, but presents it in a fresh and funky way. The visuals are spectacular, the music is fitting, and the mechanics are ridiculously fun while being extremely easy to learn. (This game handles tutorials so well. It's almost a thing of art.) There are also plenty of optional side things for you to do in the game if you want to increase the challenge. If you love action platformers, pick this up ASAP.			"

												When Monaco and The Swapper were part of the same Humble Bundle, I picked it up without hesitation.  Guacamelee! was part of the same bundle.I never would have bought it on it's own, but I had it, and it seemed like a low-commitment game, so I gave it a shot.  As it turns out, it's a really, really solid platformer!  Yes, my expectations were low, but it didn't just exceed them... this game is genuinely fun, and I'm making time in my day to come back to it.It's more about pulling off well-timed button combos than it is solving puzzles, but there's a good mixture of both -- especially if you're looking for Easter Eggs.  If you enjoyed classic console platformers, you're really going to enjoy the elements of this game that pay hommage to those.			"

You could combo your special platforming moves into your fighting which leads to all sorts of flying bodies all over the screen.

												I was looking for an indie game that would run smoothly on my laptop, and would be playable wired up to my television. I wanted a good platformer to play with a friend in coop mode, and boy, did I get one. Guacamelee is both extremely fun and extremely challenging, the campaign is pretty long, we couldn't finish it through in close to 10 hours. It gets both the fight system and the platform sections perfectly balanced, though it is at times pretty f'ing hard. I strongly recommend playing it with a friend, the coop is nearly flawless. And if you're into the latino folklore, don't think twice: it's probably worth it's original price, but you shouldn't wait for the christmas sales to end. Enjoy.			"

You'd be doing yourself a disservice not picking up and supporting this game.  I can't speak highly enough at how fun and inventive the combat is in here, after unlocking a couple of moves, you're able to mix n match abilities for some destructive fun that will def put a smile on your face!  The game is stunningly beautiful with a solid story, great use of folklore/myths as well as culture to create a imaginative world.  It also has perhaps the best soundtrack of this year!			"

It's one of those Metroidvania type games. You know...explore, come back when you have new powers to unlock new areas, explore some more. Boss battles were easy because you're forced to play normal difficulty before unlocking the hard difficulty (I hate when developers do this because I'm not one for replaying games). No replayabitilty because I already did everything in the first run, which took me about 6 or so hours to beat. Steam says 10 hours because I idled for a few hours.			"

												This is a style of game like Super Metroid, wherein new abilities acquired steadily throughout allow the player to access paths that are initially blocked. Said abilities are useful in both movement and combat. Like a punch that propels the player quickly forward, used to thump butts OR reach difficult areas.Many a pop culture reference can be found, along with chuckle-worthy dialog throughout the three to five-hour campaign. Hidden or optional areas not necessary to ""beat"" the game provide the greatest challenge in terms of combat and/or platforming.All in all a good time. Five stars, relative to it being an indie download type of game. Olé!			"

												Metroidvania, Luchadores, and a Samurai-Jack-esque art style. Yeah, I can get on board with this. And co-op, although local only, which on the PC is a crying shame. I'd love a co-op metroidvania experience. The gameplay is solid, the art style is charming. My only other quibble is the somewhat shoddy handling of character selection. In a single-player game (which let's face it, you're almost certainly playing on PC since again, no online co-op), you start the story as Juan and can only switch to the second main character, Tostada, after the introductory area. Even if you do, the game seems to not acknowledge Tostada's presence at all during the story, with NPCs still talking as though they were dealing with Juan. It's not a huge thing, but it's just sort of a missing feature that really would have knocked this out of the park on an already impressive game. It's a 4/5 for me that easily could have been a 5/5 if they'd clean up how the game handles it if you want to play Tostada and involve her more in the story. An alternate opening along with some minor edits to dialogue would do the trick nicely.			"

												Wonderful Mexican-themed Metroidvania game with great hand-to-hand combat and occasionally diabolical platforming (generally easy other than the secret levels required to unlock the orbs). The comparison to Metroid is not a token one -- the Metroid references are so explicit as to leave no doubt that it is a deliberate homage. It's packed with other easter eggs, too, including references to Zelda, Megaman, and a hidden message in the language of Fez.It's gorgeous (both audio and video) and perfectly polished. There are so many little touches that it's clear the game was a labour of love; my favourite part is probably the appropriate chicken-form for each costume.Easily one of the best platformers ever made.

Theres lot of other pop culture and video game references to be found in the game as you venture forth to rescue your childhood friend. You fight enemies by using lucador attacks and combos. The higher the combo, the more gold you will fetch which is needed to purchase upgrades or can even be used to purchase alternative costumes. Did I also mention there is local 2 player co-op? Online co-op is really the only thing this game is missing. 4/5			"

												Such an astounding game! Never had this much fun since Bastion. I love it how they put some Nintendo elements in there like Metroid and Mario! Don't let anyone fool you by NOT getting this game! Worth every penny. The combo attacks are very impressive and you can do so much! Never tried co-op yet so I'm guessing it will double the fun. If you're 'picky' about the graphics in this game will please don't bother. The artstyle enough is eyecandy and you will most def. pause just to see whats around. The soundtrack is quite good and worth every penny (get it if you enjoy video games tunes). JUST PLAY THE GAME AND ENJOY IT YOURSELF NOW!!!			"

												Well I have had a cracking time playing through this game. It uses the common platform mechanic of getting new special moves as you progress through the game, allowing you to access areas that were inaccessible before. The combat is satisfying and allows you to string some fairly meaty combos together as well as using the main power moves. There are some pretty challenging platform sections that had me pulling my hair out for a bit, but not so hard that it makes you lose interest & give up the challenge.I have never played a game with this kind of art style and atmosphere before. The graphics and the music really draw you in; the whole Mexican Luchador vibe is pulled off perfectly, and has a nice story with some funny touches. I have completed the game, but will go back to it to get those last few secret sections/chests etc. And I think the challenge arenas down in hell will keep me occupied for a while!Would thoroughly recommend this to any one who likes platforming games, with a good bit of combat as well. Brilliant fun.			"

												Simply superb ""metroidvania"" platformer. The game oozes character and style. The platforming is tight and intuitive (a controller is seriously recommended), the art style is fantastic as well as the world it immerses you in. Once again, this is a game that knows how to use humour to make things even more enjoyable.The difficulty balance is perfect, as you progress in the game, not only do you gain new abilities and skills but you really learn how to use them to maximum effect. My favourite aspect of the gameplay would have to be the puzzle-like platform sequences to reach hard to find chests. You'll find this game is both a test of problem solving and dexterous skill.Verdict: A must-play! No one should miss out on this superb game (unless of course you are irrationally prejudiced against platformers.)			"

												What a fantastic metroidvania! I cannot overstate just how well done Guacamelee is all together. The game  has an original feel largely thanks to to its animation influenced art style. The game has loads of humor to boot and it is just darn fun. While combat is a staple of metroidvanias, Guacamelee has a beat  'em up feel to its system. Combat is done by chaining punches together with the main attack button. As you progress you will learn four combat special moves executed with another button or key and a direction. These can be chained together for long combos. Also there is a grab move that can be executed on enemies have taken enough damage. The basic system is simple and common to many fighting games and brawlers, but I have not encountered it in a 2D metroidvania before. Guacamelee also has a heavy focus on precise platforming sections. These sections can range in difficulty, from simple to hand-cramping tough.The aerial acrobatics that your character is put through defy easy description, or even recallable button input. But after that last time he had to do a wall run, air dash, dimensional phase, double jump, flaming uppercut, and punch for that little extra distance.... I really wished I could have just reach in and given him a good length of rope.Overall a really great game though.			"

												ULTRA FUN side-scrolling lucha action game. Very easy to get into, but over time the Luchador's abilities pile up, making for some interesting combos (an NPC will ""train"" you with some of the mashups that you can do with the abilities). Some fights are very tough, I relied on my buddy to finish some of the bosses (taking turns resurrecting during a battle). Highly recommended for any kind of gamer - this is the type of game that you can just pick up and go anytime. Perfect for plays in between your more serious games.			"

												The early part of this game is colorful, charming, and highly enjoyable.  The music is great, the references are quirky and it briskly evolves into a fun and comedic metroid/castlevania with a intricate combat system and satisfying level design with purposeful rooms that teach you more about your repitoire of available actions.  Then just before the final world, it becomes a convuluted version of Super Meat Boy, with an sudden and jarring spike in difficulty, twitch reaction based trial and error sequences, and unforgiving checkpoints.  You know, to put it simply, the reason why Super Meat Boy works and this game does not is that SMB's controls only require that you jump at the right place and at the right time.  In Guacamelee, you not only need to jump at the right place and at the right time, but also in the right dimension while dashing, power punching, double jumping, wall running, and goat flying. Logicstically, the puzzles aren't even hard to solve, they're just borderline impossible to execute on the first 20 tries.   As a result, a game that started with the promise of having fun in a colorful world of Mexican towns and countrysides becomes a frustrating excercise of piloting my awkwardly moving avatar from one abstract platform surrounded by sawblades to another abstract platform surrounded by spikes... the sudden twist is alarming and if it's something this studio doesn't realize, or are unwilling to admit, they're next title will be a scary proposition. It's a unnerving choice in game design to lock away the ""best ending"" behind the hardest machinations of the game, and provide a ""regular ending' that so morose and completely unexpected that it clashes with the light-hearted tone established in the other 99% of the the game prior.  When a player doesn't even know that he or she has to collect secret orbs that are well hidden in the game it makes the default ending provide absolutely no pay off for the player's actions up to that point.  ""I know we promised you cake, but here's a dirty boot instead!""  The default ending really destroyed my morale to continue further in the game.  And the ""true"" ending serves as no substantial improvement in resolving the remaining storylines presented in the game.  I mean, who was the Guardian of the mask?  Why did the villians have more personality and background than any of the good main characters?  What happened to all of the unresolved story lines: did the devil stay as a chicken?  What happened to the Jaguar Man? Even if we saved the girlfriend in distress is the world of the living/dead still threatened with evil spirits and skeletons? At best we only see a kiss and then the credits roll at the end, as if that solved all of the major world issues.  For the amazing writing and world up to that point, I expected better. What's even worse is that the either ending of the game is wholly irrelevant when considering that the main character can freely travel between the world of the living and the dead.  The sullen ending provided by the default ending is absolutely ludicrous given that if the hero just pressed LB, he'd immediately be in the world of the dead and be reunited with his childhood love interest.  No wait, LB makes you dodge, I meant RB.  Wait, what was RB for again... goat run?  Belly flop?  Turn into a chicken?  Great music, colorful world, charming casts of antagonists, but ultimately a large mistep in game design puts pressure on the mechanics of Guacamelee turning it from a silly and inspired romp into a frustrating tedious platformer.

												Great game!I got it with the humble bundle pack, but if I knew about it beforehand, I would have paid full price. It's challenging, fun, and diverse. I'll admit that after the second playthrough, combat got annoying, but not enough to stop playing. There are references in about every space you travel through. I couldn't help but stop and admire all the thought that went into putting these refernces in. The controls are a bit challenging to get a hang of, but the game does this on purpose. Getting a hang of the controls is usually half the puzzle. And hard mode was was exactly that, hard. Some games will give you lower health and slap on a ""hard"" in there. Guacamelee accually tries to give you a challenge the second time around. The only huge let-downer to the game is there's no reason to go back after you've 100%'d hard mode. That being said, I was pleased with the amount of content. Buy the game, you won't regret it.			"

												Guacamelee is such a fun platformer - even if you're not completely sure about getting the game, DO IT! There is a strong Latin American (Mexican) presense in the game, perfect for anyone, even if you know no Spanish. There are plenty of jokes and easter eggs, but combat and core gameplay are what really make this. Every level has a new set of challenges, different from the last, so each portion of the game feels fresh. Bosses are hard, but not impossible, making for awesome and fast-paced battles. The story is alright, but I think the added DLC makes up for it. Do yourself a favor and pick up the game!			"

												Be warned, a generic universal PC controller will not work for this game, however after some tweaking the controls with mouse and keyboard are not too difficult.  The only thing that bothers me is the over emphasis on combo fighting, and fighting in general in this game.  But it does have a nice adventurous feel and I am enjoying the progression and semi ""rpg"" nature of the leveling up process, similar to say a zelda game with heart peices etc.  Thumbs up for atmosphere and just the right amount of ""puzzle solving"" (some tricky jumping areas), and secret rooms.

From crossing dimensions to turning into chickens, this game has a lot more in store than what you would imagine from a Luchadore.I have a feeling I still have yet to scratch the surface on this game, and hope to see what is left!I really recommend this game.

												I want to like this game. I want to recommend it. But I just can't because of a couple of reason. The combat is decent, but feels stiff, as does the platforming. The controls start out being good and manageable, but quickly get bloated. I often would mean to do one move but end up doing another. Much of the platforming gets frustrating and rage-inducing mid to late game and ultimately I just quit, no longer caring to see the end.It's a great idea, but executed poorly.			"

												This game is an homage to the games from my childhood. The whole early 1990's gameplay; look and feel seems to be a fad these days with this whole indie/pixel-art  ""sub-culture."" While I usually tend to skip these games, Gucameelee!'s charm reeled me in and the whole experience simply nails it in my book. The presentation, story, combat, and soundtrack are beyond top notch (especially when you consider it was developed by a team of 10!) However, this whole torturous love/hate relationship that exists in some of the later platforming levels (perhaps a cheap Logitech controller is partly to blame) might turn some people off. Having said that, at $15 full price (and as cheap as $3 on a Steam Sale) it is virtually a no-brainer purchase if you yearn for a good platformer set within a quirky and memorable world as a break from an ocean of modern day Triple A games.

												This is where the reviews really help; I saw this game, but wasn't sure about it.  Then, I read the reviews and most were positive.  This is a side-scrolling game that is a lot of fun to play.  The graphics are different, but beautiful and give the game its own style.  I'm a mouse and keyboard player, but after playing about five hours decided to try an xbox controller as it was recommended.  The controller definitely made a difference by making the moves in the game easier to input.  I would recommend this game as it has a great art style, has some great platforming puzzles to get through, and is a lot of fun to play.			"

												In Guacamelee! you play as the underdog luchador hero Juan, fighting to save the doncella hermosa, El Presidente's daughter from the clasps of Calaca, the king of the dead. You play in a beautiful landscape, with a vibrant, blocky texture to it, and the music combines traditional, mexican mariachi with electro pop, resulting in a really awesome soundtrack.I can easily say that this game gave me the most enjoyment a 2d platformer ever has in the past. With many hours of content, including some really fun and fluid combat which doesn't get old quickly, as well as some very well done megaman-style platforming challenges, this game is definitely worth the money. 10 out of 10.

												Guacamelee oozes style and polish from every frame. It's a pitch-perfect Metroidvania (explorable map, powerups to open new paths, etc) with satisfying combo-driven brawler combat that stays both entertaining and challenging from start to finish. The game is also loaded with secrets that provide extra challenge for the truly hardcore, including a gauntlet-style challenge and (in the Infierno bonus content) a series of challenge rooms that test your timing, speed, and combat savvy.The game also supports two-player (local only, I believe) coop, with the second player as the luchadora Tostada. A solo player can also swap to Tostada if they choose, though the game's script will still refer to the player as ""Juan.""Playing with a controller is strongly recommended.			"

												A welcomed change to all the other Metroivania wannabes. Guacamelee offers a fresh mix of style and gameplay one would expect from this sub-genre of 2D games. It avoids the weapon based shooting combat of other games by employing a hand-to-hand combo system that is quite fun to play with and can be pretty rewarding on harder difficulty because it requires the player to use a variety of moves to be successful. You'll find yourself excited to come across enemies just so you can pull off huge combos with wrestling moves in the style of Lucha libre. Defeating enemies will reward you with money that can be used to purchase more combat moves, outfits that offer stat boosts, or upgrading the health and stamina bar. While not fighting a somewhat limited set of enemies, Guacamelee's main gamepaly is actually the level traversing and its focus on platforming. At its best, the game requires the player to use Juan's, our protagonist, short list of power-ups such as the standard double jump to the wall running ability in order to manuever through the environment.  Another power-up that allows Juan to switch between two worlds on the fly adds to the clever level design. At its worse, it is basic jumping from one platform to another, but that doesn't detract from gameplay at all. Players will be searching hidden areas to find chests and more powerups. If you want to know what they are, you'll have to play the game yourself.Guacamelee is not only fun to play, but visually and aurally, it's a treat. The art is cartoony with a Mexican theme and littered around the environment are some nods to videogames such as Super Mario, Zelda, and of course Metroid. There are geeky internet memes injected into the settings as well. The music is played in mariachi style that incorporates sythn sounds and beats with the traditional classical guitar and horns that's usually upbeat and fast pased. Some of soundtrack has two versions, which you can listen to by switching between the two worlds. They're all very enjoyable to listen to and nicely accompany each setting of the game.Guacamelee is a somewhat short but ultimately satisfying game to play. Experienced players will finish it in around five hours while skipping certain hidden items. Doing everything and getting 100% will extend the game to an extra hour or two. Doing so will offer an extra ending. For everyone else, you'll be enjoying a good 8-10 hours of gamplay so do yourself a favor and pick up Guacamelee!			"

												Guacamelee! is a very fun action platformer, with some very innovative puzzling. It has some open world elements, somewhat of a level up system, and some costumes you can acquire. The action doesn't feel too repetitive, and the boss battles are fun.  Get Guacamelee! if you think you have the reflexes, or would like to find out if you are epileptic.			"

												I never expected to feel as compelled and excited by playing a 2D platformer as I did with Guacamelee. Its hook is a perfectly crafted gameplay, a brilliant level design, and a unique humorous tone.Everything is built around the abilities of Juan, the main character, and this seems to be the key of its success in all its fronts.The game world is progressively unlocked as you acquire new powers, which allow you to access those small spots you saw at the beginning, that you were not able to access, but you knew you'll be able to reach at some point. It reminds me of those magic moments I had while playing ""Metroid"" (SNES), or the awesome dungeons of any old-Zelda game.The combat system is brilliant, and this is thanks to the design of the foes inhabitating this crazy Mexican-fantasy-world. Each enemy type is built around one of your combat abilities, so as you progress in the game, and you get new skills, a new enemy enters the scene, asking you to masterize that new ability you just acquired. Without noticing, you end up fighting big groups of creatures, each one of a different type, asking you to combine ALL of your abilities in some sort of coordinated choreography. The best part is that you do not even notice of how you end up ""playing piano"" with your gamepad. And this feels really good. Everyone would like to learn to play a piano, right?Totally recommended.			"

												The very definition of ""short but sweet"". This game is a mix of Metroidvania-style progression, beat 'em up combat (with a pretty deep combo system), and some pretty challenging puzzle-platforming. As far as Metroidvania games go, this has to be one of my favourites; the pacing is excellent, combat is very fun, and the platforming is challenging without becoming excessively frustrating. Also, the game has a unique and striking art style, some great humor, and plenty of in-jokes and references to other games.The game only took me around 5 hours to complete (without finding all the secrets), but I loved every minute. Highly recommended.			"

It's terrible and distracting to a degree that I didn't expect. Every building in the town is just plastered with ""hey look a thing i like!"" posters. It's so gross.The game is fun though. For the most part the powers are fun to use and the combat is good. I do get tired of getting locked into rooms until I clear them of monsters, but I'm pretty sure that particular style of bad game design has been around for so long that it's just not ever going away. Oh and it's also really pretty if you can look past the part where they want you to know just how much they love old platformers.OH AND ONE OF THE BOSSES ♥♥♥♥ING LAUGHS AND IT IS WRITTEN IN THE FOLLOWING WAY: ""TROLOLOLOLOL!!""

Sometimes that just happens. All of my complaints are kinda minor quibbly♥♥♥♥♥♥anyway.

												To start off, I love the cartoony animation style of this game; it's so bright and colourful. I could go back into this game just to watch Juan fight moves, which flow across the screen like brush strokes. But this game offers much more than beautiful visuals, fight mechanics which are simple to start with but can be chained together to create interesting combos, complex and fun level designs, a great soundtrack filled withupbeat and racy Mexican music with an electronic tone, a sense of humour which is self-referential to its platformer genre and pop-culture, genuinely tough special enemies and boss fights which for me, were some of the hardest I've played in a long time. If you enjoy metroidvania type games or are looking for challenging and funny game with heart, I highly recommend Guacamelee!			"

The art style is lovely and very polished and at least my funny bone gets tickled on regular basis by the little hidden jokes, cameos and absurd dialogue.However; I can only recommend this if you own a controller!

A couple of the optional platforming segments are frustratingly difficult. Final boss fight was a bit of a letdown.Overall a great game.

Almost everyone else has expressed the same sentiment, but coming from The MarsupialPugilist, cousin to the luchador, this is a ringing endoresement.Guacamelee's combat is simple, but it oozes polish, power, and considerable depth. Characters themselves have little depth, but that is negligible given the fact that they all manage to have purpose, and more personality than most games can hope to achieve.Guacamelee! is worth $15, but it wouldn't hurt to wait on it, given the fact that the game has gone on sale a few times on Steam already. The MarsupialPugilist doesn't care, as long as you buy the game.			"

												An absolute treat. As ""Metroidvania"" games go this game is an outstanding example of the format done right. Combat feels fluid, secrets are plentiful and sometimes challenging to obtain, and character progression leaves you feeling ever more powerful as you discover more abilities. This combined with a fantastic sense of humor (heavily laden with video game tributes) and a vibrant and colorful world, means that those looking for an entertaining, modern day take on the metroid/castlevania style should look no further than Guacamelee!!

												Are you ready for an epic, tumbling, explosive platform/puzzle sock-em adventure? Guacamelee! Gold Edition brings plenty of pack for your punch in a wonderful Aztec, traditional Mexican world full to the rim of the guacamole dip bowl with music, puns, internet meme joke references, and story! I've enjoyed every element of this! When you get done with the action-packed story with somewhat challenging puzzles, there are new costumes to unlock, achievements to mark off, and challenges to complete~ Has a very similar feel to the platform combo-fighting Shank games!

												This game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, but it's less of a Metroid-vania and more of just a linear platforming beat-em-up adventure. Usually in a Metroid-vania type of game you're supposed to come back to areas that require a certain mobility powerup or equivalent to proceed to the next area, but this game was pretty straightforward. And the actual areas were more like platforming levels than labrynthine dungeons. The combat is very fun and satisfying, and the platforming is tight. The difficulty curve is pretty reasonable for how short the initial run of the game is, but the last boss is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This really is a game in the classic style.			"

												Absoutely amazing game.  The story is comical but also not just a joke.  The music and art are phenomenal.  If I had to describe it using other games as a basis of comparisson, the map and sidescrolling non-linear gameplay reminds me a LOT of castlevania symphony of the night and the metroid franchise which is a GREAT thing.  The combat itself has a simple combo, grapple, and special attack system that works very well and is highly responsive.I have seen the negative reviews complain about difficulty, but an important thing to remember is the games of the era this game is created in the essence of were all very difficult and chalenging.  This game is very non-punitive though.  For example, when you die from a platforming section, you simply spawn back to the start of the room.  Yes, you must complete whatever series of jumps or wall flips it has for you, but it doesn't rewind you to your last save point to do so.  In short, it has the skill elements from games of the past, without the frustration that can go along with it.			"

												Charming game - simple yet eloquent graphics, smooth-as-butter gameplay mechanics, hilarious characters and simply tons of fun. Local co-op is a fun feature as well, when you're punching and suplexing enemies all over the screen, you almost get lost in a trance as you expertly dodge and attack, going from area to area. These types of games are enjoyable, because if you're skilled enough, you can forgo the stat increasing upgrades and focus more on the skills, rewarding a practiced player with early, devastating combination moves that make you feel unstoppable. Would definitely recommend.			"

												I really like this game so far. It feels a lot like Castlevania/Metroid and it seems to offer a lot of content. It has a very self aware sense of humor and makes references to many other games(You get new powers from ""Choozoo"" statues that look exactly like the Chozos from Metroid, and one boss battle ends like the Bowser ""fight"" from Super Mario Bros complete with ""another castle"" reference). Very worth the money if you like Metroidvania games.			"

												Metroidvania luchador beat 'em up with light/dark world mechanics? The premise of this game is quite silly, but it's pulled off nicely. Guacamelee was one of many amazing 2013 indie-ish titles to tide us over before a new console generation. Regardless of the context of its release, this game looks and plays great. I played with a 360 controller which worked well. Combat is satisfying and difficulty ramps up for those seeking a challenge. The animations are fluid and interesting. And soooo many Easter eggs. I like to think I recognized them all - there were dozens of references to other video games and internet humor scattered about. I felt strongly enough about the game to go through and do all of the sidequests plus collect all the things. Victory unlocks a harder version of the game, plus you can check out community designed outfits for male and female luchador(a)s.Highly recommended!			"

The combat can be frenzied but it pays off to learn the combos and chain them together for some satisfying and stylish throwdowns. The game takes around 7-8 hours to complete and while the final 2 fights could have you tossing tables/laptops/controllers, overall the game is not too challenging....which is where the hidden 'challenges' come in. good luck with those :)			"

Fun game altogether, with catchy music (not all of it is ranchera or mariachi) and plenty of puzzles, platform challenges and all the nostalgia us Metroid-lovers will love, appreciate and reminisce while playing this wonderful game. Also, the in-game jokes, references and tidbits are priceless, alongside many other things such as deeply-seeded Mexican culture featurettes (or ""culturettes) of which the game is not lacking. A challenging, fun, nostalgic and hilarious game with everything we love of pop culture, Mexican culture and videogame culture. On top of it all, the localization (if you can speak Spanish and recognize Mexican slang) is beyond priceless. Give it a go, for you will not regret it!			"

												this game incites a yearning to be able to call meheeco your home, to wear a sombrero, to be able to speak spanish, to be able to become a luchador, eat guacamole and salsa and tortilla chips everyday, and possibly settle down with a beautiful native woman in the middle of the desert after you kill an evil mexican skeleton dressed as a charro and be happy making tequila for the rest of your days.  but then you remember that this is all just a game and that mexico is actually a place that thousands of people are trying to get away from every day by risking their lives to possibly clear a border and make it into a country that doesn't want them there and that has a multitude of issues of its own, possibly find a job that more than likely pays them next to nothing, and constantly fret about having to take care of themselves and their families, all the while desperately evading detection of their status as an illegal immigrant.  but hey, this game is pretty cool.  you can headbutt stuff, the combat overall is very satisfying, it's paced well, you can do wrestling moves, and the music is dope.  however, the seemingly never-ending ""shoutouts"" to memes and other video games is a bit overbearing, the side missions are kind of dumb, and the constant switching between dimensions later in the game can get a little annoying, especially in platforming segments.  the game as a whole is really fun though, and gets surprisingly challenging in the last few hours.  it makes you really want some mexican food too.

												I'd highly recommend this game to any metroid (or metroidvania) fan looking for another game to play. I thought Guacamelee was well-presented in both its music and art-style. The controls are responsive, the game mechanics make the gameplay decently challenging, and I had a very fun 5 1/2 hour experience with no dull moment throughout the game. There are lots of secrets hidden throughout the map and the level design is so well done that you can find the majority of these secrets as you progress through the story with little-to-no additional backtracking. The melee combat is very rewarding to players who actually take the time to learn the mechanics rather than relying on button-smashing and, in general, dying is pretty forgiving - leaving you a ""screen"" or two away from where you last died. I guess this respawn system can help keep you from getting frustrated in certain hidden areas of the game though... Anyway, if you like Metroidvania-style games, pick this up. Even if you don't enjoy them, but like beat-em-ups or any other kind of action game, give this game a chance. I guarantee you'll at least get a few laughs out of it.			"

												Simply superb ""metroidvania"" platformer. The game oozes character and style. The platforming is tight and intuitive (a controller is seriously recommended), the art style is fantastic as well as the world it immerses you in. Once again, this is a game that knows how to use humour to make things even more enjoyable.The difficulty balance is perfect, as you progress in the game, not only do you gain new abilities and skills but you really learn how to use them to maximum effect. My favourite aspect of the gameplay would have to be the puzzle-like platform sequences to reach hard to find chests. You'll find this game is both a test of problem solving and dexterous skill.Verdict: A must-play! No one should miss out on this superb game (unless of course you are irrationally prejudiced against platformers.)			"

Almost everyone else has expressed the same sentiment, but coming from The MarsupialPugilist, cousin to the luchador, this is a ringing endoresement.Guacamelee's combat is simple, but it oozes polish, power, and considerable depth. Characters themselves have little depth, but that is negligible given the fact that they all manage to have purpose, and more personality than most games can hope to achieve.Guacamelee! is worth $15, but it wouldn't hurt to wait on it, given the fact that the game has gone on sale a few times on Steam already. The MarsupialPugilist doesn't care, as long as you buy the game.			"

												If you like games with a lot of leaping around, collecting superpowers, and kicking♥♥♥♥♥ then this is one of them.If you do not like games with those sorts of thing in them, then this game has rather a lot of those things, and you may want to play a different one.If the developers were trying to make a metroidvania type game, then they have succeeded admirably. If they were not, then this was a really, really lucky fluke.Anyway, I'm having fun with it.			"

												An absolute treat. As ""Metroidvania"" games go this game is an outstanding example of the format done right. Combat feels fluid, secrets are plentiful and sometimes challenging to obtain, and character progression leaves you feeling ever more powerful as you discover more abilities. This combined with a fantastic sense of humor (heavily laden with video game tributes) and a vibrant and colorful world, means that those looking for an entertaining, modern day take on the metroid/castlevania style should look no further than Guacamelee!!

												First review! (was gonna do Deus Ex but they took it off)Recently finished, not 100%Story, boy saves girl, doesnt really matter in this type of gameArt style, like it or you don't, there are screen shots available. I like it personally, works with the whole (Mexican/mariachi/wrestler) theme which we don't see alot of. Easter eggs and other game references through out the some of the levels. Music, terrific again works with the theme Gameplay, 2D platformer/beat'em upPlatforming is hard, for me, becuase I suck, not the game's fault, the controls are fine (I used a xbox controller), timing is the key here, sometimes it's frustrating but there are plenty of checkpoints and if you die falling off a platform you'll just respawn at the previous platform you were standing on before you jumped off; unless you fell on another platform that is way down at the bottom of the level, and because there is no fall damage, you won't die and just gonna have to make your way back up. Fighting mechanic, basic puches and 4 special moves combined together along with jumps and rolls/dodges to create about 20 or so combos; there's fun side quest that serves as a tutorial for you to try out these combos, but other than that, it's not really necessary to memorize them since after the damage upgrades, which can be acquired pretty early in the game by spending orbs that you get from killing enemies (the higher the combo the more orb you get after the battle) and the abusing of the throw mechanic (which knocks down/back other enemies but does stop the combo), most enemies will be dead way before you finish the combo. Boss fights are not that hard either, learn their attack pattern dodge, lay down a combo, repeat. Finding and getting to the treasure is the best part of the game for me, even though at that point of the game you don't really need the orbs/health/stamina upgrades that the treasure chests contain; but it's alot of fun because they requires you to use a combination of moves you've learned through out the game to pull it off. Which brings me to a problem I have with the game - the map. One way to find the hidden paths is by indentifying the blurred-pixelated spots on the map that aren't explored , but some of the areas on the map are also blurred-and pixelated looking, places like the edge of cliff, both ends of a stage, down at a bottomless pit, in the middle of the sky... So alot of time are spent on jumping off cliffs or the edges and looking for walls to grab onto just to use one of the game mechanics (SPOILER) to ___ across the stage just to clear up the map to make sure you didn't miss anything. And that still won't clear up the whole map!Replayability, low, unless you want to try out a harder difficulty, since the game doesn't allow you to go back to collect all the treasues you missed or finish the challenges after entering the final stageFinal score 9/10 half a poitn for map; half a point for challenge room difficulty (yeah there's a challenge room) and replayability			"

												Excellent platformer in the vein of metroid and castlevania. El presedente's daughter, who happens to be your childhood sweetheart is taken away by a villain planning on becoming the new lord of the dead. While trying to rescue her you die, but are reborn as a mighty luchador and begin your quest to rescue her.The game has you collecting powerups that enable you to access new areas and progress. The combat is fun and boss fights are challenging. There is also a heavy empahsis on platforming which is also enjoyable and challeging. The art style is brilliant and there are lots of gaming and internet culture references. The music is also great, and there is a 2 player coop mode (i have not tried this yet but it would play similar to castle crashers or the newer rayman platformers).Overall enjoyed it a great deal and would highly recommend it.

												It's a metroid-vania style game, with some fairly decent humor and fun combat that is based on being a Luchador. Its fun, quirky, aesthetically pleasing, and is just a solid package with a fair amount of things to do. Difficulty wise its hit the mark pretty well - challenging but not unneccesarily difficult. The part so far to have seriously♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off is the last boss fight - he is hard largely because your conventional dodging roll that you heavily rely on the entire game is largely useless.Definetly worth the price though. Its fun, challenging, silly, and the art and sound track fit together with the gameplay forming a nice, cohesive package that knows exactly what it wants to be - an a goofy but entertaining action game with some rpg elements.

												Guacamelee is crazy fun. One of the tags on Steam is ""MetroidVania"" which is absolutely accurate. And I f*cking LOVED both of those games which is probably why I'm digging this so hard.Super Metroid is one of the highlights of my gaming time on SNES. That game was ""open world"" before ""open world"" was ""open world"". I would spend so much time traveling back and forth being frustrated until that oh-so satisfying ""EUREKA!!!!"" moment. And Castlevania, while being a lot more linear in the early games, was a game that was VERY demanding about timing and learning enemy movements. I always hated it at first (like those god damn floating Medusa heads) but once you start to get it, it becomes rhythmic.And then I saw the Mario reference and I was completely sold. It took me a little over an hour of play to really feel this way but... yeah. 10/10 will continue playing and be frustrated and then conquering those frustrations and feeling like a god (or at least feeling like whatever lowly god is really good at wall jumping and then headbutting things).

												I didn't do alot of research on this game, but heard good things and it was in a humble bundle so I got it. From the begining I could tell I was going to like it. Theres humor, cameos of several charecters, fun gameplay. However the game can get slightly repetitive if played for log sessions, but a second player and workshop costumes help things move along. However my play time (3 hours) is how long it took me to get pretty close to 100% however there is a hard mode that is also avaliable to play through again.I definitely recommend this game, especially if you have a friend for local co-op and a few extra dollars and its on sale.

												Soul Reaver + Castle Crashers + Castlevania: SOTN = Guacamelee!Did I mention this game is amazing?  Well it is.  It's vibrant, detailed, fluid, challenging, everything desireable in a platformer or a brawler.  The thing that really amazed me the most, was that every time I thought, ""ok.  Neat trick.  I guess I'll spend the rest of the game doing this.  I can dig that,"" it turned out there was an even cooler set of moves, and puzzles that required them, right around the corner.  I thought I had seen it all from these kind of games, and boy was I wrong.  Specials affect combat and exploration at the same time in a way that ought to make most competitors jealous, and it keeps throwing them in at a steady pace all the way to the end of the game.   Each move is color coded, which enhances the evolving visual motifs of the game as it progresses, but also emphasises the unique role of every move and the way they chain fluidly together.    I can't think of a single game that continued to impress me so much by redefining the core gameplay, again and again, all the way to the end.  The only real complaint I have about this game is that it's over, and I've seen it all.  Other than that, it's one of the best games I've ever played.			"

												I really wanted to like this game but, ughh... It doesn't really do anything right.It's like, it has some interesting mechanics in there, but nothing people haven't already done before. And then it fails to really inspire upon those mechanics. Like Darksiders if it had clunky and unfun combat. Everything in this game narrates to the player that the developers know video games but can't really make one. Like a chimp in a cape with a white wig and a sword pretending to be Alucard from Castlevania. The game's really cute and charming, but there's no soul there.The grappling is clever, but more than a little wonky. And the game has a habit of throwing lots of tireless and unfun fights at you that don't feel like challenges but busywork. I don't think the developers really played their game when they were making it. That or they're bland robot people covered in salsa, kinda like this game.Also, get ready for every video game trope ever, all at once, forcefully used over and over again. Like ♥♥♥♥♥ putting on a lucha mask and sneaking into your room at night to slap your♥♥♥♥♥with churros. Giggling to itself and masturbating, its hollow eyes reflecting nothing.			"

												I happen to be a big fan of Metroid-Vania style games, and this one is no exception.  The game wasn't as long as I'd have liked (since I'm not one to 100% items), but the humor it puts out and the play-style it uses are both winners in my book. (4/5)			"

												I got this game in a bundle and I honestly didn't have a clue what this game was. After playing it turned out to be one of my favourite games I've played. Definately recommended if you like cheesy refrences and great game design. (I would advise using a controller though)			"

												If you can stand the almost obnoxious mocking of the mexican stereotype, this is actually a enjoyable colorful platformer. As a native Spanish speaker I think the Spanish references are way too much and I expected at least a better Spanish translation. Some scenes are tedious and there's no help on how to deal with certain enemies: if you forget what a character just told you, you are screwed (though there's a helpful ""move list"" on the menu).EDIT: After playing more than 70% of the game I found that it's hard to play with the keyboard and each time you make a mistake you have to start all over. It is becoming more and more frustrating instead of being a fun experience.Graphics: 9/10Sound: 7/10Playability: 4/10Spanish puns: 4/10Overall fun: 6.5/10			"

												Full of pop culture references, nods to old school gaming, and a great sensor of humour, Guacamelee combines the exploration of the metroid games, and later castlevania games, precision platforming, and beat em up mechanics, similar to final fight and streets of rage.Guacamelee does not have any game overs, or give you any lives, rather, checkpoints are plentiful, but while they are plentiful, they are also well placed.  Later stages in the game demand absolute precision, concentration, and perfection platforming, yet the sense of relief when you pull these parts of with a reward of a checkpoint is fantastic.  While the demands of the platforming parts are in place, you will not ever feel frustrated, as the game encourages you to try to tackle a piece of platforming, and your worse case scenario is your back at the start of the room, and if you run out of health, you return back to the last checkpoint.Combat is plentiful.  Combat is simple, but there is plenty of depth.  Along the course of the game, as you unlock more moves and abilities, you can combine these moves into one gigantic combo.  There are various enemy types, and of course, like any good platformer, some of the enemy placements are quite strategically placed.  When your precision platforming and a flying dragon is trying to knock you off, you instantly remember the older days of platforming on the NES.  Combo attacking, and juggling mid air is encouraged, and the game encourages you to rack up a high combo, rewarding you with extra money.  The potential and depth of the combat system is up to you to discover, but the game does a very good job teaching you the overall basics (One of the side quests involves you linking up different abilities to pull of a combo)The overall pacing of the game is also quite good.  The game never makes you feel like it is a drag.  Just when you feel comfortable, or you come across an area where you need an ability, you usually come across a chozo statue (Yes, right out of metroid) that grants a new ability, which then encourages you to go and further explore.That all said, the game does not take a very long time to complete, and even 100% the story will take just over 10 hours.  Fortunately, there is a hard mode, and there is challenge rooms to keep you interested, while multiple costumes give you specific extra and negative abilities (For example, one suit grants infinity stamina, but you are also unable to regain health) so for people who do like to set their own challenges, there are options here.Overall, if you like humour, metroid style games, or platformers, this is a must buy.

												Guacamelee! Platform, Beat 'em up, explore - rinse and repeat.. But by Lord, it's addictive!!  On occasions it will frustrate you, but overall it's a bloody good button basher!!The music is brilliant, graphics and frame rate are smooth, the story line (rescue the love of your life whilst beating up baddies - THAT'S IT!) is simple, and some of the background imagary, which is usually bright, colourful and typically Mexican (Me Gusta Guava - yes the Me Gusta meme) has made me giggle like mad.Running around there's collectables to be had, coins to be looted (which you can spend on power ups or costumes for your luchador), and a few side missions to give the game some meat. You can choose to run/beat/chicken in either the dead or alive world, and you can alter between Juan and Tostada (Male/Female) at a 'shop' front.Swapping between the alive and dead world opens and closes pathways, and lead off to areas that can give you extra cash, power ups or boosts. Luckily, once you've found a transport system (In the guise of large heads) you can start whizzing about the place. Some of the enimies can be tough and a lot of button bashing is needed, and getting a combo to get certain baddies (and blocks) can be challenging, but still provide an overall fun time.In general, for me at least, this is a brilliant little game, and well worth the money.Now, where's my tortillas?

												Gameplay: Excellent, there is plenty to do. The plenty to do ranges from: combos, specials, health bar pieces, and stamina bar pieces.

												You're a tequila farmer who must save the president's daughter from a villain worse than the devil. You die and come back from the dead as a masked luchador (like any normal tequila farmer) ready to save the day. This is a fun platformer with a brawler twist that encourages exploration. You'll notice many references to video games and even get a good laugh or two from this fun and engaging title. After you beat it, you'll have the option to play on hard mode (which is legitimately hard). There's also the inferno: a series of challenges that test your skill at the game.Steamworks is a nice touch and it lets you use custom skins for your character. There's something gratifying about playing as Johnny Bravo. There are many skins and more to come in the workshop. The game also features local co-op. You can play with a buddy if you have a pair of controllers and a tv to hook up to.I got this game on sale at the humble indie store. If you have some extra cash and are looking for a good time, I would definitely recommend this one.			"

												A wonderful game. The world is built beautifully and the difficulty ramps up in a way that lets you learn quickly. All this while still giving a number of challenges that you may need to try more than a few times. These tend to give you either a ""YES, I did it!"" reaction or a ""Well, I'm glad I don't have to do that again"" reaction. However, that is more for completion than for playing through the game itself -- you can get through most of the game without needing to do all the insane side-challenges, but doing them does help hone your skills and make the rest of the game feel easier.There are also a variety of references to a number of pop culture and gaming references throughout the world. They don't get in the way and all seem to have been well integrated into the style of the game. The world of Mexican folklore that Drinkbox was able to portray was pretty cool overall, though it felt somewhat hammy after a while. A very fun and challenging game. I highly recommend it, especially to those who like platformers.Note: I have not yet tried the Co-op.			"

												Just finished this game last night and I have to say I really enjoyed it.  Coming off of Dust: An Elysian Tail before this, both of these games were great MetroidVania-style games, both felt different while not straying too far off the path.- Environment on this game is a little sillier without making it feel stupid- Love the cartoon-like art style  Makes the characters actions and story feel more believable.- Combat system is easy to pick up, and while they can show you many combos with the moves you learn throughout the game, I was able to kind of create my own and play in the action my way, in a sense.- While I don't feel that this game has a lot of replayability, there is quite a bit to do while you are playing it and you can beat the game and go back and finish it if you are up to the challenges.- Some of the platforming is HARD AS HELL... and I loved it!  It is one of things that made me come back for more.- Not to forget, there are little Easter Eggs everywhere, paying homage to great game titles and internet memes.If you like games like Metroid and Castlevania, this is one to pick up, I definitely recommend it.

												This game is an awesome platforming game, with a unique artstyle and combat mechanics along with good storytelling and bgm. Variaty of skills, combos are very balance and the game does not come across the feeling of grinding as you will get all the skill upgrades as long as you play along through the story.The game has a lot of reference and easter eggs through out the game and I love it.The achievements are relatively easy, nothing too hard or require too much of time to get as well.If you're trying to get all the achievements, I suggest start playing on hard mode(by typing a code) or play through it 2 times, which I did.Since I finished this when Super Turbo Champhionship Edition is out, I suggest you getting that one since its more of a upgraded version to this game.10/10, would play again.

												This game rocks in just about every individual aspect. The story could be better, but the controls feel great, the art style is fantastic, the action is fun and incredibly fulfilling, the music fits, it's funny, it makes references in the form of signs that you'll walk past twenty times and on the twenty-first time you're like ""OH I GET IT"", it makes blatantly obvious references that are also hilarious, and you obtain the power to turn into a chicken.That said, the biggest shortcoming of the game is that the moment it starts to really pick up, it's over. Like a Metroid game, you get power-up after power-up right up to the very end of the game, but before the game can fully explore the mechanics of all of your power-ups, you're at the final boss. There are things to collect (many times blocked by pretty challenging obstacles), however, so you can still get your chicken power fix after the game's over.			"

												Very nice metroid-style brawler. Not too hard(unless you want to 100% it), not too easy. The graphics are good, music is perfectly suited, game is funny and don't take itself seriously. Mexican style is also a nice thing, i don't remember many games with similar styleFighting and platforming are quite ballanced, although some jumps and fights could be a little frustratingIt has 2 main flaws 1. It's not too long, only 5-6 hours with normal gameplay2.You can't redefine keys on gamepadOverall - worth your money			"

												Guacamelee is hands down the best platformer I have ever played. The way the mechanics you learn throughout the game allow you to develop both your combat and platforming skills simultaneously is genius. The pace is at the perfect speed to allow you to enjoy the game without being rushed through it, as well as introduce new features often enough to keep the experience fresh and unique. The vibrant style of the game makes it enjoyable just to watch and though the game doesnt include voice acting, the dialogue is funny and entertaining.I cannot recommend this game enough! 5 out of 5.

												Just your average game about agave farm hand with ability to warp between the world of the dead and living after being turned luchador after receiving a mask from a statue after being killed by an undead bull fighter who turned the devil into a roster. Oh and you can change into a chicken. This game has a ton of comedy and heart, it's one of the best metroidvania games I've ever played. The combat is simple but very in depth and rewarding. It's one of those games that looks chaotic but still manages to put it all together to create the perfect package. This is a MUST HAVE game for your library. Don’t miss this one, easily a 10/10.			"

												I bought this gem on a whim while it was in the less than five dollar range. It's been the best bang for my buck I have gotten in a long time. The artwork is whimsical and pretty, the fighting mechanics solid, and the humor is wonderful. I will warn you, some of the platforming puzzles are hardcore. I have been playing games like Prince of Persia and the like for years and I assure you this game is every bit, as demanding, if not more so, when it comes to getting to some of the secrect areas and through some of the challenges. The saving grace here for the platforming puzzles is that the controls are very responsive and do not hinder your efforts to shave that extra second off your time  on a challenge.Overall I have to rank this game as a 8 out of 10. Fun, funny, but at times too demanding of the player when it comes to its jumping and timing puzzles.			"

The game's humor and atmosphere are spot-on, and the game's Mexican themes are accurate in their portrayal, both in culture and in style. The game's great to look at and very stylish. The combat starts simple but, in typical Metroidvania fashion, gradually opens up more and more as you aquire more powers.  I highly reccomend Guacamelee for any fans of the genre.			"

												The game is really fun all the way though the story. Finding all the collectibles and completing is rewarding yet challenging, but the end game. The end game is for HARDOCRE platformer players. You got 100% in super meatboy? Do you only play mario in mini mode? Have you beaten the original Castlevania without dying onece? Good for you because controlling your character though the ""torture rooms"" is torture. Imagine an M-1 Abhram tank trying to be transpoorted though a naval mine field while being held above water with by a Mosquito helicopter and pulled by a fat guy in a kayak. Using a keyboard is near impossible with most of the combos being broken by pressing down on a random letter on your keyboard, or accidentally turning yourseld into a chicken.USE A CONTROLLER FOR CHRIST'S SAKE. 9.5/10 NO FLAWS			"

												Guacamelee! Gold Edition is a Metroidvania Mexican styled action platformer. The very first impression of the game is that it looks awesome. A wonderful and colourful atmosphere that reminds me the good old times of Monkey Island. In addition to that, the writing is sharp with a lot of funny dialogues...or to be more precise, the dialogues are mostly monologues since our mexican hero Juan will not say any word during the game.Regarding the combats, I would say that are interesting but they can also end up to be quiet boring. Juan has some standard attacks (punch, kick) but he gains many power ups as he goes deeper and deeper into to the game. My humble opinion is that a medium experienced gamer would need about 10hours to finish the game. But if you want to push your self to the limits you will have to try to unlock as many steam achievents as you can. This is a real challenge, especially if you try to win all gold medals in the El Infierno area (I think I spent two days for this...nightmare).As a conclusion, I would say thay Guacamelee is a great game with humour, fantastic world design and interesting battles. Even if someone is not a lover of 2D platform games I believe that Guacamelee has something for him as well. Finally, if you do not have a CONTROLLER, just do not play the game. The first few hours I tryied it with the keyboard and I can assure you that you will not be able to keep up with steam achievents.			"

												A surprisingly good platformer/brawler. The art style is simple but well utilized and worth the price. The humor is great, the abilities are smooth and the combat is engaging. There is local co-op and, while its fun to play with someone else, the second player makes combat nearly trivial while simotaniously creating a major handicap to the platforming aspect. You often have one player pop out (which is smoothly implimented)  during most non-combat areas. A good 4/5 and worth up to $15			"

												Guacamelee is a love letter to the Metroidvania genre, in the form of a super-powered romp through the world of Mexican folklore. You are Juan Aguacate, a destitute agave farmer who finds his village under attack by the undead army of Carlos Calaca. The love of his life, who happens to be the daughter of el presidente, has been kidnapped. What is Juan to do? Why, acquire a magic lucha mask and go on a non-linear platforming adventure, get powerups from ""choozo"" statues, power-slam bad guys, find secrets and navigate rather tricky jumping puzzles, of course. Guacamelee oozes style from beginning to end, with a colorful palette, excellent music and a well-used light/dark world mechanic, requiring the player to frequently switch Juan between the living world and the Mexican land of the dead via portals, often in  mid-jump.  But the game is inconsistent in difficulty. The combat is generally managable and the boss fights are quite simply awesome, but some of the jumping puzzles are incredibly frustrating. In addition, to reach the game's golden ending, it is neccessary to obtain a number of secret items, some of which are located at the end of some fiendishly difficult challenge rooms, many of which, like the trick jump room with its accursed disappearing platforms, I was unable to complete, and this left a bad taste in my mouth. The final boss is also quite difficult, requiring you to demonstrate a mastery over all the abilities you have learned over the course of the game, but when I had finished, I was very satisfied dispite not getting the best ending. I would recommend the game to any fans of Metroidvania, but with caution- it is not a forgiving experience.			"

												In short: Guacamelee! is a metroidvania-mexican-beat'em up with amazing graphics, a charming soundtrack and a really good gameplay. Story: ?/10 - nothing new here. Two possible endings.Sounds: 8/10 - Nothing to argue about. The soundtrack is really cool and the overall sounds are quite good. Although I'd like to have a voiceover on the characters, the game's not having adds up to the indie-feel and the minimalism.Graphics: 10/10 - Minimalistically beautiful, colorful and mexican.Gameplay: 10/10 - It's like Metroid-Melee version. Lots of cool combos, new abilities to unlock, etc. Lots of secrets and places to explore. Overall: 9/10 - Really enjoyable, but I think I'd have liked the game better if it had a new game plus instead of having to reset everything to go on hard mode. And a little bit more of replayability would also not hurt, as I've finished it and don't really feel the urge of playing it again. Had lots of fun, but will probably remain untouched for some time in my library.			"

												Guacemelee is a Metroidvania-style platformer about luchadors headbutting spoopy skellertons. That alone should make you want to buy at least seventeen copies.Besides that, it has great visuals, interesting mechanics, fun combat, lots of random tat to hunt around for, and some really neat platforming puzzles. All in all, only a few cons come to mind;- it's pretty easy. Only the first boss and final boss really gave me any sort of trouble (apart from all the platforming puzzles I cocked up because I'm a klutz); in fact I think the first boss kicked my♥♥♥♥♥♥even more soundly than the last.- it's pretty short. I beat the main game in just under seven hours, including sidequests, and I'm quite confident I got most of the treasure along the way. That said there's a postgame hard mode and a couple of challenge areas I've not cleared so the replay value's there.- the ending kinda sucks. Really. You beat Calaca and the game just ends, making what never was that satisfying a boss victory fall pretty flat.That said, I still rate this game phenomenal, definitely a must-play.			"

												Nice game. Take any Metroidvania, and exchange the main character with a Mexican wrestler, with its personal set of moves. Graphic is very nice, clean and colourful (maybe sometimes way too colourful xD). In certain points, it may become pretty difficult, but overall it's pretty usable.Just get this game, give it a try and have some fun :)			"

												I've only played this for an hour so far but this is a fun game.  I'm starting to like a lot of modern platformers and this is one of them.  Fairly easy to play, cool music, awesome punch combos and lot of action fun.  The game is puts you into a character that is big and strong and goes to help out the president's daughter.  Upon arrival they're attacked by this mystical being and you die.  You wake up to find a mask with extraordinary powers that it bestows on you and brings you back to life.  Cool game, can't wait to play more!			"

												Awesome little platformers. Despite apparent simplicity this game can be quite challenging at times, especially the side quests. The mask piece (orb) missions in particular are insanely hard. The atmosphere of the game (the music and retro-style graphics) keeps you addicted to the game until the very end. Highly recommended.

Also, props to the devs who have made it possible to play in the guise of a lady luchador! And, Pollo Power wins EVERYTHING.10/10			"

												I had high expectations for this game ever since I saw a trailer for it. Boy, did it meet and excel past the standards I had. The combat is extremely fluid, the platforming puzzles are very tricky, and hot damn the graphics are stylish. Guacamelee is a Metroidvania game, fyi. I have yet to test co-op, but with how combo-friendly the game is, but I don't doubt for a moment it would be fun. I haven't beaten the game yet, as it's fairly challenging; I regret not buying it sooner, and so should you. P.S: The game has epliepsy warnings for good reason; I highly recommend a controller, although the game certainly is playable on keyboard as I have noticed.			"

												Guacamelee is a really fun game. Not only does it have an interesting, albeit sometimes cliche, story, the gameplay is really fun and challenging. A lot of the platforming is difficult yet rewarding. I also enjoyed the references to classics like Legend of Zelda and the Metroid franchise. All in all, a really great game.Note: The game recommends a controller. I've tried both controller and keyboard, and I agree. Not only does the controller have a wide range of motion (joystick rather than arrow keys), I find that some of the attacks are more difficult to pull off on the keyboard. Just FYI.			"

												Your general platformer beat-em-up, seems to have a few unoriginal ideas mixed all into one game mechanic where it does seem quite original itself. The combo system and variability of personalising your own combos is quite sweet to me personally coming from being such an avid FGC member. Theres some appearences of some online meme's and references to other games which is cute. Disliked how we require having to beat the game to unlock another difficulty, don't see the reason for this. Would've loved to play on hard without having the beat the game since to me personally, I'd probably never do a full run of the game just for the sake of a harder difficulty.			"

												It's a fun game, but it gets repetitive and has some crazy difficulty spikes. The game itself plays a bit like a simplified Super Smash Bros., with simple combos that you chain together. You traverse through Mexican-themed environments fighting enemies and gaining powers. Also, while this game advertises itself as a Metroidvania, it is more like a beat-em-up with some exploration. You'll never find yourself lost, and there is (with maybe an exception or two) only one way to reach your goal. There are side quests and small detours, where you collect items or solve puzzles, but they only improve your character's stats and aren't crucial to the main adventure. My recommendation is to buy in a sale if the game seems appealing, but it is far from a masterpiece. Be sure to have a controller, too!			"

												A really good jump'n'run-like game. The mexican-themed setting, the graphic style and the music make the world of the game feel very alive (or dead, haha) and cool. Some of the jump-puzzles are a bit hard (and not only those needed to get to the extras, some mandatory ones too), but are doable nonetheless. Some (boss-) fights are a bit hard as well, but not really frustrating since the battles are still fair and there are ways to defeat the bosses and enemies, the player just has to figure out. Another plus is that there is an in-game trainer, the combo chicken, where the player gets to learn effective combinations of the various attacks, so that inexperienced players (like me) have an easier time climbing the learning curve of the game.All in all, a good game for everyone who is into jump'n'runns and/or up to a challenge.

I paid full price and feel I got a great deal.This developer's love for video games shines in every facet of Guacamelee; the combat, platforming, the gameplay and control in general, the music, visual style, the presentation overall, are all stellar.My only knock is that the exploration backtracking isn't very intuitive. There'll usually be one isolated path you couldn't access upon first passing it, and it feels somewhat like a chore trecking back to that spot for the single purpose of seeing what's behind the now-passable block.

My favorite part of the game was not only the main story, but also the side quests and the challenges in ""hell"" (which can be conviently located just under the desert sands). These challenges really push the platforming difficuly to full throttle so be ready to put up a fight, and some of these achievments will make you want to rip your hair out.

The game is a perfect love letter to every great platformer made and it isn't shy about sneaking in notes to mario brothers megaman and many more. The music is everything you would expect in all the best kinds of ways, the movements are fluid and it is clear the designers accounted for so much. The difficulty curve is progressive but the game can get frustratingly difficult on some of the challange areas, though finishing these is for you to be able to get the games good ending. Controller highly reccomended though you can remap your keys easily and the prompts change without issue.			"

												Guacamelee is a Metroidvania type game with a focus on combat and very responsive controls. The combat actually has quite a bit of depth to it, reminding me more of the fighting game genre than classical action platformers. A sidequest which is basically a ""mini Trial Mode"" is also indicative of that. The aesthetics are gorgeous and the game is full of humour and references to other games. Sadly, the game has no voice acting to deliver the funny writing. It's also quite short; while it has tons of treasure hidden all over the game world, completing the game 100% doesn't take too long. It might also be a little too easy for some people; even on hard mode, I had no problem getting through the game in a few hours on my second playthrough. Considering the low price point and the absolute blast I had playing through the game twice basically back to back, I can absolutely recommend this game to anyone, though.			"

												If you can stand the almost obnoxious mocking of the mexican stereotype, this is actually a enjoyable colorful platformer. As a native Spanish speaker I think the Spanish references are way too much and I expected at least a better Spanish translation. Some scenes are tedious and there's no help on how to deal with certain enemies: if you forget what a character just told you, you are screwed (though there's a helpful ""move list"" on the menu).EDIT: After playing more than 70% of the game I found that it's hard to play with the keyboard and each time you make a mistake you have to start all over. It is becoming more and more frustrating instead of being a fun experience.Graphics: 9/10Sound: 7/10Playability: 4/10Spanish puns: 4/10Overall fun: 6.5/10			"

												There is plenty of things that I loved about Guacamelee. It has a very simple and to-the-point combo list. It rarely reuses puzzles and situations. Most puzzles and bosses and challenging but not too much. And most importantly, it doesn't take itself too seriously.But, in a way, it also does take itself seriously. Its challenges are designed to be just manageable, to push you to the limits of your skill. That would have been great if you actually had that level of control. But you don't. The controls are sticky. So, for example, your ""D"" command becomes ""arrow+D"", because you were using arrows moments ago, and that changes everything. The developers recommend using a gamepad, but there's no real reason why the keyboard shouldn't work. They simply decided to neglect it.At the same time, combat is based on dissing and receiving stuns. It is entirely possible that the enemies will chain-stun you until you die, and there's nothing you can do to recover.I ragequit this game many times. When it works, it's awesome. But very often it doesn't work, and it often feels like losing wasn't your fault. And that is the biggest fault in a game. A player should never feel like he's being punished for things beyond his control.I know that, technically, it's my fault for not executing the jumps perfectly. However, between the inconsistent difficulty and the imperfect controls, I don't see why I should keep replaying the same section to perfect my jumps to such a degree. The game isn't that addictive or rewarding. What stayed with me from Guacamelee wasn't the good times as much as the ragequits. And for that reason, I don't consider this game a good experience.			"

Then Guacamelee pulls your sombrero down over your face and beats you into the ground with a sack full of empty tequila bottles.Guacamelee has one level about halfway into the game that is really difficult.  So difficult, I almost gave it a thumbs down, because I would have been really disappointed if I never got past it, since the rest of the game is so good.  I left it alone for several days and then went back to it, finally getting the timing correct to get to the next save point, but my hands looked like gnarled roots when I dropped the controller and begged for mercy.It's a beat-'em-up 2D side-scrolling platformer with a lot of humor and fun combo moves.  Don't try this one without a comfortable controller.  Also, get it on sale, because if you get stuck in the same place I did and never bother trying to finish, you'll be glad you didn't pay full price.			"

												One of the best platformers I've ever played. I got addicted to the fighting mechanics, to the point I explored the entire metroidvania world just to grind for more wrestling moves.  Platforming is also great and fluid. However, the platforming does get (super meat boy level) hard towards the end; this is even more true with the optional platforming. Great soundtrack, ambience, backgrounds, platforming, and fighting. Greatly recommend this game or even the turbo edition if you can.			"

												An excellent platformer/beat-em-up game with a vivid artstyle and catchy electro/mariachi soundtrack. The fighting is very fluid in the game, with new moves introduced as it progresses and makes platforming a lot more fun to do as well.One word of warning though: there are quite a few instances of bright flashing colours appearing when you get powerups or new moves, so you might want to beware if you have epilepsy or previous experiences with seizures.

												9/10 Superb!Drinkbox Studios title Guacamlee delivers a knockout punch. Guacamelee delivers exciting gameplay and obstacles that the player must overcome. Throughout the game the player is also able to upgrade Juan’s abilities, which allows the player to explore new areas. The games mechanics also work well and run smoothly so that the experience is not ruined in the least bit. Guacamelee certainly delivers a consistent, and colorful visual design that will draw in players and make the game a joy to explore. Consumers should not expect a simple game however. Guacamelee adds that old school, don’t make a mistake or else formula to its salsa. Some areas give simple challenges, while others are brutally filled with enemies. The player is also able to explore areas in the world of the living, and the world of the dead. Drinkbox Studios has certainly put in a lot of work to make gameplay both interesting and challenging, in a world filled with are influenced by Mexican culture. Guacamelee is a wonderful game, with beautiful designs and challenging gameplay. Though the game was released in 2013, it still gives off a nostalgic feeling of platforming games such as Super Mario World. In fact, there are many cameo appearances from popular games, such as the chozo statue from Super Metroid.

												A fantastic Metroidvania game, due to the lack of ranged combat, all the action is tight, combo based, and skill based.  Skills and abilities are passed out at just the right pace, and nods and winks to old games or cultural memes are everywhere.  Whether it is reminiscing about Super Mario Bros at the end of an action sequence, or catching a glimpse of Castlevania paid homage in a wall display.A welcome feature in this game is drop in couch multiplayer.  After about five minutes of gameplay and basic tutorial, you are able to have a friend join in by grabbing a controller and pressing start.My only complaint is that it seems short.  I believe I'm done the meat of the game for main plotline, nearly at the boss zone, and all I wish is that I had a few more areas to explore, and that is knowing that after saving up X in game cash, I will have one more zone to finish, as well, I still have one last area of the arenas to complete.Overall, a technically and graphically fantastic game.  For 15 dollars, I consider it a worthwhile pickup.  If you find it on sale, it's worth picking up immediately.			"

												This is where the reviews really help; I saw this game, but wasn't sure about it.  Then, I read the reviews and most were positive.  This is a side-scrolling game that is a lot of fun to play.  The graphics are different, but beautiful and give the game its own style.  I'm a mouse and keyboard player, but after playing about five hours decided to try an xbox controller as it was recommended.  The controller definitely made a difference by making the moves in the game easier to input.  I would recommend this game as it has a great art style, has some great platforming puzzles to get through, and is a lot of fun to play.			"

												In Guacamelee! you play as the underdog luchador hero Juan, fighting to save the doncella hermosa, El Presidente's daughter from the clasps of Calaca, the king of the dead. You play in a beautiful landscape, with a vibrant, blocky texture to it, and the music combines traditional, mexican mariachi with electro pop, resulting in a really awesome soundtrack.I can easily say that this game gave me the most enjoyment a 2d platformer ever has in the past. With many hours of content, including some really fun and fluid combat which doesn't get old quickly, as well as some very well done megaman-style platforming challenges, this game is definitely worth the money. 10 out of 10.

												Guacamelee oozes style and polish from every frame. It's a pitch-perfect Metroidvania (explorable map, powerups to open new paths, etc) with satisfying combo-driven brawler combat that stays both entertaining and challenging from start to finish. The game is also loaded with secrets that provide extra challenge for the truly hardcore, including a gauntlet-style challenge and (in the Infierno bonus content) a series of challenge rooms that test your timing, speed, and combat savvy.The game also supports two-player (local only, I believe) coop, with the second player as the luchadora Tostada. A solo player can also swap to Tostada if they choose, though the game's script will still refer to the player as ""Juan.""Playing with a controller is strongly recommended.			"

												A Luchadorian Platformer Full of Puzzles and Chickens!      Guacamelee! is an exquisite game that will enthrall you with its complex platforming and unique Mexican art style. Taking full advantage of a myriad of platforming mechanics, Guacamelee! will constantly surprise you with its challenging puzzles and wide variety of special skills. The story is quite weak and the supporting characters can sometimes be more interesting than the hero himself, but Guacamelee! easily makes up for it in sheer world design...Read the full review with screenshots:https://littlebirdgamereviews.wordpress.com/2014/01/27/guacamelee-gold-edition-a-luchadorian-platformer-full-of-puzzles-and-chickens/ "

												This a metroidvania kind of game, but it feels short. As usual, you go through the different areas of a semi connected overworld and get powerups that let you return to places you had to pass up because they were blocked by some kind of obstacle that your new power can handle. It'ss also filled with easter eggs of some familiar AAA and indie games, but they get kind of inane pretty fast. The art and music are kind of stylized for the mexican theme but don't really feel that far from stock. There is plenty of straight up platforming which eventually scales to be pretty difficult, especially in areas hiding secret collectibles that aren't part of the main story. I found it to be of the ""remember your combinations ""variety instead of anything more exciting though..  Combat is more or less like a brawler, you're generally locked in and have to use optional combos, invulnerable dodges, and abilities (which have ending lag to prevent abuse) It isn't really as smart as a good old capcom game like final fight, and is kind of a step down from similiar hybird games like Elysian Tale and Muramasa as well. If you beat the game you get an optional hard mode, which has no differences bar one.. you get 2-4 hit points. I found this bad in cave story + and I was annoyed with it here as well. Memorization and muscle memory can get you through here as usual, especially with the kind of sluggish game speed. All in all, this is a game that has already been done.			"

												Oh my god, this game is just DRIPPING with charm and charisma. And it's pretty damn fun too. Starting off, I was taken in by the colorful scenes and the Samurai Jack-esque art style, but as I continued playing, I found myself laughing out loud to the regularly clever dialogue, gripping my controller during large fights, and just feeling overall satisfied with nearly every element of this game. It's challenging but rewarding, and I can say that this game on its own warrents a purchase whether it be from the current Humble Indie Bundle or on its own. Definitely an A+++ game. Love it.			"

												Great soundtrack, combat and graphical style.  Forgiving platforming elements let you explore move combinations without wasting lots of time.  The level/puzzle design were visibly arbitrary, but the game moves at a fast enough pace that it is not too distracting.The story and dialogue were not that interesting, but I enjoyed the antagonists taunting the silent protagonist throughout the game.  The boss battles are tests of timing and patience and don't involve button mashing.This is a FUN game.  Played it with a gamepad, so that is what I'd recommend.			"

												Summary: Guacamelee! is a platforming game with beat'em up and puzzle elements, which follows the story of an agave farmer named Juan who dons the mask of a luchador to save the world. There is a heavy Mexican influence but also an interestingly large amount of internet-type memes scattered in certain areas of the game. The gameplay is fast, intuitive, and fun with plenty of variety to suit different styles of combat. Although Guaacamelee! is relatively short (2-5 hours roughly), it can be lengthened with features such as co-op play, challenges, and plenty of extras to find throughout each level. The game does get progressively harder and the game is forgiving with the auto-save feature, but it's accessibility and length will make it easy for casual players to finish. Overall I would recommend the game and rate it at a 4/5.Many have compared Guacamelee! to Metroid (also because of some blatant homage in the game [""Choozo statues""]), but I would say it's more like a mash-up of Metroid and Streets of Rage (FInal Fight, any beat'em up). The focus of the combat is to basically chain as many moves into a combo as possible to maximize air time and damage to enemies. Combat is strictly melee-based and is varied with the use of a few mechanics, namely the use of enemy shields and with dimensions. Mid-game, enemies will start to have colored shields surrounding them, the color specifies what type of special attack to use to ""break"" the shield. Once the shield is down then they are free to be damaged and defeated. The concept of the game's dimensions is by having two worlds, ""The Living World"" and ""The Dead World."" This is another concept that will be introduced mid-game, but enemies will belong to either one of the two dimensions and to damage them you will have to go into that dimension to defeat them. So if an enemy is in ""The Dead World,"" you would have to tap a key (R Trigger or Q) to change dimensions in order to beat them into submission. Both concepts will be gradually taught and the learning curve is very short as graphically it's well-depicted.The use of dimensions is another major factor on the platforming aspect of the game. Walls, platforms, and such can be turned ""on"" and ""off"" depending on what dimension it is. This creates an interesting platforming mechanic (albeit frustrating at times), where you have to quickly tap to change dimensions when jumping from wall-to-wall, from one hidden platform to the next, or dodging lava by changing dimensions to make harmless water. There is a wide variety of ways this mechanic is utilized and will be the bulk of a wide range of scenarios that are built more like puzzles. Most of puzzles are usually easy to figure, but some will require trial-and-error which the game is more than generous in allowing with little penalty.There is one more mechanic that I feel I should add which is the ability of Juan to change into a chicken mid-game. This opens up a few gameplay mechanics, such as small narrow passages that only the chicken can get into, but as a chicken you're practically defenseless.The graphics are also well-done and crisp, they convey exactly what they need to and makes levels easier to tackle because of how items are presented throughout the game. The style kind of reminds me of the same vector-drawing style of say South Park, it's clean and presents its' own charm and style.The soundtrack is fitting, although I really didn't find myself in awe over the music. It still matches the Mexican, luchador-type theme, but after blazing through the game there was nothing memorable that I heard or just so catchy that I need to search it out. The plot too is in a similar boat, it's present and obviously fits with the game's style, but it's cliched and just like 75% of the other games on the market. Play the hero, save the girl, beat the bad guy into a pulp. There is a bit of a back story, but again, a bit unoriginal. Saying that, I did find all of the ""mid-bosses"" to be interesting, not so much their stories but their interactions with the protagonist were well-written and brought some humor and charm into the battles.After going through the pros, what can I single out as the biggest con for Guacamelee!? Game length is the easiest element to pick on, if you were to go barebones and blitz through without collecting any powerups or hidden items, you could probably beat the game in 3.5 hours. I didn't mention it, but similar to Megaman, there are pieces of ""voodoo heads"" and ""hearts"" scattered in hard-to-reach locations in every level that can be collected and made into an additional stamina bar or increasing the health length. Finding these items can definitely increase your gaming experience by another 4-6 hours, but it will get old and do it very quickly. It's definitley not necessary to beat the game on normal difficulty with any of these additional powerups, but for the very dedicated completionists it is something out there to do. So for the bulk of us, the game will last between 3-6 hours, which is relatively short but..I don't think it seriously hinders the enjoyment of the game. In fact, it may just make the game more accessible for more players.So overall, I found the game to be enjoyable and with the technical accomplishment of the game I would recommend it. It is nowhere near perfect, but it's still a solid game. 4/5			"

												First of all, I do not recommend buying this game.Instead, buy the definitive edition, Super Turbo Championship Edition, since it has everything and more!Guacamelee is a 2D luchadore metroidvania.It has tons of references to other games and media.The puzzles are consistently challenging by which you must utilise the abilities you currently have and would need to return to levels after gaining new abilities in search of treasure.The music is quite, quite, mexican-themed. This is a compliment.The graphics are outstanding; just the right amount of detail put in.There's also many post-ending activities such as the infernio challenges, achievement-hunting or collecting orbs (To get the happy ending).I do indeed recommend buying the STCE. This is an action-platformer you can't miss! Why not play?			"

												This is a fantastic game that progresses with a good sense of humor. One thing I did not expect, but was pleased to discover, was the wonderful use of mexican mythology. I want to go and discover more cultural surrounding this type of topic. Great game, lots of fun, I will be playing it again with a friend in the Co-op mode.			"

												Well I have had a cracking time playing through this game. It uses the common platform mechanic of getting new special moves as you progress through the game, allowing you to access areas that were inaccessible before. The combat is satisfying and allows you to string some fairly meaty combos together as well as using the main power moves. There are some pretty challenging platform sections that had me pulling my hair out for a bit, but not so hard that it makes you lose interest & give up the challenge.I have never played a game with this kind of art style and atmosphere before. The graphics and the music really draw you in; the whole Mexican Luchador vibe is pulled off perfectly, and has a nice story with some funny touches. I have completed the game, but will go back to it to get those last few secret sections/chests etc. And I think the challenge arenas down in hell will keep me occupied for a while!Would thoroughly recommend this to any one who likes platforming games, with a good bit of combat as well. Brilliant fun.			"

												Guacamelee! Is an intense platformer where you must fight to save your girlfriend who has been kidnapped, and although the story is bland, the platforming is anything but! With tons of crazy moves like the ""goat jump"", the ""rooster uppercut"", and the ""Dash DerpDerp"", you can be sure that combat will always be interesting, and platforming will be fun. The levels are well designed and the powers you get along the way help you to progress. However, one of my favorite things about this game was the seemingly infinite amount of references. They referenced everything from the Legend of Zelda to terrible internet memes, and everywhere I went I saw even more references that I hadn't seen before! Also, later in the game, you gain a power that allows you to move between the realm of the living and the realm of the dead, when you make this shift, you will see all of the references change to something fitting with the current realm you are in. Some of the references change COMPLETELY! This game was definitely worth a buy. The only bad thing I can think to say about this is that there is no online co-op.			"

												Guacamelee is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.Guacamelee is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. I will say that sentence repeatedly until my brain decides it can't recognzie them as words. Has that ever happened to anyone but me? Yes? . . . No? . . . moving on. Guacamelee is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, why? Because it does everything a 2d metroidvania should do, yet finds its own identity through clever controls and use of mechanics. Plus it has an awesome art style that would make the blind drool in awe. I shouldn't say that,  . . . should I?If you mocked this one on the board as a pass . . . shame on you sir or madam, shame on you.What can I say about the artstyle besides it is  ♥♥♥♥ing  gorgeous. The color palette, character design and world building really satisfy me so much I frequently find myself using the power of changing dimensions just to see the subtle differences ( or drastic ) in the background and foreground. The lighting is nothing short of - ... it's just so good. At this very moment I am debating finishing this disaster of my thought process or to go play some Guacamelee. ... yup.			"

												I want to like Guacamelee. I really do. The Developers did almost everything right. The art style, animations, soundtrack, sound effects, and humor are all top notch. But there are a couple of major problems that hold this game back. The lesser of the two evils is the level design. For the most part, the side puzzles are clever, and the rewards for completing them make them feel worth the effort. However, I can't say the same for the required puzzles. Much of the later half of the game is vertically oriented, and eventually the game seems to degenerate into a very sloppy platformer. There are few things more frustrating than almost making it to the top of a series of very tiny platforms, only to have one of the many enemies that have started chasing you (as there's no room to fight them) hit you, resulting in knockback the likes of which hasn't been seen since the original NES Castlevania games, and send you all the way back down to the bottom.This brings me to the more dire of the game's issues: the controls. As another reviewer mentioned, the game starts off with very tight, responsive, and just generally great controls. But as your move pool increases, you increasingly feel like you're in the game. And by that, I mean that it feels like you're wrestling your controller. There are a pretty decent amount of moves at your disposal by the end of the game, and as which move you use depends on which direction you're moving the control stick, pulling off the right move while moving and trying to dodge can be a hassle.Also, a quick, slightly-spoilery, albeit non-specific complaint about the story:The endings (yes, both of them) are huge letdowns. Especially after the journey to reach them.And now for the good parts:Despite my criticisms, the first half of the game is one of the best metroidvania games I've seen in a long time. The amount of hidden collectibles is incredible, and as I've stated before, the optional puzzles are incredible! And it has the benefit of having something that very, very few PC games seem to include these days: local multiplayer. With steam increasingly pushing Big Picture mode and couch gaming on PCs, Guacamelee is finally giving those of us PC gamers with a social life something we've been longing for for a very long time: a game we can play with friends in the same room (without forcing them to drag their rigs over to our houses). Playing with a friend can reduce the frustration caused by the aforementioned problems, and I'll be honest, it's just plain fun!Overall, despite the control and occasional level design issues, the game is worth playing, especially if it's on sale, and you've got someone to play it with! I might not recommend it at full price, but it's definitly an enjoyable experience.			"

												The very definition of ""short but sweet"". This game is a mix of Metroidvania-style progression, beat 'em up combat (with a pretty deep combo system), and some pretty challenging puzzle-platforming. As far as Metroidvania games go, this has to be one of my favourites; the pacing is excellent, combat is very fun, and the platforming is challenging without becoming excessively frustrating. Also, the game has a unique and striking art style, some great humor, and plenty of in-jokes and references to other games.The game only took me around 5 hours to complete (without finding all the secrets), but I loved every minute. Highly recommended.			"

												Spectacular game!A MetroidVania style game with a cool, combo based, fight system. You're a luchador who has to save El Presidente's daughter from an undead gringo and his henchmen...pretty simple, but thanks to all the funny characters I've enjoyed it anyway. But the main strength of the game is the gameplay, which is really well made. The map is big enough to keep you busy for several hours if you want to find everything, and as you go through the game all the fights and platforming sequences will become really challenging.I like the graphic style, it's original and well made but that has to meet your taste. I also liked the mexican style music, wich is really cool even if sometimes it's repetitive. Sadly there's no voice acting. If you love retro games you will enjoy this game even more, becouse it's filled with references to a lot of past games, some obvious and some hidden. All in all a solid game, maybe not for everyone, for its style and its difficulty, but I think it's worth every single dollar, even if buyed at its full price.			"

												You're a tequila farmer who must save the president's daughter from a villain worse than the devil. You die and come back from the dead as a masked luchador (like any normal tequila farmer) ready to save the day. This is a fun platformer with a brawler twist that encourages exploration. You'll notice many references to video games and even get a good laugh or two from this fun and engaging title. After you beat it, you'll have the option to play on hard mode (which is legitimately hard). There's also the inferno: a series of challenges that test your skill at the game.Steamworks is a nice touch and it lets you use custom skins for your character. There's something gratifying about playing as Johnny Bravo. There are many skins and more to come in the workshop. The game also features local co-op. You can play with a buddy if you have a pair of controllers and a tv to hook up to.I got this game on sale at the humble indie store. If you have some extra cash and are looking for a good time, I would definitely recommend this one.			"

												PROTIP: If you're trying to do the mariachi band quest, you won't actually be able to complete it until you can break blue blocks.A beautiful and funny brawler platformer with metroidvania elements that adds a surprising amount of challenge.The game looks great. The artstyle is very clean and sharp which looks great on an HD tv. The colors are vibrant awesome to look at. Not to mention that every environment has a second variation that also looks cool.The gameplay is quite simple at first. You jump and you fight. It's a formula that's been done before, but this game still does it quite well and is really good at adding variation to gameplay as well as challenge. The platforming is pretty standard, but can become very creative once certain elements are introduced. Once you gain the ability to shift between two worlds, the puzzles start to get pretty interesting. What's more is that the world shifting becomes a part of the combat too. Certain enemies will only be able to be hit in certain worlds, which can really put you under some pressure. You also fight different kinds of enemies that need to be disarmed with a spefic attack before you can actually hurt them. There's a lot of good enemy variation. You're also given the ability to turn into a chicken which lets you explore and also lets you skip past some enemies if you don't feel like fighting every one.There are also sidequests and an area where you can do challenges that teach you combos. They also start off easy but quickly ramp up and can be difficult if you're unfamiliar with fighting games. But those parts are optional and just get you money.If there are any criticisms I have of this game, they have to do with co-op. Now don't get me wrong the local co-op in this game is quite fun! Beating up bad guys together is great. But a lot of the puzzle platforming becomes a bit problematic when you have two people. Specifically shifting between worlds. Both players can shift worlds freely, but some of the platforming will require you to have specific timing. This can really be a problem because, unless you and your partner are perfectly synced with your jumping timing, you'll most likely shift worlds at a bad time, causing one person to get caught in a wall, which will automatically force a shift back to the world you were in, and make you both mess up. Thankfully the game is forgiving and it has a work around for things like this. At any time, either player can become a bubble by pressing a button. This allows them to move freely about the screen, taking no damage and dealing none, until the other player punches the bubble and frees them. This mechanic is also used when one person dies in combat, they come back as a bubble. This definitely resolves a lot of issues with the platforming, but it kinda stinks when one of you has to stop playing so that you can both make progress. It shows that the game was designed with one player in mind. Again, this is only a minor complaint, playing co-op was still lots of fun.A great game, so glad it came to Steam.			"

												This game is absolutely phenomenal.  It's a nice short metroidvania/beat 'em up, with a decent sense of humor, some fun skins available to download (nothing beats the sheer joy of beating up mariachi skeletons as Johnny Bravo,) fun combat, and rewardingly challenging platforming.  It's a short game, not overstaying its welcome and making sure that you have a good time all the way through.  It is definitely worth a purchase, and the beat 'em up elements make it a nice fresh take on the already underused Metroidvania genre.			"

												I'm surprised this game isn't more popular.  Or maybe it's just my Metroidvania obssession that is telling me it should be more popular.This game isn't really anything too different.  It's your standard Metroidvania game with similar obstacles, powerups, and layout, only everything is a joke.  Goat Jump?  Goat Run?  Goat Fly?  These are your powerups, which you get from a goat, obviously.What really stands this game out from the rest is it's art style, music, and sense of humor.  The combat system is fun once you get the repetitive nature of keeping your combo up and learn all of the special moves and grapples.There's also a ton of hidden things to find (including a handful of references to other games/movies) and a few challenge areas, just to take that silly edge off and remind you this game can be challenging.All in all, a short fun little game that you will highly enjoy over a weekend.

Thats pretty much it in a nutshell. That being said the game has lots of humour and even makes use of several internet memes (you see them plastered on billboards in the background) the likes of 'Me Gusta' face.For those of you who are completionists, you'll be happy to discover there are lots of hidden powerups to find, secret caves to discover and two endings, one of which you can only get if you collect all of the mask pieces that are hidden around the world.I would highly recommend this game to anyone who feels like playing something that isn't too taxing on the brain (unless your going after those mask pieces)and has great combat skills.

												This is my first review and was made purely to help me get used to writing more, please don't judge it too harshlyI didn’t think much of Guacamelee before I played it, but the roughly 5 hour experience was very satisfying. It begins like any typical videogame hero story, a weak hero goes about his day doing menial tasks that conveniently teach the player how to interact with the world when suddenly, the villain appears taking the love interest with him. While very cliche, it is still done well and throws in fairly interesting characters and amusing twists to fit the theme.  The traditional Mexican art style is an interesting new take that helps articulate the theme of the world, which is paired with a very catchy mix of Mexican instruments and techno. My only real complaint lies in the default female luchador design, whose extremely large chest is barely covered by a long white cloth wrapped around her chest. Then from her waist comes a long transparent skirt that might as well not be there. However there is an alternate costume that features her in more reasonable dress, though it must be bought ingame. There is also a reasonably large skin modding community for the pc.At first glance, Guacamelee’s combat may seem button mashy, but that tactic will only get you past the first quarter of the game before It is harshly punished. Most enemies either actively dodge about, dig into the ground to avoid harm, or show no reaction to blows at all until death. The only way to reliably produce a combo with these enemy types is to keep them airborne for as long as possible which requires very careful timing. This is where most of the game’s challenge comes from as the puzzles are usually relatively simple and mostly only require figuring out with what timing to use which ability. The boss fights are much like these puzzle areas, usually actively punishing use of the same tactics that would be used on enemy groups. There are also plenty of powerups to find and purchase consisting of power grapples, health and stamina upgrades, and costumes. The power grapples are basically variants of the throws that either do focus damage, do damage around you, or simply do more damage to the enemies that are hit.Guacamelee is a solid Metroid-vania with wonderful art and music that very much deserves your attention.

												Liked: The fighting is fast-paced, lots of opportunities to pull of combos. The setting is unique, colorful and funny.Disliked: The platforming WILL become tedious... BEWARE! Sometimes too many things are happening on screen during a fight that your best course of action will be to buttom mash. SPOLIER: The transitioning between worlds ability is annoying.Overall a good game :)			"

												Occasionally frustrating but always a blast. There is a LOT going on between the combat system, the platforming, and (Dios mio) the instant world-swapping mechanic. It's fun on its own, but it's meant to be played with a buddy (and is rife with opportunities to completely screw each other over until you're laughing and punching each other). And you WILL want someone on hand to help you solve some particularly diabolic jumps; thankfully there are unlimited continues and you'll generally respawn on the last platform you were standing on, or at least the entrance to the room. Give this game a chance even if you aren't fond of platformers, and you may just find a new favorite co-op game.			"

												If you watched the video, read the store description, and thought, ""That sounds like fun,"" you should just buy the game now. The controls are responsive, the flavor is engaging, and the story is predictable but well executed. While the main storyline on normal mode isn't particularly difficult, but some of the side areas (for life/energy boosts, new costumes ... and more ...) involve fiendish platforming and/or cleverly combining the various special abilities. The combat is easy to get into but offers a lot of opportunity for skill, as you'll learn under the tutelage of the Combo Chicken.They're not kidding about the chickens, by the way. Lots and lots of chickens. When Link has nightmares, he dreams about Guacamelee.(I haven't had a chance to try the co-op yet, so I can't comment on it.)			"

												Very good melee platformer in a clean and crisp Mexican art style centered around a hero who finally becomes a Luchador. The controls are tight, enemies are varied, and platforming is fun(especially once you start getting more powers and abilities). ive never really cared for Mexican/hispanic/w.e music, but this music is good and compliments the game perfectly.

												A satisfying game. Guacamelee! is not a long game by any means, it took me about 4 or 5 hours to get to the ending on normal difficulty the first time through, collecting about 50% of everything. I feel like I haven't really seen everything there is to see quite yet. I'd suspect that finding everything would take a lot longer, and that the additional challenges found in Gold Edition will make it last longer. Combat feels right, and is much deeper than it initially feels. The game is pretty unforgiving and difficult, especially near the end, so old-school gamers can enjoy that. If you're up the the challenge, Guacamelee! is a great game, filled with dozens of references to other games in an environment that's dripping with personality. It should be noted as well that the game features local co-op. It's a lot of fun to play with the right friend, but some of the platforming sections feel as though they were designed with a single person in mind and can be difficult to pass with a second player. However, playing alone you'll wish you had a second set of fists against some of the tougher battles. It's all possible alone or with a friend. It's better with someone else overall. Try it both ways.			"

												If you're going to make a generic Metroidvania, it has to have something more than just exploring and collecting. What made Symphony of the Night wasn't just that you did these things, but that you did it in a setting that had a sense of place. This one give us Mexican ""culture"" that boarders on stereotype (tequila and quesadillas, anyone?) and ""temples"" (you know, because of Aztec culture and stuff) that are bland and characterless. This could have been a great game, but the developers went for ""cheap rip-off"" in every way imaginable, from gameplay to setting. At least the combat is fun.			"

												Challenging platformer.Guacamalee is a 'Metroid-styled, 2D- platformer developed by DrinkBox Studios. The plot of the game revolves around a farmer named Juan trying to to rescue the president's daughter from the clutches Carlos (the skeleton) who is goiing to sacrafice her in order to rule the world. In order to do so, Juan chases Carlos and defeats his lackies along the way.Soundtrack is fantastic, giving off a mexican feel and draws you into the unique world. There is no voice acting with character dialogue through text. The sound effects for attacks are also good.The graphics suit the game well. the colours are  vibrant and  not distracting, and do a good  job at instilling the mexican atmosphere in the game. Furthermore,  the characters and stages all have a mexican styled design to them which helps invoke the mexican atmosphere in the game.Gameplay revolves around platforming and combat. The platforming in in this game varies between simple to challenging. Some platforms only require a few moves to get to such as simply jumping on them, while more challenging ones require precisely timed executions in order to reach. For the challenging platforming areas, it is difficult to get the precise key inputs through the keyboard as it can only detect a limited number of inputs at a time. I was forced to play with a 360 controller which made the experience more fluid and less frustrating. In combat you face a wide variety of foes including skeletons, dragons and  giants which either have melee or ranged attacks. The aim is mainly to unleash as many combos on them as possible to prevent them from attacking you. You have a varity of attacks which you can used to defeat your foes or to help reach platforms from side smash, uppercut and throws. You unlock more moves as you progress through the story. Furthermore, you can upgrade you character in variety of ways including increasing health, damage and spawn delay (by spending money). Furthermore, you can play the game via local co-op with a friend.There are alot of references to other videogames such as nintendo characters Mario and Link (with mexican vibes to them). Furthermore, there are secrets hidden withen each area which allows you to unlock new costumes for your character. The different costumes each have a unique trait, such as increasing health/damage, which you can use to change how you tackle the combat. Plenty of other secrets lie in the game including secret stage which you can unlock by collecting enough money.I highly recommend this game to people you love unique and challenging platformers.			"

												I like platformers, even though the genre's golden age seems to be long gone. Nevertheless, I was eager to try this one. Unfortunately, it's just to demanding for me. The controls are way to complicated and I don't only mean the melee (difficult, but satisfying and rewarding), but several times I ended up infuriated by a stupid arcade puzzle forcing me to mash my gamepad's buttons with ridiculous pace and timing. I like my games to be challenging, but what I hate is when the challenge comes from the controls. Maybe I'm getting too old for this, but making the simplifying the keyboard/gamepad config would make this game better, IMO. Pity, really, cause I love the graphical style, the music and the overall feel Guacamalee provides, yet from a certain point it has become unplayable for me.			"

												With tons of Indie platformers out there it’s really hard to bring something new into the picture. Guacamelee is a love letter to the Metroid and the movie ""Nacho Libre"". The world, albeit graphically not particularly rich (some could argue with the artistic style the developers opted for) is fun to explore.  Very much like in the Metroid series the old areas expand as your abilities to better explore become available. I also really liked the opportunity to switch between two worlds that added greatly to the old areas and also had practical function to it.The platforming mechanics are solid, the RPG elements are there but in really shallow kind of way, the story and side quests are amusing. The Mexican music I found myself not too fond of, but it certainly is appropriate. The game has plenty of character. Basically this an all-around solid title and if you are fond of plaforming adventure games you can’t go wrong with this one.8/10			"

												A punishing little platform brawler, this one. Chock full of references and very solid feeling (probably in many senses of the word). Do not purchase if: a) you're allergic to difficultly spike boss fights b) platforming that requires perfect timing isn't your thing.This is a finely crafted little game, with plenty of hidden little things. I've not tried the co-op, but it looks good. It could do with a few more reasons to use the options available (costumes and throwing moves in the shop have various effects), but I'm happy I played it through. Look up the ""good ending"" on youtube rather than go hunting, though, since it looks like there's a braid-esque post-game item hunt that is a bit of a waste of time.			"

												A fun 2d beat-em-up/metroidvania. You play as a luchador that uses his wrestling moves as mobility skills as well as for combat. Having the power of switching between the world of the dead and living makes for interesting platforming where some platforms only exists in the living world and such.The game is full of gags, many which are popular/gaming culture related. If you don't find that type of jokes fun you might get a little put off as the jokes are many. In the main game most of the platforming and combat is pretty easy but some of the extra side stuff can be pretty hard. This results in that you will have a pretty relaxing time to soak in the great artstyle and laugh at the jokes. The game will probably last between 5-10 hours depending on play style. If you want to make a rerun on hardmode you can increase the life of the game again.			"

												Guacamelee is a game with fantastic style, great music, funny humor, meme & pop culture references aplenty, and some solid gameplay.There are various powers and abilities are are drip-fed to the player in true Metroid-Vania fashion. The world increasingly expands as you learn new powers and explore further.There are some really clever moments and puzzles that involve spinning all you've learned together to finish a section.The game prepares you pretty well for what is coming, though the Mask Levels are absurdly difficult. The Infierno levels are also similarly overly hard. And the final form of Calaca is also a far cry from what you've experienced up until that point.In summary, a great game marred by some stupid artificial difficulty in some parts in order to increase its LOLDIFFICULT status and distinguish itself from ""gaems 4 casuls"".

												Guacamelee is a very good Metroidvania style game. It has a great melee combat system with a lot of depth in the form of different special moves. You can also juggle enemies in the air for what seems like an infinite amount. The combat system is brilliant and it is very satisfying to pull off tricky combos using different special moves in succession. Guacamelee has also a very distinct artstyle that gives a lot of personality to the game, and the soundtrack is also a very great effort, and it supports the Mexican setting of the game superbly.The story is buried in cliches, but the game kind of embraces its basic video game plot, and has a lot of nods to mostly Super Mario Bros for their similar damsel in distress style plots. On the negative side the game has also a lot of internet meme references. They seem kind of pointless, and I think the game would have been better off without them, but I quess Guacamelee could serve as a kind of time capsule for 2010's ""internet culture"" for future generations to discover.Guacamelee cloud certainly be seen as a timeless classic because of its tight controls and memorable look and sound, but on the other hand the internet memes keep it firmly stuck in the present.

Give this game a chance even if you aren't fond of platformers, and you may just find a new favorite co-op game.			"

												The way Guacamelee make use of the platforms is really intuitive and comical, one of the better modern platform games that I've played. It's a humorous game that will last you at least few hours or a lot more depending on how ambitious you are. Along the way you will fight a lot of ""monsters"" and also gain ""skills"". You need to make use of these skills in the correct way to kill off the variety of monsters you might face. The skill and combos system are well balanced, with that in mind the game can seem a bit difficult for casual gamers like myself. There are also plenty of puzzles that are very solvable if you just put some effort to it. The visuals of this game is stunning, no complaints. The soundtracks however were not able to match up with the rest of the game.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CONTROLLER.I can not stress that enough. I bought the game and naively thought I could play it just fine without a controller. I was wrong. The combos and platforming get so complex that my keyboard had a bit of a heart attack and so did my fingers, they both couldn't take so many keys at the same time. Then was having a hard time preforming one of the first combos you learn due to this problem. I took a screen shot of it for this review, it's in my screenshots if you'd like to see. Anyways, So I had to dig through some boxes and after two hours I programmed a controller to the game. Gaucamelee is severly hard without a controller, it was so hard I began to rage at the keyboard. But after getting a controller the game became very pleasant to play. It is such a well done game it made it on my favorites list. It combines platforming, humor, puzzles and fighting and creates a very enjoyable and entertaining atmosphere. The combat is really strong whearas in a similar metroidvania like game, Castle Crashers it really doesn't deal such a ""GIVE ME MORE COMBAT"" feel which is rare in these types of games. The controls are nice and run smooth on a CONTROLLER. But again not on a keyboard. The animation is very amusing and fun to look at. And that about covers it. My opinion, it is a must own if you have a controller. Lots of fun and a lot of reply value I might add. So if you have the money I highly suggest it. My final rating is 9/10.			"

												This is a great game. Everything from the platforming, combat,and art style to the unique, Mariachi influenced music will captivate you. While it is a small touch, I enjoy discovered the classic game references throughout each level. Trust me, they are plentiful. Just be sure to have a solid PC gamepad before you get it though. It is nearly impossible to play meaningfully on a keyboard. Take my word for it.			"
