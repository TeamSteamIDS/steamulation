												There are many games that I love and some that I hate but never before I have played a game that made me love it and hate it at the same time. Remember Me is that game. Before we get to that some background is required. I finished it on easy and on hard difficulty, found every collectible, and did every achievement. I have spent 22 hours with it - yes, it's that short a game.Why do I hate it, you ask?I hate it for the promise of being something greater than what it is. I hate it for the linear design and poor controls. I hate it for being told what to do and not being allowed to find it for myself. This game holds your hand from beginning to end. There is a lot of collectibles to be found but they are easy to find. They grant you more health or power or unlock artwork but do not give you any additional information about the world. There is a lot of climbing and a lot of fighting, and some more climbing and some more fighting. Fighting is competent but pales in comparison to Batman Arkham Asylum. The climbing is boring. Don’t get me wrong, I love climbing in games, but it has to give you the illusion of choice and discovery like in Prince of Persia or Assassin’s Creed. Here you have only one route that is always obvious. The camera is lazy and stiff and does not help you at all. There is no puzzle, there is no discovery. Every ledge that you can grab is highlighted for you. You just climb and run and open doors to get to another fight.That's not a good recommendation is it? Well, I do recommend this game for the things that I love about it, which outweigh anything that I hate about it. And what is that, you ask?I love it for the story: this is one of the best sci-fi stories I have read, watched or played in my life. It's up there with Blade Runner, Ubik, Neuromancer, and Ghost in the Shell. It's philosophical, emotional, mature and a little too pompous for its own good. The dialogues can be a little too poetic and dramatic at times, but they still fit the story. I won’t give any spoilers, because the story is the true worth of this game.I love it for the music: this is a journey in itself, the music defies description. You just have to listen to it, especially how it changes during the fight.I love it for the graphics because the actual graphics deliver what is promised to us by the concept artists so many times and rarely delivered. We often see the beautiful concept art for games that we love and we hope they could look like the artist imagined, but we know that the technology is not there yet. In this case the programmers delivered. Using the Unreal 3 engine and DirectX 9.0 the programmers from DONTNOD show a vision of New Paris that will stay in your memory forever.And finally I love it for the ability to remix memories of other characters. It is such a powerful game mechanic it is a pity it was implemented so poorly. The game allows you to remix a crucial memory of four characters in the game but there is only one right solution. It is such a wasted opportunity for branching story. It would be fun to replay the game just to see how the story would unfold if the memory of a character was remixed differently. Well, maybe another time, eh?So should you play this game, you ask?YES, play it for the story and the sensual feast that it is! It's a unique experience that you will Remember for a long time.			"

												Remember Me is a very fun game in my opinion. First of all the positives: 1. One of the biggest positives of the game is it's graphics. From the very start right to the end your treated with breathtaking views, wonderful scenery and some great detail. it's not perfect but it's certanly a lot better then most games I've played.2. Sound and music is another big positive. The music soundtrack is absolutly brillant and the way the music reacts to what is going on in combat is a nice feature. The sound effects are quite well done as well but the ambient background noise along with the great scenery work really well together to create a relistic enviroment that makes you want to explore.3.  It has a great story line and the game does well to help keep track on whats going on. The story has many plot twists and does a good job of making you think ""what's going to happen next?"" or ""who's the real enemy, Edge or Memorize?""4. Gameplay. Some people have complained about the combat system in this game but personally I like it, it involves timing your punches and kicks and remembering different combinations to pull off the biggest combos. On top of that you can customize the types of attacks you throw in those combos for example you might start with some regen pressons to heal yourself at the start then put some power pressons at the end to do big damage dealing attacks at the end of the combo.Another type of gameplay this game brings is a feature called memory remixing. At certain points in this game you have to remix someones memory and this involves going backwards and forwards in the memory to alter certain things at certain times to meet the required objective. It's a very nice feature that is fun and gets your brain thinking but it looses its charm slightly once you know how to succeed in them. Also they could of done with having more of them in the game.Sadly although it does have it's good bits, it does have bad bits as well.1. Controls. The biggest con is definetly the controls. They are very fiddly and Niln isn't exactly the best when it comes to turning and sometimes it can take a second for the controls to work which is a nightmare in this one perticular point where you have 1/2 second to react to things otherwise you die. The control problem can also be seen when your climbing around on walls as the camera sometimes confuses the game on where you want to go for example instead of going left it might send you down.2. Bugs. This game has quite a few and I've defiently come across a few game breaking bugs that have caused me to die or get stuck. Even the tutorial in the 1st memory remix can cause a bug as it stops you from altering the memory unless you do exactly what it says but it's very easy to stray slightly away from that and it has hit me twice already. Another bug that has happened was myself hopping out of a window (which your meant to do) but then I accidently climbed back in but the game treated it strangly and instead of putting me back in the room it glitched me through a wall and giving me the abillity to walk in the air which caused me to reload the last checkpoint.Overall if you look past the bugs and the fiddly controls it is a very nice and entertaining game and I certainly love playing it. Different people have had different reactions to this game but this is my overall opinion.			"

												Remember Me is an underappreciated story-driven game with stunning visuals but repetitive combat.In the futuristic setting of Neo-Paris, memories are digitized commodities. You are Nilin, a memory hunter with the rare ability to enter and alter people's memories - a threat. You start the game after having been imprisoned where you've had nearly all your memories wiped, and it's from here you must escape and uncover the full story of who you were.

Visually the game is so covered in detail I found it hard not to take screenshots of every little thing. Environments are meticulously crafted to a point of complexity rarely seen in other titles. You'll find there is a real sense of scale and grandness to the world, and with the nuanced detail given to its citizens and conversations you overhear it begins to feel alive. You can tell a lot of work went into the concept and design of each area.As you plunge through levels of society including the homes of the rich elite and slums where memory junkies have become mutated forms of themselves, it only gets darker as you uncover the full truth. Each chapter ends with a cutscene where Nilin ruminates on the dystopian society she is newly discovering and tries to see her place in it. While being a bit overly melodramatic in these, Nilin's character is written in such a way as to be insightful and emotive. It was a controversial choice by Dontnod to have a female lead character but they were adamant - and I think her genuine nature is one to be praised.

Unfortunately there are some drawbacks to the gameplay. Where you may wish the game was more open world to explore, it's not. Instead of having any semblance of freedom you're led along a linear path with not-so-dynamic parkour and climbing where your only choice is to jump from convenient ledge to convenient ledge to reach the next objective, usually an uninspired mob fight. Combat also quickly becomes repetitive, relying on pressing a sequence of buttons to do moves and receive chain bonuses. There's not much to it, though special abilities try to keep things interesting.Alternately, its most creative and compelling implementation is ""memory remixing"" where you can use your ability to enter people's memories and manipulate events within them. Here you can rewind in a scene to make a subtle change, often only slightly moving a minor object, and watch how new events unfold. Each time is meaningful and fascinating, and in my opinion it wasn't used nearly enough. It emphasizes the idea that altering a single event, or the memory of it, can change a whole life's trajectory.

Altogether, Remember Me is a game to admire for its visuals, storytelling and dystopian setting, and for a small studio it's absolutely impressive. Don't miss checking out the excellent soundtrack too. You'll have to deal with lacklustre combat and linear progression, but ultimately it's the elaborate presentation of the world and its background that make it worthwhile.			"

												What seems to be common from many reviews is the expectations that many people had going into the game, and either finished disappointed, or didn't finish at all. I will say that though Capcom's Remember Me isn't the best game ever, probably not even close, it is a unique experience in more ways than one, keeping my attention throughout the game.Combat works and plays out like Batman, but not quite as fluid. The ability to change up your combos makes for a refreshing experience each time. Enemies are can be quite tough in numbers--especially when they differ in types, forcing you to use different tactics for various enemies. Button mashing won't get you very far.The platforming and exploration are the weakest links, as they are far too scripted. You never get a sense that you're in immediate danger from scaling walls. And exploration is so linear, so confined, which is a shame considering Neo-Paris is a major sight to behold.Memory Remixes are the star of Remember Me, setting it apart from other action/adventure games. Basically, you can hack into peoples memories and alter things, changing the outcome of their behavior. It's fun to mess around and experiment. Not to mention, the memory remixes give great insight into Nilin's character; you really get a sense that she is conflicted with the ethics of what she is doing, which, in my opinion, makes her a very human character to whom we can relate.The story... I won't elaborate about it. You really need to experience it for yourself because it will blow you away. Some of the writing is awful, though. But most of it works.Overall, fantastic game. The story and lore are the strongest aspects. The game play is, for the most part, solid. Remember Me is a game you don't want to miss.			"

Posted: May 21, 2015
TL;DR --> I will remember it.------------------------------------------------Once again, I've learned the lesson not to believe in official reviewers. This game was VERY nice and I'm gonna say why did it get all those mixed reviews.Before that, I'll just summer the game storyline in one paragraph so we can move on into a more interesting debate: Remember Me takes place in Paris, year 2084. In this context people has developed into a point where memories can be digitally stored and even modified, both good and bad ones. At this point of the history, some people gets full control of all those memores storage and hierarchy is still a never-ending conflict. You take control of Nilin, a young girl who lost her memories without knowing why (obviously) and wakes up into a prison cell. I won't speak more because of spoilers.Now the pros, cons, and specially why I disagree with official reviewers. - First of all, the mechanics of the game are simplistic and nothing innovative at all. Combat system is nothing from the other world and even though you can create your own combos the feature is not as squeezed as it could. Moreover the camera movement can become your greatest foe at some points.However... honestly, who would care about those mechanics? Almost all new games are just a remix from others of the past. All action games are inspired by other action games, just like FPS games (which is the best example). Was someone actually looking for something new in the combat system? As long as controls are tight and responsive, I'm OK with that. And they are in this game, so just move along.- Graphics are very beautiful. The city is astoundingly cool and I didn't expect to find this mixed aesthetics between old-fashioned, modern and cyberpunk. If you go for minor bugs, invisible walls and locked doors, you'll find plenty. But seriously, this game was crafted to follow a story, so why the hell would you enter into a clothes shop anyway?- Soundtrack is awesome. A mix between orchestra and future music suits perfectly, and so it's demonstrated into this game. It's a very cool feature and you probably won't be disappointed with it. - Average difficulty is insultingly easy. I've played action games on Easy mode harder than this game on the hardest settings. Chill out a bit and for your dignity just pick hard difficulty from start 'cause you won't have a trouble.- As I said, camera can be problematic. I'm fine that during the exploration, climbing and jumping parts the camera moves for me so it focuses on where should I be looking at, but during combat and some specific times it is just killing.- Length is OK. I've just beated the main story in about 9h, and I'll probably need another 3-5h to get all the achievements. Just the average for a story-driven game. - The game is linear as hell. No submissions, no shortcuts, nothing. The game just drives you where it wants to, so if you're looking for a sandbox-like, look elsewhere. As for me, I'm OK when games are linear if I ALREADY KNOW they're gonna be one. - The story is very catchy and will keep you for more. It's the main feature of the game and at least for me in wasn't disappointing in any state. It won't be the best storyline you'll play in a videogame, but it's a good one. A GOOD one. All in all, Remember Me has been a very enjoyable experience and I wouldn't mind replaying the game. I seriously think that official reviewers can't enjoy games anymore. They just purchase them, grab their shotgun and instead of focusing on what's the purpose of a game, they simply try to find as many flaws as possible in order to make their ""objective"" analysis. FFS, if you look for flaws into this game, you'll find TONS OF; the thing is that no one should care at all. So stop looking for perfection in every aspect and play the game for the story.As I'm ignoring these mechanics garbage, I'll tell you what actually would make the game not that enjoyable to you:- The most remarkable con I found is that the game constantly treats you like an idiot. It takes your hand in EVERY way, even on the climbing thing. There's no space for thinking; exploring; doubting; discovering. It's like you live in an endless tutorial. Hints are cool when you're familiarizing with the controls 'n' stuff but not for the WHOLE game!- [MAYBE SPOILER] The Memory Remix feature is incredibly interesting and sadly developers didn't take all the potential it had. I know you should just mix the relevant characters' memories, but goddammit it's so good it's actually THE THING that keeps you for more! I wish there were more stuff like this, since this is what can make me enjoy a triple A game.- Collectibles. I hate collectibles. They're usually an artificial way to keep you playing a game against your will so I put it as a con, as I'd do in any game.All in all, this game caught my attention way to much time ago and now that I've played it I don't regret any euro I've spent in it. I'm a fan of cyberpunk games and dystopian backgrounds and this game has been a drug to me. In a good way. Don't let official reviewers fool you: this game is very cool and they're focusing their analysis in an unfairly biased way.Final Mark: 8/10 "

												Don't let the 'thumb down' fool you. I wouldn't recommend it for the current price, but I also wouldn't tell anybody to never play it. It's nice to see a game with a female protagonist who's actually well written. I just have mixed feelings about the game.I've played this game on PS3 and now I'm doing another playthrough on PC and I thought my opinion would change, but it hasn't. Remember Me is (unfortunately) one of those games that should've been great but instead it was... average.I'll start what I personally disliked the most: the combat. There's a great idea in there somewhere, putting together your own combos like that and in the first 2 chapters I enjoyed it. But it stays the same pretty much throughout the whole game and it soon becomes tedious. It becomes a chore, something you have to get through in order to move the story forward. The fact that I dislike the combat so much is really overshadowing the game's great protagonist and story, because combat comes back so often. Unlike memory remixes, which really only happen a few times (which is odd).As for the rest, I'll sum them up in pros and cons. Starting with the pros:+ Great protagonist. Nilin is a well-written character. She's not forced to be sexy or witty. She's just a strong, smart character. I really enjoyed her monologues after each chapter. (Why isn't she a poet?)+ Edge is another good character (who should just become a poet). At first, I did not understand his purpose in the game but it all becomes clear in the end.+ Beautiful environment.+ Memory mixes.Cons:- Unenjoyable combat. I wouldn't necessarily call it 'bad', but it's just... not satisfying at all. And the fact that there's a fight pretty much every few minutes does not help the matter.- Pretty much zero interaction with environment. Neo-Paris is (probably) a wonderful place to be. It's beautiful, it's alive. Also, all the stores are closed. Those who are open do not allow you to get in. You will not be able to wander off to that crowd of protestors, or talk to the woman who mutters something about you as you walk by. This game is basically forcing you to take a linear approach (aside from the few collectibles there are to gather).- Not enough memory mixes!That's about all I can say about this game. It was such a promising idea and I still consider Nilin and her story to be great, it's just unfortunate that she's in a game that's unenjoyable to play.I'll probably work on finishing the game anyway, and getting some achievements. I guess that's typically Dutch! I paid for it, so I'm gonna play it.			"

TL;DR: If you're the type that can admire a well-crafted and stylish world over flawless action, then I recommend you pick up Remember Me. I just completed a blind playthrough of Remember Me. I had never heard of the game before and only picked it up because it was included in the most recent Humble Bundle. I'm very pleased because I was able to enjoy a game that I otherwise would have completely skipped over. From the futuristic Neo-Paris penthouses to the dark and blood-streaked slums, Remember Me is quite aesthetically appealing. There is only one HUD element and it remains hidden unless in combat. The special effects and soundtrack match exceptionally well to the world. The game has unique style and an impressive amount of attention to detail. It is rare for an action game to be so focused on ambience and aesthetics. That focus is why Remember Me was so enjoyable.The gameplay itself has some shortcomings, though. The camera can be frustrating at times and you're limited to about four combinations. There is some variability with how the combos can be set up, but largely you'll be mashing X/Y and dodging relentlessly. The game is also very linear. There is no exploration other than the occasional dead-end detour hiding a collectible. Finally, the unskippable cutscenes are a travesty of proper game design. The combat is redeemed through a few clever elements. There is a feature where you can reconfigure your combos to heal, reduce cooldowns, or strike more powerfully. There are also activated abilities called S-Pressens which have varying effects such as turning invisible, stunning enemies, or causing a large explosion. The ranged weapon also adds some utility and combat value. Enemies throughout the game (and several bosses) might require a mixture of all the above. I would rather emphasize the characteristics that make a game memorable than lament a combat system that is otherwise forgettable. I really enjoyed Remember Me. While I wouldn't pay full price for the game, it was an absolute steal at bundle/sale price.			"

I'll put my TL:DR first. This is a great game with a very interesting, fresh, story. Don't go in expecting and amazing combat system, but it'll do for this game. Constantly got chills down my spine. Come for the world and story, stay for punching and kicking faces into the ground.Okay, so more details... What this game does well (IMO): It tells a great, compelling story that you can very easily get engrossed in for about 9 hours of single player, story mode game play. This is a hand-to-hand focused combat game. There is a ranged weapon that is also a game mechanic.The game play is good. The game does a very good job at making you feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥/b> when you're fighting 7v1. The targeting is basically automatic, yet you feel like you have control over who you want to hit. Then you go and punch their face into the ground.This game has good visuals. When I say visuals I mean the graphics and aesthetic. The graphics in the game are pretty good. There are complex scenes that seem vast and large. They look amazing the entire time. Does not even bog down my computer for what seems like entire cities being rendered. At no time did I feel they skimped on the visuals, except at times when you'd get close to a player texture. The quality is good, but not ""oh my god, this is fantastic.""The aesthetic (different the graphics) is very good. They keep to the same style through out the entire game. You visit a few places, and they seem to be done very well. They are engaging and full of life at all times. The art team did very well here.What the game does wrong. There are a few things that the game does wrong. The number one thing for me is: THE CAMERA MOVEMENT IN THIS GAME IS SO CRAPPY IT BREAKS IMMERSION. Seriously, it's hard to look up and see what you want to see. Let alone see what the art team has created for you to explore. Most of the time I found myself looking at the ground.Due to the bad camera, movement at times can be tricky. This leads to some bad deaths, or just getting frustrated at the game.Some of this game is scaling walls / parkor?. The system for this is meh at best. You don't ever do it in combat, so it's not like you're getting angry at it a lot.OverallI really enjoyed this game. Multiple times during the story I got chills down my spine. The story drags you in, and keeps you there. As long as the bad camera does not drag you out of the story, you can be sure that you'll enjoy this enriching, vast, world as you punch and kick faces into the pavement!			"

												I picked Remember Me up during the Summer Sale for something like £5 and feel it was a lovely bargain. The game is set against a neo-futuristic Paris, with a civil war brewing over the use of dodgy memory machines which are causing havoc.The game feels a heck of a lot like it took a lot of inspiration from Deus Ex, and that's a great thing. The game feels like a very very very linear Deus Ex (emphasis on very, this game is on rails).The fighting can get a bit tedious, but after completing it on the hardest difficulty in 9 hours I can say that some points provided a significant challenge and the story was very enjoyable.For the first game by a new studio, it's very impressive. Can't wait to see what they make next!Nilesy			"

												There are 3 things that make Remember Me a memorable game:1) Fighting: Although technically you just keep pressing a button, timing is important and the combos themselves are put together by you. It is not really the punch or kick you pick but their ""type"" - some will heal you but cause less damage, others increase your Focus bar so that you can unleash special attacks once it is full and there are those that can break some enemies' defenses. It is very rewarding to have your own moves and you unlock some special attacks even towards the end of the game. Remember Me remembers to remain new and original.2) Be Kind, Rewind: Occasionally you get to see a cutscene, a memory of someone who is vital to the story. This is a memory you can tamper with. Why? Because it is important for that person to remember something else. To remember that it happened in a different way. You start moving your mouse clock- or anticlockwise (depending on whether you want to go back or forward during the short film) and try to look for glitches, items you can tamper with. And once you make the changes the memory may turn out to be a completely different experience. This is an amazing feature and my only issue with it is that only a couple were included in the story.3) The environment / story: This is a believable world, a world full of leaping creatures in alleyways, sewers and full of robots / drones doing the daily chores in shops and various facilities. You notice ATM machines offering cash in exchange for memories. And when you get to climb up and reach the rooftops as you finally leave behind the dark slums you spot the Eiffel Tower. It looks the same in 2084 but its gleaming whiteness is in contrast with the riots and struggle and sadness happening on the streets of Paris. You, Nilin, are tasked to solve this problem. While at first the game wants you to find out who you are it gradually incorporates more elements of this new world into the story and makes Nilin realise who she is and what exactly is the Big Picture.Easily a must grab for sci-fi fans. Pick it up if you are eager to get your hands on something original. In the meantime, Remember You Soon!			"

												For some people, first impressions are generally inaccurate. Sure, there are people that seem to have a genetic knack for quick judgement calls which turn out to be largely factual, but I'm not one of them. After starting Remember Me, I assumed I was playing another run-of-the-mill action adventure game, but before long I came to realise I was actually enjoying it.Set in a dystopian future, players assume the role of Nilin, a ""Memory Hunter"" who, ironically, has had her own memories stolen. Guided by the ever-present voice of Edge, the leader of the rebel group, Errorist Movement, Nilin must take down the Memorize corporation who, in controlling memories, effectively controls the population. I'm a bit of a sci-fi junkie, and the premise surrounding Remember Me is an interesting one. The futuristic setting of Neo-Paris is beautifully crafted, with great contrasts between the slums and affluent areas of the city, which makes the very linear nature of the game much more apparent. Sadly, exploring just isn't an option. The highlights of the game though, are definitely the ""Memory Remix"" scenes, where players need to tweak certain aspects of a person's memory to alter it. Unfortunately, you're only presented with a handful of opportunities to attempt this, and I think the game would have been better if more of the focus was on remixing memories. Aside from synaptic DJing, Nilin is also an adept hand-to-hand combatant, and the combat system does allow for a bit of tactical fun once all the combos and unique ""S-Pressen"" moves have been unlocked. It's not exactly complex, but there is some added depth to the button mashing. Overall, I think Remember Me is an enjoyable game, without being an innovative one. I'm glad I was off the mark with my initial assumption. I'd certainly recommend this to sci-fi fans, since the setting and story were part of the appeal for me.			"

												After a bumpy ride, I finally completed the game. Hoooo boy, where do i begin? This title came highly recommended by friends, and of course the reviews. Let's start with the good stuffs.+ Strong female lead. Nilin is such a bad♥♥♥♥♥+ Intriguing storyline. Kept me interested.+ Interesting world. Dystopian Neo Paris looks so cool (I kept wondering why I saw more robots than humans in the city). + Combo labs that you can personalize for different fights.+ Remixing memories is fun.+ Easy combat skills and cool powers to help in fights.+ Graphics looks great.+ Good voice acting.+ Good soundtrack.Now the negatives:- Very slow unskippable cut scenes. And why does Nilin walk so slow every time she talks to Edge? Can't she run and talk at the same time?- Nilin's monologues that doesn't seem to contribute much to the story. Again, unskippable.- The camera sucks. - Repetitive and annoying boss fights.  Just dodge and mash mouse buttons. Sometimes, your combo doesn't register.- Memory remix as a selling point but only get to do it, like, 4 times in the game. - Very linear, you can't get lost in this game. Paths are marked. Unfortunate really, I'd love to see more of Neo Paris.I enjoyed the story (completed the game, just for the ending). The gameplay, though, not so much. Would I recommend this title? Meh, only if you can get it cheaply. Not worth the full price. My Rating: 6/10			"

												Its alright.Very cinematic, shiny, with alot of polish VISUALLY.  Story is strong.  Above average.Game pacing is wonky and the controls are unbearable unless played with a controller.The game is extremely linear.  There are a few collectables (standard increase health, increase mana stuff) but the game is such a straight line that the collectables (that might be in the occasional closet) don't increase game value OR replayability.  Game length is around 8 hours (sans dicking around).To make this clear, your in this for the story, that may be about it.At the time of writing Remember Me is $49.99.  I would reccomend not picking it up at this price, and perhaps waiting for a Steam Sale.Enjoyable.  I finished it for the story, and the graphics, but suffered through the pacing, linearity and controls.     B			"

												I think this game is underrated.  It is a beautiful cyberpunk game that has a little bit of everything - good story, strong female lead, interesting characters, detailed environment, puzzles, platforming, combat system with customization, and creative elements.   I can understand some of the complaints about repetitiveness of combat and linear levels, but other good story-driven games are like that too.   I guess it is a matter of perspective.   If you are like me and don't finish games in one sit-down, those complaints probably won't matter much.  I actually couldn't wait for my next break so I could continue the story.  On sale, this game is a steal imho.			"

												I truly enjoyed this game!  There are so many things to like here; the noir cyberpunk story, the amazing visuals, Nil herself, the boss fights, and the innovative memory editing feature. This is the type of game that totally takes you on an adventure and makes you care about the characters.  Its a good mix of platforming, puzzle solving, and fighting. My only complaints are I thought the fighting is a little meh and setting up your powers and modifications correctly can be a pain sometimes.  I also found a couple boss fights to be tricky/buggy.I highly recommend this game, I think its an underrated treasure! :D			"

												well it's obviously a gorgeous game --- the character models, acting and mocaps are exquisite! ...and it's still in DX9, can you believe it? besides borderlands, this has got to be the apex of what DX9 can do.storywise, it's like a spin off omar naim's 'the final cut' (look it up if you get a chance).[journal.remembermegame.com]now the gameplay is where people might find the cons on this title --- we've seen other capcom fighting games, yeah? well it's nothing like any of those... this one couldn't make up it's mind whether it's gonna be like batman's arkham series or bungie's vintage fighting game 'oni'.think of batman in the arkham series; except you can't counter attack... THAT's this game.now logicly, it makes sense coz the female protagonist nilin is barely 120lbs (?) in built and size... if you know martial arts, there's nothing for it but to run and dodge coz your stature ain't gonna counter those massive blows from enemies twice your build.oh btw, sometimes the keybinds does not register as well as it should so that's a con too.but overall, it's still a gem.pick it up if you see it on sale!

												Remember Me is a mediocre character action game that nevertheless features a great sense of style and a few interesting puzzly bits.Set in a cyberpunk version of Paris, the story follows ""Memory Hunter"" Nilin as she seeks revenge against the corporation that kidnapped her and stole her memories. I don't want to describe it in any more detail, as Nilin starts the game with almost total amnesia. Finding out what's going on is part of the excitement.The gameplay consists of three main phases: combat, memory manipulation puzzles, and platforming.The relatively innovative memory puzzles take two forms. Occasionally, you will be asked to enter a person's memories and re-order them so that the person remembers events differently than they actually occurred. Also, you will use transferred memory recordings to solve environmental puzzles. Neither of these puzzle types presents a significant challenge, but they are satisfying to solve.On the other hand, the overly-simple platform is a lowlight. The game uses the typical Assassin's Creed-esque auto-sticking type of platforming where it's very hard to miss a jump. It's also entirely linear,  and a glowing marker shows you where you go, so the platform sections essentially boil down to pressing the joystick in the right direction. However, the environments you platform through are often breathtaking. That makes the platforming more sightseeing than actual gameplay.The combat itself tries to be inventive but commits a fatal sin. Your fighting moves include pre-set combos and ultimate moves that require recharging. The ultimate moves look cool but don't involve much thought; they're standard ""press X to take down/kill.""For the rest of the combat, you'll be relying on the combo lab system. This works by given you four preset button combos that must be pressed in a specific order. However, the effect of each button press within the order can be reassigned - a hit may do extra damage, may regenerate health, or may increase the rate of recharge for your special moves. These effects can be remixed at any time, so you'll frequently find yourself changing up the internal order of the combos when you find yourself in a different kind of fight.Movement and enemy variety within the fights are good, but the combo system also includes the game's biggest problem: combos can only be completed against a single enemy. Moving to another enemy will re-set the combo. You can dodge out of the way and continue your combo, but only if you return immediately to the same enemy. Since the game has no block button, avoiding damage relies entirely on dodging, and since dodging moves you so far that it effectively breaks your combo, it's quite hard to actually finish a combo. This is especially irritating on the highest difficulty, where enemies are considerably faster.Since you can't string your combos together against multiple enemies, the combat fails to flow in the same satisfying manner that it does in the Batman games. At the same time, the fact that you're locked into pre-set button combinations means the game also lacks the depth and precision of more complex spectacle fighters like the Devil May Cry series. Overall, the combat is just awkward and stilted.The relatively fun memory remix puzzles and interesting game world just can't make up for the lame combat, so this one gets a thumbs down. That said, if you can tolerate the poor combat and would like to experience a decent story in a compelling future world, this one might not be a terrible Steam sale purchase.			"

Basic InformationTitle:  Remember MeDeveloper:  DONTNOD EntertainmentPublisher:  CapcomGenre:  3rd Person ActionGeneral ImpressionRemember Me is a nice yet underrated title which presents us with a strong female protagonist in a cyberpunk setting. The time bending and sci-fi Paris are both dominant themes that are not found in too many games. It succesfully mixes 3rd person combat (and some shooting) with sections of puzzle solving and platforming while it manages to bring enough diversity to make the game interesting at all times. I never quite understood why It didn't sell better or receive more attention. It is always sad to see an IP with lots of potential, being sidelined by more generic yearly released titles. I still hope that It will receive a well deserved sequel eventually.Strong Points+ Beautiful graphics and sounds.+ Interesting setting and storyline.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- Barely passable shooting mechanics.Rating 9/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

												Remember Me is the First Project by the French Developers DONTNOD Entertainment, and are certainly shaping up to be a very successful Team with 2 outstanding Games [Life Is Strange]. It has certainly got me excited for the 3rd Game rumoured to be released in 2017 ""Vampyr"".The Game takes place in Futuristic Paris, and comes with a very unique and interesting Story, with some solid Visuals to take in. For the first half of the Game, I found myself to be walking through the streets purely to take in the sights of Neo Paris. As Beautiful as it looks, I just wish it had more interaction to it.It is heavily Story driven with a unique and interesting setting, topped with some very nice Voice Acting. The handful of Characters it has won't be seen much, but they were still well made, and fit in perfectly.I read many comments about how ""Linear"" the Combat is, and personally, Action Games are my least Favourite so I decided to play it on Easy so it was less painful for me. However, I found the Combat very interesting, and more importantly, fluent.Most Games have their general ""Rotation"" for best DPS, and I find this Combat System to be no different from that except you don't have freedom to ""Button Mash"". Infact, you have the ability to Edit the Combo's to add certain effects to each blow. Besides the Normal Combat, you also have a collection of Special Abilities to counter certain Enemies.The Combat reminds me a bit of Assassins Creed. Being surrounded by Enemies, and having to dodge an incoming attack while fighting through, with some allowing a finishing blow ""Overload"". Difference being that unlike Assassins Creed, you don't have the whole Group standing around waiting while 2 Attack you at a time. In Remember Me, ALL of them are going for you, and you need to always be thinking about your position, which Combo to use on who, and which Ability to use on who.My only dislike I have for the System is that you only get a total of 4 Combo's to Edit, unless you buy the DLC. However, it's not a big problem at all because 4 is definitely enough to get by.Besides the Action side of it, it's main focus involves jumping from ledge to ledge with a Waypoint every 10 Meters [which at first I didn't like, but dealt with it]. It has a couple of simple Puzzles, and a few interesting Riddles which I enjoyed, as well as the a few unique scenes to alter Memories.All in all, Remember Me was a very solid experience in all aspects.Genre- Action / AdventureGame Elements- Combat- Quick Time Events- PuzzlesAverage Playthrough- 9 HoursLiked- Interesting and Unique Story- Interesting Combat- Great Main Character- Nice Voice Acting- Beautiful settingDisliked- Needed more Environment Interaction			"

												Mixed feelings is the best way to describe my experience with Remember Me.On one side, cinematography/direction is great, good voice acting (for the most) & interesting story, all woven together into a visually impressive futuristic cyberpunk world of Neo-Paris.On the other side, it’s supremely linear, repetitive & predictable.The combat system tries to be innovative but simply becomes a button bashing exercise. It provides options to create your own combos using different types of attacks. Some may like this level of freedom, but there are multiple points in the game where you need to choose the 'right' combos to get through the fight. This can become frustrating, not to mention also that many of the smaller enemies need 20 .. 30 .. or more hits to take them down unless you use your 'focus' power abilities. Boss fights are more enjoyable, employing different tactics but there are not that many of them compared to the grind of meaningless mob fights. Unlike the excellent combat system in DMC (also from CAPCOM), you generally feel weak & under-powered.After each mob fight scene, you generally have some more 'on-rail' corridors to run down followed by some short 'Tomb Raider' style climbing sections. Rinse & Repeat till a boss fight or cut-scene. Nothing challenging in traversing the world either, and I kept wondering why Nilin had to climb everywhere! Sure she is on the run, but still seemed excessive & out of place sometimes. Almost to the point where they are just trying to cash in on the heroine action/adventure success of Lara Croft (but not really pulling it off).There is next to zero interaction or exploration within this beautiful world which was also a shame and the main character animations of Nilin where pretty basic, not really giving her much personality or detail.On a more positive note, the real standout feature that is very unique & fun to experience is the Memory Remixing. This alone was almost enough to give Remember Me a 'Thumbs Up'. Yet these are rare & short-lived, and only get one of these every few hours of play. Really wish this was more a main reoccurring feature since they really executed this perfectly!I found it hard to get emotionally involved with Nilin or any of the supporting characters. Story drives forward at a good pace via the cut-scenes, but little is done to give the characters depth or clear rational/reasoning to much of their actions. For someone who has lost all her memories she seems quick to trust others without any real questions or concerns. On writing this I have played about 30-40% through the game so perhaps this improves in the closing parts of the story, but the game has become boring for me so I am unlikely to continue further. All-in-all, I will remember this game as one that was so close to becoming really great; interesting blend of many familiar science fiction themes/ideas yet not enough differences to make it truly unique. A game dogged by artificial limitations & repetition in the design, which really detract from the experience. May still be worth grabbing if you are into the genre (only at a good price), but I honestly feel this would have made a better movie than a game!If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!

At its best it's the best tripe-A game representation of cyberpunk to date. Together they make a not bad game. It's definitely the world the game takes place in that kept me coming back, sometimes even the story was great. I liked the monologues at the beginning of each chaper and how they drew me in the world that came alive through the seemingly common inner troubles of the protagonist. There was some good writing to be had there.The memory remixes were the first somewhat original gameplay feature you come across, I did find myself wishing they were more allowing for the player's imagination though.Pros:+ the vision of cyberpunk+ the pretty environment visuals+ the monologues+ the remixes, as few as they wereCons:- mediocre combat- bad upgrade system- some badly scripted scenarios that broke the immersion			"

												'Remember Me' is a work of art, a wonderful game with only one problem - it's no fun to play.Positive:- great graphics- fantastic music- strong atmosphere- very good story- innovative- extremely detailed worldNegative:- gameplay, it's simply no fun to playFighting is quite repetitive and more often frustrating. Some enemies are invisible, some deal damage to yourself if you hit them. Each boss fight has a certain pattern you have to find out and learn before you can beat the enemy. The game has many key-combinations you have to memorize.Manipulating other peoples memories is time consuming and annoying. Detecting aspects you can change in someones memories is a tiring process and finding the right combination of memory aspects to change to achieve a specific change is even more tiring. It is obvious that the developers have put a huge amount of work and effort into the game and they created something very unique and beautiful. Nevertheless, I can not recommend the game because I asked myself several times when it finally will be over. I loved the story, Paris 2084 is simply adorable, the music is fantastic but I can not recommend 'Remember me'. Sorry!			"

												On one hand, the premise sounds great and the story seems cool and everything. It's very beautifully done too. The trouble is there isn't very much fun because while the areas all look rather exciting you can't explore them. There's a fixed path you follow and you can't even climb a wall just because it isn't on this particular path that leads you to your quest. The plot also stops being interesting after a while when you are just sent out on quests that are loosely tied to your overall objective. In general it's a rather cool game, but it's not something that one must absolutely have, and it's certainly not going to be a game I would bother playing again.			"

The venue of the games, this new Paris, it is such a futuristic city, some places are very strongly reminded of Mass Effect, the developers pay attention to small details. From Nilin beautiful figure, I think even the girls noticed it. Story: I won't spoil, but the story is awesome. The only thing that upset is that you could push the wrong ability.7/10			"

												Unraveling the mysteries behind Remember Me story can be convoluted at times. Players take on the role of Nillin, a memory hunter who has, in fact, had her memory stripped away. She begins the game stumbling down a hallway as a mysterious voice comes over a communication device to break her out. Over the course of the experience, discovering Nillin’s past, and why the evil corporation MEMORIZE is in fact so, well evil, pushes the player forward.The story is complex, and confusing more often than not. Performances operate at both ends of the spectrum. While Nillin comes across fantastic, some of her supporting cast lack the emotion necessary for certain sequences. There are some cheesy bosses and eye-rolling dialogue, but for the most part, I enjoyed the alternate take on the genre. The world of Neo-Paris is what sells the experience though. Each area is crafted with such lush detail that it is hard not to stop and take notice. The lights of the Eiffel Tower glisten in the distance, while the flooded streets below give that sense of defeat. This is a wonderful world that I was wishing I could explore more.Remember Me is a “by-the-books” third-person action game akin to Assassin’s Creed or  Mirror’s Edge. The influences of both of those game sin particular are prevalent throughout the entire experience. The gameplay consists of a heavy mix of platforming and combat, both of which are distributed evenly with a great pacing from start to finish.Combat is where things really get interesting. On the surface, it feels like any other hand-to-hand system. Comparisons to the Rocksteady Batman titles are inevitable, but Dontnod mix it up with a customizable combo system. The Combo Lab is a unique take on the idea by opening up strings of button presses that can be customized with four separate types of attacks. Visually the game looks great running on max settings on the PC. The textures are fantastic, and Neo-Paris really comes alive. The soundtrack is amazing. There are no better words for it. Composer Olivier Deriviere has crafted one of the most memorable scores I can recall. Unfortunately, the game picked up some bad habits along with the good ones adopted from the marquee titles in the genre. The camera in particular leaves a lot to be desired. The combat in the game can become very frantic and fast-paced; you need to be able to see what is going on at all times. That isn’t always possible as the camera likes to zoom in on the action at random times. In any case,I loved my time with the game, and would recommend it to anyone looking for something completely outside the box. Overall 8/10.			"

												""Remember me"" takes you on a journey to a decadent future where peoples memories can be recorded, shared and sold...The year is 2084, the place Neo Paris a futuristic version of Paris. Here the population is oppressed by an agressive and ruthless corporation named Memorize.Memorize created a tecnology that makes possible the recording of personal memories from any person. These memories are then sold to the public in ATM like machines, downloaded to your brain through an implant in the back of you neck called sense, that everyone as it seems, and then voila enjoy the ride. This process causes addiction and it's like the new legal drug on the streets.""Remember Me"" is an action game play on a third person perspective with a focus on combat. An editor called ""Combo Lab"" let's you costumize your attacks in to combos. These combos can heal, do damage, reduce habilities cool downs, amplifie effects or a mix of some or all of those as you see fit. Besides these combos there are special powers that you unlock through the game like becoming invisible or doing extra damage for a few seconds.After a while combats can become a bit repetitive mainly because you will stick to 2 or 3 combos and use them again and again until the jobs done. The exception to this are boss fights. Those are demanding and require a more strategic aproach requiring you to rethink combos to adapt to the situation.I found the story to be interesting specialy the memory hunting part where you have the chance to change peoples memories by altering little details in it to create a new memory that suits your goals. Also the scenario is awesome, they really put a lot of effort in creating Neo-Paris. It's a shame that the game is so linear because a world like this deserved to be explored more.The Good:- The story is interesting;- Future Paris is an awesome scenario to experience;- Memory manipulation is fun.The Bad:- Camara angles are bad in some parts of the game, mainly on insides and tight places;- The game is linear, theres no room for exploration or side questing.

The remixing memory segments was a fresh of breath air and reminded me a lot of the movie Inception. All in all, the warm and fuzzy feeling towards the games end, was similar to how I felt upon finishing Bionic Commando, a previous title by Capcom.

												Wow.How did this game not win all the awards? I would put it high, high, HIGH on my list of GOTY candidates. The only possible weakness in it is that it's too short (About seven hours for me, start to finish). Nilin jumped right up the list of my favorite video game characters, being a weird amalgam of Jade from BG&E and Faith from Mirror's Edge. The story was tight (as in compact and focused) and also sweet (as in awesome), and it managed to subvert many of the tropes I kept expecting. The world was a take on dystopia that I haven't seen. The combat was a little imprecise, and you didn't really get to explore the world much physically even though there was tons of detail crammed into every little nook and cranny, but there was just so much there.There weren't enough memory remixes, but I file that under the ""Too short"" category. I loved every second of it and only regret that there isn't much more left to play other than hunting down all the doodads and trying it on hard.			"

												Briefly, this is not the game about the memory hunting.The gameplay is shallow and pretty straightforward: run along the scripted route, meet an open area, defeat 2-3 enemy waves, repeat. There are no enemies (or friends) in the game world except those scripted areas, this world is empty. There aren't any choices, just the script rails. The ""Secret locations"" are always just two meters away from your route. The most promising feature of the game - memory remixing - occures only 4 times...  and in fact it is all scripted as well: no choices, no shortcuts, no free will.Pros:- design, artwork and atmosphere - just great. 11/10.Cons:- heavily scripted gameplay, no interaction with the game world aside from the scenario- lots of cliche, shallow and unconvincing characters- nothing special about the game itself, it feels like playing some reskinned console ""beat'em up""- camera is awful			"

												The combat for this game can turn off a person right from the start, since it comes off as being your basic button mashing fair. A person that choose to stick with this game will find a more deeper experience with Remember Me, the further you get. The platforming aspect is pretty much cliche for this kind beat em up action game, but its not to the point of annoyance, thanks to the jumping indecators, that sometimes guide you to your destination. One of my complaints for this game is the camera controls during combat and during the platforming segments. You'll find yourself constantly fidgeting and fighting with the camera, to get the right view of your battle area. I sometimes find the camera will hover above the characters head, to where you'll pretty much just see Nilin's hair. you'll sometimes miss a que of a enemy, to where it will result in you taking damage. The story is decent, the gameplay is decent, the graphics are great aside from your regular texture pop-ins. The feeling of being in a futuristic world (Neo-Paris) is there, though the linear experience kind of hinder you a bit. i found myself wanting to explore the world more in this game. This game is definitly worth the purchase for people who want take a break from first person genre thats populated on Pc.			"

												I just completed this game and find myself perplexed by it. The visual style of it was pretty darn impressive, both artistically and graphically, to an extent. Most of the voice acting was good enough, and I had very few glitches and only one crash I can recall. Why, then, am I not recommending the game? Well, because those are the only good things I can really say about the game from my experience, except perhaps that it was a good idea that did not turn out well.Is this an awful game? No. However, the game fails almost entirely on its gameplay, explaining the world you're in, and the plotline itself. The gameplay largely consists of much crappier versions of activities other games have already done. Did you think the modern Tomb Raider or Uncharted games did a decent enough job of climbing sections? Well, Remember Me does a far crappier version of these. Perhaps you thought the Batman Arkham games had some enjoyable third person brawling combat? Get ready for a very poor man's version of that system. Not only that, but the game is set in a sci-fi location where memories and tech are everything...in presentation, at least. In actuality, 90% of your controntations in the game are punching and kicking the crap out of stuff.In regard to the game explaining the world you're in, they just didn't even try to have a coherent set of rules for this future setting. You can alter memories, but it's only important maybe 5 times in the entire game. There are ""execution"" moves you can pull off that don't kill enemies but do a blast to their head. The game never tells you exactly what this does. It's implied that it messes with their memories. There is more involving stealing memories as well as having a hologram arm thing that shoots projectile energy...but it doesn't seem to have a port to fire the energy or anything like that. The technology is never explained and feels terribly out of places. It -looks- nice, but this game's only positives tend to be graphical. The plot of the game largely relies on various pieces of technology and things these pieces of technology do, when you're still trying to grasp what this tech does, and there are mutant things you fight which the game does a terrible job of explaining what they are as well. This is one of the most poorly constructed games as far as explaining how stuff works in that universe, that I've ever seen.Remixing memories is decent enough, but by the last two times I had to do it, I was well past the point where I wanted the game to be over. The game has 8 chapters, the last of which is super short, but by the time I was finishing chapter 5, I was very ready for the game to be over. If not for the game's visual presentation, the fact I paid for it, and that I really like science fiction settings, I do not believe I ever would've mustered the willpower to complete this game. I doubt I will ever play it again, as trying another game or replaying any of dozens of better games was a far better use of my time than this.Since the visual look of the game is its strongest point, I'd actually recommend that if you want to enjoy this game, that you just watch a few Youtube videos to see the city and everything. It looks great. That's about all there is to really like about the game, though. In a few years when graphics are far better in so many other titles, this game will have nothing it does better than other games, so I cannot recommend it.			"

This game is for:- players that enjoy great narrative and can compromise gameplay- avid sci-fi fans- cg junkies- artsy hipsterish gamers (whatever that means)This game is not for:- players that enjoy deep mechanics and rich gameplay options- players that prefer open worlds and multiple paths they can progress- tasteless hatersI fell in love in Remember Me since I first saw the trailer. Now after completing it, I am even more mesmerized by it. It`s amazing!The story is great and would be appreciated a lot by sci-fi lovers. The music, made by some crazy genius mixing contemporary classics and breakcore, suits it incredibly well. And the visuals... OH THE VISUALS! This is the most beautiful game I ever played. For real. The concept, the design, the detail, EVERYTHING, I feel speechless to describe. You must see it ot believe it.Many people hate the combat system, but actually it`s not that bad. I used only the first two combos trough the whole game - X-X-X and Y-X-Y-X-Y. It`s true it gets little repetitive, but it`s definitely not a random mashing of buttons. It was able to even get me in somekind of meditative state in the long battles. It`s really arcade-ish and strange in a way.The main character - Nilin is not you usual pumped up sexualized bimbo. On the opposite she is emotional, strong and intelligent and it`s not hard to get under your sking because of what she is and not how she looks. Be careful before buying Remember me, though. This game is extremely linear and scripted. As well as the most beautiful it is also the most scripted game I ever played. There is always only one option and you can never get out of the scenario. Actually I would say this is more like a graphic novel with elements of gameplay : D If you don`t have problems being led by the nose from the game creators and you want to experience a great story and amazing visuals - don`t hesitate and play this game!

												Remember Me has all the elements to be an AAA title. The graphics are absolutely stunning, the story feels original and fresh, there's fantastic voice acting, good music and sound, and the gameplay is fluid. It's really quite a treat of an action adventure game. In my book, this is a must play title.Although it felt a little foreign at first, the remixing of memories is implemented really well offering a unique element to the game. There is also a combo customization element in which the player can customize abilities like healing, power cooldowns, or extra damage. For example if you like using your memory powers more often you can customize to add more cooldown abilities or if you seem to take damage often you can add more healing powers. It requires player interaction throughout the game as you unlock more upgrades, but I think some sort of default arrangement would have been fine for most players. The combo order in terms of punches and kicks never changes. There are also a few hidden objects placed around the small maps for health and power upgrades in addition to artwork unlocks. No game is without flaws and Remember Me definitely has a few, although nothing game breaking. The camera look sensitivity was the one aspect that annoyed me the most. For whatever reason the vertical mouse look and horizontal mouse look sensitivities are set differently making the vertical movement slower. This made it ridiculously painful to look up and down throughout the entire game, and was especially annoying during combat. There was nothing in the menu system to allow me to compensate for this. On top of that, the combat aspect itself is quite shallow, limited to punching, kicking, and dodging using up to four different attack combos. And even though you get a range ability later on, it takes a while to charge so it never really becomes a factor.The game is completely linear with almost no interaction to the external world other than climbing ladders or gripping ledges and they dumbed down the platforming aspect such that it literally indicates exactly where you need to go for each jump. As a puzzle game lover, I typically despise games that have to hold your hand the whole way.Despite the minor flaws, I thoroughly enjoyed the overall story this game delivered.			"

												I played this game in two sittings over two days. I've never finished a game (besides portal) that quickly. I loved Nilin, she was a very diverse character. I could connect with her throughout many points in the story. The small clues that eventually led up to the, well, two big reveals, I definitely didn't pick up on until I really thought back on it. The fighting was a tad bit difficult to learn and VERY repetitive, but the story made up for that. All in all, I REALLY liked it.Note that most thumbs down reviews don't have many hours logged. Trust me, there's a reason: at first, the game is a bit uninteresting and slightly boring, but as you play, it becomes a LOT better. If you don't look at the game critically, it's fun and easy to play once you get the hang of it. My only real complaint is the repetitiveness of the boss fights and not being able to explore much. Neo-Paris is so gorgeous that I would have loved to just get lost in the city. I also would have liked more to do with the memory remixing.It's a hugely story driven game, so if you like that kind of thing, this is definitely the game for you! (as long as you're cool with some combat too).Ease of play: 8/10The concept of fighting is easy to grasp, but can be repetitive and annoying that it just frustrates the crap out of you. It's a relatively easy game; your paths are clearly pointed out for you and the game gives lots of helpful tips. It's easy, yes, but is it a bit... too easy? Maybe.Graphics: 7/10I ran this game on Windows XP with the minimum graphics card. With all settings on medium, honestly, the game looked fantastic. I'm sure it would look even better on a computer with higher specs. I rated this aspect from my personal experience with the game. YMMV.Story: 7/10I loved the concept, and the story is a HUGE part of Remember Me. I loved learning about Nilin and Edge, and the two major plot twists at the midpoint and end of the game honestly shocked me. It was a bit boring at some times, but overall, it was fun to learn about the world of Neo-Paris and uncover the secrets behind Memorize and the Sensen technology.Overall: 7/10I liked Remember Me a LOT, and I think it's an underrated game. If you're not sure, wait until the price drops (I personally got it for $8 and it was VERY MUCH worth it. I would pay the current price ($30) if I had to.) The visuals are stunning, the characters are intersting, and the story is fantastic. If you're willing to overlook the repetive gameplay, pick up this game!			"

												A fun way to spend a relaxing Sunday. The graphics are detailed and very beautiful, wish more interation was added. The combat was ok and challenging a bit at times but not so much if you're used to games like this. Remixing seemed half done and could have added more elements to it I think for a full player experience. Overall I recommend it, the story is interesting  and music isn't bad either, it can get intense at some parts. A visually movie like experience.			"

												After I had finished 'Life is Strange' last year I felt the need to play Dontnod's other game 'Remember me'. I didn't like that it was focussed a lot on combat but the story kept me interested and I wanted to keep on playing. (Ended up playing through the whole game in one day)While the combat is clunky, it is interesting what they did. You can make your own combos using 4 different 'moves'. And there are also 5 special abilities you learn over time. Towards the end you will have a couple of fights in which you really need to use strategy and mix all the different moves and abilities.The graphics are amazing, the sound is mesmerizing and the story is one to remember. 8/10			"

												Remember Me is a flawed game, but it's really pretty awesome. I always prefer games which try to do something unique and maybe don't entirely hit their mark over games which stick to established tropes. Remember Me plays like a linear Batman game, but it has a lot of very clever ideas built in. Custom combos, memory remixing, reactive music; it doesn't all work completely as intended, but there are some really great ideas being utilised.If you like the story and setting of games like Syndicate, Deus Ex, or Binary Domain, you'll feel right at home with Remember Me. The writing gets a bit corny at times and the secondary voice actors are less than stellar, but I'm always a fan of a good futuristic dystopia. I hope they get a chance to make a sequel because they were on the verge of something great here. It's well worth your time to try this game.			"

												Extremely linear, was completely different from the pre-release trailers and teasers, pre-purchased this game and was let down. The city is empty unless the game allows there to be specific people for given moments. I found the game very boring as i often just found myself running around being told where to go, where to climb or fighting my way through hordes of robots etc. for me this game had potential but was let down. Graphics are great and the memory remixing brings a fresh experience to the game but again this game gets boring fast.It takes on average 7-8 hours to complete with collectables which are fairly easy to find so no challenge there and there's no temptation to replay with the new story mode feature once completed as i feel it would be a waste of time.4/10 - Recommended only buy if under £10			"

												Remember Me is the kind of game you'd expect a first-time developer that's not located in any kind of development hub to make. It's a science fiction auto-platformer (Uncharted, Enslaved, etc) brawler game. It's set in Neo-Paris; in the future, climate change refugees and income inequality lead to a European Civil War which ends with people using earthquake-bombs to destroy Paris.Combat... so, uh, I don't like brawlers. Don't like God of War, don't like Ninja Gaiden, don't like Bayonetta, etc. This is where you yell at me because my taste is♥♥♥♥♥♥or something, rather than understanding that different people have different tastes. You can go into a screen and set each button in a given combo to have one of the following effects: heal me; cause bonus damage; speed up the cooldown of my special abilities; amplify the effect of the previous button. Typically I'd set up one combo to heal me, and another longer combo to do damage and run the cooldown. Overall the combat felt fairly fluid... I'd compare it to sort of high-level play of the Batman games. I think people who like brawlers would probably find it shallow because the execution is so easy and varies so little throughout the game, but that's fine by me.What doesn't work is the late-game combat. The back 25% of the game, you pretty much entirely fight electrified super-buff enemies. Any method of attacking them hurts you. As a result, you either need to attack them with an endless number of heal-me combo attacks (because the healing cancels out the hurting) or power up your special moves and use those to take them out. This wouldn't be so bad, but at the end of the game when you clear out a combat arena, they send a second wave after you, and so you've depleted your special moves from the first wave. It gets pretty frustrating. The early game bosses are really cool, the late game bosses boil down to defeating tons of trash mobs and then periodically being able to injure the main bosses. The boss of Chapter 7 was a genuinely miserable experience, I died about 10 times or so. Remixing is really cool. Basically, you hack into someone's memory. You watch the memory play out. At the end of the memory, you use the analogue stick to rewind (by circling the analogue stick, so it feels like you're editing video on tape, very cool control choice). At key points in the memory there are objects you can interact with. By altering the objects, you change the way the memory plays out. It's possible the result will be a memory bug--for example, changing someone's memory so that they die is not possible because how can you remember your own death?--or it's possible you'll lead to a desired alternate outcome. Then when you pop out of their memory, they might have a moment of clarity or conscience as their updated memory makes them reconsider their beliefs. Unfortunately you only get 3.5 of these sequences in the game and the plot never deals with how deeply disgusting it is to alter a character's memory to trick them into helping you; like, to give you an example, the first remix involves changing a woman's memory of accompanying her sick husband to hospital to a memory of the hospital killing her husband in front of her, this to get her to take your side in a civil war. And the character you do it to continues to pop up later. So is this woman not going to visit her husband anymore, because she thinks he's dead? What the hell?The game has a really distinct visual style and some amazing views. Neo-Paris combines the messy dirt of Blade Runner with the bright sterile colours of Fifth Element. So expect to be overwhelmed by colours and distracted by grafitti and trash everywhere. The character designs are basically leather and latex future badasses. The weirdest thing I found was that large quantities of food is left on the ground, and at one point I found an entire lasagna just sitting on the ground, untouched. Who the hell cooks a lasagna and then throws it out the window? But some of the views are really really inspired. I wish the game gave you more of the outsides of Neo-Paris and fewer levels inside sewers or prisons. There's somewhat significant environment reuse. You visit some version of the prison 3 times, and another level is mostly a sewer--the game only has 8 real levels. I am sure this reflects budget limitations. The score is basically a big soaring orchestral score combined with some 70s sci-fi synth--I don't know how to describe this really, but not the kind of dark synth you think of from 80s sci-fi, a more optimistic synth--and then randomly injected with really digital, glitchy kind of techno. The combat music is really cool. If you get hit or flub a combo, the music stops. The better you're doing, the more glitched out the music gets. I felt some level of comparison to Parasite Eve in that at its best the combat music had a kind of acid lounge jazz feel, but more techno. Really cool, original score, and I'd listen to it outside the game.Having said all this, I do have some problems with the game. The story is absolutely nonsense and the levels don't really fit together well, as if they made the levels separately and then had to thread them into a story. The dialogue is really really poetic but sometimes unclear, which makes me think that the game received fewer editing passes than most or maybe it's just the ESL coming through a little bit. The jargon-heavy nature of the script subtracts from the world rather than enhancing it--really, I need to follow the Remembrane to find the entrance to Memorize to save the Errorists. I unlocked a new S-Pressen (""Expression"") or an upgrade for my SenSen and just found a Mnesist. Groan. The conclusion to the story is incredibly, incredibly stupid... I can't stress how dumb it ends up being. I won't spoil it here, but if you sit down and think about the motivations that went into starting Memorize corporation, as well as how those motivations translated into the way Memorize is ran and what it is shown doing in the game, it makes no sense.On the whole, I'd recommend the game because of the interesting things that it does, including a biracial female protagonist and some really beautiful views. The platforming is so effortless that it feels pretty good and liberating to go through it. I'd probably recommend you play on easy to minimize frustration since I don't think you'd get a whole lot of satisfaction off of ""mastering"" the combat system by playing on hard. The game will never get a sequel and the developer will probably make another game, to say nothing of the way game budgets basically render stuff like this unlikely to exist more generally, so it sort of stands on its own as an interesting and unique artifact.

												The art and music of the game are absolutely beautiful. While there are great ideas in the game like the memory remixes it ultimately suffers from many deficencies. The controls are clunky and show it's a console port, the levels are linear without much chance to explore the game world. A lot of players who are in for the narrative will be put off by the constant pressure from the crowds of enemies you have to fight and some will not have the skill and/or patience to overcome the fights with the AV-78 'Zorn' robots and are therefore stuck in the game progression which is always a bad design decision which makes the game inaccessible for part of the audience.The camera is sometimes really bad and makes some fights more difficult than necessary and to make the finishers in boss fights QTE events is also questionable. Parkour is done better in many games as is the fighting.I liked the topics of global warming and climate refugees and excluding economic refugees by big walls presented to the player in the game's lore as they are directly related to actual events.I sympathize with the developers choice of Nilin as a female protagonist of mixed race which was a bold move and cost them sales for sure. My decision to buy and play the game was of course influenced by the huge success of Life Is Strange from the same studio and you can see where their concept of rewinding time came from.To put it simple the game shows excellent production value - word is it cost around 20 million - but fails to realize its full potential in many ways and thus is sold always for a bargain bin price.If you happen to pick it up for under 10 € you'll have a beautiful game with some quirks that can be forgiven due to the fact that it was their first attempt and they lacked experience,time and money to polish the game.There are solutions to make the cutscenes skippable and change the FOV - look them up at the game hub.Given my mixed feelings about the game it's a 6.5/10 overall and I recommend it on sale.

 Plot  – The game is set on a futuristic Paris, called Neo-Paris,  at the year 2084. You will play as Nilin, who recently got his memory almost completely wiped. A mysterious guy, whom only you can hear from your voice comm will help you and try to remind you who you were. Later you’ll find out that you are part of a rebel group called ‘The Errorists’, whose mission is to bring down Memorize. The Memorize Corporation are the one who have invented a new brain implant that allows people to upload and share their memories on a cloud, not only this but they can also remove unhappy or unpleasant memories. Not only have you learnt about this, but you also found that you are a memory hunter. You have the ability to steal memories, and as well as remix them, bending people’s past to your benefit.  Environment and Design  – One of the best environments I have seen, the world is completely detailed. I never felt a dull moment all through the areas, nothing is rushed. But this comes with a price; the game doesn’t let you experience what the world can truly offer. The game features huge world, yet you’re stuck on a limited area to progress through the story. You don’t have the free will to check out different places. You’ll also know easily when you’re about to face a wave of enemies. Wherever the story goes, you’ll follow.  Gameplay  – There are only 3 happenings in this game; conversations, climbing, and combat. The game pretty much revolves around this three. In terms of combat, the game features an interesting way of making your own combos and its effect. Though the actual combination to press doesn’t change, you have the option to choose the animation and the effect of that specific attack. You have the ability to regain health, decrease the cooldown of your skills, inflict a devastating damage or multiply your combos, the choice is yours. After a few tries, you’ll definitely get the rhythm of each combo.Throughout the game, you’ll unlock each skill one at a time. This can be a downside because the only possible way for you to truly enjoy the different ways to finish off an enemy is during the last stages of the story. The game also showcases your ability to remix memories. In here, you’ll see the whole scenario and you have the ability to rewind and make some changes that would alter the ending of that scenario. Even though this is a great feature, you only get to do this on specific characters.  Controls  – Other than the different types of enemies that the game offers, you also have two additional enemies to deal with. First one is the camera angle will most of the time get in your way. Instead of showing you what is happening on your character during combat scenes, the camera will show you an object that will completely block the view. Second would be the annoying controls outside the combat, basically running and climbing. There are times that the controls override what I pressed. You want to go right? Sure, let’s go left.   Conclusion  – Yes, the game is very linear to the point that you only have a very limited space to explore. But the story and combat system they offer, makes up for it. Even though the game is quite short, I personally enjoyed the whole ride.  "

												There's a lot to like to this one, but although I would recommend it, it still leaves much to be desired.The concept is interesting and pretty unique. It is very linear and story-driven, but it doesn't utilise the core mechanic of memory remixing much at all. At it's core it's a third-person fighting game with some shooting tacked on. The combat mechanics were average at best despite the pressens adding an interesting touch. Shooting is sloppy thanks to a sluggish and unresponsive camera and some mechanics were badly interpreted for a mouse/keyboard player.This is a console port though, so that's why it has these problems with controls. Despite this though, I got used to it and didn't end up grumbling too much in-game from control-related failures.The story is very good though, but I won't spoil. The dystopian future is pulled off very well with some amazing level design with very few complaints. They even tried a bit of a puzzle element, which was completely out of place but a cute effort.I do recommend this game. It's not a 'must play', but it certaintly is a'should play'.			"

												""Underrated"" is a term that gets thrown around a lot, but in the case of Remember Me it is completely justified. With only 65 on Metacritic, I expected to have to wrestle with bad controls and wonky gameplay in order to experience the story and setting that initially interested me. Gameplay is great if you enjoy combat a la Batman or AssCreed but find that it's really not challenging in those games. I found myself having to change strategies and combos in reaction to new enemies thrown my way. The pacing is great throughout. The story is engaging. The set pieces are stunning and the game looks fantastic even on lower settings. All in all, took me about 10 hours on hard mode. Definitely recommended if you are even remotely interested in sci-fi/dystopian future settings.			"

												The Good:- Story, characters, and setting are all developed excellently- Spectacular visuals (both environment and animation)- Great sound - voice acting and soundtrack are high qualityThe Bad:- Combat system is very hit-or-miss (you either enjoy it or hate it)- Limited replay value outside of searching for collectibles- Caters to fans of adventure rather than actionRemember Me is honestly a gem of a game; I've spent time replaying both the complete story mode and individual levels, and each time, I find myself thinking, ""how is this game not more popular?"" The conclusion I have come to is that while the overall quality of the game is very high, the general gameplay experience is very bent toward a certain kind of player, causing the game to be rather polarizing. This game feels and plays very much like a Tomb Raider game (particularly the games before the reboot, i.e. Legend, Anniversary, Underworld). Like Tomb Raider, Remember Me involves a great deal of acrobatic platforming, an excellent story with deep characters, a fantastic soundtrack, and a kickass female protagonist. However, also like Tomb Raider, the combat falls short of many players' expectations, the replay value is based upon the player's interest in collectibles and/or interest in the game's world, and the mix of platforming and occasional puzzle solving will not be everyone's cup of tea.In many ways, the game evokes a sort of cinematic feel, with a great deal of the enjoyment coming from watching the characters and the story's events unfold. Players looking for fast-paced action or a highly customizable experience will likely not be satisfied with what this game brings to the table, but for others seeking an intricate story and overall enjoyable adventure, Remember Me is certainly a *memorable* experience ;) . . . Okay, I'll see myself out lol.			"

												Remember Me definitely is a memorable game in my age. I have finished it with Errorist Agent Difficulty, so have rights to say something.It is a memorable game in this decade because of the brilliant art concepts and the unique environment which assists the vital part of the “Remember Me Universe”, which no one else in this industry did something similar. Not in the past, probably won’t do within next few decades.It is very hard to say an Action-Adventure game with linear story is a bad thing simply because with an open world with variety objectives on will cause chaos in game and make gamers lose their concentration to the significant part of story. Remember me does have a very strong-characteristic storyline which does not have much space for some adds-on. So I support developers, they made the right choice.The game contents, graphics, walkthrough systems etc are not much to say, they are all very outstanding, all YOU NEED is to play to find out yourself.But there’s something I specially want to mention about the game, it is the music. The music is an epic, they all go so amazingly with the game, it drowns you towards the “Remember Me Universe” and thanks to it, you will never leave the world unless you quit the game and back to the desktop. I wish they could do a soundtrack eagerly that I can listen to them even if I am not in game.The only thing so sad is that Remember me does not have Steam Badges and following with the Trading Cards system. It is on my top hit list and I want it so dearly.Overall, a highly anticipated video game came out and people said bad about it usually turns out to be a masterpiece. People said how bad it was simply because of the overwhelming expatiations which were too high for the game and, these objectives often being considered non-achievable. It would bring down all the great efforts the development team had put them inside no matter how hard they had tried.Scarlet's Score: 8.5/10 "

												This is a tough one to talk about.I was drawn to Remember me because I played Life is strange, fell in love with it and then had a more in depth look at the developers of that game (Dontnod) and in doing so came across this. There are plenty of ways the games are similar but they're very far from being a similar experience so don't come looking for a Life is strange fix.It's tough to talk about because I had a somewhat hard time getting into this game (multiple attempts) and then a somewhat non-enthusiast time getting through it. Yet at the same time there are a lot of aspects I want to praise first:+Great story (really comes into its own only at the end parts though)+Beautiful graphics+Well made world with its version of the future and lore+Surprisingly good combat system (one of the things that kept me coming back for more actually)+Good voice acting and animationsSo what was my problem?-The environments feel constricting and navigating them can be a bit awkward (You're teased with being Ezio Auditore whilst trapped in a highly linear environment and narrative)-A bunch of story elements seemed to me debatable and dubious-Whilst the story and world are well made, the environments also manage to largely feel grey and the majority of them are not memorable Those points and then there's the bit how collectibles are really hard to find... Really the negatives are more like subjective barriers that kept me from fully enjoying the positives rather than an entire side of the game. They could also be a result of me trying to compare Remember me to other games I've liked too hard and so having specific expectations. All in all there's definitely something to this one. It's fairly short so give it a chance			"

												The first game from Dontnod Entertainment, and it's a good one. You play as Nilin, a Memory Hunter who has lost all of her memory by a company known as Memorize, which I won't go into for any spoiler reasons. This world takes place in Neo Paris in 2084 (Yeah, you have to put 'Neo' in front of everything that takes place in the future).  What's so special about Neo Paris? Well, pretty much everything is based off of memories, which are pretty much bought and sold for anyone's needs.I don't want to get too much more into the game's story as there are plot holes, plot twists and just some complicated stuff in it.The game can be summarized as a Beat Em' Up, similar to God Of War and such. But, I won't just summarize, I'll go into further detail. However, before I do I must admit that I never played with a Keyboard and Mouse, only a controller, so the ways I used to attack were the 'X' and 'Y' buttons.You use Pressens, which are used to make combos, and each pressen can have a certain effect. There's a Regen Pressen which regenerates any lost health, there's a Power Pressen that increases attack power of that hit, then there's the Cooldown Pressen which lowers the amount of time to wait for an S-Pressen to startup (I'll go into more detail on these in a minute), and finally the Chain Pressen, which increases the amount of Regen, Power, or Cooldown when linked to one of these. The max combo is 8-Hits, which honestly is kind of difficult to get in some situations. Each combo is started by the two attack buttons, and there are specific combos for each. Also, with the DLC Combo Lab pack, you can use moves from the Street Fighter series as combo finishers. It's a basic combo system, and fairly easy for me to understand and memorize.S-Pressens are special moves that can allow infinite attacks, a bomb, stunning, and even making robots fight for you. These are used with the Focus bar, a little blue box that fills up after attacks. Each S-Pressen has a cooldown time every time you use one, and that's where Cooldown Pressens kick in.There's also a weapon that allows you to shoot enemies and destroy robots that is very nifty and fun to use.Remember Me also has its fair share of puzzles, which can be easy or difficult, depending on how easy matching and listening is for you. And there's also parkour elements... which after a while become less cool, and more annoying and bland.Score:Controls: 8/10Music: 7/10Story: 7/10Voice Acting: 8/10Gameplay: 7/10Graphics: 9/10Total: 7.7/10It has its moments, and is definitely very fun for some moments, but it also has its downfalls. However, the graphics do look very nice, and complement the Steampunk feeling of the game.			"

												WOW! How can so many mainstream reviewers be wrong about this? Yes theres yellow markers on where to jump. Yes the characters do have some silly/odd names.Yes the combat feels light and nothing like BATMAN: AA & AC.But the main question is does this detract from the game making it not worth playing? Hell no!The combat is light and fluid just like the main protaganist Nilin so it fits the character very well. While some may find it annoying that your combos do get broken mid-flow by having to dodge other incoming attacks thats how street fights go. While you combo to death one baddie do you expect his four friends to take a break, order coffe and read the local paper, all while you pummel his face and body with your fancy moves? If you say ""Yes!"" to this then may I suggest something more like  Cooking Mama™, an EA game or a trip to the boxing gym so you can flail on a punching bag. The combat if fast, fluid and most importantly entertaining. The fact that you can edit your combos mid-fight to help heal or reduce your timers is very helpful in a pinch.The visuals are totally fantastic. The atmosphere oozes throughout the game from the slums of District 404 to the heavenly hights of Neo-Paris. Some of the areas are nothing more than fancy corridors linking one part to the next but I found myself walking through instead of running like i could have. Looking around at all the little details hidden in plain sight from the puddles on the floor, items on tables, robots doing their thing and street vendors selling their wares. What I found was a vivid living world pulling me in. Even the ""journal entries"" are interesting. Adding to the game instead of distracting from it. The yellow markers for the jumping sections do look odd but if they were not there in some areas you wouldn't know where to go  and would leed to alot of wondering around with that ""Where do I go now?"" expression. An option to turn these off would have been nice touch for those who don't like them.While remixing peoples memories I found meself engrossed in almost every detail. I found myself wondering how I would react if these were my memories being alterd. Would I be the man I am today? Would I turn to the dark side? These are fantastic ideas but as many reviewers have mentioned before me ""...there should have been more of theres segments...""As you may be wondering I really like this game and as you're reading this now I hope I have hellped you resolve some of the things that may have stopped you from buying this game before now. This is a game that will (hopefully) make you think about events in your life and the lifes of others. How these events if changed or stolen chould change the very person you are today. All while keeping you engaged in the story and wanting to progress to see what happens next is a good thing and I would reccomend this to everyone. I'm just sorry that I put off buying this title and I hope to see Remember Me 2 in the future.SUBJECTIVE SUMMARY >> Well worth the money for a solid original game and story.			"

												This beautiful and polished game is probably going into my list of best singleplayer experiences. Its graphics and art style are  just pure gold. Cyberpunk/transhumanist setting and story are pretty good and blends in with the gameplay fairly nicely. Has some interesting puzzles, not too hard at all though. The action isn't as bad as some make it out to be, as I enjoyed it. Parkouring is also a big part of the gameplay, though limited to only very specific objects to help you reach the next area. When on sale you should definitely get it.			"

												The combat system is just utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, especially later in the game. Unfortunately you can't just ignore it, even if you play as a ""scriptkiddy"" (easy mode), because there's no way to avoid the boss fights and they're getting harder and more frustrating nonetheless. ""Easy"" only means that you take less damage.At first it's okayish, you have combos and special stuff, looks solid. But later it's a mess, it just doesn't work anymore and it leads straight to constant and massive frustration. It feels like Batmans (AA/AC) combat system gone totally wrong. Instead of cool, tricky and satisfying melee fights you get a straight punch in your face every one or two seconds, which destroys any attempt to control the fight. Of course, you can jump around (and evade attacks) like crazy and kick some suckers here and there, but then it will take hours to end the boss fight (Boss plus his countless stupid minions). If this sounds incredible fun to you go ahead and grab a copy.I almost finished the game but just gave up then. I don't care whats next which is sad since the game art is one of its own kind. Even though I can't see the U-Engine anymore its pretty nice, shiny and pretty dirty as well. The story is more ""so la la"", I expected more. The setting goes imho a bit to far and feels to fantastic for a pure Sci-Fi setting. But well, the thing that breaks it for me is the combat system.			"

												I bought this game being somewhat of a ""fan"" of Alain Damasio who is an awesome french writer and is co-founder of DONTNOD. He largely participed to the creation of the universe.Pros :-Fantastic art style. The augmented reality, remix scenes, the final episode, fight against Madame are great examples.-Solid utopia/dystopia with an excellent ending. Tiny things like people naturally saying ""Remember you soon"" in place of ""See you soon"" or clever blend words like ""Errorists"" or ""Mnemopolis"" add a lot of cohesion.Cons :-The gameplay is very rubbish : combat system is dull, ultra linear levels with nothing interesting to do but following a thread, the pace is boring... When you steal memories it just feels like you've reached point B and head to C as everything is scripted. When you use your powers to move a container it just feels like you're pressing buttons on your controller because the entire scenery is empty except for the said container.-Camera was ... ugh ...-Not enough remix scenes! c'mon this was the coolest thing to do! why so few?Conclusion :I am not sure video game was the right support to allow Remember Me to bloom and that's a shame. And in case you primarily wanted the pieces of lore ... well you have to thoroughly play the game *sigh*.Because of that I cannot recommend buying this game.			"

												Interesting premise for a game. Combat plays a bit like the Batman: Arkham Series, with some tomb-raider-esque platforming built in, as well. The game's heroine, Nilin, is one of the deeper protaganists in a game in quite some time, and her personal struggles really draw in the player. The dystopian Neo-Paris sets an interesting backdrop, as well. In the end, however, the story's reach is beyond its grasp, and the whole experience falls a bit flat. Couple this with repetitive (though competent) combat and gameplay, and you've got a game that is fun without being the brilliant masterpiece it aspires to be. Luckily, the camapaign is short, so it doesn't overstay it's welcome too much. Would recommend as long as your expectations are set going in.			"

ProsFantastic settings. Amazingly detailed, colorful world with  a beautiful futuristic Paris cityEasy to pick up and playCool memory alteration mechanics. It's not something you perform much in the game but it's still enjoyableThe art is gorgeous. The characters look amazingly detailedThe musicConsThe combat power ups. Not a fan of themI feel that the game's pace suffers a bit if you want to find hidden items. You can skip them but you'll want to find them, since you gain more combat combos optionsThe game is very linear, even when ""parkouring""The game isn't that long and it's pretty hard to die in combat, since you can heal when attackingGraphicsThis game was astonishingly beautiful. Paris looks amazing with a mix of cyber punk and parisienne architecture. Fantastic and very colorful, I was impressedThe characters are also very pretty and detailed. Nice faces, nicely dressed and you can see a lot of effort was put into designing themGameplayThe combat is your typical Arkham games style. Chain combos and dodge attacks. You also have power ups that I didn't like very much since they become mandatory to use in late game. You can also build your own chain combos so you either deal more damage, heal more or reduce the cooldown of your power upsThe problem with the bigger combo chains late game is that there are too many and fast enemies that either don't let you complete the combo or die way too fastIt's hard to die in combat. You can easly sustain the damage taken by using your healing combos to regain healthThe game is pretty linear with the typical tunnel esque design that doesn't give too much space for exploration. Besides, when ""parkouring"", the game tells you exactly where to go. Feels like it's holding your hand all the timeThere are hidden items that allow you to unlock more combos and expand your health points. Looking for them kinda slows the pace of the game, which hurts the game a bit. You can ignore them but their beneficts make it hard to want to skip them. I believe that if these items didn't exist, the pace of the game would have been really greatAudioReally good OSTSome hidden items have a distinctive sound you need to be on the lookout for. Was a nice detailFinal ThoughtsDidn't know what to expect from this game before picking it up but I can say I had a very, very good time playing it and I'm sure most of you will have it too.Was a cool sci-fi action game that brought some new ideas to the table (some better than others...) with a cool theme, amazing design and a cool story.Had a great time finishing this game.Recommended!

												The first game released by Dontnod and not an entirely bad one either. Funny enough, I played Life is strange without knowing who developed it and wondered why something seemed familiar....What is it? It\'s a 3rd person action/beat-em up/platformer set in the future. It has some heavy Bladerunner and Mirrors edge influences and you can tell from the color scheme. Graphically it\'s pretty decent for an U3 engine game, as you\'d expect and ran well for my rig. Some amazing city scapes, nice lighting and heavy reflections make this game look crisp and futuristic.Never mind the fact that you spend most of the time trudging through gritty lower level Paris neighborhoods and sewers but it makes the moments you are travelling though some very high tech looking areas more appreciated.The sound and music for some reason reminded me a little of the Tron 2.0 game from way back, it suits the game, especially during the combat sequences, very punchy.Speaking of combat, it\'s mostly hand to hand. You time your punches and kicks to form a chain (combo ), pre-determined by which button you press. See, using a gamepad, it would be something like xxx, or xyyxyy or yxyxy but the really great thing about this games combat is that you can program/create your own combo as long as it follows the button sequence. For example, pressens (damage, health, special attack cooldown and Multiply?) can be programmed to the button you press in the sequence. I could create an attack chain starting with damage, followed by health steal on the second hit, followed by a cooldown to my special attack on the third hit, then another damage and finish with multiply. Mix a combo any way you want! I mean it\'s not freeflowing like Batman Arkham games but it\'s close. And sadly that\'s also a bad point, there isn\'t enough combat or it\'s all or nothing. Sadly, the game space itself feels a little narrow and linear. A lot of the time you\'re walking down a hallway to turn into an open room to follow another hallway. The platforming is pretty dull and it felt like the game was holding you\'re hand a lot as you play through it. Never-the-less, the game looks amazing while you are walking around in a straightforward manner. It feels good to play though, very fluid movements as LONG AS YOU HAVE A GAMEPAD! I can\'t stress enough how much better it is to play with a controller. I much prefer using a keyboard and mouse with my games but I feel it\'s essential to play this particular game with a pad!The character movements are nice, very fluid! I\'ve walked up and down stairs so many times and I\'ve got to say they\'ve nailed movement nicely!So in a nutshell....OK combat, just not enough of it. Good music and sound effects. Fantastic graphics for an UE3 game. Story...ho hum, interesting concept with a couple of What the! moments.It\'s a great game, maybe under appreciated.			"

Posted: November 23, 2014
												Lemme start this off with the positive aspects of the game.I love the setting, which might be due to my having a soft spot for cyberpunk. The aesthethic is beautiful, the orange/white color contrast works well and is integrated into the architecture, posters, graffitti, Sensens, and just about everywhere while not being overbearing. There is also nice contrast between the higher class and lower class parts of Neo-Paris. Luxurious shops, finished roads, well-furnished homes, and even a ritzy android brothel can be found in the Saint-Michel district. Slum 404, however, right next to the district, has no roads. The buildings are dilapidated, Leapers run abound with their home, the sewers, being just next to the slum, and there are no stores - merely stalls, stands, and bar put together by scrap metal. The world was well fleshed out and I wanted to explore more of it.Sadly, you don't really get to explore it since the level design is very linear. If you liked the world of Mirror's Edge but hated that you didn't get to explore it much, Remember Me has the same issue. The premise of the game is interesting too, with memories becoming a commodity. I love the opening of the game, showing the moving, heart-felt, well-intentioned marketing for commoditizing memories - then the stark reality of how prisoners in La Bastille are abused by having memories taken away, and how the wardens and doctors are basically thought police.Also, I think Nilin is cool and a badass. I like her character design. I did roll my eyes a few times during the game towards the end when she said things that just made you go ""Wait, what?"" because they felt uncharacteristic and shoveled/ham-fisted in for the sake of ""drama"". Female representation in video games has been a hot topic lately, so I figured that was worth mentioning.Ok, now for the bad stuff and why I can't recommend the game for $30 in good conscience.The gameplay is lackluster and easily the weakest part of the game. Mostly just memorize 1 or 2 combos, swap out the Pressens you need for the situation, and press the spacebar + a/w/s/d whenever you see a big red ""!"" on some part of the screen - often the direction you dodge in doesn't even matter and can be cast during any attack. The platforming/parkour is very fragmented, lacking the flow of Mirror's Edge or Assassin's Creed while having less depth. It being slow and easy makes it incredibly boring and tedious .Being boring and tedious seems to be a common theme, even in the memory remix portions of the game. Memory remixing is just a matter of moving through the scene and trying all the possibilities until you get the outcome the game wanted. There isn't any challenge, risk, or open-endedness to how you reach the outcome. Memory remixing is basically a point and click adventure game that lasts 5 minutes at most.Also, UNSKIPPABLE CUTSCENES. If you're a completionist like me, this will make 100%'ing the game a royal pain. Rewatch every monologue by Nilin, watch Nilin put her hand to ear and walk at a snail's pace until Edge is done talking to her, watch a Leaper attack an enforcer to the ground, watch a conversation go on and on, watch the memory for its full duration at normal speed before you remix it, etc.Verdict:If you do not already own this you're probably better off just watching a let's play or waiting for it to go on sale for about $10.If you do own this, it is worth a playthrough at least.Hopefully if DONTNOD Entertainment get a sequel going they can polish the gameplay to make it more engaging, allow you to explore Neo-Paris or another city in this dystopian setting, and allow you to skip cutscenes.

Nothing is ever really lost to us as long as we remember it.― Paulo Coelho  L.M. Montgomery, The Story Girl Interesting combination of Tomb Raider (female protagonist + platforming), Assassin's Creed (parkour although limited, Remembranes and Edge ;P), Batman: Arkham series (melee combat) and probably Deus Ex series (e-idea).After 20h (16h Normal gameplay + 4h for replays and farming achievements):PROS+ Nilin and her sweet *a*s*s in tight jeans <3+ Hunt Glove + Spammer+ memory remixing <3 I felt a little like Chief John Anderton from 'Minority Report' playing with spatial operating environment inside someone's memories.+ Remembranes + Pressens combo idea & special S-Pressens powers+ interesting and very nicely done locations+ intriguing concept of world&community evolutionCONS- Combo Lab is predefined... really? only four available chains with a limited sequence? why?- combo chains have to resemble those of Batman series, but they need much more intuitive and a good fit- you can't practice your combinations in... something like the Matrix- bad camera work, both in fighting and climbing- nice but closed maps, practically reducing explore to straight road from one fight arena to another- very bad autosave system, you can't go back even one load what makes that sometimes you have to repeat the whole f* Episode from the beginning if something is missed- you can't speed up or skip cutscenes (really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at replays)- before almost every new fight Focus points are reset, which prevents the S-Pressens firing... can't be too easy, huh?- you can't use a Spammer to shoot down drones- Captain Trace 'flight' fight/run...Subjective rate: B, sometimes even B- (this game deserves a sequel, with improving all the negatives that I mentioned. The larger, sandbox world [or only an illusion of sandbox, but a good illusion] + my own combos + better camera and save system and finally more Sensation Engine-story with awesome remixing.And what if not?

												Just finished it, and lord that was a frustrating journey.  Lots of good ideas, poorly executed.  It was also infuriating that every section of the game is almost completely linear, with only the occasional 12 meter side path for an item.  The whole game basically amounts to a straight line, with the occasional QTE or remedial activity to make it feel like less of a walking simulator during those sections.  Bunk climbing sections -- don't be fooled, they're linear and uninteresting too.  The combat was mildly interesting, but extremely limited.  *So much* untapped potential.  If only they'd done each feature a bit differently.And the combat QTEs were frustrating and made battle even less fun.If you can get it cheap and you're very patient, this game tells an interesting story and hints at a very interesting world, but make sure you're okay with only getting a small sample of it.  In retrospect I'm kinda glad I played all the way through for the story, but only for the story, and only barely.			"

I know there is a lot of criticism on not being open world and the combat is repetitive but it doesn't overrule the game on an overall level.

The action and gameplay are very entertaining, the enemies are not too hard, but not boringly easy either.The implemented Combo system and power-ups is very nice touch too.The graphics looks pretty good, and if this is a console port, graphics-wise is perfect - constant 60fps at 4K and also looking good. There are only a few games achieving this.The controls are a little bit awkward in the begining but the player gets used with it pretty quick. It will be probably easier with a controller, I'm not sure.Anyway, the game is awesome for my taste.RECOMMENDED! 10/10! "

												I honestly came into this one expecting to hate it. People had panned the combat as difficult or confusing, and the game to be nothing special.Lucky for me I still went ahead and picked this up (at a steep discount, though, so take that for what it is). From the moment the game started, I was intrigued by the setting. Though full of sci-fi tropes, the game still managed to capture my interest and imagination, and I found myself caring for the protagonist as she made her way from beginning to end. I even found myself worried that she was, at times, too trusting of those around her and I worried that she would make the wrong decision - and though I had hoped at times I could make the decisions for her, the linearity of the gameplay did not take away from the final product. As for the combat, I personally had no trouble figuring it out. The 'build a combo' system isn't quite what I expected - what I had expected was something more difficult. Basically you get four different combinations of X and Y presses on the controller (or your keyboard equivalent). Over time you unlock different 'powers' to place in each of these slots... so if your combo is X-X-X you can have one X be a powerful hit and the other be a heal, or maybe something that lowers the cooldown of your presens (big power moves). It made sense to me, and I managed to adjust and play with the combos to suit my playstyle and for different parts of the game (easily done on the fly).Getting the combos to work wasn't an issue either... but be warned, this isn't a button-mashing game. For the most part, combos all require calm, regular and deliberate button presses. If you are accustomed to going crazy with the controller, you will be frustrated as getting any of Nilin's (the main character) powers to work properly requires combos to succeed. tl;drGraphically impressive game with a linear, yet rewarding story, interesting and appropriately challenging combat with some climbing, discovery all in a great science fiction setting. Game clocked in at about 9 1/2 hours for me, which I think was about right. Great buy, especially on sale.			"

												Remember Me has lots of potential to be a great game, but the heights that it's trying to reach is hampered by an underwhelming gameplay. One can clearly see the ambition that the development team was going for, however, it doesn't translate very well in the game. My main concerns are with the Combat and level design, where everything is simplified and doesn't offer variety. The latter, especially, is somewhat disappointing, since the backdrops are sprawling and detailed, and players are left with linear pathways and simple verticality. I can imagine the possibilities that they could have achieved with a little more tinkering and polish.But this is a story-centric game, and choosing between one aspect over another, you'd have to go and focus with what's hot and trending. The story in Remember Me is good. Nothing mind-blowing or emotional; it just needs to develop its characters more, and not make everything so coincidental. It's very exposition-heavy, and they were clearly planning for the long term, since the world, characters, past and present events, are all laid out for the player. It's like Mass Effect: the universe and everything that's happened in it is explained in the first game, and further explored and polished in the subsequent games. If Dontnod could turn this into a franchise, it would be great. The premise is cool, and the world is oozing with style. So go ahead and buy this game. Make Capcom see reason, because it would be such a waste if the suits are just going to throw it out.Some things to take note of:*The camera is pretty unreliable, and can move erratically when indoors. This leads to major problems during enemy encounters.*Combat is very repetitive, and there's no variation at all; you just do combo after combo, and there's not much skill involved. Since this is a story-focused title, I suggest that you play in easy mode, since the only thing that hard mode does is make your enemies hit sponges.*Boss battles have obscure QTE segments. I say obscure because the icons that flash on the screen, doesn't represent keyboard or controller icons; they have their own unique prompts that follow the stylish aesthetic of the whole game. If you miss a single prompt in the whole QTE segment, you're going to have to lower the boss' health again - and do the QTE segment all over again.*You can pause cutscenes, but you can't skip it. This also applies to second playthroughs.*Uses an autosave system. No manual saving for you, little man!And there you have it.			"

												Remember Me is an action adventure game with an interesting sci-fi story with plot twists. It plays like a sci-fi version of DMC – Prince of Persia.You play as the female Nilin a memory hunter in a future version of the city Paris where a giant corporation Memorize offers all people to change or alter their memories via an implant that’s connected to the ‘net’.The game has beautiful graphics that really suit the style of game. It also has some very original gameplay elements like:By playing the game you gain experience. With this experience you can create your own combo’s. The combo system is also needed and has to be learned to win fights. With certain keypresses you win health, time limit to perform special moves is diminished and to execute an extra powerful move.A few times in the game you can manipulate memories of a character. This means a video is shown and by rewinding the video you can change the outcome. To finish certain levels, you need to manipulate the memories of your advisories. This is why you’re called a memory hunter.The gameplay has stealth, exploration and melee combat elements. It’s played in 3rd person. The world is linear but there are a lot of secrets hidden.The more you advance in the game the more special moves (weapons, move faster, …) you unlock and the more combo’s you can create.The game is a console port but supports 2560*1080 resolution. The sound effects and music are very good. It’s recommended to play this game with a controller. I tested it with an Xbox One wired controller. Replay ability comes from finishing the higher difficulties and finding all the secrets. The game is single player only.I recommend this game!			"

												Despite its best efforts, Remember Me is a game worth playing through. Once.You're here for the same reason as everyone else. The game looks fantastic in trailers, in screenshots, and I'm happy to tell you that it remains fantastic-looking throughout the whole game. Any game that can make a sewer-level look good deserves some credit.""This is for David!""- character avenging her perfectly alive, reasonably healthy husband that has nothing to do with the scene at allPity the gameplay doesn't fair quite as well. You have four static combos to choose from, that can be slotted with different effects (""pressens"", the most made-up scifi name in existence next to anything beginning with ""Z"") - and while the animations for each slot is unique, outside of the general pool you choose them from every other aspect stays exactly the same. There's damage, healing, and the cooldown-timer reducing effect for your static combos. Notably, though, are the chain moves, which have a multiplicative effect when stacked on themselves and ""anchored"" to a single effect. This means that you can heal your entire healthbar, touch-of-death any enemy and completely remove the cooldowns on all your abilities in a single combo.The abilities are mostly situational, the few that aren't are useless compared to your regular combos (without the enemies introduced that are straight up immune to those).Result is that it's incredibly underwhelming. On a first playthrough, where you're being dripfed the ""pressens"", you don't have enough tools to do anything with, and on any playthrough afterwards you just break what's there.Luckily they balance this by introducing enemies that are immune to your melee combos completely and require either the peashooter projectile weapon or your ""I Win"" abilities (if they're not immune to those as well).Sorry did I say luckily, it's awful.""Who is responsible for this outrageously cool act of sabotage?""- News anchor on terrorist act that results in hundreds of deathsYou have a combo-extender (Think Dodge Offset except worse) wherein you dodge over an enemy and continue your combo otherwise, but ranged and melee enemies have absolutely no problem attacking in quick succession, just far enough apart that they will always catch you on the recovery frames. Not to mention the horrible hit detection on the enemy-dodge that means it's always a safer bet just to dodge into the enemy you're currently punching then to actually try to use the system for anything else.No counters or parries or options to play well, don't be ridiculous.This is not God Hand, this is not you juggling crowd-control viability, single-target damage, speed, reach, recovery, ancilliary effects for each move all under constant pressure. This is an incredibly sloppy game that just manages to scrape over the bar for being completely streamlined.There's a fair few collectibles to halfway incentivize replaying the game, but don't. It's not worth it.You cannot skip the cutscenes. And boy does Remember Me love to waste your time with cutscene, after cutscene, after forced walking segment, after cutscene. The ""remix"" segments are just interactive cutscenes. You can't walk down a corridor without a cutscene. The entire last level is just cutscene followed by a solid 10 minutes of forced walking. It does not miss a chance to shove its plot down your throat.Remember Me's plot isn't good, either. The world is fantastic, the setting is inventive, it has some great ideas, but the plot is just about the amnesiac non-character Nilin getting reunited with her parents and being really blandly angsty about it. With incredibly bland-to-poorly written dialogue.""But is continuing this fight worth losing my soul?""- The quality of dialogue writing that you can expectI didn't even like going through it the first time, and the second time was absolute torture. No, you can't turn them off, skip them, fast-forward, you can't even alt-tab or bring up the overlay because it pauses the cutscene.I've legitimately left the game running and gone to make coffee while cutscenes were playing while clearing out collectibles, this is not a game that expects nor desires you to replay it.What keeps it going during that first playthrough is visuals. And that's it. This is not a game you want to be good at, or even wants you to be good at it. That's whats to recommend Remember Me for, here. An eye-treat that's mechanically ambitious and suffers intensely due to continual compromises with a cinematic direction, compromises that drag it down an absurd degree.That first playthrough, though? That ones alright. I recommend it for that one.			"

Remember Me is an action-adventure platformer and the first game developed by the Dontnod Entertainment.The Story:The game is set in a futuristic Neo-Paris. People now have a brain implant called the Sensen created by the mega-corporation Memorize. Sensen allows people to share their happy memories or remove their unhappy ones. Thanks to this Memorize has an enormous control over the population and has established a surveillance state.You play as Nilin, a memory hunter whose memory has been wiped by Memorize. You basically start off having an amnesia.You set off to take down Memorize and recover your lost memories. You're also on a journey of self discovery as you question your motives and actions along the way.The Gameplay:Remember Me plays similarly to all your favourate action-adventure platformers such as Castlevania: LoS or Enslaved.You do a bit of fighting, puzzle solving and ofc jumping and climbing.I played the game using the Xbox 360 controller and I strongly suggest anyone to play such games with a controller of your choice.You hit enemies using the X and Y buttons. As usually you can create combos with them by pressing Y-Y-Y-X-X-X-Y etc.You can ofc shoot flying enemies and dodge attacks by moving the left stick and pressing A.Classic action-adventure gameplay but a bit simplistic here. You won't unlock any crazy combos. Enemies are very easy to fight and even if you do manage to die you start again basically at the same place.It took me about 8h to finish the game on hardest difficulty.Remember Me is one of the easiest action-adventure platformers i've played but its charm is in the magnificent world and interesting story. Neo-Paris is very well crafted and it is a joy to climb its futuristic buildings.PerformanceI didn't experience any technical issues with the game. It ran like a charm!It seems to be very well optimised and I didn't run into any bugs or glitches nor did I have any crashes.If you're looking for an eye candy tho then you'll be dissapointed. The graphics aren't exactly bad but they were mediocre even back in 2013. The voice acting, however, is supreme.Overall Remember Me is a good game. Is it worth the 27.99€ is up to You to decide.The story will take you about 7-11h depending on how good you are at these type of games and either you decide to go for the collectables or not.			"

												OK, Here's my review of Remember me. Greetings, you snobs! Hound's here. Writing for you and you only! This game, Remember me is indeed a good game. And I'm here to tell you why. Remember me is a game set in Paris, Neo Paris, where a technology of editing memories has become a thing. In this world 'Sensen', I know what an idiotic name, is the company taking charge in this trade and in turn has become a big power in the city. The concept of memory remix, as it's called in the game, can either erase your memory, twist it or tinkling with it however you like. Those without the memory will become 'Leapers', hollow shells once human now a disfigured creatures with mind full of hostility live in the underground part of the city waiting for the Armageddon.You are playing as Nilin, a specialized memory DJ(get it? because DJs do remix songs and she can remix memory. Get it?) call Errorist who can twist other's memory to the point that they got so emotionally effected that they killed themselves. She was captured and was about to be 'erased' by a certain doctor working for aforementioned corp. She was helped my a mysterious man named 'Edge' and together they set out to fight against Sensen and bring the end to all memory remix bull's load business. So... That's the plot. It isn't anything special, quite mediocre regarding to the story presentation, to tell you the truth. The story has its moments from time to time especially towards the end but that's it. What really astounds me is the graphic or rather the art style they chose. The world is vibrant with colors. Bright orange, green, red, blue... they're everywhere. The details put into the world are quite mind boggling. You can just stop doing everything and look at the robot servants sweeping the floor and it will please you. The game is that beautiful. You'll want to come back and play it even though you got bored to tears by the story and the combat system. The city of Neo Paris in the game consists of a lot of areas, the prison, hospital, town square, arena like thingy, creepy underground and lots of alley ways. All are detailed to the finest despite the quality of some textures and are definite feasts for your eyes.But let's talk about the gameplay and combat, Shall we? The gameplay in this game is 3rd person beat'em up game, I suppose, with elements of parkour platforming every now and again and also a dash of puzzle solving to a certain degree. You are going to climb a lot, fight a lot and sometimes solve puzzles that come your way in various forms.The parkour part is quite generic. There is absolutely no 'WOW' or 'OMG' moment in the game that really excites you during the time you traverse the locations in this game. There is absolutely nothing new or things that you've never seen from other games that have parkour in them. So, a little bit disappointing I'd say. The combat in this game is a kind of thing that you either hate it or... 'meh' to it. It wasn't that bad if you're really open to it. Interesting concept it brings actually. But the execution is a little bit dull. In this game you fight with the enemy using 'Combo' system. You gradually unlock new moves and compose them into different strings of moves call, unsurprisingly, Combo. These moves that you unlock are actually a collections of Xs and Ys divided into 4 category of moves, healing moves, guard breaking moves, timer reducing moves and special attack gauge building moves. All function as the names suggest. Heal you, break opponents' guard, reduce timer for your special moves and build up the gauge the allows you to use those special moves. There are 4-5 preset combo lines, I don't really remember, for you which you can't really change anything just choose which Xs and Ys from your desired category to define what effect of that line of combo will be in the end. You can create a combo line that will heal you only and do petty damage or a line that hits the opponent really hard and does absolutely nothing else. All are according to your preferences. The combat in this game get repetitive as all the other people say. But for me, I think the idea behind it is quite interesting. From what I describe to you, those whose heads are really that deep in their asses would notice that it was intended to be tactical. You are to create tactical combo lines that help you according to the situation you are facing. For the example, You might be fighting with an enemy you can't touch and need to stun them with your special attack before hitting it. The problem is that your special move that stun your enemy has a really, and I mean really, long♥♥♥♥♥cooldown. What are you going to do? Wait for it? No. You are going to use your combo to reduce your cooldown timer to zero as fast as possible, of course. That's, I believe, is the heart of this combat system. But as I said before, the execution is quite dull and results in people hating it(let alone the fact that the control is quite clunky at times.) The puzzles, on the other hand, are quite good. In this game, there are a lot of puzzles you'll need to crack. Form how to avoid the drones that will kill you instantly if you happen to be within its radar radius, to the puzzling poems you need to figure out for the correct password to some certain doors. The biggest puzzle sections would be the memory remix itself. There are some moment in the story that you'll need to remix someone's memory to your benefit. You'll need to watch the whole memory play try fiddling with highlight objects in it and wait to see the result. Some objects you manipulate might do absolutely nothing, some will make things go wrong drastically which is called the memory glitches and some will do the job just right. It quite interesting and exciting to fiddle with it. You can try again and again until succeed but you'll have to rewind it quite a lot if you get it wrong. And right now, you might ask yourself 'Should I get this game then?' Unfortunately, I can't give you a straight answer(but for the sake of the review on steam I will select 'yes' for recommendation of the game.) I would have to ask you that 'Do you have 6-8 hours of your life to go through the game that is quite dull but filled to the brim with beauty and impressive visuals and decent puzzles?' 'Are you willing to forgive clunky control at times?' 'Will you intentionally lower your expectation a bit and enjoy it for what it is?' If the answers fir those questions are 'Yes', then go on. Buy it. Enjoy it. Have a good time with it. Remember me for me, is a decent game which I feel that it might have been planned to be something special in the beginning, something grand but somehow was scrapped, cut short or terminated for some unknown reasons. I can sense the potentials behind its ideas and I can feel enthusiasm lies hidden within it. I can see the determination, hard work and devotion that the developers put in it. And it has to be really heartbreaking that their game came out just only decent and being underappreciated by a lot of people. Anyway, That'll be all I'll have to say about this game. If you like my review click a like button on it. If you find it useless then the unlike button is there a reason. Hit it if you feel like you need to. Thank you for reading to the end. I'll see you guys next time when I decide to write reviews for some other games! Bye bye, beagles.			"

												Remember Me is an absolutely unforgettable game. As Nilin, the player escape from a facility in a futuristic Paris in a dystopian future, trying to avoid her memory from being wiped completely. NIlin cannot remember a lot of things, but wants to - so she joins the Errorist's cause (a group of rebels) to stop the Memorize corporation from taking control of people's memories. The corporations buys, trades, & sells them on the market; and some people even try to get them removed. Nilin is also on the quest to find out more about her past and to try to confront it, while she's at it. Nilin was a former Memory Hunter, so she has the ability to alter, remove, and take people's memories. And well, that's just for starters here. What sounds like an excellent premise on a global level for such a dystopia, it only starts off only as a cool plot device for a while. But, a bit later, it also gets very personal and intriguing, eventually elevating the game's story and characters to excellent heights. If that isn't enough - the (English) voice-acting is also excellent. Finding ""Journal"" entries throughout the game is also interesting and worth finding, as they will further immense the player into the excellent game-world, its inhabitants, and everything that this game has to offer.   The game's art direction and music are absolutely exceptional. The music is an orchestral score blended with electronic music  elements - and it sounds great, creative, and absolutely unique. If that isn't enough, the music knows exactly how to hit the right mood, to the point that each note and each song is quite meticiulously placed at the right moment and time.The game's combat system is pretty cool, feeling similar to the style of combat found in Batman: Arkham series of games - but, there's a lot more dodging and other things involved, as well. As you perform more combos, moves, and find things in the game-world - you will unlock more moves, more different types of attacks (some heal, some regenerate your cooldown on special moves, etc), and more combo sequences that you can perform. Once you learn more move, combos and special moves, more enemies and different types get thrown at you - which causes the combat to get awesome, hectic, complex, deep, and challenging. Gameplay varies, mixing elements from all kinds of different genres. The game doesn't deviate much from its linear path, as there isn't much for side-quests and things to find. You might find things like Journal entries and upgrades to Nilin, but they won't be too far beaten from the linear path. While there are combat sequences, there are also platforming sequences (where the game is often pointing you where to go and move for the platforming), stealth elements (where you have to avoid getting scene or caught), and there are even puzzles to solve (like what you'd see in ""classic"" adventure games). While all of these elements are solid, it's the actual sum of its parts that create this whole that eventually makes them great.The coolest of the puzzles are the ""Remix Memory"" puzzles, where you go into a person's mind and change their memory completely, bending it to Nilin's will to get whatever desired outcome she wants from them. The player is given a bunch of ""glitches"" in the memories and must figure when and where to change them. Players will rewind, fast-forward, slow down, pause and select certain elements, all in the hope of getting Nilin's desired outcome - while there are only unfortunately a few of these, all of these puzzles are all creative, interesting, and excellent. Remember Me starts off as a slow-burner, hand-holding the player quite a bit early on (to teach you its numerous different mechanics) and to try to immerse into its game-world.  The game is always enjoyable and intriguing because of its art direction, game-world, music & premise - but once it gets really going, it gets fantastic. While it does take a bit to get really going somewhere mind-blowing w/ its story, combat, characters, and gameplay - once it gets going, this is when the game goes from good to great. Remember Me is a game that should not be missed...and definitely not forgotten anytime soon.Final Grade = B+			"

												Remember Me gets a bad rap. It's a really fun action adventure that is largely underrated because people want it to be something it's not. First of all it's a linear story. Yes it takes place in a futuristic Paris, no you can't explore where ever you want. As much as we all want it to be an open world game it's not. Now if you can get past that what you'll find is that Remember Me has a rich and detailed story and some elements that make it a really fun game. As Nilin, a memory hunter, you're up against the company Memorize. Think 30th century Umbrella Corp. There's a revolution going on and you're public enemy number 1. In addition to leading a one man rebellion you're also piecing together Nilin's fractured past. Plenty of story to keep you entertained.The graphics are incredibly detailed as you explore a diverse world, from the underground sewers to posh futuristic apartment complexes and sterile offices. A lot of work went into realizing the impressive environments. And even in non-movie sequences the visuals are stunning. As for gameplay there's a mixed bag of tricks. The main thing about this that sets it apart from the rest of the pretty 3rd person adventure games is the ability to remix people's memories of events. However, those events are few and far between as there's only 4 instances of doing that in the entire game. And because it's a fairly short game, only took me about 15 hours to finish it feels like something with a lot of potential that could have gotten a lot more prominent use in a larger game.This game also boasted the idea of being able to create your own fighting combos. This is also a place where I think a bit of false advertising or lost in translation fell flat. There's only 4 fighting combinations. You can edit what you do when you press a button but not much else. I feel like Sleeping Dogs had more variety in fighting where this game just pretends to give you a very limited variety. Also if you're reading this DO NOT BUY THE DLC. It just unlocks a handful of extra move types. You still have the same 4 combos just you're given a few extra designations. IMO it's not worth $4 but I thankfully bought it at 75% off so the sting of realizing it's cheap and worthless doesn't hurt that much. That being said it's a cool game. If you see it on sale and want to play something that's a little bit different then go for it. You'll have some fun though quickly fleeting, it's got a nice story, good soundtrack and voice acting. It's not terribly challenging but you're playing it for the story mostly and that at least lives up to some of the hype.			"

												I was extremely eager for this one. I was expecting one of the best games of the year, however I was disappointed. First things first, I browsed many different opinions regarding this game, this one is mine and I hope you respect it.☆ One of the reasons I was looking forward to this game was the fact that the Character is a girl - maybe I was expecting something along the lines of ""Lara Croft"" in the new Tomb Raider, I don't know.. - but I didn't find Nilin to be that much of an interesting character.☆Located in NeoParis, the futuristic French capital, ""Remember Me"" is set in the year of 2084 and shows a Society controlled by a corporation called Memorize. For the sake of Spoilers, I won't go deeper into this subject..☆In the game, Nilin is always questioning herself about her role in the world, what is the real result of her rebellion, and if there even need to take control of that planet from Memorize Corporation - after all, there is still a slight piece of humanity in what is left in NeoParis.☆The exploration points are one, of a series of flaws, regarding this game. The gameplay isn't fluid and thanks to that made it boring and tiresome for me - there is nothing attractive about fighting with Nilin, much less explore scenarios in search of the ingame's collectibles.Remember Me has a good story and fabulous scenery, the game had the possibility of being one of the best of the previous years. But at the same time, has too many limitations. So, probably is likely to be forgotten. The game is good, I was expecting more out of it.★★★★★☆☆☆☆☆ 5/10			"

												I do recommend this game, but not for everybody, and perhaps not even for most people. Read further through the review to see if you might find it worthwhile or not.First, the story and enviornment, since this is really the interesting part of the game.Part of the dystopian premise here is standard fare: environmental problems  push a vast portion of the world's population into squalor, with the instability spreading to the first world, leading to civil unrest, war, and eventually a civil war that fractures Europe. The interesting science-fiction twist is a technology that allows people to extract, move and share memories. The game doesn't look in to this in the kind of depth a good science fiction novel would, but rather uses this mainly as a structure to support the plot. While the writing and acting has quite a few awkward moments, the overall story certainly avoids being a straight ""good vs. evil"" tale, instead being considerably more interesting. As Nilin, part of a plot to bring down an ostensibly evil corporation taking over the world, you'll find that things swiftly become uncomfortably unclear. Your very first memory remix involves bringing someone over to your side by convincing her that the corporation killed her husband, which I doubt anybody with a conscience could feel comfortable with if they take the story even moderately seriously. As you proceed, you'll find yourself wondering on a regular basis who the good guys really are, or even if there are any. While there are a few characters who fit into the ""evil villain"" mold, all the rest have plausible reasons for what they do, and nobody comes out purely good or bad. This gives the story a pleasing depth that most games don't have, and does a lot to make up for failings in the gaming elements.One area where the game really shines is in the sketching out of the world. The fantastic art and design really makes the world come alive, even though, being a straight corridor game with almost no ability to look or explore beyond the path along which you're driven, I couldn't see nearly as much of it as I liked. But the details that were there were wonderful, holding up even to stopping play for close scrutiny, and the Parisian setting (with its mixture of French and English scattered about) adds very nicely to the foreign feel, at least for an Anglophone like me. On the technical side the art and design could have benefited from rather more polish, but if time and budget considerations forced the choice of where to put the design effort, clearly the developers made the right decision.As mentioned above, this is a straight-line corridor game with, aside from short detours to pick up collectibles, no exploration or choice whatsoever. Even for those of us who like to take our time and look and poke around, this makes the game quite short; I would be surprised if anybody took as long as 20 hours to finish it. For those who finish games quickly anyway, this isn't a problem; for those who usually get a lot more hours out of a game (because they explore every nook and cranny), I suggest you simply take this as they give it to you and enjoy the fact that at least there's no padding here to waste your time.The gameplay doesn't really have much to offer; it might best be described as ""adequate."" There's a reasonable amount of platforming of puzzling, none of which will bend your brain terribly. The memory remix idea does have the seeds of something brilliant in it, but unfortunately never really has the time, space or integration in to the story to do more than be an interesting sideline. You can play around with the remixing, but there's only one ""correct"" solution for the single storyline, so you can't explore the consequences of trying alternate paths. The best part about remixing memories is the discomfort you feel when you realize that you've acquired allies through building up a set of lies, and quite hurtful ones at that; you can well imagine that these people will eventually find out what you've done to them and their families (even if it was in the name of the greater good) and quite justifiably come after you for revenge later on. I'd love to see a game that wraps this idea deep in to the fabric and explores the consequences of how you choose to remix people's lives, rather than just being an element you need to get through to make the story progress.The combat in this game has been quite divisive, as is clear if you have a look at the forums. For the most part it's a fairly standard fighting style game with a bit of shooting thrown in to deal with robotic enemies and knockdown of human enemies. The main interesting twist is that you can select, for your combos, which blows emphasize damage, health restoration, and speeding the cooldown of special attacks.Experienced players of fighting games seem nearly unanimous that, even on the hardest level, combat is far too easy. If you're one of these people, you're probably best off not looking at this as a fighting game at all, but as a relaxing stroll through the story.On the other hand, for people like me who are terrible at fighting games, the combat is pretty rough, to the point of being very frustrating at times. The main problem here is that the game doesn't really provide useful training for the beginner at this genre; if you can't learn at the pace things are thrown at you the game will carry on forward anyway, and you'll soon find yourself out of your depth. Some careful combo design and going back to previous chapters (with more health and in-game skills) to work on particular areas where you're lacking can help mitigate this, but a training room or training mode allowing practice of particular skills would really have helped here. (The Combo Lab Pack DLC might also help, here, but opinions on that have been mixed and I've not tried it myself.)To sum up, we've got a good linear story with more depth than typical for a video game and a beautifully realized interesting world, even if we can't see as much of it as we'd like. If that appeals to you, you can probably fairly easily overlook the issues with the gameplay, and you'll almost certainly be able to overlook the lack of polish, in trade for a unique experience. You'll also be able to find many areas where the game could have gone a lot further in exploring the consequences of different decisions, but I'm happy to leave that for another game, and take this as the good start in this direction that it is.

												I picked this game up in a Steam sales because it looked interesting without any expectations and it blew me away! This game was simply the best cyberpunk experience I ever played. Beautiful artful graphics (Neo Paris looks breathtaking), great electro music especially towards the end of the game and an truly awesome story (especially appealing to someone who has own kids). I completed the story in 10 hours and to me this game was by far one of the greatest experiences i've ever had. But...I don't get why people are complaining about the combat? If you read/watched anything about the combat, it's basically another button mashing game. I knew what I was going into before I bought it. To me, it has more flexible combat due to combos. You can't button mash X constantly. You actually have to land combos. It's a fun combat system in all honestly. I love the idea of being able to have different combos. Do I need high DPS? 4 damage Presence (the items you put into combos) then a double Presence at the end that double the entire combo. Do I need fast healing? Swap out all those Presences for healing ones with a double at the end. I can change combos on the fly. It's wonderful This game is a little piece of art itself.   "

												The game has an interesting story (with cutscenes that you can pause but never skip, not even the 2nd+ time you see the same scene). Art looks nice with the future setting of Neo-Paris 2084.Nilin likes to climb on ledges/pipes like Tomb Raider, and melee fight like Batman with her own special sci-fi powers/tweaks.Some specific parts of the game are very annoying, but overall it's a nice game that is defenitely worth playing at least once.

												Remember Me is certainly too linear. Gameplay is hardly rigid and somewhat repetitive. But we can't bring himself to penalize too heavily as the experience offered is involved. With a great story, a rich and disturbing universe, dynamic and well thought out fighting, an exemplary artistic achievement and a memorable soundtrack, it has everything to emerge as one of the most attractive and original games of the year. In short, not to be missed !			"

												Neo-Paris, 2084. Personal memories are now digitised, bought, sold and traded like commodities. The last vestiges of privacy and intimacy have been extinguished in what feels like a logical progression of the explosive growth of social networks at the start of the 21st century. The citizens themselves have given in to this surveillance society in exchange for the comfort only smart technology can provide. This memory economy transfers immense power over society to just a small group of people. Remember Me is a third-person action adventure in which players assume the role of Nilin, a former elite memory hunter with the ability to penetrate people’s minds and steal or even alter their memories. The authorities, fearful of her knowledge and skills arrested Nilin and wiped away her memory. After her escape from prison, Nilin embarks on a mission to recover her identity, helped by her last and only friend. This search for her past leads to her being hunted by the very people that created this surveillance society.… I finish now the game and its one of the best advanture/story games what i ever played, yea the game have some problems with the fighting camera angle, but the story-telling are amazing,When its on sale and you wont a game with really nice areas and a amazing soundtrack then try this.10/10 for me :-) "

												Super underrated game. Some people pass out on this game because of the combat system. To me, it was easy, fun and the ability to create your own combos is pretty nice and gives a little variation to it. Also the Powers are nice, useful and fun to use. The game is stunning, with breathtaking landscapes and very detailed environments, and it's just super aesthetically pleasing. The soundtrack is awesome too and goes amazingly well with the game.Also, I personally loved the story. A lot. And Jax too.I would say this is, for sure, one of my all-time favourite games. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Cyberpunk stories/environments or even Science Fiction in general.			"

												Remember Me is a game that has so much promise and potential, but can't quite deliver on every aspect of it. The setting of Neo Paris is intriguing and breathtaking. The world is begging to be discovered but remains confined for the most part. The mechanic of creating your own combos is good in theory, but is a moot point when the game sends unnecessary waves of hit-sponge enemies at you. It just becomes monotonous at a point, which is why I found playing on easy to be much more enjoyable than Normal or Hard. The concept of the Memory Remixing is one that I loved and wish the game could have done a bit more of. For all of it's faults, Remember Me builds a great world that I want to spend more time in. I feel that with some refinements (mostly combat) there could be a truely great sequel waiting to be made. If you manage to get it on sale, then Remember Me definitely gets my recommendation.			"

												I don't usually like to use the word ""underrated"" but Remember Me deserves it. I'm not quite sure why this game wasn't more popular when it first came out. It has an interesting story and compelling characters in a unique setting. Stylisticly it's somewhere between Mirror's Edge and Deus Ex: Human Revolution. That's a great place to be.Visually, the game has a super strong sense of style and a consistent color palette. Those are things I feel like get overlooked in a lot of modern games. And at 1440p this might be the best game I've seen yet for having textures that actually look good.The sound is solid: good soundtrack, good voice acting. The dialogue itself is left wanting a few times, but for the most part it works and moves the action forward. Where things slow down is when you have to repeat a section you've already beaten: you can't skip cutscenes. This is especially frustrating at the beginning of chapters where the scenes can last for minutes. It's a standard feature that desperately needed to be implemented here and I hvae no idea why they didn't include it.Where the game suffers is in the action itself. Combat is mostly melee based and it requires memorizing combos. That's not something I enjoy doing. In general, fighting is a lengthy, boring affair you must endure to get through the game. It particularly sucks to get through several waves of enemis only to mess up a single time at the very end and be sent back to the beginning. Once you learn the system it's quite easy to cheese the AI though. So the combat has the worst combination possible: not challenging, yet frustrating.The quick time event system uses icons that are all the same shape and color, so they're easy to confuse, especially if you take a break from the game and come back weeks or months later. I still don't know what the use/interact icon is supposed to be.Once you muscle your way through the combat there is a very polished world underneath. I loved the exploration aspect, and there are some fun and funny things that happen in the background. Just the level of detail and care but into the environments and NPCs makes a playthrough worthwhile. I wish I could've learned even more about the world's back story.There is definitely room for improvement (and it probably would've sold better) if they revamped the RPG components to actually matter: having the ability to choose points going into HP, strength, or the ranged attach would've increased replayability and made me feel like I had more control over my character's growth instead of having new abilities thrust on me when it was convenient.I also wish they had made the locations and missions less linear. Not to the extent of something like a Fallout or Elder Scrolls game (I understand budget and time constraints) but something more akin to being able to wander around the city like in Deus Ex plus the minor skills tweaking I mentioned above would've put this game much higher on a lot of people's radars.Overall it's a great freshman entry from Dontnod. I'm really excited to see what they have in store with their second game, Life is Strange.			"

Posted: July 9, 2014
												       I know this game is a little on the older side but I finally got a chance to play it and I feel like it could have been one of the most underrated games in recent history.  A lot of the features of this game are absolutely fantastic and judging my articles about the game the one gripe most people had was the combat (which honestly wasn't that bad).  To get right into what this game is about, Remember Me is a 3rd person action game with combo based fighting mechanics and a parkour style level progression design. Essentially it is like many other climb, jump, crawl games like Tomb Raider, Uncharted and Enslaved but the main character instead of using projectile weapons only uses her fists and her power arm.  Now the Combo system runs a little differently from other combo fighting games in that there are 4 primary ""pressens"" with 4 separate, and each more complicated, combos . However with these combos you can set any presser to each combo. The longer the combo the more xp you can get the more pressens you can unlock. There are 4 separate Pressens; Power which hits hard, Regen which heals you some each time you use it in a combo,  Chain which increases a combo multiplier making it do more damage and get more xp (these are best used at the end of the a combo) and cool down which lowers the time required to use a S-Pressen. 	S-Pressens are powerful, specialized pressens that you can only use once per certain time period and must have enough focus to use it. There are 5 S-Pressens which include Fury which lets Nilin (the main character) attack with each hit being more powerful than the last, Sensen Dos which stuns enemies and is very useful versus specific enemies, Rust in Pieces is a bomb that is effective versus robots, Camo which cloaks Nilin allowing her to move around regaining health and being able to perform a takedown on powerful enemies and logic bomb which can break shields and heavily damage enemies. Now the Specials and the basic combat system albeit are unique in their names and how they look, deep down it is just a generic combo based system and can get repetitive over time and can be prone to problems with connecting hits.	My biggest problem with the game however is the buggy parkour system. As it is a lot of times the camera control can be all over the place and Nilin could miss a jump that she should have been able to make. At times the parkour makes sense but other times it feels like it was just put there to have something for the time between fights and memory syncs.  	One of the coolest features of this game however is the memory stealing/manipulating and as far as I'm concerned is not used enough in this game. Nilin's main ability (one of the main reasons she is such a sought after person) is that she can manipulate a characters memories of an event and completely change their personality of what happened during that event. During this mechanic you can go forward and backwards during a memory and slightly alter things in the room to make the characters do things including killing each other or remembering something to not be as tragic. It was used 3 or 4 times throughout the game but just the process of going into someone's mind and changing a memory to get a different outcome was absolutely facinating. 	Enough about the gameplay, on to the story.  The year is 2084 in Neo-Paris and Memorize corporation has invented a new implant called the Sensen which enables others to share memories with others, remove memories or even sell memories to earn money. During this time due to an infection and corruption of the implant, a new race of humans developed called Leapers. These Leapers are very basic in their mental capacity and are very aggressive towards non-Leapears. Enter our character Nilin who is a memory manipulator but in the beginning she has had almost all of her memories wiped because she had been captured by memorized and been punished.  However thanks to someone called Edge, she is able to escape and work to find her memories and try to take down Memorize. Throughout the game Nilin has to manipulate the memories of many in order to get to the bottom of the whole situation of Memorize and the Sensen.  The story is very unique and it is wonderful to have a main female protagonist that is the strongest character in the game.  	The graphics of this game are absolutely beautiful and to top it all off, Dontnod Entertainment really did a top notch job of creating a very beautiful and realistic future Paris. The whole game is very aesthetically pleasing with the variations locations being so different showing the true difference between the impoverished  and the wealthy in Neo-Paris.  On top of that Olivier Deriviere did an absolutely fantastic job bringing the soundtrack to life to match the game beautifully. The music is much like the works done by Daft Punk in Tron Legacy in that Deriviere mixed a bit of electronic with orchestral sound. The end result is a soundtrack that I have ended up listening to repeatedly at work while I have been programming. The voice actors also do a fantastic job bringing their characters to life and make the dialogue all that much better. 	Overall this game is absolutely fantastic, from the story, characters, music, graphics etc.  The only downside is the generic gameplay and flawed camera angles during the parkour/climbing mechanics. I would highly recommend this game and I look forward to see if Capcon would bring us a sequel at some time in the future.•	Story - 95•	Gameplay - 70•	Graphics - 90•	Sound - 100•	Fun - 90•	Replay value - 80 "

												A wonderful game with a fresh story concept (at least for me), underlined with an atmospherical soundtrack.From the begining you get involved into the world of NeoParis. Besides a few exceptions, you're sympathizing with the characters through the whole story. Also the secret stuff collectors get their money's worth.I've really enjoyed this game and think that's a must-have-played for every cyberpunk fan!			"

												Great game! The story could be a movie!Remember Me is a great game. It comes with a good gameplay, good graphics and a very cool story.Maybe you could even call it the ""French Revolution"" in 2084?It's about a company that digitizes memories. But it can also delete your memories and make you to kind of a zombie.Then there are the people who are against it.I personally liked the story a lot and could imagine it as a movie. You start right in the middle and it has some turning points. The gameplay I mean is basically the fighting system. You have to create your own combos with a bit consideration. Fighting in Remember Me doesn't get boring because of variation. There are lot of different enemies and combos.Moreover, the game has beautiful graphics, which makes it more worthy to play.All in all, the story and the gamplay make Remember Me to an all right game. It's not the best but not bad also!			"

												This is one hell of a game, though not without its misgivings.CONS:- The battle system could have been better. It's not awful, but don't expect Devil May Cry. This does not mean there isn't any variety to it, so you won't exactly get bored of it.PROS:- An interesting story with a fleshed out setting. A real rollercoaster. There's lots of external material you should look up later on, too.- The art direction and the environments, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! One alley in this game is more detailed than entire maps in other games. Maybe I'm overstating things, but only just a little - it's just insane how much detail is packed into everything.- The music is also something else. They added a bit of a glitchy spin to it, so it definitely stands out and stands strong.OVERALL:Absolutely worth at least one playthrough to experience the story, and all the sights and sounds on offer. Despite the fact the combat system may have been a late addition, the game nevertheless is still a solid package in every other aspect. Its art direction, in particular, is just jaw-droppingly impressive and immersive.Just... wow.			"

												I had to get Remember Me, after playing Life is Strange. Remember Me is DONTNOD's first game and it's great solid start :D. It tells the story of Nilin in a beautiful future Neo-Paris, who has lost her memory.  As a fan of sci-fi genre, I enjoyed this story a lot. It reminds me of some awesome movies of the genre. The game is linear and at quite many parts of the story you have to solve some puzzles, climb buildings. Remember Me also features some awesome ""rewind"" moments, where you alternate memories. The combat is fast paced, and you can customize your own sweet combos and eventually unlocking more moves. Boss fights include some QTE, which was the only downside for me as using K+M, because the button icons for K+M didn't make it very clear what to press in few moments. Resulting in some retries. I think the soundtrack is amazing, it fits well in the scenes. The game's story was really good imo and it will keep you interested to the end, as you learn more about Nilin and the city. It made me think how scary it would be, if the technology would someday evolve so far, as it is in Remember Me.So folks, try to remember and buy this game sometime :).			"

												This game is a bit like a date with a really attractive imbecile:  The ""good looking"" aspect wears thin really quickly and all you are left with is crushing disappointment.  The most disappointing part is that you can see how much effort went into the game, but it still fails to engage.  My gameplay experience was as follows: Disembodied voice tells you to go and do X at location Y, so you head towards Y because you have nothing better to do.  Most of the trip involves idiot-level climbing with handy yellow ""This way, stupid"" arrows guiding you. Roughly halfway, you arrive at a large open space and you're attacked by swarms of random enemies.  Combat involves mashing keys furiously.  Helpful key-mashing hints keep popping up, basically saying, ""LOL! Don't suck so much"". Once enemies are dispatched, you arrive at your destination.  Cue cut scene.  Rinse, repeat.After several cycles, you have your obligatory boss fight, which is tedious in the extreme.  Your attacks only do minuscule damage against his / her / its billion hit points, so it takes time.  Once the boss is vanquished, you have a pointless QTE, which is difficult to get right the first time, especially if you're rolling your eyes in annoyance.  This means you have to endure another round of boss-vanquishing before you get to try again.This was the point where I said, ""Screw it, I've given it a fair crack, but I am not entertained"" and moved on to more interesting things, like laundry.  If I have to deal with rinse and repeat, I may as well get something worthwhile out of it.			"

												I'm so torn on this game. What is does good, it does great, but what it fails at it fails at hard.The score/setting/characters/story were all amazing. There was a point in the game I had to do something that made me feel as rotten as I did on Walking Dead, and I was so attached to the moment. The ending was epic, and during this 3 hours session I couldn't stop playing. During each session I started, I had to force myself to stop playing. There was a decent variance in enemy types (in an ~8 hour game), each with their own strengths, where you had to use the many weapons/attacks you gain to defeat them. I was surprised at how much the story sucked me in. I tried to ignore it at points, but it really drove the narrative well, and was mind-blowingly shocking at points.The game is LOADED with sections where someone is talking to you, and you're forced to walk slowly through the environment. I can't tell you how annoying this is. Also, this gorgeous world is extremely linear, and right out pisses me off at points. This is really evident during the platforming sections. The rhythm-based fights and combo-building was fun when I got the hang of it, but it wasn't overly deep. Overall, this game was a conglomeration of great ideas, some executed really well, but some completely missed their mark. It really feels like one development team started the game, for some reason it got shelved, and another team picked it up, and wasn't able to keep the same vision, and rushed it out to market with a ""good enough"" attitude.If the game interests you, add it to your wishlist, and look for a sale. For Me  the good things really outweighed the bad, and I will Remember this game for some time.			"

Mid fight, zoomed in on forheads or point at the ceiling. The fighting/dodging system tried to take some clues from the Batman game. But much was lost in translation and it just doesn't flow well. So bad that I simply can't recommend the game. I hope this developer continues to refine their games and I look forward to their next releases.			"

												In Remember Me you are the memory hunter Nilin, who has lost her memory. It's a classic story of rebels trying to overthrow the ruling elite, but with a fair few twists along the way. Nilin proves to be an interesting and evolving character, cast in a story that's well worth experiencing.When it comes to gameplay, this is a fairly standard third-person action brawling game. A fair number of cutscenes and a lot of dialogue during gameplay provides exposition, as do the classic hidden lore items. Meanwhile you'll be fighting off a wide array of well-designed enemies and bosses by chaining together various combos of melee attacks. And as per usual there are some QTEs involved as well, particularly in boss fights, albeit fewer than is the norm in this genre.The combat is very satisfying, particularly on the Memory Hunter difficulty setting. Combos are reasonably easy to chain together but you need to pay a lot of attention to what the enemies around you are doing to avoid getting hit. Unfortunately the difficulty is a bit inconsistent in that the first major boss is also immediately the most challenging in the entire game. Most later bosses can generally be finished in one go, partially because you'll have unlocked all your combat moves by then.Remember Me shines due to its excellent art direction and map design. The merely average console-port quality texturework and visual effects are outdone by simply stunning vistas that can be seen in the background. Just keep in mind that it's an extremely linear game with no alternative paths in its environments, nor are there any choices to be made or different endings during its story.The game offers a few interesting twists along the way. Not only are there several different combos that unlock during play, but these can be altered to suit your playstyle. You can slot in different types of button presses in each combo to determine how much damage, health regeneration, and cooldown reduction a combo delivers. Initially more exciting is the ability to remix people's memories. That is until you realize that it's an entirely linear affair (albeit with a few alternative branches that can't be used as endings) and it only happens three times in the entire game. It's still fun to do, but far too underused a mechanic.A future where a company runs a post-apocalyptic world through controlling people's memories may not seem all that plausible. But there's great attention to detail throughout the experience that keeps it consistent and the hidden lore items flesh out the game's setting very well.Conclusion / TLDRRemember Me isn't the game that was marketed originally, but can manage to impress on its own terms if you forget the hype. A much better than average third-person action game, albeit an extremely linear one with its most unique elements - altering combos and changing people's memories - severely limited. And it's a solid PC port.Technical Droning120Hz - NoFOV slider - NoBorderless Window - NoGraphics Options - DecentTexture Quality - AverageGamepad vs Keyboard - Gamepad, due to mostly melee fighting / combos / QTEsKey Rebinding - Yes			"

												This is one of those games which you might aswell just watch on youtube and your experience would probably even be less painful. You will spend most of your time climbing from one predefined ledge to another and just pressing whatever buttons the game tells you to press, the climax of your freedom being to walk into the one occasional dead end to find a ""hidden"" item. Combat is as bland as literally mashing the very same combination of buttons over and over again until generic enemies with different skins die; To say it is repetitive is an understatement.Unless you really do enjoy dull and linear sightseeing without any actual interaction, I cannot recommend it at all. It's shiny and has a somewhat decent story, but that alone just doesn't kick it, the presentation is bloody awful.			"

Remember Me is a great 3rd person action game. You play as Nilin, an acrobatic melee fighter / Sensen hacker working against a megacorp that manipulates human memories.GameplayBasically, Nilin can punch, kick or dodge in a catlike way (jumping over enemies or backwards). Your main objective is to hit combos like punch-kick-kick-punch-kick-kick. You use Pressens to personalize the effect of your combos (e.g. regen health, extra damage, ...).Combat gets more exciting mid-game, when you start to unlock longer combos and special powers while facing a large number of foes at once. Keyboard/Mouse controls are decent but personally I prefer a controller, as the combat feels more fluid and the camera is easier to handle.StoryThe story has its plot twists and succeeds to keep you engaged. As a downside, I think it's a shame that some cool characters like Headache Tommy and Olga Sedova don't have bigger roles.The lore is well written but it's not forced upon you. There are ""Mnesists"" (journal entries) that you can collect and read or simply ignore without any penalty.Graphics & ArtIt's evident that everything, from the futuristic Neo-Paris streets to the character models, was done with great care by extremely talented artists.Remember Me is one of the best looking Unreal Engine games and a gorgeous cinematic experience. The lights effects are spot-on and the textures are first-rate (although not high resolution). My only complaint is that the FOV is ridiculously low and there is no way to change it. You can try some .ini file tweaks or Flawless Widescreen, but they inevitably end up messing with the HUD.Click here for a screenshot of the graphics options.Music & Voice ActingThe music is fitting and was composed by Olivier Deriviere, who also composed the soundtrack to Assassin's Creed IV: Freedom Cry. The main theme played in the menu and in several scenes is quite remarkable.About the voice acting... Well, some lines are little bit cheesy, but the actors did their best and delivered a satisfying performance.VerdictRemember Me is a solid AAA experience. Don't let the ludicrous Metacritic score put you away.I certainly hope to see more from the French studio Dontnod Entertainment!			"

												   There are some really special games out there, ambitious, with good ideas, and that aren´t afraid to talk of issues, like loss, grieving, and the weight of our memories over our shoulders, this is one of those, but is a deeply flawed game.  First things first, the art direction in this game is amazing, as well as its soundtrack, both are top notch, New Paris is a place that i will love to see in another game, it´s  not going to happen wich is a shame, but is hard to blame the people who didn´t like this game, because where it fails is in the game part, is full of good ideas on paper but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.  The combat is a diferent take on the now standar third person hand to hand combat that the batman games brought us a years ago, sadly it isn´t as fun as in the rockstar games. The combo thing is a nice idea, you can personalize your combos with differents effects, regen health, more damage, less time for the special moves, but the flow of the combat is a slog, never and i mean never did i get that sense of flow you got with the batman games, or in sleeping dogs for example, you have to time your hits in an excruciating slow manner, just a little bit faster would have change it a lot, and anyway there´s a lot of combat in this game, each time i entered an open space i started to groan, loud, and the final irony is the most unnecesary boss fight i remember, story wise makes no sense, no sense at all, is a boss fight because is a videogame and you need one of those, you know, videogames. The irony is that is actually a pretty decent boss fight, is not too difficult, but you have to use the abilities that you used in the game, no QTEs, even tough almost all the finishers in the rest of the game´s bosses are QTE wich was a nice surprise, but man, this game didn´t need it  the traversal is easy with a couple of different puzzles, and the game even throws at you help at the small hint that you are somehow stuck, i would have loved some more freedom to explore and to try different routes and so on, but no is my way or the highway dude, ah and there are some collectables, obviously, too in some nook and cranes not many  but i didn´t care too much about it.   the memory remix thing is the other great idea with a poor execution, but there are only a few and the annoyance at the wasted potential is small, but it adds up to the flaws of the game  This game could have been great, really really great,  with better combat, a little more exploration and freedom of movement and a couple of different decisions story wise could have been glorious, the dynamics between the protagonists tackle some very important issues and they did it pretty well to tell the truth, the twist is pretty obvious, and that´s what makes the final part of the game a dissapointment in its execution, and the end doesn´t really makes a lot of sense.   i kind of liked it, but your mileage may vary depending in how much its linearity  and the combat annoys you, or how much you like it, the art direction like i said is superb, and the ost is now in my rotation, is really, really good			"

												Excellent soundtrack, good story, great art-direction, so-so gameplay*.Get it on the cheap and you won't be disappointed.*I guess I should expand on the gameplay.Most of the game is going to be spent fighting. Combat is basically a lite version of the Arkham games. A symbol appears over an enemy's head letting you know they're about to attack and you have a small handful of combos. You can replenish health and energy by using specific moves in your combos. There are a few special powers, some of which are interesting such as the ability to turn robots against their masters. Otherwise your time is going to be spent climbing, doing some minor exploring to find health/energy upgrades, and solving puzzles. The most interesting aspect is the memory remixing, where Nilin goes inside of the memories of others and changes things around. Something as simple as moving an object, flicking a switch, or taking the safety off a gun can lead to dramatic occurences. If these were more fleshed out they'd be an integral and awesome part of the game. Still, they're pretty interesting.			"

												I really want to recommend this, truthfully.Remember Me has so many commendable aspects. The world - Neo-Paris - is an astonishingly rich setting, backed by excellent music that blends orchestral flourishes with ""futuristic"" digital work.However, Remember Me fundamentally fails at too many basic things to be a good game. The gameplay is somewhere between passable and dull: One can breeze through the game mashing one button without too much hassle. Annoying stealth sections and finicky platforming make Remember Me frustrating rather than enjoyable/challenging. The story doesn't live up to the awesome dystopia it is set in, particularly when you use the awkward english voice track.The real sad thing, though, is the exploration: as wonderful as Neo-Paris is, the on-rails no-exploration design means you don't get to do any actual exploring.This game does plenty right, and at a low, low price is worth it to experience an engaging world and good music. On the whole, though, this is a missed opportunity, and will bring you frustration more than it will pleasure.			"

												I'll think about this game in the future, I'm sure, it's got plenty of cool and slightly unbelievable setting and plot design, presented expertly with well-crafted visuals and sound.The gameplay is nothing special, sort of a cross between Arkham ____ and Assassin's Creed, but with very linear levels. It taught me how much Ubisoft knows about making climbing around without danger into a challenge. The complaint about this game that I recall hearing the most is that there weren't enough Remixing scenes, and that's probably because those were the original part of the whole gameplay construction.

												The memory remixing concept should have been great. This was a game that needed to explore how your interactions with a character change after you alter their memories and the moral and ethical quandries around that. That should have been the core game mechanic. Instead, they made the core game mechanic ""Guitar Hero, but with punches and kicks.""The game is a total disappointment. It could have, should have been a cult classic. Instead it's a forgettable bargain bin game at best.			"

												This is a wonderfully crafted game, an interesting premise resplendant with an excellent script, plot, and design (amongst other things). The script was well thought out, and developed in tune with what I humbly felt was one of the best conceived stories in a long time (related to games only). The whole design of the game was well laid out, it had an abject air of utter hoplessness and a visual quality that I still think about. The combat mechanics of the game are reminiscent to Rockstars Batman whilst the general movement of the character i.e, climbing is similar to Naughty Dogs Uncharted. All in all I suggest you play this game if you are a fan of intelligently created dystopian sci-fi worlds, beautifully crafted visually and conceptually. Excellent scripts and a general flow of events that don't leave you disappointed and confused. 10/10.			"

												I remember watching footage of Remember Me from E3 a few years ago. The clip featured a women in a futuristic world manipulating a man’s memories to make him kill himself. It certainly interested me, but for some reason this game stayed under my radar until now. I picked it up as part of the recent Capcom Humble Bundle so I decided I’d play through it and see what it’s all about.There is a really good story here that definitely makes the game worth playing through to experience. The art style is really nice, it kind of reminded me a bit of the 2001 film AI, having a really striking futuristic style and a slight dystopian feeling going on. There's some really nice attention to detail in the world in little details such as memory dispensing machines that look like cash machines, the holographic interfaces over shop windows, computers with holographic interfaces, and the way people dress and their fashion sense. The architecture that contrasts Gothic and Neo-Renaissance Parisian architecture with futuristic structures is also really beautiful and strangely believable. You can tell that a lot of love and thought has been put into crafting this world. It’s one of those games where you want to walk around and look at every little fascinating detail.The theme of memory storage and manipulation is very consistent throughout the game both artistically and within the narrative. I especially like the parts of the game about remixing memories and how that affects things. I wish there was just a little bit more of that in the gameplay and less of the combat, which is just lacking and slightly frustrating. The combat is a bit like a Batman Arkham game but lacks the refinement and can as such be very annoying on occasions. It badly needed a counter button or just something it make it more enjoyable. It feels like the combat is just something you need to push through in order to get to the other parts of the game.It is a very linear game and features Tomb Raider-esque wall scaling and jumping. It also has some environmental puzzles and sneaking past stuff. I felt most of that stuff is actually done quite nicely in this game even if it wasn't exactly pushing the boundaries of innovation. One particular gripe I do have however is the amount of cutscenes, they happen very often without warning and they are not skippable. They are all really nicely done with great voice acting and well written dialogue, but they often felt almost rude in how they just take away control from you unceremoniously. It is a story heavy game however and the story is really well told so it's understandable.I played through this game in few days in a couple of sittings and I enjoyed it a lot, taking just under 10 hours to get to the end of the story. I wouldn't exactly say it's the best game ever or anything like that, but rarely can a game hold my interest from start to finish and this game certainly did that. I feel it could have been an amazing game had it focused more on the memory remixing and even more on the story, although it seems like the developers have learnt that lesson and done exactly that in their next game Life is Strange. If you can see past its flaws there is a very worthwhile game here with a lot of commendable things to like and enjoy.			"

												What an infuriating experience! This game was clearly designed and implemented by artists alone. No sensible design went into its combat system, level design, progression, or story!Now then,Pros-Beautiful setting and environment art-Well-done fluid animations-Music! I can't speak enough of the music. It's dynamic; adjusts to your combat flow and makes the unbearable grind somewhat exciting. Seriously, just stop reading right here and go listen to the music!And now for the crap *takes a deep breath*Cons-Combos actually reset when you hit a different enemy than the one you started the combo with. Seriously?! Have you devs even heard of the Batman games??-Empty, shiny, boring, plastic, soulless world. They had a gorgeous canvas to work with. A futuristic dystopian cyberpunk Paris. But the only reason you'd ever know it was Paris was seeing a 2D tour d'eiffel or arc de Triomphe as a skybox once or twice in the game. pfff.....-Boring and shallow combat system that gets boring after the 1st hour. Oh, and did I mention your combo will reset if you hit a different enemy?-Claustrophobically linear world. No really! The camera even makes a point of it and hugs your shoulders for dear life so you never EVER get to see anything around you. Not that there's much variety to be seen after the 1st hour in anyway. It'd be unsound to actually say exploration goes unrewarded as exploration is rather PROHIBITED in this game. Invisible walls galore!-Game breaking bugs, progression blockers, crashes, you name it! Get ready to love restarting at last checkpoint.-WHO DESIGNED THE COMBAT SYSTEM SO AS TO RESET THE COMBO AFTER YOU HIT A DIFFERENT ENEMY?!?! I DEMAND TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER!! -Repetitive boilerplate missions. Run through these empty halls, open a few doors, traverse a few platforms, punch-punch-kick, then run through these next set of empty halls. Oh, and an annoying cheesy poet will be incessantly calling you every 2 minutes with some narrative ""wisdom"".-Speaking of opening doors, this game actually made a glorified mechanic out of opening doors and interacting with switches! No really, one of your ""powers"" is the ability to interact with switches! There are 3 types of switches in this world for some reason. It's just practical good design. And they all have fancy shmancy names!-Speaking of names, they should have shipped a ♥♥♥♥in thesaurus for all those sensens and remembrens and nonsense.-And as far as the ""story"" goes, this game is so far up its own♥♥♥♥♥that it can see daylight. Rehashed evil corporation, sheeple leading their lives, hippies trying to show you the light man, blah blah bling blah...There is one slight saving grace though. The game can be completed in under 9 hours! So the nightmare doesn't last for too long!What a waste...			"

												Story 8/10Visuals 7/10Art Concepts 9/10Combat 6/10Fluidity 7/10This game is great. The timing of the story cutscenes and visual imagery while youre exploring makes you feel like youre playing a movie, not a video game. This hasnt happened to me with any other games. It was really depressing realizing off the bat that your only pathway is a narrow corridor for the entire game. I can only imagine what this game would be like if it was open world. I would definitely buy.The combat can be rage inducing. It consists of 2 basic concepts: chaining combos and dodging. Like someone else said, you cant chain combos into other creatures which really sets combat back. Dodging for the most part is responsive but sometimes you get caught in an animation and youre screwed. It forces you to settle down, wait for the monster to miss with its attack, then you go. The combo building system in your little menu is pretty cool, it lets you choose what strikes go where, with different animations and attack types (heal, damage, cooldown, and a double bonus). Oh and the boss fights are fun.So the game is pretty good imo. Its not all combat, you do some puzzle stuff, collectibles, mess with peoples memory (cool concept but annoying to do) and parkour (limited, dont expect mirrors edge). I would probably play through this story again,  after maybe a half to full year. So every once and a while. Took me 12 hours to beat but I would definitely cut that down a lot the second time around. "

												Remember Me promises a lot more than it can ultimately deliver, but it's still a solid third-person brawler with some fantastic production values (easily one of the best game soundtracks of 2013) and a story that touches on a lot of themes and emotions most games don't bother with. The fighting is fast and fluid, and there's some scope for customising how you want to play - as a heavy hitter or constantly using heals and specials, say. It's just a shame much of the game is so easy by default you never have to do any of this. The platforming and exploration takes you through some phenomenal environments - visuals like few if any other videogames out there - but it's annoying that they're so linear you're rarely given much time to properly take anything in. And the puzzles, the ""memory remixes"", are a neat idea and presented well, but they're really just a case of slow trial and error to get the right boxes ticked or left unticked. A lot of Remember Me feels ""good enough"", then, rather than great, or makes you wish it gave you more freedom, or challenged you more, or spent more time fleshing out its story. At the same time it frequently looks and sounds phenomenal, it is still fun to play, and its story does manage some very moving, thought-provoking moments even if it's not as brave or as smart as it seems to think. Definitely pick it up on a sale if you like third-person brawlers with some smarts - just be aware it's not really as deep or as meaningful as the developers originally seemed to be implying it would be.

												Probably one of the best games i have played so far. The story is based on such a unique concept of stealing other people's memories. Its futuristic and the another thing i loved was when she got into others mind and altered their memories.  story  The game begins with Nilin, a memory hunter, whose memory was almost stolen and wiped but she still managed to remember her name somehow. She was guided by an unknown friend who was later called Edge. He helped her and guided her throughout the game. In between all of the episodes of game she tried to remember who she actually was and why she always needed to listen to edge.   She reluctantly obeyed his orders and did everything he said. As the game proceeded she found the missing pieces of her memory and tried to put them together.

 Thanks to him she suprisingly found her mother and that happened when she was told to remix the memory of CEO of memroize, Scylla.Later in the game she discovered that Doctor Quaid was the only person who stole people's memories and made them leapers to establish an army of leapers. But before she could get to Doc to kill him, he was already killed by Johnny Greenteeth, who was turned into leaper by Quaid.In the end she was forced by Edge to destroy the H3O, the center of Memorize. That H3O turned out to be Edge himself, the particular server where all the unhappy and bad memories of people were kept. After destorying H3O or Edge She learnt that suffering and having bad memories is part of life. 


A really nice and considerate friend Edge! <3

 gameplay  Nilin was one with great abilities and skills, she happened to accquire new ones in game. No guns! only melee. She was good in martial arts and had to make chain of presens to make combo in Combo lab and that was to achieve great deal of damage even health point! Captain Gabriel Trace door's code was actually a riddle. To pass the security door, the riddle must be sloved 1st so as to figure out the code! well i kinda liked it cos i like solving riddles! Melee is actually good cos guns on the other hand are so frustrating and we have to buy them and then in middle of fight we just run out of bullets! so melee works quite better than weapons.

												Remember Me is a very cheap game (Can easily find keys for 5 euros), which brings back the old-fashioned wonder of playing an adventure (or i should say ""A Story"").In a world filled with first person shooters and sometimes dispersive open world games, ""Dontnod"" delivered a fine gem.Not a perfect game, but surely one worth playing.Remember Me is an action/adventure game.It somehow reminds me of Uncharted, where you alternate combat phases with some guided platforming.To be honest it shares the same downsides as the Naughty Dog masterpiece, like a way too guided progression.The major downside of the game is that there's no room for exploration; you basically navigate a lot of elaborated corridors.The good thing, though, is that the graphics and setting are so inspired you actually get captivated by the whole atmosphere and you don't think too much about these issues after a couple of hours of gameplay.The combat mechanics are great.Ok, you only have 4 combos at your disposal, but you can customise them however you want, by unlocking different ""Action Points"" (pressens), each one with a specific effect (reduce cooldown/regain health/break guard/double effect ecc...).The longest combos are hard to deliver (but deadly) and that, mixed with a satisfying variety of enemies and a good selection of special abilities (that are unlocked throughout the story), makes the fights always stimulating.The developers did a great job balancing the fights, inserting different type of enemies at the same time, so you always need to think and use a new strategy.The other major feature of the game is it's narrative.A very simple yet captivating story, that keeps you wanting to know what's going to happen; the plot twists are also great and the game also brings up some existential questions and strong topics.One last thing i'd like to mention is the ""Memory Remixes"", a really interesting and fun ""Game within the game"", although it's featured only for a couple of times.Remember me is a fine action/adventure game; not perfect but definitely worth the small price you can buy it for.Strongly recommended to people who can appreciate a good story. Not recommended to people who can't stand ""Non-Open-World"" games.Pros:- Great Story- Well Orchestrated fights- Memory Remixes are really cool- Very inspired level design and atmosphere- Fairly good graphics.- Customisable combosCons:- Strictly Guided Exploration- Sometimes ""Claustrophobic""- More combo slots would have been nice.- Not That Long (about 7 hours of gameplay)- It should have ""dared"" a bit moreTo consider:- Old School Gameplay (You might like it or dislike it)Recommended			"

												Remember Me is not perfect. But to be honest, nowadays, what is?I wholeheartedly recommend this game on a sale, however. Full price, eh. My record of 9.5 hours is pretty much the entire game length on hard difficulty, although I did miss some collectibles. Therefore, 28 EUR is steep. But I got this at -85% off, and I have no right to complain.The story was VERY interesting, the setting was unique. Neo-Paris, 2084, where SENSEN technology is capable of storing your memory data so that you can erase the memories you don't want, relive memories you hold close, and use your memories as currency... and you're Nilin, an Errorist, who is guided by Edge trying to dismantle this system, which is supposedly ""flawed"" and should be destroyed.Soundtrack fits the futuristic theme of the game, it's glitchy orchestral, like a movie soundtrack mixed with electronic and effects. Great support for the events that occur.Gameplay is primarily three things: - Combat: (combo-based system, combos can be customized in order to have their elements (pressens) be POWER, REGEN, COOLDOWN REDUCTION and CHAIN; and you also get Sensen Abilities which need a Focus bar which you get from punching your opponents enough. Simple enough. Some people in the negative reviews might claim ""they couldn't get into the game because the combat is too difficult"", but you honestly just have to press the right button at the right times, like ""right left right left right"" with the right delay between them and bam you executed your 5-hit-combo. Not hard, in my opinion.- Platforming: you need to climb on things, jump on things, move some things around, etc etc. Think of ""Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons"" and that's pretty much how it goes, except you only move your one character.- Remix sections: There aren't too many of these in the game, but they hold important plot points, where you alter the memory of others. You'll see if you play. It's interesting. Really.---- NOW the question is, what did I mean by this game not being perfect?There were some glaring flaws in some game design elements. Literally a flaw from a game design perspective. In order to learn more of the LORE of this game, you need to find MNESISTS. Now, they wanted to make collectible secret items... and they made those be the MNESISTS. The problem is that without them, you for example won't understand what the hell the Mnemopolis is - but these items are REALLY hidden, and if you don't know where to look, looking for them can be extremely tedious. They aren't indicated well at all, they're just tiny orange boxes, hard to find, and usually you need to go on an alternate path to find them.So this is like playing in the Mass Effect universe, except you have to look for well-hidden secrets in order to learn the lore of the game, which you're supposedly interested in if you're interested in the plot. I think this was quite silly.Also, by the end of the game, the enemy versatility kinda falters, they rehash some stuff from previously instead of adding something new.In the end, it was still a great game.- PROS:Interesting story and unique settingsGood soundtrack that supports said settingOkay combat (others might disagree but they just need to get a sense of timing I guess, it really is not difficult)- CONS:Some platforming is a bit tediousThe combat can get repetitive by the end because of rehashed enemies (too much saber force)THE ITEMS THAT GIVE YOU THE LORE ARE HIDDEN COLLECTIBLES. Terrible decision, even if it kinda makes sense, but not really. Makes looking for them tedious, you might want to use a guide.The antagonists' motives just aren't very deep by the time you actually get to them. But the plot overall makes up for it.Recommended. Not at full price, but at a greater discount, definitely.			"

												Not bad, but not a milestone , unfortunatelyThis game has incredible good approaches , the visual talent and the cyberpunk -like atmosphere are awesome at times . unfortunately the story - that COULD actually have had brilliant quality -remains strangely unconnected for the most time and connects only at the end again .For me , therefore, not really recommendable game , because  the console-ish flogging and climbing orgies  bored me and can not really excite me , but thats my personal gusto..Too bad, because here an Open World would have led to a  certainly big and unforgettable (haha)  game .I bought it on sale for EUR 6 , that's fine though.

												One of my favorite games of all time! Great music, the visual effects are wonderful, great story, and some really interesting mechanics. Can be a bit tough to control at times, but in the grand scheme of things, its a great game. I can not reccomend this game enough, and as the sale is going on right now, I'm telling all of my friends to buy it right now.			"

												Great Game !!I loved the Story, intriguing and keeps you going to discover the whole plot. Stunning Visuals, not the best Graphics in 2015 but the Design of the whole futuristic City is marvelous, the Digital Universe that you go thru at some points is also very well done. The Fighting is fun, can be repetitive but you can build your own combo sequences to fit your needs and the mix of enemies requires for you to handle them in a certain way, you can't just jump in and rage. There is some very original sequences where you need to remix the memories of NPCs, this brings something completely new to the game genre. Add to the mix some puzzle elements and some Parcours and you get a good 20 hours of enjoyable gameplay.On the downside the game is very linear, one playthrough is enough unless you're a secret hunter who wants to get all the hidden items or complete all the Achievements. I would give Remember Me an 8.5/10. Easy grab for a 5-10$ sale.			"

												Great game with a fun atmosphere and an interesting story that offers a unique commentary on our social media obsession. Not especially difficult once you get the hang of things and not all that long, even with multiple play-throughs, but that's kind of my point. The atmosphere is incredible and the things this game does, it does well. Combat isn't amazing, but it is undeniably fun, and you can lose yourself in the memory sequences trying to find all the little hidden combinations. It made me want to keep playing well past being finished with the achievements.Definitely worth picking up, especially with how cheap it is now.			"

												There was a time when this game was rated ""mixed"" at best on Steam. Why, I have no idea, unless you expected something vastly different from this game.What it is:It's a linear, story driven 3rd person ""brawler"" in a pretty stylish world (New Paris of the future) with lots of little details you can gather in those levels to get a better sense of the world and its surroundings, the people living in it, the technology, etc. Most of these lore items can be found pretty easily. There are also some upgrades and what not. Not very spectacular, but functional. Same goes for the combat system, which relies on ""combos"" you unlock during the game. Sadly, this only means varying button chains of X and Y, plus A to dodge. That's pretty much it for basic combat. The strategic value of this system comes in the form of your various combat moves which either do increased damage, reduce ability cooldowns or heal you on hit with some ""linkers"" to increase those effects. You need to have strong, but also functional combos to sustain yourself and defeat your enemies. Apart from that you unlock various special moves that are sometimes required to beat certain foes. And you have a ranged attack.The enemy variety is a bit lacking. There's really just mutants, police and robots in a few different variants, but the game is also not that long that this ever becomes a real problem. The fights get progressively harder, longer and more varied, but if the game went on for another few hours, this would certainly be a problem. As it stands, it's ok.The other part of the game consists of a bit of exploring, however the levels are really linear, so not that much to do, a bit of basic platforming a la Prince of Persia (very basic) and just enjoying the story with the occasional puzzle and boss fight thrown in. As the game progresses you get more and more abilities to manipulate the environment around you. It's still all linear, but it's fun in my opinion.The last part of the game is about ""remixing"" memories, which I'd say is the weakest part of the game. It sounds great in theory, but is a) not utilized often enough and b) kind of annoying to do. Takes up too much time or you can get stuck without really knowing what to do, etc. Though mostly it's pretty straightforward. I still think it's an interesting concept. Just needs a reiteration :)Some other negative stuff: Controls are not always spot on, annoying when falling to your death. Checkpoints are sometimes placed too far apart or at annoying places. Also you cannot ""load"" any checkpoint you activated. There is an option to replay the level, but you will lose all progress and again, you can't select which checkpoint to start from. If a level takes you 1+ hour to complete that just doesn't make sense. Cutscenes cannot be skipped. Not even if you've already seen them. Biggest negative aspect of the game.Apart from that the story and characters are mature and interesting in my opinion, their motivations are understandable and the message is clear. It's one of the better stories in a video game, especially a 3rd person fighter.Please just understand that this is not a spectacle fighter. Embrace the story and artistic vision and you will love it. The protagonist kicks♥♥♥♥♥and the concept artists should make an anime series. That style works perfectly for a gritty Anime in a Ghost in the Shell style for example. Too bad. I would have loved to explore this world a bit more.			"

												“Remember Me,” takes place in 2084. You play as Nilin, a memory hunter, who is destined to bring down the corrupted Memorize Corporation. Memorize has been wiping away people’s memories and turning people into mindless pets. We the players, are tasked to fight back to restore Nilin’s memory and all the memories lost in Neo-Paris.To add, “Remember Me,” takes place in a well-designed Neo-Paris town with a lot of flare and artistic style. There are areas of high class futuristic technology and there are areas of run down corruption. Many areas are set ablaze and crawling with Leapers whom attack you in the dark. Overall, the game is driven with high-tech angst, and can be dark and disturbing. Fighting enemies in earlier levels which you may think are hard are actually easy in comparison to later levels. Also, ""Remember Me,"" has a repetitive, and head scratching combat system. In a lot areas you are fighting the same enemies. Also, some of the later bosses can be a grind to understand. Some need to be beaten up with certain powers that restore over time. This can be irritating because you are left dodging enemies to play defensively. If you are not dodging enemies you will soon face your death and if you do not do the correct combos it is harder to gain your health back. This is because you need combos to gain health and you have to dodge many enemies to avoid taking hits in which you gain your health back. All the while you have to focus on killing the main boss.""Remember Me,"" offers more than repetitive combat like being inconspicuous, leaping walls, solving puzzles but, the main focus they should focus on a future tentative, ""Remember Me,"" title is the combat system and making the story not so linear. Even with my critique, I recommend this game.			"

The only downside are the controls, they are ... kinda ... ok. but they could be better, i mean when i use a power where i have to drag something, i have to pick up my mouse like 5 times and scroll, or when climbing, it's a bit hard to clinbe when the camera won't move freely and you can't see any other prespectives than the one the devs give you...

Remember MeOverall: 8/10 - It's worth tryingKeep going if you wanna find out more! :DStory: 9/10The originality of the game is amazing, including the theme of the Memories, the Future and the Humanity; it must be your type if you're interested in such genres. Besides, I really appreciate that they put a lot of effort in designing a holistic world view for this game. You would agree with me if you check out carefully the Mnesist (Official Collectible Documents) in this game. The details contained are exhaustive enough to recount a complete story, and in the meantime they also correlate and interrelate with each other. You'll get to know everything about the things and persons you've encountered and will encounter through reading those documents, and then you'll be admiring the elaborate settings of this game. Same as what IGN says about it, AMBITIOUS IDEAS.The story is hardly defective, except that some part of the plot might seem a little bit too feigned and even ridiculous, to be honest.Actions: 4.5/10Seriously, this game is tagged Hack & Slash. While I may have to agree on that, I feel like the Blow Feedback of Remember Me is probably the worst I've seen so far. I felt that it was okay, acceptable at the start of it, but once I reached Chapter 4 or 5, it wasn't anymore. Nilin's Melee Moves felt so much like Tango Steps, in my opinion, especially in the later stage of the game when the enemies are enhanced and featured; I hardly feel that it's a combat anymore. I don't know, but that's really how I felt, and it almost became a torture for me to stick it out to Chapter 8(fin). I might have closed the game and thrown it into the ""NEVER PLAY"" Group of my library if not for that I felt like it was so coercive that I completed the game.And the design of the chains of the moves is not very successful, because in the end you'll find Triple Strike (the first chain you could use in the game) most practicable.Graphics: 7.5/10Poor texture mapping causes unnatural facial expressions and robotically stiff combat moves (that's also one of the reasons why the Blow Feedback feels flabby and impotent), even in CGs (or Real Time Renderding).Despite the flaws in character graphics, the scenery of Neo-Paris in 2084 is unquestionably beautiful. I'm not an expert and I don't know why there could be such a huge technical gap between character map and landscape map.Special Content: 10/10Everybody remembers Memory Remix in this game, the best feature of the game. It also requires a little effort to figure out the puzzle, and in the process of it, you can trigger a lot of different conversations or something like that, but in order to progress in the game, you will have to find the one and only outcome of this Memory Remix. I can't say too much lest I spit out spoilers :D but surely you'll recognize the fun.Also the game has included some stealth content, try it for yourself :D.Conclusion: 8/10 - It's worth trying.If you don't expect too much on its actions, it's definitely a good game for you; but if you really want to beat 'em up, go for Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance :D I strongly recommend this game to those who want real Hack & Slash; but I guess the most important thing about Remember Me is the exquisite story, not the invigorating combat.

												This is a hidden gem, it's a shame that more people didn't play it. I picked it up for dirt cheap on a humble bundle and was very surprised how much I enjoyed it considering the mixed reviews. The atmosphere is incredible- with a Blade Runner aesthetic to everything. Cities feel alive, and are full of NPC's to interact with. Animations are fluid and the sound design is phenomenal. The graphics hold up surprisingly well and natively support super sampling in the graphics options. It's got one of the most unique and interesting game play mechanics I've seen in any game- specifically, there are portions of the game where you're hacking into peoples brains to change their memories of events that have already happened- Inception style, these parts are pretty amazing. The story was interesting enough for me to see all the way through. Highly recommended.			"

IntroductionRemember Me is a third person, action game which combines slick combat with an engaging storyline for a mostly linear game. Its unique style, protagonist and features are sure to leave you impressed with very few errors anywhere in sight.GameplayProtagonistRemember me puts you in charge of a woman named Nillin who as you discover very early on, is a memory hunter; one of the best. However, now you've lost your memory, and you're on the path to getting it back. It's not often that we see a dark skinned, female protagonist so that's a welcome aspect to the game. Nillin is a determined fighter who doesn't seem to care who she's going up against and takes matters into her own hands, literally. As she has lost her memory, you as the player discover things about her at the very same rate that she does; it's often surreal. One thing is for sure, Nillin is a real gem in gaming.StoryThe year is 2084 in a futuristic paris called Neo-paris, and you wake up in the middle of a lab after your memory has been wiped...mostly. You find yourself heading down a path to a total wipe until some unknown man named Edge contacts you via your built in comms; Sensen. He warns you of the danger of a complete memory erasal, and offers you one last chance at redemption; run and don't look back.Remember Me's story is brilliant and captivating, and though a few things may be unclear as you progress, you realize that the writers draw a parallel line between your understanding of the story and Nillin's memory. Early on the story was mostly decent, but once I hit around the mid-point, I literally couldn't put this game down. Your gameplay mostly revolves around platforming, fighting and solving various puzzles that may come your way. The platforming was decent, and the in-game navigation was done in such a way that it felt natural though future tech seemingly made things easier. One thing I didn't quite like was the lack of an open world. I wanted to know more about the future environment, it felt like I was forced to simply progress to each new area, sometimes being totally locked off from previous areas each time. It's a given with linear storylines, but I'm so used to open worlds now that locked paths & such are somewhat of a negative to me. This game would do pretty well with an open-world.CombatCombat in this game is fairly well done. There are two buttons used for melee combat, and later on you get the option of using ranged combat as well. Fighting revolves around chaining together combos; think of Batman Arkham series. If you have the combo lab DLC (recommended), you can change around your combos to include all kinds of cool moves which excel in various scenarios. Each combo has a fixed order in which you press a combination of X or Y buttons (for a controller). This helps you to memorize (heh) combos which can be quite invaluable when facing lots of enemies at once. Editing these combos was quite fun as I got to personalize my combos to include all kinds of various punching and kicking combos. Some of these were great finishers, some for AoE damage (like a whirlwind kick), and some were simply basic punches and kicks used to chain it all together.There were a few interesting mechanics involved. Firstly, you had access to some special abilities (I won't reveal them all). For example, Sensen fury would disable your regular combos, and turn you into one superpowered, kung-fu master or something like that anyway...You'd be able for a short while, to punch and kick to your heart's content. Cooldowns on these abilities are pretty long, but that's where the second mechanic came in; cooldown reduction. There were certain types of sensen (I think?) that you could equip in the combo lab which would allow you to reduce the cooldown on your abilities. This made it so you could end up using your abilties multiple times per fight even though they were on such a long cooldown. There was also a regeneration sensen which allowed you to heal on hit, quite useful and saved me a bunch in fights, and there were multiplier sensens which enhanced the effect of previous sensens in a combo (enabling you to reduce cooldowns by well over 100 seconds when triggered.Combat was overall pretty simple, for an experienced gamer, but there were lots of moments that forced me to learn how to adapt and change my combos around in order to even survive. It was overall quite satisfying and in my opinion, is better than arkham city's combat in many ways, though you did not have any counter-attack options.Remixing memories was fun, as you could totally changed how someone remembered an event, though it did not actually change the past; realistic and fun. This could totally change their opinion on practically anything. I disliked the fact that we only had one set way of accomplishing these tasks, as it felt like I was restricted to getting one specific combination of memory glitches each remix.AudioThe music in this game was really good. There was definitely a futuristic vybe tied into all of the soundtracks, as well as some upbeat tracks used for combat. Speaking of which, the audio made combat that much more fun, as the music increased in volume as you chained together combos, and reduced in volume and complexity when you got hit. It was a very unique and interesting feature, one that should be included in a lot more games of this category. Each hit on enemies felt quite satisfying as the sounds for hit enemies resounded in your ears. Tougher foes were noticably more resistant visually and the sounds were toned down for them to emphasize this effect. The soundtrack, while not quite my style, was pretty good. The sound design team definitely deserves props for their work, as good or bad audio can make or break a game respectively. VisualsThe visuals for this game were amazing. The city of neo-paris looked amazing, as did the main protagonist. From the floating text over store-fronts to breathtaking interior designs, this game delivered. At the other end of the spectrum, the dark, dirty, infested underground sections felt exactly like described and you couldn't help but feel pity for anyone who had to live in the slums. Visuals were top-notch here, no complaints.AestheticsThe game had a unique feel right through. The future was filled with so much interesting technology, it made you want to exist in this world; it made you immersed though it was a third-person, linear game. Floating text over key objects and storefronts, robots doing various household tasks, clean cities and dirty slums, it all felt so real (if not a bit ambitious for 2084 heh). This is one world I'd love to see expanded upon in a sequel as it deserves to be explored some more.Drawbacks/NegativesEvery game isn't without its flaws, and Remember Me had a few. Platforming wasn't always as accurate as it was portrayed. There were definitely a few moments where I jumped right for a ledge, only to fall straight to my doom where I should have definitely grabbed on. As mentioned before, I felt like the world was just too closed off, and sometimes it felt empty (save for your average household robot which you couldn't talk to). Definitely would do well with more free interactions and less time forcibly being sent on missions. The combat lacked a counter-attack mechanic, though this may be more realistic than anything else. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I'd just assumed that the combat would have included some counter mechanic.SummaryI'm going to avoid a simple pros & cons section.The game was really good for an entry into a potential series. The story itself could very much continue based on the ending, and this is one city I'd definitely love to see more of. Conclusion: 8.5/10 worth a buy.			"

												Remember Me is an interesting story based around a classic SF premise; unfortunately, the gameplay is wretched. The demo I'd played led me to believe that I'd be spending most of my time going into people's memories and changing them, but across 8 chapters, you only get to do so 4 times. The bulk of the game is spent running around and fighting.While navigating the landscape's numerous ledges, ladders and landings is fun, the game constantly stops you for overly-long combat sequences; in a game where your main character is so mobile, it would have been nice to have the option to avoid some of the combats by taking alternate routes. The combat is theoretically made easier by the inclusion of customizable attack combos, but the timing on them is so fiddly that using any but the simplest one is extremely iffy; often you'll get three hits into a combo before the engine decides that you were trying to perform an entirely different combo and starts you over. There are also special abilities that allow you to deal massive damage, stun enemies, perform instant kills, or turn certain types of enemies against the rest, but using them requires you to perform combos to power up your special meter. This gets more aggravating later on when you encounter enemies that damage you when you attack them; you can instant-kill them with the aforementioned special move, but if you encounter multiples of this enemy, you'll have to take a lot of damage while hitting them to build up your meter and reduce your cooldown timers. Boss fights last an unforgivably long time, requiring you to fight off wave after wave of basic enemies so you can use your special move and actually attack the boss. By the time I'd reached the final boss fight, I'd had enough of the combat and decided to watch the ending on Youtube instead, which I'd recommend over playing the game.I will give Remember Me credit for one thing, though: It's nice to see a game starring a biracial character, though I didn't realize she was one until around 2/3 through the story.

												TLDR: Sort of okay game that takes itself too seriously. Linearity and repeitive combat don't help either.This is one of those games that can't decide wether it wants to be a game or a movie. It's a shame I have to give this a no too because there's some legitamately good things about this game. Sadly my reviews are more along the lines of ""is it worth it"" so sadly the answer is no. At least not at full price. Let's start with the good. The voice acting is fantastic. With better writing and more interesting characters it could have even be notable. Sadly though it's too good for this game. The story is your usual copypaste sci-fi dystopia you've seen a thousand times before, except this one takes itself really seriously so you just feel like skipping it. This wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't the main focus of the game. It's also incredibly linear. Maybe not to the point of FFXIII, but it's still enough to feel more like an interactive movie than a video game. Combat is uninspired and feels like a crappy version of Batman Arkham combat. You can customize combos to get back health or charge power-ups, but chances are you press the wrong button at the wrong time. You end up getting frustated and use the short combo 95% of the time. Replayability if any comes from collectables that increase your health and powerups. However going to previous chapters to get these feel more like a chore since each chapter (there's about 8 or 9 minus a prolougue) is about an hour or more long. That does however give you a chance to enjoy the scenery which is fantastic. Neo-Paris looks gorgeous even at lowest graphical settings. You can even unlock concept art which is a plus. Music is forgettable but then again what isn't forgettable about this game?Length: 10 hoursShould you buy this: If you're looking for a good game you're going to be disappointed. If you're looking for a game to make fun of on YouTube for how seriously it takes itself you've got a winner.Worth: $5			"

												----tl;drGraphics/Art: 10Sound/Voices: 9Gameplay/Controls: 8Story: 10OVERALL: 9----This is going to be long, but I feel it really deserves it.After playing the first chapter, which was a prologue, you immediately get hooked. The universe is hard to describe, but if I had to, then the closest I can put it is Assassin's Creed 2 for the ledges and scaling buildings with European construction, mixed in with Deus Ex: Human Revolution futuristic style and technology. The writers have created a beautiful and rich tapestry and history about the new world in the future. Essentially, after the ice caps started to melt, the oceans rose, and the cities and countries that couldn't handle the changes began to collapse, governments etc. People started to move about on boats as climate migrants. Neo-Paris was one of the cities that did well.At some point, a man created the Sensen, linking your memories to the cloud, allowing yourself to upload your memories, download others for a price (fancy a holiday? buy one! also sex movies as well with you as the star), and even delete memories that are too painful. This and lots of little titbits can be seen in the numerous collectables which shed more light on the history of the world, the people, and the technology. These are all optional and aren't needed to further your abilities. There are two others which do help you though SAT patches, get five of them and your increase your maximum health by one, and the same with Focus boost, to increase a bar for your super powers.The Sensen also acts as augmented reality, allowing you to see menus of nearby café's, bin collection time, and more usefully, ledges and pipes you can jump onto. The game subtly helps you with many of these prompts, like seeing a fire, and being helpfully told it's 972C, or the floor is electrocuted. This is why I love the universe, since it is nearly here, although it isn't built into our bodies yet.And so, we start the game with Nilin, our female protagonist, currently undergoing a memory wipe. Why? We don't know, not yet. This is the same with most games where you don't know what you're doing at first, but in this case it is justified, and you need to help find your own memories as to what the hell is going on here.The game handily walks you through the controls bit by bit. A third person game, you essentially fight using combos. Inside each combo, you put in a Pressen, basically, a normal attack with something else in it, each Pressen is either the X or Y button. Power, to give you that extra oomph to your punches and kicks; regeneration, restores a bit of your health each time it connects; cooldown, reduces the time it takes for your super powers to recharge; and finally chain, which increases the Pressen just before it greatly.There are four combos in the game, which are unlocked normally during the game, the longer the combo the more powerful the effects of the Pressens towards the end. Just for your reference, I played with an Xbox 360 Windows gamepad, and it worked very well.People have criticised the combat, yes, it is a little repetitive with little customisation to make your own combos, but it was fluid enough that the chaotic battles with eight enemies sometimes makes you think. Prompts show you when to dodge an attack and then continue the combo as if you never left it. The only annoyance is one flying enemy, which makes two sound when firing, and the second one is where you have to dodge, not the first, and I kept getting caught out by that.Later you get the Spammer, a cannon on your arm which fires 'data' at people, then a more powerful version to break structures. Your five super moves are also handy and are unlocked at specific points in the game. I won't go into detail here, but they help in your ability to fight the enemy.Now, the game itself, how does it play? As I said I used a gamepad, and it was fine for me. Camera issues were few and far between, like a column getting in the way of seeing who you're kicking or cramped locations. As you move through the game, the comparison to Assassin's Creed 2 vanishes, there is no freedom of movement throughout the city. So what? With a city this large, it would take so long to visit everything, and the story doesn't need it anyway. You have set goals, and you go through the slums to the posh district, and then onwards to prison and so on. There are some nook and crannies that hide away those power-ups and the collectables. I thought I was good at finding them, but I missed a few in my first run. Linear as it is, it can get confusing, but the Sensen helpfully shows you the way to go with the ledges and jumps.I played on hardest difficulty, and found myself dying, a lot. Boss fights are tough, and for good reason, and in some battles, the opponents can overwhelm you, but with good timing on the dodge button (which makes you invulnerable to any damage during the motion), you can beat them. It is highly satisfying when you beat back over a dozen foes with your combos.Music is mostly techno, trance house, thumping beats and so on during combat, and the voice acting is well done, and not too hammy (except for one or two characters, who were in fact hammy themselves).The story is, to be honest, gripping. You start off with no memories, then you find out you’re a memory hunter, who can even remix other people's memories. Yes, you do get to do this in the story, though only four times. These are like watching a video, then changing subtle things in them to get a different outcome. It's fun to play through them all to get the different endings and so on, and overall it is a lovely thing to watch. However, to me, these were the major points when I felt very sad, because of the story. You are literally changing what they remembered, when in reality it was completely different. When you think about it more, that is horrifying. Each remix reveals more to the plot, and there are some great twists in the story, which overall I class as one of the top in any game I've played.Overall, a great single player game, somewhat basic combat but still satisfying, platforming is great for its purposes, beautiful environments and a great world to visit.

Enjoy the very excellent Phillip K♥♥♥♥♥♥reminiscent distopia of New Paris along with an excellent emotionally charged story of memory manipulations and outcomes.   Beautiful art direction accompanies scenes where you remix someone's memory by rewinding crucial scenes and affecting varying outcomes.  The fight system is fluid and the combos are customizable in an innovative fashion.  The linearity is a worthy trade for the telling of a gripping story.			"

												Ive finished this game on my Xbox , and i would reccomend it to anyone , at full price or on sale , the story is rich with interesting things , the setting is unique , the combat is a bit iffy but it doesnt differ that much from other popular games (imagine the combat in witcher 3 without the spells and potions ). In my opinion one of the best games ever made. But then i am a sucker for unique stories , and i havent come across one similar to this before.			"

												I appreciate how much Remember Me tries to innovate with some really neat stuff I haven't seen in other games, but for everything it offers it falls short somewhere else. The world is beautiful and the story is intriguing, but it can't take you passed the average gameplay at it's core. The fact I finished it says something although I am quite forgiving when it comes to games that have an interesting world, you on the other hand may not. I am conflicted about recommending, but since I have no option for middle ground I will because it's quite cheap at the moment.			"

												A QTE-ridden game. I cannot reccommend it unless you like QTEs, I personally loathe them. I fought the boss, what's the point of ""press X to-not-die"" except for placing it in weird corners so that the player does not read it and dies? (oh, and has to start the battle all over again, because obviously saving happens only at savepoints).The story looks good, but the game mechanics are too annoying.EDIT:I forgot the camera movement. K+M or Pad won't make a difference, the camera movement will get in the way. You cannot aim unless the target is near the center of the screen and often you have to aim quickly while fighting. And while you fight 90% of the time your target won't be on screen, meaning that you have to turn around the camera to aim (and in the meanwhile you'll get attacked, so forget about completing the objective)			"

												""Remember Me"" is a linear third-person action platformer that plays with your mind -- literally -- that could have stood out above others of its genre, but its flaws keep it from shining like it could and should have.Highly enjoyable none the less, ""Remember Me"" offers an intriguing sci-fi story with kick-@ss characters, a gorgeous neon Paris and unique gameplay features.+ Nilin is one though kitty-cat.+ Unique gameplay mechanics that focusses on one's memory.+ Great character designs.+ Plenty of collectable background info.+ Sci-Fi Neo Paris is a wonderful place.+ Intriguing movie-quality storyline.+ You can put together your own combo that will either heal you, speed up your cooldown or deal extra damage...- ... but this very same mechanic could easily be forgotten.- Platforming and fighting can feel very stiff.- Little content after the single player.- Sometimes a bit too linear, as Paris begs you to explore it.Final verdict: if you're not 100% sure about this game yet, ask yourself what you'd like from this game and then consider if it can offer you exactly that. I'd you like linear action games -- like myself -- I would most definately recommend it. 7.5/10!			"

Without giving away spoilers, this game was emotional from the very beginning to the very end. It is truly more than a video game; it's a work of art!Favorite aspects:- Atmospheric- Great soundtrack (Listen carefully to the combat music, it gives eargasms)- Story rich- Strong female protagonist (Last but certainly not least)I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who loves art or just a fun game to play! 10/10 would play again!

Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of HearingOverall Rating: 7/10Gameplay Rating: 8/10Accessibility Rating: 5/10NotesOverall rating is a combination of the gameplay (mechanics and story) and accessibility (how the game includes deaf/hoh gamers).  If you disagree with my take on the game or if something is factually incorrect, please leave a comment below!Game OverviewRemember Me (RM) is a linear scifi action game from DONTNOD (Life is Strange).Gameplay MechanicsThe game's outstanding combat system and general gameplay and story are marred slightly by an occasionally difficult camera and a handful of frustrating scenes, but these are minor.  Whereas I originally thought that the somewhat limited combat system would get redundant, it has instead been quite entertaining as combo chains are added and expanded well into the game.Further, the puzzles in the game are well made with a balance between being easy and still slightly challenging, and the memory remixing is a very unique method of story progression and puzzle solving.StorylineWith an interesting storyline in a dystopian futuristic Neo-Paris, RM takes you on an adventure filled with memories, both real and fake, as you reclaim Nilin's memories and unravel the story.  This game's story is entertaining from the first chapter throughout, though some of the dialogue is over the top and expository.You examine the story both through regular gameplay and through memory remixing, which is where you enter someone's memories and adjust key aspects of them to achieve the results you want.RatingGameplay (story and mechanics) rating is 8/10.  Mechanical issues are enough to detract from the overall gameplay rating with camera and motion control problems at key times.  The story is outstanding, though, once you get past some moments of questionable writing.Accessibility OverviewGame OptionsGenerally, the opening game menus are best controlled with keyboard or gamepad.  Mouse controls on these menus works, but is difficult.- Subtitles- Individual controls for master volume, music, voices, and sound effects.Deaf/HOHDeaf/HOH gamers may miss large portions of the story due to small, difficult-to-read subtitles.  Further, a lot of flavor text (random talking, chatter, etc) is not subtitled.  I would recommend enjoying the game and replaying or watching a video of the gameplay to pick up missed plot/storyline information.Pros:- Subtitles exist!- All vital gameplay information (mechanics, some storyline) are conveyed via on screen dialogsCons:- Subtitles DO NOT indicate who is talking/are not color-coded- Subtitles are very small (possibly scaling issue with resolution), have no background, and are over a busy background, making them difficult to read- Subtitles during combat are easily missed, but do not seem to be significant- Background talking IS NOT subtitledNotes:- This is a single-player game; no chatting.MobilityGamers with mobility issues may have problems with this game.  Most common controls for the game use WASD movement, space for jump, shift key for aiming, and e for use.  These can be changed.Pros:- Keys can be rebound to suit your capabilities.Cons:- There are Quick Time Events (QTE) in game that require pressing certain buttons within a limited amount of time.- There is only one key bind slot per action.Notes:- Casual difficulty mode still has QTEs.Accessibility RatingAccessibility rating is 5/10 for the issues above.  Although there are challenges with this game, it is worth checking out.  Its accessibility issues do not outweigh the benefit of the experience.---Visit Games Reviews for the Deaf/HoHhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/gamereviewsforthedeaf "

												Remember Me is a game that is very easy to misunderstand.It dares to break many cliches about how a game should be like: it has no free roaming (its very linear), it has no stealth (oh the gasp), combat requires thinking and skill and thats a big problem since most players want either button mashing or pattern memorizing, none of that here. No patterns to learn since every combat will be different even when you repeat it a lot of times, and button mashing results in fast death and frustration.So what is Remember Me all about?Well, its a fast paced and spectacular roller coaster action game with a very good story and gorgeous stylish visuals.There is also more to this game than meets the eye.The story is not only good, its also deep on a philosophical level if you care for this kind of stuff, and it does something that no other videogame dared to do for many years, namely social critique.I have never seen a game taking so many stabs at the problems of our society and culture as this game did. I bow down with respect in front of the person(s) who wrote the story for this game.The combat is exceptional. It can be confusing and frustrating at first, but once you figure things out, it offers a great choice of options that you can use in inventive ways....first playthrough on errorist difficulty i was more concerned about the story so i neglected the combat, but second playthrough on hard difficulty is where the combat really shined for me. It offered a lot of freedom of choice, it forced me to understand and use the combo system properly, and it offered easy ways out of difficult situations if used properly.... but i strongly recommend to NOT play on hard on your first playthrough, ignore this advice at your own risk.Your enjoyment of this game will depend on whether or not you are open to something different, if you are able to accept and enjoy a linear game with an unusual combat system.Looking at reviews, most negative comments are about game being linear and about the combat...there is nothing wrong with a linear game when its done right (and this one is) and the combat is great if you make the effort to get into it.My only regret is that i bought this game on discount, i should have bought it full price because its more than worth it.

												I'm about halfway through Remember Me, on the hardest difficulty setting. I'm loving it.The game is set in the year 2084, in a futuristic version of Paris called Neo-Paris. A corporation named ""Memorize"" has invented a new brain implant called SENSEN which allows a big majority of the population to upload and share their memories, as well as grant the ability to remove unhappy memories. Because of this, Memorize has control over the population and basically become a surveillance entity. Because of this, a small group of rebels named ""The Errorists"" formed, strung on bringing down Memorize. The invention of the Sensen has also resulted in the creation of ""Leapers"". Leapers are memory addicted humans who have mutated into a creepy looking, sewer dwelling creature due to their SENSEN degrading from too many memories being absorbed (very bioshock/splicer-y).The combat is pretty sweet. You are able to create your own combos with the moves you have unlocked. These moves, when used in a combo, grant you things like cooldown reduction, healing, and increased damage. You are also granted abilities that function like a ""special move"". Some of these special moves need to be used to defeat certain enemies that have shields, or are invisible.If you picked this up during the steam sale, you lucked out. It's definitely worth the buy.I've read a lot of reviews and this seems to be a love/hate game. So far, I'm on the ""love"" side :)			"

												Action-adventure game Remember Me presents you with a scifi world some half a century into the future, with the augmented virtual reality at its core. Neo-Paris is the focus of actions: the once-great city has been rebuilt after a civil war caused by the catastrofic climate change. As I like scifi, this cosmos is very cool indeed, and effort has been used to make it believable.In the game, you're Nilin, basically a young woman with master kung-fu skills. You are a former rebel suffering from amnesia caused by her captors and memory altering technology. Before being totally incapacitated, you are suddenly saved by a mysterious figure, Edge. You quickly proceed to become his pawn. Following his instructions, you find stuff about yourself and your past life, as well as the evil corporation you're destined to take down. Along the way you see sights of Neo-Paris: very visual, the game has fine graphics and I even spent several moments just watching some scenes because I thought they were beautiful.Very linear, the game lacks all choice following Nilin's story. Granted, she feels lost, the only lead to her memory being Edge. Story advances quickly and all characters are (in my opinion) quite realistic and thankfully there are no comedy relief characters, as the theme is serious and considers ethics of basically a *insert social media site* with access to your true memories.The emphasis is more on action, putting you against both humans and robots. Conveniently, authorities are not allowed to use firearms so you can instead show them your kung fu. This is done by comboing punches and kicks and occasional evasive maneuver. Once you get the hang of it, it's quite easy as well (playing on the highest difficulty setting). It's not too special, but there's not too much of it either. Every level ends with a special boss fight.The most interesting mechanic is remixing memories: at predestined points you get to invade people's memories and change them to suit your objective. There are only few cases like this but they are always super-important for the story. EDIT: I nominated Remember Me for Nov 2016 ""The “Game Within A Game” Award"" for this feature.All in all, the game took me 15 hours to finish the story, then another 15 hours to acquire the rest of the achievements, avoiding using guides until the very end. A decent action-adventure, I'd advice getting it on 50% discount.			"

I Really Liked the memory resynchs probably my favorite part, and a bit of old school platforming/problem solving.Overall 9/10 Surprise hit for me, deserved much better than it got on release its up there with tombraider for me as playability goes and how much i enjoyed it, felt like i was playing an epic AAA production movie with quality sound and gorgeous graphics (Everything Maxxed on a 550Ti) get it on sale if you like this style of game, some hate it but why i cant tell as i enjoyed every minute.

												A hugely underrated game, this one is a good indication of why a game's worth should not be reduced to a single [metacritic] number. This game tells a story. A story about a distopia where memories are commodity for desperate junkies, and the rich. It's full of references and quotations from famous literary writers and philosophers (from Balzac to Simone de Beauvoir). This narrative is also very well executed, and enriched with awesome graphics and an extremely fun combat system.So why the low general score? The only negative issues I've seen target the game's linearity and hance the lack of replayability caused by it. I guess people judge games by their value of being potentially the only game to play for the rest of their lives, nowadays. Bugs are close to nonexistent - or too minor to take any notice.If you're into the concept of memories - and a good distopic narrative that tells about it in an artistic manner sounds intriguing, this game is for you.

Now, I don't like it in here is the poor camera angles. Was playing this at my mouse and keyboard and the angles where a little bit a pain for me, but when I plugged my controller, it seems better and that's good. The repetitive combat and the lack of fluidity in Nilin is ugh.. Every game has a cutscene and you can choose whether to watch it or skip it, but in here, you have no choice to skip it and that is bad. At first, my view at this game is ""Meh. It's a good game but not that great."" But as I played through it, it slightly changed my mind. I liked the story. 7/10.			"

I Really Liked the memory resynchs probably my favorite part, and a bit of old school platforming/problem solving.Overall 9/10 Surprise hit for me, deserved much better than it got on release its up there with tombraider for me as playability goes and how much i enjoyed it, felt like i was playing an epic AAA production movie with quality sound and gorgeous graphics (Everything Maxxed on a 550Ti) get it on sale if you like this style of game, some hate it but why i cant tell as i enjoyed every minute.

												Action-adventure game Remember Me presents you with a scifi world some half a century into the future, with the augmented virtual reality at its core. Neo-Paris is the focus of actions: the once-great city has been rebuilt after a civil war caused by the catastrofic climate change. As I like scifi, this cosmos is very cool indeed, and effort has been used to make it believable.In the game, you're Nilin, basically a young woman with master kung-fu skills. You are a former rebel suffering from amnesia caused by her captors and memory altering technology. Before being totally incapacitated, you are suddenly saved by a mysterious figure, Edge. You quickly proceed to become his pawn. Following his instructions, you find stuff about yourself and your past life, as well as the evil corporation you're destined to take down. Along the way you see sights of Neo-Paris: very visual, the game has fine graphics and I even spent several moments just watching some scenes because I thought they were beautiful.Very linear, the game lacks all choice following Nilin's story. Granted, she feels lost, the only lead to her memory being Edge. Story advances quickly and all characters are (in my opinion) quite realistic and thankfully there are no comedy relief characters, as the theme is serious and considers ethics of basically a *insert social media site* with access to your true memories.The emphasis is more on action, putting you against both humans and robots. Conveniently, authorities are not allowed to use firearms so you can instead show them your kung fu. This is done by comboing punches and kicks and occasional evasive maneuver. Once you get the hang of it, it's quite easy as well (playing on the highest difficulty setting). It's not too special, but there's not too much of it either. Every level ends with a special boss fight.The most interesting mechanic is remixing memories: at predestined points you get to invade people's memories and change them to suit your objective. There are only few cases like this but they are always super-important for the story. EDIT: I nominated Remember Me for Nov 2016 ""The “Game Within A Game” Award"" for this feature.All in all, the game took me 15 hours to finish the story, then another 15 hours to acquire the rest of the achievements, avoiding using guides until the very end. A decent action-adventure, I'd advice getting it on 50% discount.			"

												Nice not-so-common cyberpunk setting, a decent storyline, stunning visuals and amazing soundtrack on one hand.Two button combat, dull platforming and boring boss fights on other. Still, I'd say ""yes"" if you can bear with boring mechanics since the first mentioned part is trully amazing. This game might've actually been better off as a movie. :D			"

												Give a Meta Rating of 55.If it`s on sale:Take a look for yourself if you like futuristic stories like Minority Report, Total Recall, Matrix or I Robot.The design is actually good - the gameplay is not. The result is almost just a screensaver.Corridor, mob mashing, more corridors, cinematic, traverse left then right ... fighting the camera ...this works for the first 2 levels, only over time the FUN gets lost down the road.When the gameplay would be as good as the ""look"" of this game it would be awesome.( Why you can´t jump a single box on your own still escapes me - well, follow the orange arrow ... ) While this is common procedure during the intro/tutorial part of a game ( following the orange arrow ... ),  too linear is the progression and the fights start to end in simple button mashing. ( Even bought the DLC to get more fun out of this - it did not help ) Running from cinematic to cinematic i got gradually bored and was happy once it was over.Edit: The story has it´s moments only after 10 hours of game time ( including trying to find gameplay hiding somewhere and re-playing 5-6 levels ) this game is over.( Nasty on re-playing a level is that you go over and over through the cinematics again and again without being able to skip ... don´t have to tell you how old this can get  )Fights ""can"" be fun. Memory Re-mixing is the most ""memorable"" feature in this game.Combo creation is a good idea. Then, ideas start for fall short.The Devs deserve an ear bashing for not using a great idea to full extend. They spend obviously quite some time on some details, only the gameplay got left behind.Animations have for the most part good blending and as result look smooth which gives this game a good ""look"" and ""visual feel"". It just does not leave the ""screensaver effect"" to include a smooth intuitive gameplay that makes use of the ""existing"" environment to have fun with the same.They just don´t let you.In the end it leaves ... not much behind. Only a feeling of emptiness.While romancing the thoughts of what this game could be.As a gamer, i want games to play and not to look at.			"

												Remember Me is an odd duck of a game. It's a mix of ideas all thrown into a pot, some of which don't pan out and others that turn out really, really good.First and foremost: don't buy this game at full price. It's entertaining, but it is by no means worth the $50 base they are still trying to charge. However, it is one of those games that does get exponentially better the lower it gets, and I found it to be a very solid $10-$12 mid-range title. It doesn't go on sale very often, either, so get it when it gets down to that range.The actual gameplay itself is a bit of trial-and-error. The combat follows the now-standard Batman and Sleeping Dogs formula with the twist of being able to create your own combo systems. It's not as fleshed out as I would like, and the controls are not as tight as others with the system. However, being able to reset timers or heal yourself via punching is a nice addition.Some of the cooler segments involve rearranging memories, in which you are placed into a scene and must make small changes to it that greatly affect the outcome (i.e. make a doctor kill a patient instead of curing him by messing with the hospital room, etc). The only downside is that the system is used very infrequently, with only two or so such scenes in the first several episodes. Again, a lot of cool ideas but none of them fleshed out much.What really makes the game, though, is the story and atmosphere. The game is absolutely gorgeous, and in the absence of good Cyberpunk games, it really does stand out. Nilin is a great character, and the city is breathaking on systems playing the High settings. I found myself actively trying to find the little Journal Mnesists things so that I could learn about the world you play through. They did a great job of building a futuristic Paris. I wish it was not such a linear game (especially for one that promotes the exploration aspects of it), but what paths we are set on really demand a lot of admiration.It's not a perfect game, by any means, and the half-hearted attempts at some of the gameplay gimmicks keep it from being a true AAA title. That said, however, it really is a very unique and mostly fun game that will likely leave you entertained, if for no other reason than the story, visuals, and grand locations. It's a game with a ton of ambition behind it that fell just short of being fantastic, and it could warrant a sequel to tweak or expand what it does right. Well worth a steep sale price, but avoid at retail.			"

												Pros :-Satisfying combat-Awesome theme music (10/10)-Engaging Story-line-Memorable characters-Really well made boss fightsCons :-Controls feel not responsive at times-Game seems a little bit easy even on the hardest difficulty-Game benefits from more Combat encounters-Delete the current ending and write one that fits the atmosphere of the gameVerdict 7.5/10You don't remembering anything and the story unfold as you progress . Music hype you up as you try to combo your way through hords of enemies or some finiky ones. Well made atmposphere will suck you in and make you care. I like how the story is not black and white like most games, and it starts from grey and goes back and forth as you discover more pieces of story.Combat is fun I would have liked a more customizable combos or more types of enemies to spice things up a little more, but the game doesn't fail to deliver on that front.Boss fights are another really powerful and enjoyable aspect of the game, each one is unique, fun and memorable. Even though I did some of them multiple times, I enjoyed each replay too.This is not a great game and has some flaws, most games do, some are even personal and just how I feel, but If you value a good story and action, I recommend giving it a shot.P.s. Game devs please don't hide the lore inside the game. I understand I have to explore the wrold, and It makes sense with some aspects like focus and SAT patches, but It really doesn't with the lore. Put it some place I stumble upon it naturally and I read it and enjoy it.			"

												I don't like Remember Me.*Summary/Preface/TL:DR*I usually give a somewhat in depth review about games I play, but I just don't feel like it. Instead, I will highlight bullet points of what I liked and don't like. This became longer than I planned due to my writing style though.  Overall, I don't recommend it, but it has favorable aspects and going by the helpful reviews on the store page as of this writing, the average mainsteam gamer will probably be ok with this as long as they are aware that this is an extremely linear spectacle fighter with irritating combat, but a unique and interesting world, story, character and occasional use of ""memory remixing"". If the world interests you, but you can't be bothered with the gameplay, just watch some videos about the story.Likes:-Setting: A futuristic Paris in a world where people can erase, replace or alter unwanted memories. Neo-Paris looks like Mirrors' Edge mixed with Assassins' Creed.-Asthetic: I'm a sucker for cyberpunk and ""high techy"" looking games, and I like the look of the futuristic setting with bright lights and holograms. I don't know why ""SenSens"" on people necks have all these weird shapes though.-Main Character: Mostly for the fact that it's not a white male. I didn't finish the game to be bothered whether I like her as a character overall. I'm just glad to see a female, and definitely one of color.-Memory remixing: This is possibly the main hook of the game, and the most intensive puzzles of the game. I love the idea of messing with people's memories, even though you aren't actually changing what happened. It's like changing the past in a time-travel game, but without actual time travel and confusing paradoxes and conflicts.Dislikes- Combat: Oh, the combat. It has the impression of something awesome with customizable combos including unique mechanics of restoring your health and reducing cooldowns of your special moves with various attack animations, but it isn't fun to fight at all. The game feels like it wants to be Batman Arkham plus God Hand, but the free-flow is nowhere close to as smooth, responsive, and intelligent as Arkham nor is as deeply customizable and rewarding as God Hand.Long combat strings are constantly canceled out due to the need to dodge enemy attacks and while that makes for a more realistic/reasonable combat scenario, it negates the usefulness of longer combos. You technically have the ability to maintain your combo string - but it was never reliable to me. If I dodged completely out of the way of an enemy to an empty spot, then my combo was canceled. If I did a leapfrog dodge over an enemy, then it might decide to remember my combo. This unreliability in an action game focused on combos is inexcusable, and forced me to use the shorter combo strings. Worse, most enemies I could easily beat into a corner by spamming the main attack. I've spammed 'X"" more in this game than I did in Dynasty Warriors.-Extremely Linear level design: This is common for games of this type in the past generation, but it is beyond banal to constantly walk forward as if you are playing a Call of Duty campaign. Platforming is thrown in to add a sense of scale, movement and verticality, but there is little skill involved as you follow inexplicably placed markers telling you where to jump and you are ALWAYS going down a singular, set path. ""Thank goodness for all these conveniently placed ledges"", the main character probably thought.-Overall ""Hold your hand"" game Design: When new combat mechanics are introduced, the game forces you to stop what you are doing IN THE MIDDLE OF COMBAT to show you a mechanic in a menu. When you get an unlock, the unlock message stays on your screen until you press select to view the unlock in the Combo Lab. A hint system which I don't think can be turned off, though some hints are manually activated. A ""You always go forward"" level design. Hand holding jump markers in platforming - I'd honestly rather let the game do it for me so I can go through the game faster at this point. Games like Prince of Persia: Sands of Time and early Tomb Raiders had linear, but semi-skilled based platforming segments. Platforming in RM is just a more ""interesting"" way to  walk down the pre-determined path. Of course, like most extremely linear games from the past generation, once you go past a certain point in the level, you can't go back ,which sucks if you missed something from earlier in the level. ""Reload last checkpoint""? Well, the checkpoint starts right after the point of no return. If you're really desperate, you can exit to the main menu and restart the episode, which leads me to.-God forsaken unskippable cutscenes: WHY OH GOD WHY DO GAME DEVELOPERS INSIST ON FORCING THEIR CUTSCENES ON YOU?! Admittedly, the story/plot/setting are the best part of this game, so you probably want to know what is going on. But if you want to skip something you've already seen or just don't care and want to play, too bad for you. You MUST sit through a cutscene. Did you die in a battle preceded by a cutscene? Well, you have to watch it again before you start the battle over again. Oh, and it has that beloved ""slow walking while talking cutscene"" Bulls*** that so many AAA action games insist on having.-Insecure Security: Important locations are protected by flying drones that immediately kill you the moment you step in their sight range....which is just a 10 meter circle under the robot. God forbid somebody exploits their patrol pattern. Maybe there are cameras and security teams to watch over blind spots? BAH! Who needs that?! Maybe the working robots can act as cameras? Not they just sit there, not even sending a silent alarm to their owners - WE HAVE SILENT ALARM BUTTONS NOW!I nearly quit the game for good once I had to solve a riddle which would seem easy, but confusing due to its implementation (a PIN number riddle) and then I finally had it when I completed an annoying boss battle, just to be able to not finish it due to a bug where I think an enemy got stuck behind a wall. I'm not sure what happened, but my player was stuck in combat animation and I couldn't open the door out.			"

												Before I say anything else, I'd like to apologise in advance for my English as it's not my native language. You may wonder why I choose to write in a language that isn't my own then - the answer is simply that I wish to share my thoughts with the widest public, and I wouldn't be able to achieve that in my mother tongue.With that out of the way, let's get to the game..thank you in advance for your patience!I find it hard to accept the Metascore this game received, I have found it to be one of the most thematically interesting games I've played.Imagine a future where your memories can be digitised, stored, erased, shared with those you care for: this is the future Remember Me takes you to. Sounds inviting, doesn't it? But I'm sure you're smart enough to see the risk in this.With access granted to the last remaining haven for personal privacy, corporations gain absolute power over the individual; the abuse of memory trading taints and fades identities.But not all submit.A group forms to fight the corporations: they are known as the Errorists, and this is where your journey begins.Captured and stripped of your memories, you are freed by an unexpected ally and persuaded to rejoin the cause you once fought for, determined to regain your memories and identity.Now to the gameplay: Remember Me plays as a third person action adventure with some minor platforming, and a melee combat system that borrows from the Batman: Arkham series, not without adding its own taste to it.It all flows well and never gets overly repetitive, as combos can be customised in order to regain health, deal heavier damage or power special attacks. Enemy types are sufficiently diverse and can provide a decent challenge in the higher difficulty settings, as you will often adapt your combos to the situation.Only minor hiccup is the camera, that at times follows at angles that make it hard to have a good visual of the fight.Platforming is linear, ledges and ladders you can (and must) use are highlighted.There are collectibles scattered across levels that will grant health or energy improvements, but overall the game is linear; I don't consider this a particular flaw, as the game is story-centered and linearity keeps the plot flowing at a good pace.The level design is beautiful: Neo Paris is created with meticulous attention to details, and I often found myself stopping to take it all in, or just listen to NPCs discuss about their daily trials and tribulations.The story is obviously the strong point of the game: if you were intrigued by the premise, moving forward will never feel like a chore and will not fail to catch you off guard more than once. You are in for a treat.There is one more feature I haven't brought up yet: at set points in the story, a unique power of Nilin will be revealed. You have the ability to enter people's memories. Cool? Very.Not only that: you also have the power to change them, affecting the present! This is done by interacting with different, set objects in the memory, affecting the end result. This is a great mechanic that I felt should have been fleshed out further. Imagine not having limitations on the remix, with any result you achieve having effect on the story!Still, it is a very interesting trait that already works well in the state it is given to the player in.In summary: a gripping story, a thought provoking thematic, a setting as beautiful as it is tainted, a fun combat and a unique mechanic. If any of it appeals to you, do not hesitate to immerse yourself in the not so distant future Neo Paris.And if you read this in 2084..Remember Me.			"

story 10/10: great well thought out story. graphics 10/10: absolutely beautiful graphics,they even rendered the dirt and grime in the slums. gameplay 6/10: it felt more like an interactive movie than a game,it's VERY linear there's one path and it's littered with go this way signs. whenever you have a chance to go off the main path you're guarenteed to find a ""secret"" item, well it's not really a secret because they show you a picture of where to look.this game would have been absolutely great if was a sandbox game like GTA or saints row,stealing and planting memories for various people to progress,gaining either good or bad reputation and effecting the various parts of the city.example you need to get to the other side of the river,you could go underground or you could fly over it ,to go underground you need to steal the memory of a sewer map. to fly you have to learn where they store the jets and find a pilot to steal their memory of how to fly.plot twist you could buy something in game to change your own memory which alters a past decision in your save game.I think it was well worth the $10 I paid,I just think it had alot of potential that it didn't tap into for whatever reason			"

												In this game you walk around, jump ledge to ledge, climb up/down etc to progress through the various areas. It's very much on rails, as in there's only 1 way to go, this is not open world.Every so often you'll walk into a combat situation, where you punch and kick your way through several enemies using a combo system that you can customise to suit the fight. Also boss fights. Its pretty basic, almost like an interactive movie with occasional fights. But I found I really enjoyed the story. I played through the whole game in 12 hours, so its not long. Art style looks great, soundtrack is pretty good too, and is somewhat influenced by what happens during a fight.I picked this up on sale for about $5. Definitely worth it, I thoroughly enjoyed it.

												While the story and gameplay elements were okay, there were a few more things that I didn't like about this game that makes me want to not recommend it.I will start with the good.  Remixing memory sequences. You go into the memories of a couple characters and modify (a limited number of) things to change what really happened.Building your own combo moves.  The buttons are locked to specific sequences, but the ""power"" of each button is customizable.That's about all I really liked about it.  So the bad...  Can't skip cutscenes, most of them are quite long, and it doesn't offer any motivation to go back to collect items hidden around the levels if I have to sit through the cutscenes every time.No counter-move, only dodging, and using it messes with your button combos.  It's really frusterating trying to get a longer combo against an enemy when you're fighting more than 2 or 3 and always having to dodge.Speaking of combos, while I liked the concept, there weren't enough ""pressens"" (that's what they are called) to go around to fill out them all, even by the end of the game.  I collected ~90% of the items out there, and still had 2-3 locked button options.Hidden collectibles, I never get them all in any game and it's a major chore to even think about going back to get anything I missed.  Especially with not being able to skip cutscenes...Lastly, by the end of the game, I didn't feel all that powerful.  My combos were relegated to healing abilities and/or speeding up the cooldowns on special abilities.  Stealing memories shouldn't have been limited to getting stupid access codes.  All the special abilities and combo moves are unlocked at set points before entering combat with new enemy types.  It would have been way more rewarding to earn new moves through something that tied to the story instead of ""oh here's this new move now"".			"

Posted: August 24, 2016
												Remember me is game that excels at mediocrity. It has no major failures but I never quite found it to be fun. It feels like the pinacle of design-by-committee. And here is why:It tries to be Tomb Raider (or Uncharted) but the leaping/climbing puzzles are not puzzling. An orange arrow always indicates where you must jump to next. There is little exploration because the camera becomes quasi-fixed during climbing sequences so you can't easily look around for alternate routes.It tries to be War in the North (Lord of the Rings) but the combat isn't fluid. How a game published by Capcom managed to fail at executing Combo moves is beyond me. To discover which combo you're currently performing you need to watch the bottom of the screen. You shouldn't need to because in a fighting game you should know where in a combo you are simply by the buttons pressed. Not so with Remeber Me; if you make a mistake during a combo it's seems pretty touch-and-go as to which new combo you will then start performing.The dodge mechanism is almost awesome and it's as close to fun as this game gets. The problem is - once again - combos. If you're midway through a combo then no amount of pounding dodge will disengage from the fight before another opponent has a change to land a hit. Breaking the combo and (on hard) losing Nilin a significant chunk of health.And here lies the next issue, the game doesn't fully save focus before a fight. If Nilin dies the fight restarts without focus and very often focus is required to win a fight. This makes for a lot of tedious dodging and landing hits against blocking/invisible opponents to slowly build focus back up again. The cooldown times on some of the focus attack are also ridiculously long - even when using the correct Sensens to diminish it.Moving on from the mediocre combat my biggest gripe is the unskippable cut scenes. Many of which are slow pans across pieces of architecture. Often placed just before difficult fights with messages that must be acknowledged with a button. And the message can't be skipped immediately either. There will be a slow walk with banal chatter then a message pops up. Then wait until the press-a-button image appears then more slow cut scene then another message. It's terrible.The story is not as great as portrayed (spoiler warning): Nilin's mother is involved in a car crash and blames Nilin (who was being a brat). This translates to a general hate for humanity and is used to rationalise enslaving them. Nilin's father (who is generally not present) decides the best way to fix his wife's abandonment of his daughter is by making his daughter forget it. To do this he builds a computer that takes (and stores rather than deleting) all peoples bad memories. It becomes sentient and want's to both be destroyed by Nilin and be destroy Nilin.Finally - and what should have been the Remember Me's master piece - are the memory editing sequences. Nilin gets to occasionally hack someone's memory, changing key events to alter their perception of the present. But each sequence is trial-and-error, there are no obvious cues. Change an event then watch to see what happens and if the game accepts the sequence; if not then rewind and try again. Fortunately there are only five such sequences.All-in-all Remember me feels like a game that has been built without pride or joy in the undertaking. It's a soulless but competent slog done far better by many other games.			"

												A good game with a good story. Far from perfect, but worth the playtime.A different battle system heavily inspired by the Batman Arkham games, and some climbing from the Prince of Persia/Assassin's Creed series. On the other side, the game could have been less linear. The truly unique gameplay mechanic is the memory remix, during the remix tou will alter a person's memory for your own reasons (for the story's sake actually). The only downside is that there were too few of these.The art style is amazing, and the setting (Neo-Paris, 2084) is just beautiful. Early in the game you will see some bits of the high-end of the city, and it feels truly alive. The game really makes you believe that you are always being watched.			"

												The unique setting and fantastic graphics are outstanding and the strong point of this game. Some breathtaking vistas that come close to concept art. The soundtrack is very good as well and the dynamic combat music never gets old. Nilin is a strong female protagonist, which is not often seen nowadays and while the story seems a bit average at first, it get's more interesting and ""twisty"" at the end.It may not have the best gameplay, though I would say it's fairly unique combo system can make for some interesting moments. The later enemies are a bit annoying but it's not unfair and the combat never got boring. The voiceacting can be grating, so maybe switch to French with English subtitles for a more unique and enjoyable experience!			"

												This was quite possibly the best singleplayer experience i've had in a long time- absolutely loved Remember Me. An intruiging futuristic sci-fi story set in Neo-Paris 2084 featuring some great animation, voice acting, visuals and an incredible attention to detail that creates a very atmospheric experience and a believable world. Boss fights are varied and challenging, and the 'memory remixing' segments are definitely the highlights of the gameplay. Combat in general is a little lacking towards the end of the game, and the platforming would have benefitted from being a bit less linear, but overall was still fun. The story lasted a solid 11 hours for me, though would probably be faster if you're not stopping every now and then to appreciate the amazing world design. Definitely recommend this to others!			"

												7/10A very nice story, with a nice plottwist.The protagonist and two other main characters are nicely developed, they actually have something you can grab, something you can feel with.The gameplay itself is rather linear and the only variety in fights appear, when you unlock new skills combos or face new enemies or boss battles.The level design is very nice. It is apocalyptic and yet remains with a slight touch of blurry dream of a harmonic world. It´s also very interesting. I found myself trying to explore each corner of the levels I got into, the fact that there are several points of no-return in the game, kind of disappointed me.And that you cannot visit all these interesting places, even though they seem to be accessable.Outstanding cinematic feeling on the whole game, even when you´re not in cutscenes and excellent voice acting, as well as the soundtrack.Overall, I would buy the game again, though it does not have a replayable value, as the story is the main carrier of the whole game. Once you know the story it becomes extremely repetitive. Similar to Bioshock.			"

												A good game with a good story. Far from perfect, but worth the playtime.A different battle system heavily inspired by the Batman Arkham games, and some climbing from the Prince of Persia/Assassin's Creed series. On the other side, the game could have been less linear. The truly unique gameplay mechanic is the memory remix, during the remix tou will alter a person's memory for your own reasons (for the story's sake actually). The only downside is that there were too few of these.The art style is amazing, and the setting (Neo-Paris, 2084) is just beautiful. Early in the game you will see some bits of the high-end of the city, and it feels truly alive. The game really makes you believe that you are always being watched.			"

												Remember Me has a lot of things going for it. The story's premise, that memories are malleable -- readily extracted and remixed -- is interesting and full of possibility. The setting, Neo Paris (some 70 years in the future) is well-realized, full of colour and detail. For me, the environment art was the best thing about the game; I enjoyed looking in windows, walking around living spaces, and just generally exploring. The game features a strong soundtrack, and decent enough voice acting. These positive qualities are tempered by significant weak elements, however. In particular, the core gameplay mechanic, third-person crowd fighting, is remarkably dull, and not enlivened by the ‘customizable’ combo system. There are four button combinations (increasing in length) that you can customize to ‘do’ different things (gain health, do damage, etc.), but once I had settled on combos I liked well enough, I rarely changed them. Fights quickly became repetitive and uninteresting, something to get past to move the plot forward. Furthermore, boss fights almost always end in quick-time events. The levels are entirely linear, and on-screen indicators tell you exactly where to go. What fun is Prince of Persia/Assassin's Creed style jumping and exploring when the game tells you exactly which platform is the next one in the sequence? There is one gameplay mechanic that was interesting, memory 'remixing', which requires you to 'scrub' through a memory and alter it in ways that change the outcome. Unfortunately, there are only a handful of these in the game.In short, Remember Me has a lot of solid ideas, wrapped in beautiful scenery, but hampered by dull, repetitive and linear gameplay. This development team has a lot of promise, they just need to figure out how to execute better gameplay mechanics.I would recommend this game, with reservations. On sale, for $20 or less, I would recommend it, at the very least to check out the environment and level art.			"

												This game gripped me from the intro, the menu UI, the first level.As stylish as it can get.The gameplay is as linear as can be (a few collectables along the way take you a bit of the path, but not too much). The combos are not really combos or quick-time events but just sequences of buttons. The memory remixes are not really a game.And I still love this and would love to see more of this! If you liked Binary Domain or any other (french) 3rd person action game, you will love this one.			"

												Its good certainly outweigh its negatives, but the negatives are pretty glaring at times.Visually, I think this game holds up to Bioshock Infinite - I'd actually say better to be honest (except it's not as bright and designed to 'pop' like Infinite). Unfortunately, I think the artists and level designers couldn't/didn’t (differences in gameplay, I’d guess) take advantage of its environment the way Infinite did, so, sadly, you may not notice it. This is such a gorgeous looking game when you are able to actually take it all in.The story and plot are interesting but the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed writing and dialog runs the gamut of quality, being either kinda annoying to times where I grimaced and thought 'this is really ♥♥♥♥ing drawn out – I can’t believe they’re doing all of this expository dialog, just SPEAK NORMALLY you weirdoes,' to other times when it was actually sort of nice. But throughout it all you could always see where the devs WANTED to go with it and the intention was always good. So enjoy the plot, but let the story/dialog wash over you when it starts to feel overbearing. I wouldn’t call the main character, Nilin, a particularly great female character lead, but there were some nice instances where she did grow as a character as a result of her actions, and was also emotionally considerate of other people. It just gets lost sometimes under the weight of the verbose expository dialog. As a general rule actually, had the writers integrated the numbing Shakespearean soliloquies and monologues into actual conversation, all of the characters would have been much more interesting and effective.The main way to interact with the game was the combat, and it was decent enough, but it grew annoying very quickly during the last two chapters (of eight total) because you could only chain combos together with the same opponent (the opposite of what you can do in Batman, where so long as you aren’t hit you can chain multiple enemies into the same attack combo); there were often so many bad guys that each time you dodged to avoid getting hit you had to begin your combos again, starting with the weakest attacks – this made the combat very drawn out and felt like it was taking for-♥♥♥♥ing-ever. It wasn't challenging at that point anymore, just boring. Earlier in the game there was less of each wave of enemies, so it was more challenging. There was a good spread of enemy types, and you had to fight several types concurrently, so that was quite nice, usually.The Uncharted-esque environment traversal worked, and without the direction indicator directing you to your next point you’d end up lost because the environment wasn't built to guide you, it was built to be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sexy beast. So there's an element of hand holding, but I never found it annoying, oddly enough.The Memory remixes were pretty darn cool - you invaded the movie-scene-like memory of a person and made slight alterations to play out over the course of the memory and basically let the butterfly cause the hurricane - but woefully underutilized. If they had quit the combat silliness near the end and given you another six or seven remixes to do it'd have been ♥♥♥♥ing grand. Grand, I say.All in all I'd still recommend the game, with the caveat that you actually take the time to actually LOOK at the environment you're traveling through. It's a mostly fun game that's absolutely stunning to see and, for the most part, fun to play. I think Deus Ex had better characters and story, and managed to hit more consistent highs in terms of writing quality, but Remember Me blew it out of the water Future Dystopia Cyberpunk-wise.You should pick it up and play at some point.

5.0/10.0Remember Be offer a quite interesting future sci-fi story, with some social and political elements. I like that! And the story-driven part is also the most positive part of the game. Unfortunately I can't say any positive things of much other parts of the game. There is another interesting and original part of the game however, the memory remix.First of all this is clearly a console game, which is very bad ported for PC. The controls feels clumsy, the menus do not support ""normal"" mouse-mode, and you are forced to navigate in an annoying console-way. And the memory remix is the most bad ported part in the entire game. To rewind in these parts, you literally have to clear your computer desk, to make space for you to look stupid with your mouse, while you make big counter-clockwise movements with your mouse. Very, very bad control!Another clumsy and glitchy part of the game is the fight parts. And except from that, these are furthermore quite trivial and boring on the long term.The game is very linear, and have too much of a console-feeling for my taste. The game however, is very pretty, and the scenery is very nice to look at.But all in all, I can't recommend this game. The story, scenery and memory remix is the best part of the game. But a too linear level designs, boring battles/fights, and not at least a very, very bad PC port, make me incline to the view that this is not a game that I will recommend. Unfortunately, because the concept have potential.			"

												Remember this game!Remember Me. Ein ReviewSeit den ersten Minuten der rund zehn Stündigen Story wurde ich in den Bann dieses Spieles gezogen...warum, dasswede ich jetzt erklähren.Story: Schon die ersten Minuten des Spiels machen Lust auf mehr: Im Jahr 2084 ist es dem Konzern Memorize gelungen, eine Technologie zu entwickeln, mit der Erinnerungen wie eine Datei abgespeichert und mit anderen geteilt werden können. Während immer größere Teile der Bevölkerung davon abhängig werden und in einer Scheinwelt dämmern, reißt der Konzern immer mehr Macht an sich und kontrolliert den gesamten Staaten. Jeder, der sich gegen das Regime stellt, wird in die Pariser Bastille gesperrt. Von da an führt  Remember Me durch eine packende Geschichte, die in der Mitte zwar ein wenig langweilig wird ,  dank der glaubwürdigen Heldin und der interessanten Nebenfiguren aber durchgehend bei der Stange hält.(txt.  von gamestar.de)Technik: Schnelles Gameplay und tolle Grafik sind gut zusammengeführt und ergeben so ein robustes Spiel.Das gute Kampfsystem ist schnell und trotzdem leicht. Das Spiel an sich ist tunnelartig und man ist ein wenig eingeschrenkt das stört aber nicht weiter.Nilin Cartier-Wells, der weibliche Protagonist sieht gut aus und wird nicht langweilig.Die Welt:In den belebten Gassen der französischen Hauptstadt findet man Geschäfte, und Restaurants , während Roboter ihre Bestellungen aufnehmen.Umgeben von Historischen Gebäuden  wie Notre Dame oder Sacré-Coeur, die zwischen vielen Häusern schön rausstechen.Natürlich hat das Spiel auch seine Macken: Die Kamera spielt nicht immer mit und an manchen Stellen sieht die Grafik dann doch nicht so gut aus ausserdem sind die im Spiel vorkommenden Kletterpassagen ziemlich langweilig und einfach. Die Kämpfe  werden immer in einem abgesperten Bereich ausgeführt dieser ist zwar relativ groß, schrenkt aber trotzdem ein wenig ein.Dennoch ist das Spiel eine klare Kaufempfehlung und für 20 euro vergleichsweise günstig.

												It could have been 1 of the greatest games ever created...I dont remember any other game that would get me on such an emotional rollercoaster,1 min i luv it only to hate it another.Some parts of it are done so damn good,like visuals and overall design of characters and maps,even hairstyles its just magnificent!Music and sounds just breathtaking...but the gameplay is so so at best,its not bad its just nothing special.The most interesting feature in the game which is memory mixing is used only 4 times in the game...why?Why make it into platformer kinda game?Why not go stealth?The game asks for it on every corner...And the fighting system...im ok with Batman/AC fighting system but here  you have no counter,its just strange decision since your being attacked by multiple enemies from multiple angles...The whole game is like a genius(a real one) meets a failure and they decide to make a game together.Another thing,with this engine,one of the best i encountered,everything looks beatiful and its well optimized but...you spent most of the game in sewers,slums and mostly dark areas where you can see♥♥♥♥♥♥ Why?Seems to me like a lot of ideas didnt get implemented into the final product and it breaks my heart cause i love cyberpunk,i love France,Nilin is beatiful and really cool heroine..just...ugh it could have been so much more.To the verdict,with stuning visuals,designs,magnificent music,great story,new and fresh ideas but so so gameplay I give it :8/10(it could have been 10)I do recomend it,its worth your time and money.

												So I actually bought this games for 2 euro on a sale and I knew it was a underrated game. I thought 'well, maybe they're right', but I bought it and you know what I'm gonna say? This game ROCKS!The game has a very original storyline, (it's something like the Deus Ex series but a bit different) which is an interesting one with some twists as well. I also love the music here! (And so will you!)The graphics is OK (well, looks like Unreal 3)One thing I didn't like at all was the combat system and the AI. Why do I say so?Because the combat system is a bit clunky, but overall it does not interfere the whole game at all. You can get used to it pretty fast...So the rating for me:Gameplay 6/10Graphics 8/10Story 10/10Music 10/10Overall rating 9/10, because I really liked the game and  I'm sure I will recommend it to everyone who will ask me about it :) Thank you for reading and enjoy the game!

												Hard to judge this game objectively. Well, I'll begin with the end. :)I rate RM as 90/100 (or 9/10)+ The best cyberpunk city I ever see (even better than Stark). I love you, Neo-Paris;+ Athmosphere and the world;+ Playing with the memories of character (the best part of game);+ Not bad system of fight. Interesting to create chains.And now bad news.- We can delight the sights of Neo-Paris only 1/3 of game. Other 2/3 we are roaming in buildings and undercity. Really boring. :(- There are 8 chapters in game, only 4 (!!!) times we can playng with the main feature of the game - ""remixing memory"". Very stupid devs decision.- Closer to end - very easy fighting- Absolutely no side-quests. I understand, that its not RPG. But this game deserves more quests, cause the world is welldone, and it'll be very interesting to explore. But...- The base storyline is very ordinary After all this bad words, that I wrote, why is so high rank?Well, I'll explain. I dont want to play COD №100, Elder Scrolls №50, etc. I want to see fresh ideas in gameplay and new worlds. And these devs give me the oportunity. Unfortunately, they COULD do the game better, but they didn't. Si, I give them 90/100 for attempting. And finally it was fun to play for me. :)			"

The fighting combo system is too limited to really enjoy, and the mechanic-limited fights are heavily broken. All that aside, it has a wonderfully formulated story line, and a sturdy female heroin. Just wish they would have spent more time designing open world scenes, and spent a little more effort in making everything a little more fluid, while reducing hard-animated reactions.			"

												This is one of the most underrated games from 2013. Game play wise camera angles could be little better I guess but not that much to complain. This is not your typical third person combat game with a female protagonist. Good voice acting and  story is interesting and imho graphics could be better. Most interesting part of the game for me is the ability to remix someones memory and bend it completely to your will that will make an enemy to follow you with no sweat. I have never done something like this with a game before and pleasantly this was entertaining. Anyway is this game worth it for $29.99 price ? maybe but it is hell worth for $5.99 price tag that went on the last Capcom weekend sale and it will go on sale again.			"

												After 2 years I would like to share with you my opinion about this wonderful game. First of all, this is my favorite game, all because of the ideas, the design of this game, the amazing soundtrack, the artworks and pretty much everything in this game, even the gameplay is not terrible as many people said. For those who are unfamiliar with the game. The game is set in the year 2084, in a futuristic version of Paris called Neo-Paris. The main character in the game is Nillin, a memory hunter. In the game there is a puzzle game were you can change the memory of your friends, and enemies - however, your actions are limited and you have to figure them out carefully. There are elements of parkour as well that makes the game feel more open even though there is no open world. Pretty much everything in the game is perfect but the combat system, which is a bit lame. In the menu you get artworks and 3D models of the story mod as well, you can get them while playing the game. I think that I've mentioned the main aspects of the game, expressing my own opinion of course..Hope you like it, thanks for reading :)			"

												First episode into the game and I was having a hard time containing my excitement.  This was the first ""AAA"" game I had played in quite a while that oozed with so much...atmosphere?  The trailers and screenshots don't quite do the prescence of Neo Paris justice, and I can see how they  may come off as a typical cyberpunkish utopia/slums contrast.  However, Dontnod's designers manage to take those tropes and somehow make them feel fresh and envigorating.  Even the UI for the menu's in the game are interesting, different, and don't feel like a hastle to sift through (the Combos Lab aside).  The Horn of Jericho is probably my favorite and the most memorable enemy offered up by the game, something about the giant angry robot projecting a shouting human mouth while roaring is captivating and creepy at the same time.The game does a really good job of pacing out the combat, puzzle solving, and platforming, delivering all three in varying doses without any single one getting too tiresome before switching gears to something else.  Collectibles are cleverly placed and most use different cues like memorizing an image to find later in the level or audio cues so they can be easily located without too much ""hunting forever to get that one achievement"" syndrome.  Narrative pacing is slow to start, and just when I was beginning to presume certain portions were just poorly written the story fills in the holes and brings the player back in.  Since the protagonist starts out the game as an amnesiac this is a good hook to keep you in sync with the status of the main character.  They know just as much as you do, sometimes even less...Some enemy models get tweaked as the game progresses, so while there's not a lot of variety to the silohuettes, the combat system forces you to rethink your strategy by changing the status quo each time a new enemy type is introduced or by throwing unique combinations of enemies into a fight.  The boss fights never seem unfair, though its not always immediately clear what your goal is to wear down the enemy in those scenarios (if you are ever stuck for a prolonged period of time on a battle or in a puzzle the game can offer a hint to help you along, but this was usually not provided in my playthrough as I eventually figured it out in time).  The combat system has you slowly unlock button presses with special effects throughout the game, which can then be chained together in templates provided for combos (XYYXYY, XXX, YYYXXXXY, etc.).  These special effects range from additional damage to healing on-hit.  While not my favorite part of the game it was fun to have some control over what my attacks did when facing specific enemy types.  Platforming is not an open world experience like Assassin's Creed, you can't climb anywhere (usually only on highlighted beams and ledges).  Despite movement being somewhat restricted I never felt like I was running down a linear series of hallways like some games suffer from.Puzzles come in a wide variety, some include modifying the environment through use of various machinery and your AR glove, while others involve cracking passwords or figuring out how to outsmart a drone formation patrol.  The most notable are the memory remixes, where you enter the memory of another character and look for glitches to remix to make them believe something in the past occured in an alternate fashion to help will them to the protagonist's cause.  A couple of the remixes left a bad feeling in my stomach, combined with a few of the actions the player was championed into accomplishing by their ""leader"".  The moral consequences of making someone believe in a different past are rarely explored, and many of the negative actions the player has to take to get to the ending evoke a ""Spec Ops: The Line"" feeling with a lot less hating yourself and a little more ""did the ends justify the means?"" pondering.  The smaller gripes I have with the game include jumping being very nearly worthless when not in a platforming scenario, unskippable cut scenes (if I die with a checkpoint right before a battle, etc.), the sometimes confused UI in the Combo Lab, and the game pausing whenever I Shift-Tab (I could at least be browsing the web during the second+ viewing of those cut scenes?).  My love for what this game does RIGHT completely eclipses those annoyances though, Dontnod has built a solid third person game with mechanics that are classic but feel fresh, and have built a beautiful world around that gameplay.  Do yourself a favor and give this game a try.			"

												I am only 2 hours into this game and I have to say that it is by far the most original game i have ever played.   The story is one of the best i have encountered in a game in a long time.  The combat system is very user friendly and free flowing.   This is really a great game.  The fact that you can manipulate peoples memories is such a unique aspect of this game....This is a definite must have for the gamer who loves fighting and very story rich games.  I just love it and cant say enough positive things about it.  You really must try this game!!!!!			"

												The story takes place in a partially believable future Paris, France in about 70 years. The Neo-Paris is beautifully created as a delightful mix of the actual historical Paris and various sci-fi elements. Overall the graphics are good and have a nice unique touch. For decent gameplay a pad controller is highly recommended. Although classified as ""FPS"" there is stricly no actual shooting, only lots of punching and kicking and firing various gadgets (firearms will be abolished in Paris in 70 years). The difficulty level is quite high, as a fairly experienced gamer I had to switch from the normal difficulty level to easy after completing only 20% of the game to avoid excessive frustration. Still I felt the battles were quite difficult at times towards the end of the game.The biggest reason why I enjoyed the game was the decent plot, and the somewhat philosopical approach at the subject. At best, it may give you a few things to think about regarding existence in general and the future of mankind and our planet.The game is not perfect, there are a few minor annoyances like sometimes accidentally not being able to go back in the level in those places where they aren't completely linear. Also the battles get a bit repetitive eventually. For a single-player game it's perhaps also a bit short. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it and would highly recommend it.			"

												Remmber me will remmbwer, the game is an Mastier peaceIts made right each part of the game but the end is a learning prosses just as a game needs to be buildThe story is lovely and can be seen as any BlockBaster movie out there...I did have a few bugs doing play (a battle that did not finsh was by far the worst i had.. [had to restart that part it and second time it was fine])The game really makes sure to keep you on track and its hard to really get lost.. even in these they left it to look like a more open world and go down to the smallest detiles in the gameSo you ask me if i will buy it? Yes i will... i really not want to frogot these game and i hope some more games take some pages out of these to use in there gameMy highest copline abut it will be that it was a little too easy (i play nowmal so far) after you understand how to fight most of the fights become really easy to beat..And even that the ""level"" system in the game is nice its really limtied...So i really recommend it more for the guys (and girls) that love story driven game and that is artistic, less to who is looking for fighting game, as its there but if you only look for that.. i less recommendGaMe On			"

												Remember Me: Take a trip to Neo-Paris 2084 where memories are bought and sold which leads to the decay of society. This game is essentially a Third Person Brawler with special combos and Parkour thrown in.  Great Visuals and standard gameplay for this type of game.  There are also events called memory remixes where you change a person's memory by manipulating objects that are in their memories for different outcomes.  Overall it is a decent title.For Don't Nod's (The Development Team) first game attempt, it is very creative and original in a solid package.    Many of you do not Remember Me, but you will Remember to get this title on sale!!  Perv POV - Best Female Lead that showcases a Great Booty in Denim Jeans!!   "

												Remember Me has a world made of *very* tight linear corridors, I'm talking 5-6 feet wide here. It has a cutscene every 30 seconds, less if you move through the levels quickly. And you will, because there is nothing to explore in them. There are invisible walls everywhere and you can only climb where the developers decided you could.Tutorial messages informing you that you got a new ""whatever"" will not stop throughout the game, even during combat, which is nice.It has Deus Ex: Human Revolution level of boss fights. I recommend having a couple of spare keyboards around, because you will need them.I was very interested in this developer's other game, Life is Strange, but to be honest, I'm not anymore. A developer that is capable of making this horrible game shouldn't be allowed a second chance. I know that they are developing a vampire themed RPG at the moment, and I shudder to think of all the mud they will drag the RPG name through. I bet it will make everyone who buys it re-install Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines and play that instead.So, the bottom line is, go play VtMB and when you see a game by DONTNOD, DONTBUY!			"

												At times this seems like two different games, one is a smart mindf*ck game (literally!) where you have to remix peoples memories to make them remember events differently to bend their will to your own ends. The other game is a straight up Batman style brawler, made way more complicated than it needed to be by you having to map abilities you unlock to the x, y, a or b buttons and then having to remember and try to pull off button combos in the right order and with the right timing.The brawling sadly takes up most of the game, while remixing peoples memories you only get to do about 4 times in total throughout your journey through Neo Paris, which by the way made the game for me. This is one gorgeous and very cool looking city. It's sadly also incredibly linear while you are navigated through it while either climbing up buildings or fighting people.Tonally it seems off as well, with your character and the story being overly serious but then undercut by these larger than life cartoonish villians you have to fight, which seemed totally out of place in this context, that was jarring for me.The soundtrack was really awesome though, really memorable and hummable, in fact just get the soundtrack instead you'll enjoy it more :)

												This game took a beating on metacritic for certain gameplay and design elements, and while it took questionable approaches to some things, it wasn't afraid to stand up and be different. Some of them helped the game tremendously, and some took away from it, but at the end of the day Remember Me is very worth suffering through some annoyances of extremely linear level design, janky cutscenes and weird memory replay mechanics for a fantastic story with great characters in an undeniably gorgeous world.HighlightsRemember Me includes incredibly gorgeous detailed environments and backdrops, and a very metropolitan, urbane feel to everything, a style which wouldn't be felt again until games like Deus Ex: Human Revolution* Detailed NPCs add life to the environment. You'll often stop to eaves drop on NPCs engaging each other or having a conversation * Interesting characters and especially very interesting bosses with personality which also help to add a dimension of challenge* One of the best asses in video gamesMistakesRemember Me stands up above many other games with some incredible design and production value, so it's painful and frustrating when something doesn't feel as well done as the other design elements. The extremely linear nature of the world, for example, feels like such a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥because of all the fantastic depth and beauty in everything else.* The combat is unique and very good when understood, but the game does an awful job of explaining and guiding the player to use the system, and you can easily play through the entire game without ever fully coming to terms with the combat* Some of the cut scene elements are un-skippable and just plain annoying at timesRecommendationsRemember Me clocks in at 10 hours of play time, and has a lower price point than most triple A titles, but at £22.99/27.99€/$29.99 it might be more than most should pay, considering the very dividing gameplay structure. When on sale, it's a real bargain, and worth the risk. It routinely goes -75% or more.* The game was originally designed, under Sony, to play more like Assassin's Creed, and a much more open world and was then rolled back by EDGE due to the smaller story, and to help fit the story

												I've had my eye on this game for quite some time now. Everytime I see pictures from it, I let out a sigh and say ""Ah... The beautiful cyberpunkish future."", since you know, the game has that sort of vibe and I'm drawn to it. I know the ""real"" reviews haven't been praising the game, but as long as Call of Dutys and Titanfalls are ""the best"", I know it's just better to play the game myself and make up my own opinion.The game looks and sounds great. I noticed myself stopping quite often just to see my surroundings and almost felt like I could breath in the foul air of lower slums or feel the wind on my skin when topping a skyscraper. World looks detailed and creates a realistic atmosphere. Oh, and Nilin, the female character you control in game, looks cute and her animations are pretty spot on.The story is pretty straightforward. (No spoilers, just what the trailers and game description already tells you!) You wake up with all your memories and skills gone. You hear a voice that guides you to get back on your feet and helps you trying to solve what's happened. Maybe a bit over used landing in games generally, but it works. In Nilin's story it makes sense, since she was a memory hunter herself, until she ends up on the receiving side.Story is progressing mostly via cutscenes and radio chatter between Nilin and NPCs chatter, while the player moves from A to B, climbing buildings, fighting pursuers and collecting hidden health boosts and lore updates. I can't help it, but very often I felt like I was walking on a narrow path. The world might look nice and ""living"", but the game world feels quite restrictive. There isn't much exploring to do and all you need to do is find the one path and stay on it for another waypoint or cutscene.The fighting scenes reminds me alot from Assassin's Creed or some DC/Marvel superhero game. You can adjust your combos for different animations, damages and heals. During a brawl you can make cool athelitcs, dodging enemy attacks, while trying to keep your combos up for maximum pain. As the game progresses, you get more powerfull skills and cooldown abilities that helps you taking down big crowds of bad guys without a scratch. Nilin can be a badass if you want her to be.So far the game hasn't been very hard on the puzzle side. I've found most hidden items with ease and the occasional ""trap here, pull lever there"" puzzles aren't overwhelmingly hard.The most interesting part in the game is Nilin's ability to alter memories, which has a permanent effect on persons and helps the story progress. Jumping a memory phase back and forth, while trying to find glitches and then letting the memory play again is fun. As I'm not fully done with the game yet, I just hope there's more of these Jedi mind tricks, before the eventual end.I do recommend this game for anyone who likes a good looking scifi story, with some action on the side. I'm glad I didn't ignore this game due to the mediocre reviews it got in public.			"

												Remember Me is a cyberpunk wet dream.  The camera control is a little jarring at first, and I've got a feeling it's best played with a controller, but the story is so profoundly original, and the Neo-Parisian environments so awe-inspiringly beautiful, that you quickly become immersed in and engrossed with the game's universe.  Dontnod Entertainment have expressed an interest in developing a sequel.  If it happens, I just hope they will introduce RPG elements.  It's a fantastic game - particularly if this genre is your kind of thing - but it could easily have been so much more.			"

												After beating the game, I have realized how unexciting it was. While the combat is mildly entertaining, it is fairly repetitive. The introduction of new enemies is not a fresh challenge, but rather an annoying feature, like when enemies are invincible because they are powered by other enemies you must kill first, or turn invible during combat, or hurt you every time you peform damage even when attacking with a range attack. You do climb around like Assassin's Creed, but only through set paths, which again, I found to be more annoying than anything else, mainly due to the fact that you frequently fall and find yourself in trouble. Remixing memories is a puzzle, but once again, because they took awhile to figure out sometimes, I found them more frustrating than anything else.			"

												Remember Me is a very stylish futuristic action game.  The story is very intriguing and the gaming world looks fantastic.  You have special abilities to alter and steel other people’s memories in a world where memories are for sale and highly sought after.  The gameplay itself is a mismatch of fighting (with combos) and platforming climbing from one building to the next.  There are also some shooting and puzzle sections and even a few quick time events thrown in.  There is a bit of exploration for extras and power ups.  Gameplay wise its nothing fancy but everything is at least done competently with some variety, although you have probably done all of this stuff before in other games.  The unique part is sometimes you get to alter a person’s memoires to benefit your situation.  This part I found very interesting, but it only happens once in a while unfortunately.  Overall if you like action games with a futuristic setting then Remember Me is a solid choice.			"

												This could have been one of my all-time favorites. Great soundtrack. Amazing atmosphere. It has a Tomb Raider type feel for traversing certain areas - with hacking locks and moving objects in order to progress. You get to see memories via other characters, find hidden items, and learn more about the protagonist as you go. If this had been a bigger portion of the game it would have been a winner (and at first it was...)Now the downfalls.Once you go through certain doors (none of which are indicated) you can’t go back. The fact that you can’t explore is discouraging. Miss that hidden item? Oh, well. Also, if you die before the next auto-save any hidden items you did find revert back. Which will happen because the camera angles are odd and sometimes you jump to your death. Some of these items offer stat boosts.The combat is a combo fight style. For the first half of the game fights are engaging but not overly difficult or long. The boss fights were fun. One boss. Right move/dodge at the right time. Then half-way through it becomes a sh*t storm of enemies...and more enemies...and more enemies...over and over. You can’t fully use your combos at this point because there are too many swarming you. The fights overtake the game and become tiresome and a hassle.This brings me to the next issue that killed the game for me. This has some of the worst boss fights I’ve ever encountered. Some are nothing but waiting on two-minute cool-downs and avoiding attacks. Others are long drawn out button mashing torture sessions. One fight was so bad I swore I would never do another boss fight like that again. Twenty minutes later I’m fighting TWO OF THEM and their horde of zombie type enemies swarming me non-stop. My controller nearly took a rage fueled trip across the room.Since the combat is a major portion of the game I can't recommend unless on sale. A well-developed game should not be so frustrating. There was clearly a lot of ambition, but it feels like they lost focus on what they were trying to create half-way through.			"

												“Suffering, like painful memories is just part of life” – Nilin.Remember Me is a beautiful and fun game to play, however the combat just seems to lacking something when compared to its competitors and I can’t put my finger on it. That’s not to say that the combat is bad, it’s definitely a good attempt at something new and original but it’s missing that spark that the Devil May Cry and the Batman Arkham series has. DONTNOD Entertainment has made a really good action-adventure game and because of its combo lab, environmental puzzles and remixing of memories, it hard to make comparison to its competition.			"

												Very nice graphics let you drop in a atmospheric surrounding of hopefully never to come future. This game is just great, if you leave out the console movement of your character and the frustrating boss-fights.. Oh, by the way, I played this on the easiest I could get it on for the first play through. I wanted to soak in the story and atmosphere. The idea of manipulating what we remember is really nice, but in my humble opinion, by far not exploited enough in this game. I just saw me confronted to a lot of arcade-fights and ended up wanting to uninstall this game at each single boss-fight I had to restart at least five times.. Metro was a lot more fun! I recommend this game only because of the atmosphere, the sound and .. Not the bossfights :pAlthough some of you, used to console and arcade-like fights, might still enjoy this kind of gameplay. And don't get me wrong here, its not like mortal combat fights, its just easy stile fights with the normal opponents and leaching you out bossfights.. The atmosphere and surrounding recompense some how enough to keep me on track.. Stubborn me :pIf this is on sale, go on and grab it, you will enjoy the atmosphere. The idea of this game is just brilliant. But be aware of those bossfights and adapt the price accordingly. Oh, and make yourself a cup of coffee from time to time. That helped me out and kept me away from uninstalling and continue on track.			"

												Amazingly underrated game with one of the most original worlds in recent times. I saw some of its concept art floating around the internet before finding out what game it belonged to, and those pieces, while great, don't do that game any justice when you actually see the game in motion. Every piece of art has been translated over into the game world flawlessly.The story is reminiscent of creative works such as Ghost in the Shell, Blade Runner, Total Recall, and the such, which I'm sure without a doubt that those works had a huge influence on its narrative, and its very telling in its aesthetic that it definitely took influence from those. The combat system is kind of like the rythmic sort of combat that's become the norm in a lot of action games, such as the Batman Arkham series of games, or for example Assassin's Creed. The game also allows you to build your own combos, with a variety of different effects that you can unlock and choose from, in an a la carte type customization. While not that long of a game, I do think it is a very engrossing one, although my one constant complaint that I would have with this game is that the camera isn't the greatest, in fact it can be pretty frustrating to deal with sometimes, but it's really not that much of a hassle once you get used to it. I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for an action game, something with an original story, and with an interesting world. It's a shame that this didn't get much exposure, or money, so I kind of doubt that it'll get a sequel. Which is a disappointment, since original games like this are few and far in between in a modern market saturated with sequels or adaptations of already existing IP's,			"

												Remember Me is in my eyes a totally underrated game if you're only a little bit into this type of game. It feels like a great cocktail of Mirror's Edge, Tomb Raider and Batman Arkham Series. The game takes place in the year 2084 in a world shaken by nature after the ice melted and a company invented a brain implant to manage your memories.Pros:* The visuals are astonishing. I really dug into the art style. Take a look at some of the screenshot and it will look even better in motion.* The sound/music is awesome, too. Great compositions and dynamic mixes (e.g. for fights).* The story! It great. You must play it to experience that on your own. Made me think what's going on in my head once or twice. ;-)* The love for details. I felt really impressed on how much work they invested into (small) details. Floating signs telling you the store is closed, but the website is online or to watch your step close to an edge, just make the world to feel complete. The memos you can find, will tell you stuff like details about the history of the world.* Memory Remixs: During the game you have to manipulate a couple of memories which is done by ""scrolling"" the memory forward and backward and change simple things like the position of a chair which may make the scene to come to a whole different ending.OKs:* Fights are like Batman, but not that fluid. You've got lots of enemies and mixed up types. So you have to manage your techniques and modify your combos to match new challenges. During fights you bulld up focus which allows you to trigger special moves you're granted through the story.* Traversing the linear levels is basically straightforward. The climb/jump/shimmy stuff feels like Tomb Raider, although there's always a marker pointing where to go. All over the level are hidden powerups/memos so you have to look left and right.* There are quick time events in the boss fights. They may feel cool, but I don't like them when they force me to repeat stupid stuff (like part of the fight before) when I press the wrong button.Contras:* I had some control issues (keyboard+mouse) with an action scene where you're chased by a madman in an armed helicopter. Dunno if they were not precise enough or if it was just me.* One boss fight is somehow plain stupid as its extremly repetitive. It took some tries to get the basics and then it was not really fun. All other bosses felt much better designed.Overall: You have to play it yourself!			"

												I bought the retail version of the game when it came out, admittedly taken by its visuals and its concept but unsure if it would be worth the money I paid.  I am not too keen on using controllers when I play games so unfortunately I played Remember Me a little bit then shelved it. Recently playing another Capcom game with a similar concept led me to dust Remember Me off and replay it. So here is my belated thoughts of the game:I'm going to start with its combat because there is so little to be said about it. If you have played games such as the Batman Arkham series and do not mind the combo building style of combat and platforming, then Remember Me will not disappoint you, however if combat like this is not your cup of tea and you are not fan of hanging from high buildings, then you will be very frustrated while playing Remember Me (especially on the hardest difficulty). On the other hand, if you are not too fussed about the combat and are more interested in a very well told story, amazing art work coming to life with perfectly executed graphical design, as well as interesting characters and enemies, then this is a must-play for you. Not to mention, the soundtrack is quite good and the voice-over acting is flawless. It was also nice to play a female protoganist that was desinged very well with a realistic attitude and body posture, and not running around in bikinis. The setting is in 2084 Neo-Paris. The details in the environment, characters, and enemies are amazing. I recommend you try and find all the collectibles (as some of them are very well hidden and will take you to every nook and cranny). The audio is flawless, from the music and the enviornmental sound to the voice acting, especially the voice acting which is very professionally done - it definately puts the player in the right mood.Despite of the unfortunate events the protoganist goes through, her desperation is just, without sounding needy. The rest of the voice acting is also perfect, as it gives you the correct emotions towards the other characters, (such as liking or disliking them, getting annoyed by them or feeling sympathy for them). The physique of the character in my opinion stands out - recently the protogonists in video games have been on the extreme side of appearances (especially females with unrealistic body shapes that in the real world would make it impossible to do the things they do in games). However in this one, the protognist (Nilin) is designed perfectly to play the role of the fast, agile and lean heroine without going over the board and shadowing her feminity. The most important thing that captured me about this game was the main concept of the game, playing with people's memories. I found it quite unique and I don't think I came across anything like this before in a game. It was very refreshing.(TL;DR Version) I highly recommend this game to players who are looking for story-rich, beautifully designed game with Batman Arkham series style of gameplay, set in Neo-Paris with a unique concept.

												What happens when social networks go too far?  That is the future that Neo-Paris exists in and is the premise of this game.  It's a solid title especially for 75% off.  Has that whole Matrix/Bladerunner feel to it without being or utilizing the overused elements from those movies.  Oh and who doesn't enjoy a good remix ;p			"

Pros:· Great audiovisual design· OK plotlineCons:· Bad level design· Bad combat systemIf the medium is the message, the message of “Remember Me” is delivered very poorly, corrupted during the transfer by a devious Errorist. This whole concept would be better for a Telltale-style adventure game, not for a dull sub-par Batman clone. However, I will recommend the game ’cause if someone would play it on YouTube, it could be a great experience, still. The message is enjoyable, the gameplay is not.			"

Had the game been any longer, I probably would have given up.  It's good cyberpunk that wasn't fleshed out and released with more than just a few problems.			"

												Very good (underrated!) game by the creators of ""Life Is Strange"".It reminds me of Mirror's Edge, as it uses a cyberpunk setting: ""Neo"" Paris in the year 2084.Good story, cool character, and stylish gameplay with a battle system similar to the Batman titles.The visual style and graphics are very impressive.Did I mention the awesome (orchestral) soundtrack?Downsides:- Battles sometimes seem unfair (i.e. Trial&Error, you dont get the ""flow"" you are hoping for and die)- Climbing sessions like in Uncharted or Tomb Raider (sometimes you jump right into oblivion instead of grabbing the next wall), maybe strange gameplay decision- Not much background info about the world around you9/10 would steal memories and overload again.

												I was gonna wait until I finished the game to post this but I need the world to know how good Remember Me is. + The most diverse range of characters I've ever seen in a game+ Beautiful soundtrack, especially the battle music cus it's influenced by your actions+ Stunning open world+ Customisable combos means fighting is way more than just spamming the same key+ Story is amazing+ Nillin's remix power is fun to play around with+ No detail is spared, a lot of thought went into this game and I really appreciate the subtle extra hints (e.g. elevator scene in Episode 7)+ Achievements are rly fun to work for+ ROBOT STRIP CLUB- The dramatic camera is annoying sometimes- Battles are 50% dodging which gets tiring but the other battle features are cool, like the S Pressens, and they kinda make up for itOverall +++++++ I love this game so much, I don't know where the bad reviews are coming from but it's so worth playing.Remember you soon.

												This is an exceptionally good game if you're into really believable sci-fi cities, technology, etc. The soundtrack is amazing, as is the visual design... Though sometimes the highly cinematic camera angles cause some issues. Even so, it's gorgeous. It also takes a lot of risks in terms of story, characters, mechanics, and most of the time all that pays off. I could go on, but instead I'll get right to the point: There is absolutely a way to play this game that will help you enjoy it, and a way that will hinder you. The combat often seems to drag and interrupt the flow of the game as a whole, and the voice acting is... Well, the English voices can be pretty hokey. Unless you're really looking for a challenge and/or really hate subtitles, do yourself a favour: Swallow your pride and play on an easier difficulty than you usually would, with french voices and subtitles in your preferred language. The easier combat lasts just long enough that's it's still fun but doesn't get in the way of the more substantial parts of the game, and the french voices VASTLY improve the tone & feel of the dialogue and cutscenes.

												More people need to play this. It's a great blend of Bladerunner meets Tomb Raider meets old skool Beat em' Up. Graphics and art design are terrific and Neo Paris is beautiful and intricate from the slums to the rich snob areas.Nilin is a great character and you really get a good sense of who she is and what she's feeling. The soundtrack is kickass and there are lots of collectibles and achievements for the OCD guys.  props to Elysia for hooking me up with this unique and original adventure. Also she got a nice butt.

												2 hours in and first impressions are good ;)Ok so it’s linear and not really anything we haven’t seen before, but it’s well done and polished, and it oozes atmosphere.The game is pretty and the music is well used and well done, some of the small effects like the digital interference when your energy is low are very nice, the whole visuals are reminiscent of Ridleys blade runner and Bessons 5th element, the entire package has a distinctly European feel to it, which is a pleasant change.The style of play is tomb raider meets teken, a sort of running jumping climbing on ledges with generic hand to hand combat combo move fighting thrown in. There are some clever visual which make you go ""oooh nice"" every now and then and reach for the screen shot button.The memory altering sections are also a nice break from the fighty climby bits.If you’re looking for a way to spend a few hours playing a stylish story/film style game with some nice clever touches I would recommend REMEMBER ME. When it’s on sale it’s a deffo purchase.Please DEVS high end texture packs for PC are always a welcome edition (sometimes the xbox shows) ;) "

												Two words: pure awesomeness! I decided to get this game just by looking at its pic with title and main heroine on it, saying ""damn, she looks badass so the game must be the same too!"". And guess what, I wasn't wrong. Futuristic setting, interesting and unique plot, amazing graphics, great and badass character with a brilliant design and on the top of it all incredible music which wraps everything together, creating an atmosphere you won't forget. The only downside is that the gameplay's linear so I'm pretty sure some people might find that annoying but it's still definitely worth playing! If you're into futuristic and cyberpunk-ish stuff then I can assure you - you won't regret playing it!Hope to see a sequel of this game one day. Kudos to the creators!			"

												This game was quite something. I'm personally a fan with the whole topic of mind experiments and to what extend humanity can reach for a new world development, not to mention this game made it look in a way I didn't really though of: a dystopia. Gameplay has its regular fightning mechanics and the twist is that you can configure your own combos from specific animations, you can do any configuration but at some point you will need to make a standard build which most likely won't be visually appretizing, but hey, it works efficiently! Soundtrack is very well made (fan of orchestral music) and gives this game a great sci-fi aspect.Gameplay 9/10Graphics 9/10Story 8/10Soundtrack 9.5/10A game with linear gameplay, interesting combat mechanics, great story and an amazing soundtrack.

												Without a doubt, this game has one of the best soundtracks in video game history. On that alone, I recommend a playthrough of the game. The visual design is also quite spectacular, and every time the camera shifts or pans into a vista, you can really see the detail in the game's environments. Unforunately, in the early part of the game, you spend a lot of time in some pretty boring and lackluster settings.Combat, in particular, the combo lab system, is a bit obtuse in the beginning. Once you realize the freedom you have in customizing a combo to give you extra damage, regen, or cooldown bonus, it's pretty simple to figure out the best order for your playstyle. The melee fighting behaves very similarly to the Batman Arkham games, where stringing combos and dodging at the ""!"" prompts allows you to wipe the floor in most cases. The boss fights are particularly fun when the game throws a good mix of enemy types for you to handle all at once. They can get tricky, and I had the most fun in those scenarios.Certain cinematic moments (particularly a certain chase sequence) can leave you frustrated due to its trial-and-error nature. Thankfully, that kind of stuff does not happen often.The story is enjoyable enough, particularly near the end, and if you're open to some cheesy sci-fi, you'll have a good time. Don't expect to be blown away, though.Again, I can't stress enough how much the music in this game makes it for me. Without that glitchy, up-tempo, orchestral soundtrack, I don't think I could recommend the game as much. It makes that much of a difference. If anything, get the soundtrack if you really don't want to play the game, though the two go hand-in-hand rather beautifully.			"

												""Remember Me"" had a hard time finding a publisher, since the makers didn't want to compromise on the main character being a woman. Apparently, publishers thought that because most gamers are male, they wouldn't want to play as the opposite gender (uhh, Tomb Raider series?) and would feel awkward watching ""themselves"" if there were love scenes involved.Now Capcom has added the title to their range of games. All is still not perfect - from what I heard, they still meddled by asking for a planned love story to be removed. And as a woman, I cannot help but notice what form-fitting clothing the main character is wearing. But well.The story plays in late 21st century Neo-Paris where 99% of society have the ""Sensen"", a brain implant that allows to share and erase memories. Traumatic events can now be made forgotten, lovers can gain a greater understanding for each other by experiencing their partner's life, entertainment consists in downloading pleasant memories for cash. We start into the game as Nilin, a young woman waking up in La Bastille while her memory is being erased. Without any idea who she is, she is helped to escape by a mysterious figure and soon learns that she was a memory hunter. Memory hunters steal important memories from others, but Nilin could do more: She could remix memories to make people believe key events in their past played out differently. Now, she must find out more about who she is and soon notices the many downsides to the Sensen technology that has transformed society. She is at a focal point of it all and could well change everything ...Gameplay-wise, ""Remember Me"" borrows from other games, but it works well enough. There is a lot of hands-on combat that clearly took its inspiration from ""Batman: Arkham Asylum"", and I heard that Nilin's wall-climbing antics are similar to""Prince of Persia"" - no idea, haven't played it. The combat system adds the use of special punch/kick combos that can score a lot of damage, refill Nilin's health or her energy bar for special moves or multiply the the aforementioned effects. It's a new idea for once, although I never really had to use the highest combination and only had to start thinking about combinations around the second half of the game. Admittedly it was a bit confusing at first, and that they named things here so weirdly - Pressen, S-Pressen, PMP, Sensen DOS etc. - wasn't helping.Over the course of events, Nilin will also steal memories to help her access places and - cool idea - remix memories. Those latter segments allow for some fun experimentation: We see an event happen, then can rewind it and change various details, then see how the course of events is changed. While there is only one combination that will lead to the goal, the element of discovery here is also interesting.For me, the game was a mix of fun and frustration. Fun when things ran smoothly and the story rolled on, frustration at sometimes having to learn things by heart, like e.g. where to run while a helicopter's firing at you or, worst of it, the quick-time events at the end of a boss fight. Imagine already having drained the boss' energy to the lowest level, only having to finish things off, and then you're required to look intensely at the screen, waiting for several symbols (punch, kick, use, jump) in a row to flash up and quickly hit the key. You didn't see them clearly enough or weren't fast enough? Tough luck, back into the fight it goes. Bite marks on the keyboard may ensue.Overall, it's a solid experience with lovingly detailed graphics and a game I'd recommend. Not perfect, but something that's still fun to play.			"

												This is a great game. I had a blast playing it. I play 99% of my games with keyboard and mouse, but I don’t recommend it with this game. In fact when I switched to my Xbox controller for PC the game mechanics and combat just worked 100% better. The game has cool features I don’t remember encountering in other games. You can build your own combos with certain bonuses in them such as healing, or special ability cool down decreaser. The enemies are fun each type you have to find the right tactic and/or combo to counter them. This keeps the fights interesting throughout the game. There is also a feature in the game where you can hack someone’s brain and change their memories by altering small things and see how it plays out until you get the result you are looking for. The story is strong and a little emotional. I got this game on sale around 20 bucks and I think that it’s a fair price. It took around 12 hours to complete. After you are done you can jump to different levels to complete achievements you may have missed. Graphically the game is awesome; very detailed and polished. I rate this 89/100. The city could have been a little more open and I wish I could have gotten a little more detailed with the combos.			"

												Amazingly underrated game with one of the most original worlds in recent times. I saw some of its concept art floating around the internet before finding out what game it belonged to, and those pieces, while great, don't do that game any justice when you actually see the game in motion. Every piece of art has been translated over into the game world flawlessly.The story is reminiscent of creative works such as Ghost in the Shell, Blade Runner, Total Recall, and the such, which I'm sure without a doubt that those works had a huge influence on its narrative, and its very telling in its aesthetic that it definitely took influence from those. The combat system is kind of like the rythmic sort of combat that's become the norm in a lot of action games, such as the Batman Arkham series of games, or for example Assassin's Creed. The game also allows you to build your own combos, with a variety of different effects that you can unlock and choose from, in an a la carte type customization. While not that long of a game, I do think it is a very engrossing one, although my one constant complaint that I would have with this game is that the camera isn't the greatest, in fact it can be pretty frustrating to deal with sometimes, but it's really not that much of a hassle once you get used to it. I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for an action game, something with an original story, and with an interesting world. It's a shame that this didn't get much exposure, or money, so I kind of doubt that it'll get a sequel. Which is a disappointment, since original games like this are few and far in between in a modern market saturated with sequels or adaptations of already existing IP's,			"

												Story: set in the year 2084 in Paris which is called Neo Paris. You can hear that in game. It revolves around a Corpotation called Memorize that invented a brain implant called Sensen. Which allows the user to upload, share and edit the unpleasent memories. This gives Memorize a fair deal of control over the population. This in turns turns the City into a surveillance state. But with all surveillance states there usually is a group that do not aggree. In this we have a group of rebeles forming under the name Errorists. They basicly want to bring Memorize down. So to start you are Nilin a female Errorist imprisoned in a fortress called Bastille. Where you nearly have all your memories wiped by Memorize. In the final part of having the remaining memories wiped. You are saved/helped to escape the fortress by a man called Edge who turns out to be the leader of the Errorists. Edge explains that you are special and are gifted, able to Steal and remix memories. You are taken through the Story. Guided by Edge who you only hear over your com device. After doing your first remix on the bounty hunter Olga you set on your path to bring down Memorize.The Graphics: The game was brought to us back in June 2013. I remember playing it on my laptop and I was impressed back then. I can say now that I have played it again on my new rig built back in June 2015. The game still holds up for me. Very Impressive in my view. There is some things that can be improved on. But that is always there. Game play: Its not openworld. Its got plently of action which can get a bit repeating but when in that mood to kick butt is very satisfying, combined with the combo lab which allows you to set up your own fighting style pre say. It has amazing memory sences were you get to remix memories trying different ways to reach that goal. The voice acting was good from what was there. Would have been nice to have more characters to interact with. Seeing more of the group to. Even a base of sorts.Controls: I tend to use mouse n Keyboard because thats what I mainly skilled myself in. Well this game certainly covers that. Allowing you to mess with your bindings. It does appear that it supports gamepads. The Music: The music. What can I say. I have listend to many. From games like Morrwind, Fallout, Mass effect and they all have the inpacting music tracks, that just stick with you and fit the game. Well with Remember me, it did that to. It showed its style and futuristic grace very well. It certainly fits the game nicely. I do love it when a sound track fits.The Reply Value: Would I play it again. Yes, I would the story hooked me the character Nilin. Yeah shes hot, but it was also the fact what happened to her and the time setting to. Plus now that I have noticed they are pretty much wanting to do Remember Me 2. But supposidly no longer viable with Capcom. I am hoping they change their mind or even have another publisher. Who will give the support. As I would defo replay this one again. Even now I would replay it agian. Just like some of the other games I have play them once a year and repeatedly enjoy them.Bug/Glitches: I did notice one thing but might have just been a sound issue on my side than the game. At two points the game sound just went out with like a little pop. But came back if you went to the game menu and back into the game. Not sure if thats just my sound system trolling me or the game. Other than that there was nothing that really poped out at me.Overall: Story is great, graphics are lovely, game play is good defo room for improvement and maybe bit more openworld. Defo more interaction to and characters. Controls perfectly fine. Music just minted. Replay value defo there. Plus if they bring in number 2. Bugs/Glitches as I said propably just my sound system. But it did not really effect my game enjoyment much at all. I have to say I give this game a 9 paws out of ten. This is certainly a game I would recomend.			"

												Remember Me is fantastic work.  First of all, if you think MP is some kind of Holy Grail of gaming, or that 'Collectibles' are a modern trend that is core to gaming, then steer clear of Remember Me.  It's not for you.  This has been made by a team of artists and designers who had a big vision for a game and saw through a pretty good contender for a long-lasting favourite.This game can be over fairly quickly if you rush the lot.  Don't - I like a game that lets me walk rather than run.  Check out the grand amazing vistas, the grime of the grungier parts of town, look for your journal entries, get absorbed, and this is far longer than most attempts at a SP campaign in cinematic game offerings at the moment.  The repeating levels was a minor 'hmmm' however there is a good reason for each revisit and reinforces the impact of your actions in the story-line.  This said, it felt a little restricted to too few areas for such a big city, never mind the injured world itself.  I came across a couple of bugs where the game hadn't registered a combat or action success and I had to restart the last checkpoint (minutes spend repeating myself, but there were just minutes.)  Combat threatens to become repetitive however that's avoided if you play as they mean you to - tactically, fluidly, and adapting.The soundtrack has been crafted with the game themes in mind.  The acting is some of the best I've heard in a game in ages, particularly Nilin, whose actress does help keep you in the mood and pace of the scene.  On this note, atmosphere is rich, as is the world you're running in - again, you can tell how much effort has gone into this project when close attention as been paid to architecture on varying levels of modern on top of classic, with plenty of evidence of life.The game's pace keeps you continually upgrading via a system of memory recollection (which basically works like experience). Apparently the combat has come under fire from some reviewers but I don't see the problem - you are clearly given the approach to take with different enemies, and if you forgot, check the Journal.  The game allows up to four combo sequences into which you can place hits and kicks of different properties.  You customise your combos to give you what you need - timing your combos is key to success, and for me, this works.  It's a very accessible tactical approach to avoid mindless button mashing. The other aspect of the game which I really liked was the memory remixing.  This isn't an idea milked to death, and sees you rewinding and pausing memories, altering details to change the outcome, and the target's motivations.  It's very linear, and I was even a little frustrated when certain obstacles that the acrobatic Nillin could clearly get over acted as invisible walls, or insurmountable set pieces (I do like to climb on stuff).To finish off, back to the storyline - it went to places I didn't anticipate and in the end I was treated to an excellent bit of sci-fi, with a back story of decent depth if you care to look for it.  And you should, because the origin of this dystopia helps understanding it all.  The writing is on top form - some of the baddies and tough goodies are pretty standard but the story behind the world is well thought through.

												I bought the retail version of the game when it came out, admittedly taken by its visuals and its concept but unsure if it would be worth the money I paid.  I am not too keen on using controllers when I play games so unfortunately I played Remember Me a little bit then shelved it. Recently playing another Capcom game with a similar concept led me to dust Remember Me off and replay it. So here is my belated thoughts of the game:I'm going to start with its combat because there is so little to be said about it. If you have played games such as the Batman Arkham series and do not mind the combo building style of combat and platforming, then Remember Me will not disappoint you, however if combat like this is not your cup of tea and you are not fan of hanging from high buildings, then you will be very frustrated while playing Remember Me (especially on the hardest difficulty). On the other hand, if you are not too fussed about the combat and are more interested in a very well told story, amazing art work coming to life with perfectly executed graphical design, as well as interesting characters and enemies, then this is a must-play for you. Not to mention, the soundtrack is quite good and the voice-over acting is flawless. It was also nice to play a female protoganist that was desinged very well with a realistic attitude and body posture, and not running around in bikinis. The setting is in 2084 Neo-Paris. The details in the environment, characters, and enemies are amazing. I recommend you try and find all the collectibles (as some of them are very well hidden and will take you to every nook and cranny). The audio is flawless, from the music and the enviornmental sound to the voice acting, especially the voice acting which is very professionally done - it definately puts the player in the right mood.Despite of the unfortunate events the protoganist goes through, her desperation is just, without sounding needy. The rest of the voice acting is also perfect, as it gives you the correct emotions towards the other characters, (such as liking or disliking them, getting annoyed by them or feeling sympathy for them). The physique of the character in my opinion stands out - recently the protogonists in video games have been on the extreme side of appearances (especially females with unrealistic body shapes that in the real world would make it impossible to do the things they do in games). However in this one, the protognist (Nilin) is designed perfectly to play the role of the fast, agile and lean heroine without going over the board and shadowing her feminity. The most important thing that captured me about this game was the main concept of the game, playing with people's memories. I found it quite unique and I don't think I came across anything like this before in a game. It was very refreshing.(TL;DR Version) I highly recommend this game to players who are looking for story-rich, beautifully designed game with Batman Arkham series style of gameplay, set in Neo-Paris with a unique concept.

												Without a doubt, this game has one of the best soundtracks in video game history. On that alone, I recommend a playthrough of the game. The visual design is also quite spectacular, and every time the camera shifts or pans into a vista, you can really see the detail in the game's environments. Unforunately, in the early part of the game, you spend a lot of time in some pretty boring and lackluster settings.Combat, in particular, the combo lab system, is a bit obtuse in the beginning. Once you realize the freedom you have in customizing a combo to give you extra damage, regen, or cooldown bonus, it's pretty simple to figure out the best order for your playstyle. The melee fighting behaves very similarly to the Batman Arkham games, where stringing combos and dodging at the ""!"" prompts allows you to wipe the floor in most cases. The boss fights are particularly fun when the game throws a good mix of enemy types for you to handle all at once. They can get tricky, and I had the most fun in those scenarios.Certain cinematic moments (particularly a certain chase sequence) can leave you frustrated due to its trial-and-error nature. Thankfully, that kind of stuff does not happen often.The story is enjoyable enough, particularly near the end, and if you're open to some cheesy sci-fi, you'll have a good time. Don't expect to be blown away, though.Again, I can't stress enough how much the music in this game makes it for me. Without that glitchy, up-tempo, orchestral soundtrack, I don't think I could recommend the game as much. It makes that much of a difference. If anything, get the soundtrack if you really don't want to play the game, though the two go hand-in-hand rather beautifully.			"

												Remember Me is fantastic work.  First of all, if you think MP is some kind of Holy Grail of gaming, or that 'Collectibles' are a modern trend that is core to gaming, then steer clear of Remember Me.  It's not for you.  This has been made by a team of artists and designers who had a big vision for a game and saw through a pretty good contender for a long-lasting favourite.This game can be over fairly quickly if you rush the lot.  Don't - I like a game that lets me walk rather than run.  Check out the grand amazing vistas, the grime of the grungier parts of town, look for your journal entries, get absorbed, and this is far longer than most attempts at a SP campaign in cinematic game offerings at the moment.  The repeating levels was a minor 'hmmm' however there is a good reason for each revisit and reinforces the impact of your actions in the story-line.  This said, it felt a little restricted to too few areas for such a big city, never mind the injured world itself.  I came across a couple of bugs where the game hadn't registered a combat or action success and I had to restart the last checkpoint (minutes spend repeating myself, but there were just minutes.)  Combat threatens to become repetitive however that's avoided if you play as they mean you to - tactically, fluidly, and adapting.The soundtrack has been crafted with the game themes in mind.  The acting is some of the best I've heard in a game in ages, particularly Nilin, whose actress does help keep you in the mood and pace of the scene.  On this note, atmosphere is rich, as is the world you're running in - again, you can tell how much effort has gone into this project when close attention as been paid to architecture on varying levels of modern on top of classic, with plenty of evidence of life.The game's pace keeps you continually upgrading via a system of memory recollection (which basically works like experience). Apparently the combat has come under fire from some reviewers but I don't see the problem - you are clearly given the approach to take with different enemies, and if you forgot, check the Journal.  The game allows up to four combo sequences into which you can place hits and kicks of different properties.  You customise your combos to give you what you need - timing your combos is key to success, and for me, this works.  It's a very accessible tactical approach to avoid mindless button mashing. The other aspect of the game which I really liked was the memory remixing.  This isn't an idea milked to death, and sees you rewinding and pausing memories, altering details to change the outcome, and the target's motivations.  It's very linear, and I was even a little frustrated when certain obstacles that the acrobatic Nillin could clearly get over acted as invisible walls, or insurmountable set pieces (I do like to climb on stuff).To finish off, back to the storyline - it went to places I didn't anticipate and in the end I was treated to an excellent bit of sci-fi, with a back story of decent depth if you care to look for it.  And you should, because the origin of this dystopia helps understanding it all.  The writing is on top form - some of the baddies and tough goodies are pretty standard but the story behind the world is well thought through.  The dystopia rose from a humanitarian ideal, brought down by greed, with a broken well of regret and pain at its core.  You'll be forced to take actions you question.  Is it right to enslave public menaces and monsters?  Is it right to change who a person is for a greater good? etc.  The plot delves deep into the important characters (including Nillin of course) and by the end, the world has changed.This game could have been incredible, it could have been a lot more, but there's still enough to appreciate.Easy test now: If you're still reading, this is a game you shouldn't miss.

												Remember Me is in my eyes a totally underrated game if you're only a little bit into this type of game. It feels like a great cocktail of Mirror's Edge, Tomb Raider and Batman Arkham Series. The game takes place in the year 2084 in a world shaken by nature after the ice melted and a company invented a brain implant to manage your memories.Pros:* The visuals are astonishing. I really dug into the art style. Take a look at some of the screenshot and it will look even better in motion.* The sound/music is awesome, too. Great compositions and dynamic mixes (e.g. for fights).* The story! It great. You must play it to experience that on your own. Made me think what's going on in my head once or twice. ;-)* The love for details. I felt really impressed on how much work they invested into (small) details. Floating signs telling you the store is closed, but the website is online or to watch your step close to an edge, just make the world to feel complete. The memos you can find, will tell you stuff like details about the history of the world.* Memory Remixs: During the game you have to manipulate a couple of memories which is done by ""scrolling"" the memory forward and backward and change simple things like the position of a chair which may make the scene to come to a whole different ending.OKs:* Fights are like Batman, but not that fluid. You've got lots of enemies and mixed up types. So you have to manage your techniques and modify your combos to match new challenges. During fights you bulld up focus which allows you to trigger special moves you're granted through the story.* Traversing the linear levels is basically straightforward. The climb/jump/shimmy stuff feels like Tomb Raider, although there's always a marker pointing where to go. All over the level are hidden powerups/memos so you have to look left and right.* There are quick time events in the boss fights. They may feel cool, but I don't like them when they force me to repeat stupid stuff (like part of the fight before) when I press the wrong button.Contras:* I had some control issues (keyboard+mouse) with an action scene where you're chased by a madman in an armed helicopter. Dunno if they were not precise enough or if it was just me.* One boss fight is somehow plain stupid as its extremly repetitive. It took some tries to get the basics and then it was not really fun. All other bosses felt much better designed.Overall: You have to play it yourself!			"

												An underrated game. Yes the controls are lacking (as is often the case with console portages, looking at you Darksiders) and the camera can be frustrating. The combat can also be a bit clunky and gets admittedly a tad boring after a while when compared to other titles. The game is also linear, but then again any story-driven game HAS to be quite linear by definition, the only regret is the lack of exploration inside the levels like what Dishonored (which is the embodiment of ""linearity of the story but complete freedom during each mission"") did. But you know what ? Nobody cares about this.The first good thing about the game are its gorgeous graphics and soundtrack, which is something I don't acknowledge most of the time. Then there's Nilin, one of the most interesting and endearing main characters I've seen, and this game also allows itself the luxury of playing the ""amnesic heroine"" card correctly, which is often used as a pretext to have a dull hero. Here it's the exact opposite. The other characters are also quite interesting (especially Edge), although they obviously get quite a bit less screen time. Then there's the plot itself, which is really done in a nice way with a few interesting twists. Of course cynics will always find a way to criticize it for using ""obvious clichés"" but seriously it's one of the best storylines I've seen in a videogame in a very long time. On top of that, the game asks a few very interesting and important moral/ethics questions (what would the world be if we could change memories ? Can you trust anything you know when people out there have the ability to change your memories into whatever they want ? How do those people live it ?), which is something that's a bit too lacking in recent games.In the end, we have a movie trapped in the body of a videogame. This is very obviously intended for the theaters (perhaps this is what happens when a game studio hires too many creative people/writers and not enough engineers ?), but due to the low amount of sales it's sadly an unlikely possibility. Because of this, we'll have to settle for this interactive story and forgive the gameplay defaults. Because everything else is really worth it.			"

												Amazingly underrated game with one of the most original worlds in recent times. I saw some of its concept art floating around the internet before finding out what game it belonged to, and those pieces, while great, don't do that game any justice when you actually see the game in motion. Every piece of art has been translated over into the game world flawlessly.The story is reminiscent of creative works such as Ghost in the Shell, Blade Runner, Total Recall, and the such, which I'm sure without a doubt that those works had a huge influence on its narrative, and its very telling in its aesthetic that it definitely took influence from those. The combat system is kind of like the rythmic sort of combat that's become the norm in a lot of action games, such as the Batman Arkham series of games, or for example Assassin's Creed. The game also allows you to build your own combos, with a variety of different effects that you can unlock and choose from, in an a la carte type customization. While not that long of a game, I do think it is a very engrossing one, although my one constant complaint that I would have with this game is that the camera isn't the greatest, in fact it can be pretty frustrating to deal with sometimes, but it's really not that much of a hassle once you get used to it. I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for an action game, something with an original story, and with an interesting world. It's a shame that this didn't get much exposure, or money, so I kind of doubt that it'll get a sequel. Which is a disappointment, since original games like this are few and far in between in a modern market saturated with sequels or adaptations of already existing IP's,			"

												I have discovered this game through Steam so I thought it was the proper place to write an review on where i founded the game ironic huh? I wasn't so sure if i was going purchase this game but I saw the Trailer, Read the Description and Look at the screenshots and it caught my attention right away. So i ended up buying at the risk of whether or not if i was going to seriously enjoy it. It turns out my overally experience for this game was just ideally flawless I was amazing on how well scripted this game and how much my predicitions were all wrong Dontnod entertainment did an awesome job with an awesome storyline on their part. The Second thing I thought was amazing was just the action alone you had to think every second on when to encounter the leapers/guards and it was well challenged. Another Thing that interest me was the customizations and the sensen powers who knew Niin (Sorry if i actually spelled her name wrong) would have the power to overdrive memories, control what happens and remix memories that just amazed me a lot and Dontnod Entertiament has an pretty interesting idea of the future but who knows what might happen. I got this game when it was on the community sale during the Steam Winter Sale and Even if i did pay the full retail price i would still made the risk regardless. Its well worth your money and you can always go back and redo the story on a harder level. Rating 10/10			"

												This game goes on sale all the time and I feel it's worth the sale price. Has some lush environments but the combat, while having some novelty with the customization of combos to deal more damage or restore your health, is slow and monotonous.Likewise, the story has some interesting aspects but I wasn't too invested. One of the problems was the severely underutilized ""memory remixing,"" which is one of the game's key selling points (I think there were only 3, which was quite a shame since they are very good). If there were more then I think the story/characters could've been improved.Anyways, the game was enjoyable but certainly won't blast your socks off.			"

												Pros:Has Steam Achievements and badge trading cards. Comparable to the Batman games.Great graphics, maps, voiceovers, plot, story, action.Cons:There is some problems with the remix sequences, but doable.Can use gamepad for better fighting but harder to move through maps.Keyboard and mouse is harder for combat but helps on moving through maps.Is sort of buggy, but playable.  Need better instructions and tutorial.The automatic camera system is terrible though, you can use something to move the camera view.There is no clear detailed stats on what each individual skill does.  Gameplay is Ok, but has annoying QTE parts in the bossfights.Be a great game for those that like melee fighting games and platformers.  Buy When on Sale.Remember Me is a Wall crawling and melee combat game set in 2084 Neo Paris. Very Cyberpunk environment.  Very challenging even on easy mode.  You will need to learn to use combat moves correctly to make it to end.  Bosses and combat gets progressively harder, with larger groups of attackers at times.  Main Character is great at free climbing and jumping and the path has plenty of: ledges, pipes, hand holds, ladders, jumps, leaps, drops, dangerous areas and rides on objects.  MC is a melee fighter, she runs into preprogramed fights a lot along her linear path.  There is health stations and other pickups hidden along the route and the auto save is helpful.  The path is shown by arrows on the Augmented Reality viewer, but hard to see the path sometimes.  The automatic camera system is terrible though, you can use something to move the camera view.MC has several combo attacks choices LMB is a 3 hit combo, RMB is 6 hit combo, and 8 hit combo and you have other modes that you can activate after gathering focus and has cooldowns.  The combo attack skills are unlocked and can be placed in any order, but there is no clear detailed stats on what each individual skill does.  MC also can steal and manipulate memories, so there are memory remix puzzles and path guides.  For more info:

												This is absolutely worth playing if you're into sci-fi at all, especially the kind of near-future sci-fi that deals with new technologies that reveal something about the human condition, a la Deus Ex: HR. This is unfortunately not nearly as well-written or engaging as Deus Ex, but it does present a similar sort of experience (and with much better graphics. Worse music though). Remember Me runs really well too, and plays great-- the fighting is actually really fun despite the terrible lack of enemy variety, and the ability to nimbly leap over enemies as you're comboing them really makes you feel like you're controlling a skilled fighter (serioulsy, the nimbleness is off the hook here, and a nice departure from the usual cover-based face-shooting of Every Other Action Game Ever). The main character Nilin is another reason to play-- the character model is really a nice design, and i love the way she gets all out of breath after running a lot and the way she kind of looks around while  she's walking-- these are great details that really add to you caring about her. Hell, play it just because you get to play as a cool biracial French woman with a sweet haircut instead of the usual Generic Beefcake White Dude-- an extremely refreshing departure on this count as well (and if it bothers you that everyone is speaking English in a game set in freaking Paris, there's actually the option to switch the audio to French with English subtitles, so if you're a great big hipster like me and want it to seem more authentic then you're in luck). Short version: very nice looking and never frustratingly difficult, and although the story is basically a Luc Besson movie stretched over ten hours, it does at least broach on an interesting subject and also makes you care about the character and what happens to her. Definitely a solid purchase if you're into Sci-Fi, though if you're not you can probably skip it unless, again, you want the rare experience of playing a game where the character isn't like the character in every other game out there.

												Remember Me is the first game made by one of my personal favorite geme developers, DONTNOD Entertainment. The game is a 3rd person brawler with platforming. The combat system in this game is unique and I found it very entertaining. You get customisable combos. Each combo has a set combination. Lets take the combo X,Y,Y,X,Y,Y. The buttons  for this combo is set. The first button of a combo will always do damage. The functions of the rest can be altered. You can customize this combo to do the following: X (Damage), Y (Heal), Y (Damage), X (Deacrease abilities cooldown), Y (Heal), Y (Double all effects). There are countless other ways to customize this combo. Unfortunetley there are only 4 combos to customize. Its still a great system and you can only perfom a combo if you press the next button as a hit connects. The platforming is very linear and easy. The only problem I had with the platfoming is that Nillin sometimes missed a ledge  she should have been able to grab. You play as Nillin, a memory hunter that escapes from prison in the opening section of the game. You are helped by Edge, another memory hunter. The story is really well told and the world of Neo-Paris is amazingly well realized. There is not a lot of items to interact with and sometimes the world feels more like a display than a real place. The world is still breathtaking and mostly immersive. Hidden logs helps expand this world further. Remember Me is a great game that I would recommend to everyone.P.S. There are one cringe worthy saying in this game thats just laughable. That is a greeting. ""Remember you soon.			"

												What makes this game great is the mix of beautiful graphics, the interesting female protagonist of color, the combat system, the thrilling story and the adrenalizing soundtrack. It surely isn't the greatest video game ever created but sadly immensely underrated; it offers so much new since you're not in your generic white American town and the plot actually isn't already overused. While the main story only takes about 10 hours to finish and there are no side missions, it has a great replay worth since you can create completely different fighting combinations which, especially on memory hunter mode, give the game a whole new level of difficulty.Please give this game a try, if you're not willing to spend 30 bucks wait for the steam sales when it drops down to 6, and immerse yourself in the beautiful world of Neo Paris!

												Remember Me was, well.. memerable.  From the voice acting to the cinematography.  Simply a beautiful game.  Visual/audio 90/100.  The fighting/action and mechanics were easy to master and not very hard or complicated.  There were a few times where it bugged out just a bit. Some Boss battles required you to learn timing and triggers and became a little predictable.  Over all 75/100.Story was linear but well done with a few suprises thrown in to keep you involved. 80/100.A nice feature of the game was reminicent of Mirrors Edge.I kept wanting to yell Parkour after jumping from ledge to ledge to overhang.  Parkour!All-in-All I would give it an 80/100.  I would recommend Remember Me for someone looking to be told a story and enjoy a visual experience.			"

Remember you soon!   That is what the game says, and that is what I would say to the game. No doubt, you have to play Remember me.You ask why? Because it is one of the most original games I've ever played. Interesting story, excellent game art, stunning soundtrack performed by an orchestra, unique level design. Even the starting menu looks great. But, unfortunately, this game is not perfect. The reason of this is not a bad gameplay. Even though the combat system was critiicized by lots of gamers, for me, it seems OK. Looked a bit complicated at first, but after some time I got used to it and, actually, got fun from gme fights.   So, my main complain about this game - bad face animation. Good game art hides most of the graphic flaws, but when it comes to looking at some character's face closely, while one is talking to somebody - all face animation problems become visible. Often face emotions just do not combine with a nice voice acting, spoiling impression about the game.   Another complain is not being able to go back after some checkpoints. Oftenly I missed some secrets just because chose the wrong door that lead me to the next story episode.  But, in spite of all, I liked Remember me. And I will definitely play this remarkable game again.My personal rating for it - 8/10.			"

												This game had lots of potentials, but lost it all. Simply put, it's a terrible console port. - the gameplay is terrible- the control is terrible- the camera movements are terrible- sound is buggy- fight system is overcomplicated- memory remix scenes are hard to control- bossfights are too long and annoying- countless other bugs, mistakes fails and so on.At least:- the graphic designers did an awesome job, the enviroments look really good. I had to finish the ♥♥♥♥ing game at 66% because the Johnny Greenteeth bossfight bugged and the game didn't let me continue. I did it again, same happened. It thought I'm still in the fight and didn't open the door to continue. This was the  ♥♥♥♥ing last straw, I ragequitted and deleted this crap. Save your money and especially your time, don't buy this crap.			"

Product received for free
												Disclaimer: I bought Remember Me on sale (80% off) and refunded it after about an hour of playtime. Hence the ""received product for free"" annotation.The narrative is quite interesting. Remember Me plays in a cyberpunk-ish world where memories have monetary value, and thus are being stolen and traded on a black market.The Gameplay is split up in combat, climbing sections and memory alteration puzzles. The puzzles are not necessarily hard, but with its groundhogday-ish nature they're quite entertaining.The predetermined combo button strings and enemies with too much HP results in ridiculously boring combat. Climbing and platformer sections are really, REALLY boring on-rails sections that look a lot like prince of persia, but doesn't play anything like it.Cutscenes are unskippable. This is a game that you want to play for the story and the story alone. Get it if the story concept interests you, but not if you're looking for a good Beat 'Em Up.			"

												Gameplay:  Good.  The combat is easy to pick up.  The combo system is solid.  There's a combo system that is customizable and easy to pick up.  The special abilities are useful, and executing combos rewards you by letting you use more special abilities.  The remixes are neat and unique.  There are a few puzzles, and they are quite easy and logical.Graphics:  Great.  This game is gorgeous.  There world is lovingly created, and it shows.  Neo Paris looks great, and the characters look amazing.Plot:  Great.  This is one of the few games where the plot is very original.  The plot moves along quite nicely, with just enough mystery to keep you wanting to know more.  There are some nice twists along the way.   The plot, and world envisioned here is good enough to be a good movie.Cons:  Some of the fights, you're not quite sure what to do.  The game eventually gives you some hints on what to do if it thinks you're stuck.  Overall a very minor quibble.			"

												Remember Me is the first game made by one of my personal favorite geme developers, DONTNOD Entertainment. The game is a 3rd person brawler with platforming. The combat system in this game is unique and I found it very entertaining. You get customisable combos. Each combo has a set combination. Lets take the combo X,Y,Y,X,Y,Y. The buttons  for this combo is set. The first button of a combo will always do damage. The functions of the rest can be altered. You can customize this combo to do the following: X (Damage), Y (Heal), Y (Damage), X (Deacrease abilities cooldown), Y (Heal), Y (Double all effects). There are countless other ways to customize this combo. Unfortunetley there are only 4 combos to customize. Its still a great system and you can only perfom a combo if you press the next button as a hit connects. The platforming is very linear and easy. The only problem I had with the platfoming is that Nillin sometimes missed a ledge  she should have been able to grab. You play as Nillin, a memory hunter that escapes from prison in the opening section of the game. You are helped by Edge, another memory hunter. The story is really well told and the world of Neo-Paris is amazingly well realized. There is not a lot of items to interact with and sometimes the world feels more like a display than a real place. The world is still breathtaking and mostly immersive. Hidden logs helps expand this world further. Remember Me is a great game that I would recommend to everyone.P.S. There are one cringe worthy saying in this game thats just laughable. That is a greeting. ""Remember you soon.			"

												Remember MeRating: 8/10Overview: Linear Action/AdventureThe Good:+ Great art style+ I love the setting, taking place in a dystopian cyberpunk Paris. The world /atmosphere looks beautiful  with many different environments. Exploring the slums of the city is contrasted nicely by the clean upper  city buildings. It's a game where you stop to take in the scenery.+ Although very linear the game has excellent pacing, slowly introducing new enemies, environments and  light puzzle solving to keep things moving along nicely. + The combat is going to be hit or miss with many people but I found it to be very enjoyable. You can  customize different combos to fit different purposes. You could have one combo solely for dealing out  damage while another combo heals you. You could also mix and match different things so that a single combo  can deal damage, heal you and recharge your special abilities. Many of these things are slowly unlocked as  you play. The combat itself is where it could use some work, most combat involves inputting a combo and  dodging out of the way. + Collectables that increase health, focus, experience and story packets+ Cool enemy design. + Good boss battles.   + SoundtrackThe Average:The story, characters and voice acting is missed potential. Given the setting, more of the interesting  story details are told in memory packets scattered throughout the world for you to find.  There are moments in the game where you have to 'remix' someone's memory. You can rewind/fast forward  through the memory changing certain things that will alter the outcome. These moments are cool but also  annoying especially if you don't know what to change, you could be stuck for quite a while fiddling with  different things.  The Bad:The voice acting can be pretty bad at timesCan't skip cut scenesConclusionA great game especially for its environments and setting but misses a lot in other areas. I would love to  see a sequel to iron out many of weaker aspects of the game. "

												Remember Me is a perfect example of a game that excels at art direction, style, story and characters, but makes those high points moot when you put your hands on the controller. What could have been an excellent game is ruined by mediocre combat which is riddled with AI issues and just pure jankiness.The sad part is that the one gameplay aspect in Remember Me, called ""Remixing"", is probably the coolest feature I've seen in a game in a while, where you alter cutscenes on the fly to complete a puzzle. But it's only in the game a few times, and is overlooked by the shoddy platforming and fighting.			"

Remember Me. A somewhat dystopian action-adventure centered around a woman suffering a little bit of amnesia and lost in place.Story-wise: You play as Nilin, an young Afro-French prisoner in Paris, 2084, whom has undergone a memory wipe yet clings to her birthname and faint thoughts that lack a connection to anything. Before you were taken away, a voice calls for you. Referring to themselves as ""Edge,"" they tell you to escape, that you do not belong in the facility, seeking a route to a burial dump.Your job is to follow Edge's guidance and find all the puzzle pieces missing to Nilin's memory. Fight off the authority and figure out what is happening in Neo-Paris.ReviewThe GoodProgressing in the game, new and quite interesting characters are introduced that provide a new spice to Nilin's backstory, learning what it is or was that she had planned before being arrested and sedated. The atmosphere of this future city is nicely done as well; major elemnts of the gameplay require some parkour to cross over areas and some combat.The BadWhenever it comes to fighting enemies, the combo system does not allow much and only allow a set of combinations. Building more power for attacks depends on your awareness of enemies surrounding you; meaning that if you push out a series of punches and kicks and suddenly get disrupted by a rear attack, it takes time to rebuild all the lost power. Some parkour sections are difficult sometimes, especially if it wears a pitiful jump across a gap or ledge that may often be hard to accomplish. Though the story is quite interesting, a bit of the twists can be a little predictable or poorly executed.Concluding CommentsIt has given me a lot of decent playtime and features a bit of unique that I hope to say about a lot more games coming in the upcoming future.--Hermix.

												It is very rewarding seeing the story through to the end. Only catch is - you have to be open to accept a new game no matter how many you've played in your lifetime. That is what being a gamer is.I've heard far too many complain about this being done before, I like this game's sci-fi setting along with the plot, amazing visuals, and combat that gives you a feeling of satisfaction after beating up all those bad guys in an uber fancy combo.

												It's a fairly standard sprawling yet linear adventure: think Half-Life 2 and The Last of Us.  Though it is completely on rails, it feels vast, like you're carving a natural path through a huge mega city.  It is also GORGEOUS.  Constantly.  I mean, it may not be the most technically advanced game out there, but it has world design on par with HL2's City 17.  Combat is button-mashing combo junk like Assassin's Creed or Shadows of Murder with annoying QTEs capping off boss fights, which is really the only disappointment the game presents (aside from very restrictive ""platforming"" segments filling out most of the game).  More pleasantly, maybe it's the agile woman protagonist in a French sci-fi setting, or maybe it's thematic parallels between memory access technology and photography, but I feel the spirit of Beyond Good & Evil in abundance here.  As a fairly enjoyable hop and skip through a fantastic dystopian future landscape, I would recommend it for the visuals alone.			"

												This game looks nice but thats pretty much all there is. I had serious trouble to get the game started. Switching it from game dx config to windowed mode helped but once you get to the game, it does look nice and feels nice untill......untill you get into a combat. You need to time your shots, while enemy comes at you. You cant beat them off like let's say in batman games. You are stuck with combos and their combinations and timely executions of a button. This is damn annoying and drives me away from playing the game through. How can something so common be messed up so badly? If you like agonizing timed button presses, get it. If not, don't.			"

												So this is a classic old gem,its a must play must have game with extraordinary story! If you dont like good stories and alot of cutscenes then skip this game.+as said amazing story,the concept is so great there can be a movie or a serie and it`ll kill the competition with no problems+the graphics are stunning even for an older game,and it runs on a older version of unreal engine,but the best part at least for me was the surroundings,the devs really put some effort in making it good looking,also you can force the AA,FXAA,DSR etc to run to give the game even better quality+runs smooth no fps dropping no tearing,glitching,texture failing etc.... -NO! the ingame textures being torn appart are part of the game trust me you`ll get it once you get into the story more :)+its really responsive and fast paced,yeah yeah fast paced but alot of cutscenes....i mean the combat part where you control the character is really good+just amazing concept of mixing the combat styles and abilities plus adding just a bit of reflex momments so its not to much but just enough to have something else in the game+this is a spoiler plus for me this is a great innovation having the ability to remix the memmory of someone and change the story+steam achievements+steam trading cards-there are no DLCs for it,i mean there is one but its more of an addon then a proper DLC,it gives you more combat moves/attacks,there are plenty in game so its not game breaking at all-some minor sound issue,sometimes the sound would just go away,happend to me 3 times during the whole gameplay spent on it,and there is an easy fix just alt+tab out and back in game-even thou it was a standard amount of time spent to complete the game after completing it several times it felt a bit short...-even thou the combat is good it could have been much better i mean adding more combos or letting me edit the positions on the combo to what i want or even grabbing etc,there is sorta grabbing but only for finisher moves-the concept is just amazing but the gameplay is linear,i mean you can only proggress how the devs intented the story to be told,which is still fine cause the story is just amazing,but it would be even greater if there was a choice that you as a player made that had an inpact on the rest of the story....there was room for this to be implemented but maybe in ""Remember me?"" (part2)I give to this game a 8/10 ,old amazing game definetly would suggest it,Try getting it on discount worth every cent,you wont regret a thing.Since many old games had a remaster hopefully this one gets a new engine remaster and then you`ll just get a masterpiece.

												Just played/finished the game (It's a very short game, took me about 7 hours). It's a very interesting concept and story there's no doubt about that. Although I wouldn't say that it touches on our social media at all. It's more on the verge of talking about advancement in technology in regards to how it might affect us on a physical/mental level, which in this case using human memories to regulate our society. It's a game definitely inspired by many other forms of media like the anime Ghost in the Shell and Deus Ex. Deux Ex imo is a far more polished game that literally trumps this one in terms of sheer story, gameplay, and characters. I would say that the plot of this game was ""average"" at best. It was nothing amazing and thought provoking like the 2 forms of media I mentioned earlier. The writing and dialogue is a little tacky, and there's little to no character development. The only character you will really follow is yourself. You don't really interact with many other people at all, and the motives of the people you bring down are quite cliche. I applaud the developers for making an entire world that is ran by people using their memories to get by, but they didn't write a stellar story at all. Gameplay is repititive, but kind of cool for the first hour. The only unique thing this game has is the ""Remix"" sequences, which allows you to tap into a memory, and change it resulting in the victim remembering a fake memory instead of the real one. It's kind of cool, but you only get to do it like 4-5 times. Honestly I would pick this game up if it's on sale, making it like $4. Other than that I would recommend playing Human Revolution, which is a far superior game than this. They're both quite different, but share the same sci-fi like setting, but Deus Ex goes way deeper.			"

												Remember Me is a great little game, though on the surface it might seem like less. If you play games for the gameplay, and not the story, you'll probably be disappointed. Ideas from other games abound. There's some climbing a la Assassin's Creed, but the path is always indicated - there's no exploration to find the best way up. There is one way to progress through each level, not multiple ways, like in Dishonored. The way some exploration mechanics play out may make you think there might be another path through the level, but there isn't. The combat mechanics are ripped straight out of the Batman Arkham series, though with a twist: instead of button mashing, you get to build and individualize your combos. So why do I recommend it? Well, high production values mean great graphics, sound design and some really great music (played by the Philharmonia Orchestra, no less). Lots of screenshot opportunities. The combat system, though derivative, is not a chore, and by the end I was having fun customizing my combos and taking enemies down in different ways. Puzzle solving to get through a level was consistently fun. The story revolves around a search for identity. Memories have become digitizied and commodified; memory hunters (like the main character) can steal and manipulate memories to change others' perception of reality. You play as Nilin, a memory hunter whose memory has been almost completely wiped, but who escapes her captors and spends the rest of the game attempting to discover who she really is (with the help of her faithful assistant / boss, Edge). Though occasionally predictable, the story is told well, helped by good voice acting and tough, thoughtful writing. And the ending, if bittersweet, is very satisfying.  A key part to the concept of memory and motivation is the fun puzzle-system ""the memory remix."" You are presented with a memory and need to alter a sequence of events to change a character's memory of events - and their motivations in the story.  Memory Remixes are very cool, Inception-like sequences that occur multiple times (to the game's credit, it is not over-used). Easily one of the best parts of the game. Remember Me is a fun experience whose story and memory-manipulations just edge it towards the unique. And there are other games (like Alan Wake) whose progress is extraordinarily linear but still manage to tell a unique story via a fun experience. Pick it up on sale for six dollars, and prepare for a fun 8-10 hours.			"

												I am always going to remember this game! Let's talk about what's great. The voice acting is on point, and I'm able to connect with certain characters based on their personalities. The gameplay and graphics are pretty amazing! You get to make your own combos that focus on different aspects of fighting. Also, I really enjoyed the story! I read a lot of reviews before I purchased this game, and a lot of people claimed the story was uninteresting, but I beg to differ. I think the story was absolutely great! It really makes you feel like you're in this world, where memories can be digitised, bought, and sold. I got connected with all the characters, and wanted a happy ending!Now, what exactly is wrong with this game? Well, I believe the game gives aways too many hints on where to go. Remember when your parents would never let you cross the road unless they were holding your hand? Yeah, it felt like that. To be honest, that's the only thing that's wrong with the game. The story takes around ten hours to beat, but that isn't TOO bad! The game also has collectibles you find throughout each episode, which is cool, especially when it gives you a small break of intriguing storyline. Buy and play this game immediately! By the way, Nilin is one hot girl...			"

												Usually, the word ""interesting"" doesn't bode well when discussing art, but Remember Me is interesting in the best possible way. Derivative combat mechanics and uninspired platforming are a small price to pay for the marvelous, high sci-fi world building and characters that are drawn with tenderness and depth. There are sparks of brilliance everywhere, and they burn just about long enough to leave you intrigued rather than frustrated. Being able to customise attack combos is a stimulating diversion, even though there are extremely few options to choose from. The handful of ""memory remix"" sequences are narratively arresting, but ultimately amount to an exercise in trial and error, albeit beautifully realised. Remember Me is a game that lacks conceptual focus and falls back on a lot of tried and tested gameplay conventions to make up for it. However, the gorgeously realised world, compelling plot and fantastic presentation mean that you should definitely give it a chance. I for one will come back for a second playthrough.			"

The Short of ItDespite some imperfections and occasionally frustrating controls, Remember Me is worth buying when it comes on sale if you like a powerful, layered story and complex characters.The Long of ItNilin is a memory hunter, an agent who can wipe or alter other people's memories, changing them to suit her purposes. However, as the game begins, she is in the process of being memory-wiped herself, and with only the barest of memories still left, she manages to escape the facility she was being held in, and finds herself fighting for a cause she doubts, against people whose crimes she doesn't understand. The laser-guided amnesia trope is played straight in this game, but well, since the game is about deleting and altering memories, it is actually justified. Speaking of which, part of the game revolves around altering people's memories to change their allegiances or motivations, with the other part taking place in the real world, focusing on exploration and combat. The memory remixes, as they are called, aren't always intuitive (you don't always know what consequences altering a single memory fragment may bring), but of course, that makes sense, since we don't always know the consequences of small actions in the real world either.When Nilin isn't rooting around in people's brain boxes, she makes her journey through Neo-Paris, a dystopian future city (aren't they all) with a massive gap between rich and poor, and an underground population of monstrous ghouls, cast-offs whose memories have been so vandalized and corrupted they have become nothing but deformed animals. Most of the time, Nilin makes her way to her objective by platforming, dangling off ledges and leaping from one handhold to the other, and while it can get frustrating to fall to one's death because of a wrong button press, thankfully the game creates lots of checkpoints, making the occasional mis-press not disastrous.During her journey, Nilin is often attacked by enemies, because of course she is. In combat, everything depends on how well you can string combinations together and which effects you've assigned to which button press. The combat system, despite being combo based, is relatively easy to get a hang of, because no matter which animation or attack Nilin performs, the timing of the button presses is always the same. The only thing that takes more work to master, and which is paramount in the later sections of the game, is to perform mid-combo dodges and continue the combo right after. Once you get this down, though, combat becomes fun and engaging, with only the camera movement eliciting the occasional frustrated grunt.Combat, however, isn't the main strength of the game, though. In DONTNOD tradition, the main focus is on the story, and Nilin's journey to understanding who she is has a profound effect on players who like to be immersed in a good story. There's the occasional cliché, and yes, also the occasional slightly predictable plot twists, but all this can be easily glossed over because of the fine voice acting (and this time not by the Usual Suspects, but by unknown actors) and the highly credible moral ambiguity the story brings. You'll often find yourself questioning Nilin and the people around her as they achieve their ends by very dubious means.The Right of ItAs mentioned, the story is Remember Me's strong point, as are the scenery and environments, which can be truly gorgeous at some points, and Olivier Derivière's music is memorable without stealing the attention. Combat can be fun, but also frustrating when you're still learning to Miracle Dodge. Once you get it down, though, most of the frustration is left behind, and you can enjoy stringing long, spectacular combos together. But, once again, this game is, in the first place, about story, and again, it's delivered very well. Haters of the Grizzled, Square-Jawed White Male Protagonist will rejoice.The Wrong of ItA few of the sequences in the game qualify as DIAS: Do It Again, Stupid!. There will be a few sections where the game makes you fail over and over again, with no negative consequence, until you 'get it right', using foreknowledge of where the pitfalls will be. The part where you have to flee from Captain Trace in his gunship in particular is an egregious DIAS offender. A few of the battles, mostly against bosses and mini-bosses, also incorporate quick-time events, and we know how much we all hate those. Botch the QTE, and the boss will resist your 'execution move', forcing you to do the last bit of the boss fight again. Well, at least it doesn't cause a game-over.Also, 32 seconds of unskippable logos.The End of ItRemember Me may have its clunky bits, and I know it got a bad rap by 'professional' reviewers, but the actual user reviews don't lie. Yes, it's a console port, but you hardly ever notice that it is, although playing with a controller is highly recommended. It's worth the buy if you like the genre, or if you're a fan of a good story told through a video game. It suffers a bit from the games-as-movies syndrome, but Hell, if it's a good movie, I don't mind.			"

												So this review is for people who haven't played a ""fighting game"" before:  like me before I played this game...and who like to try to get Steam achievements.The story and setting gripped me, which is why I gave this one a chance in the first place.  Let me tell you-- I had so much fun!  I read ""The Fighting Guide for the Frustrated"" guide by Category Theory here on Steam, which at least gave me the impression I wouldn't crash-and-burn on the first boss and abandon the game.  Still, I played on the Easy difficulty (because I know I suck and it was my first game like this).  But by the end, I got almost all (47/50) of the achievements (I did get some help on strats to get some achievements). The only ones I missed were the achievements for finishing the game on Normal and Hard, and killing one boss in less than two minutes. I was on the fence about replaying the game on Normal or Hard to try get the last achievements, so I started a Hard play-though and the first boss kicked my @ss.  I eventually beat him, but it took many tries.  Over time I developed the strats and combos to get through the more difficult sections, and I was truly exhilarated to finish the game on hard (and pick up that boss achievement I missed) to get 100% completion.  I have a love-hate relationship with Steam achievements, but this was a case where the achievements pushed me to levels I would not have otherwise pushed myself, with a very gratifying result.It's not considered a difficult game, and veteran fighting gamers scoff at it, but it gave me a workout, had nice graphics and story, and was just really satisfying and fun.  Also keep in mind that the game is pretty much ""on-rails.""  If you require open world, then you might want to skip it.  I recommended it if the trailer interests you, even if you're not into fighting games.			"

												I'm so glad i didn't missed out on this one.It's a pretty good game, though i can't deny it has it's flaws (but imho it's just minor ones).First things first: You play as Nilin, a Memory-Hunter in Neo-Paris (Year is 2050something).People can actually alter memories, share them and remove unwanted ones.You've lost your memory and escape a facility to search for the truth and your own identity.Gameplay is very similar to the Batman-Arkham Games. You'll fight your way through enemies, using combo-attacks. There are predetermined combos mixing punches and kicks, while you can decide which special ability should be triggered, as you can have an attack either be powerful, giving a bit of health back to you or shortening the cooldown-time of your more powerful skills.It's an interesting concept and i found myself playing around with it, trying different playstyles.The graphic is very good and has a great artstyle.The story is also quite good, and keeps you interested (at least it did for me).One of the more unique features, to actually alter memories to give it a different outcome (plays a bit like watching a videotape, fast forwarding, rewinding plus the ability to change different predetermined things), is used rarely, which is a shame as this was pretty much fun.About the flaws:The camera is annoying from time to time and using mouse + keyboard feels a bit inaccurate.It is VERY linear, though i didn't found that a negative thing as it was supporting the story, people might dislike the lack of freedom.The Story itself also feels a bit like a mix of Inception, Assassins Creed, Johnny Mnemonic and other Movies and/or Games, but it still felt pretty unique.All in all, if you like 3rd person games like Batman Arkham Asylum/City or Assassins Creed, then you should keep an eye on this one.

												Linear, handholding piece of crap. Levels are just straight lines with glowing pointers . You don't even need to search secrets, they are shown to you on big golographic screens. Combat is dull and boring. It's stripped from Batman series without any innovaton. The idea of Combo Lab (constructor of your own combos) is great, but poorly implemented: you have 3 preset combo chainas and you can't change the lenght of the chain or type of moves. And btw you have just two types of moves (hand strike and leg kick), so all your combos wil look pretty identical. Also it's nerly impossible to chain combos in the large group of enemies, because switching between targets breaks your combo. The only bright side of this game is the artstyle.			"

												An absolute pleasure to play. And the visuals are absurdly pretty to look at, even on the medium settings!!!While the combat can bit a bit buggy due to no formal target-lock-on toggle being implemented, the combat system is still extremely customizable and refreshing. And an added bonus is that you cannot spam some of the more complex combos in order to wipe through the mobs; you have to take particular care how you approach each enemy and, since you cannot block, you must dodge enemies, making for truly spectacular combat animation (since, if you time your moves right, you can immediately dodge an incoming attack in order to continue the combo you were building up to that point)And while the game's story setting is a bit hard to grasp at times, looking at the journal entries and paying close attention to detail will reveal an amazing locale and background dripping with depth.Since this is a bit of a sci-fi type game, the story is easy to get lost in if you do not take care to pay attention to what is happening, but if you do take care, you're heart will beat and you get lost in the world Nilin is plunged into.

												Let's see,  I was shock the first time I played this game. I wasn't expecting  the game to be any good  because the amount of hate in the reviews on several pages but I got to play an amazing game. The first thing I notice was the damn good graphics, so well done, everything looks great in this game. Nilin, the protagonist looks amazing, she is a badass and her voice is amazing aswell as the rest of the voice acting in the game. The sound was pretty good and the atmosphere is great. The city is nice and very detail. People dont like that is linear and I disagree, why all the games these days have to be open world. The amount of games with open world games It's ridiculous. It doesn't have to be open world to be a good game. Now the Story hook me up to the end very well done. the cutscenes I couldn't skip even if I already saw them, I didn't like that. The combos were pretty basic and was okey nothing more, I didn't like the fact that I couldn't keep the combos with other enemies, only one per combo. The memory remix just appear a few moments in the game, they could put some more of those because I love every time I did them. Worth  playing.			"

												So... I have a mixed opinion about this game. I will definitely recommend it if it's on sale.Pros:- The combat system is amazing, I didn't see anything like it since Omikron: The Nomad Soul- The combos and adventure system is well defined and provide a good experience- The setting and story is catching- It's hard to beat, even in normal modeCons:- Controls are weird, like, really weird, but you can get used to them- The camera is REALLY annoying sometimes, it feels like going back to the Tomb Raider 2 camera system- The scenarios are straightforward, you don't get any chance to interact with the world around youI wish:- The story was more deepIt looks like I didn't like it, but I did, the only thing is that I wouldn't pay more than 10 pounds for the game. It is a game worth playing			"

												Remember Me never quite meets it's full potential but it's still a robust experience overall.For starters, it's one of the most visually striking games I've ever played. The graphics and art direction are absolutely phenomenal. I'd almost solely recommend this game on the strength of it's visuals, it's that good.The game has a very uneven story though it's bursting with originality. The writing is smart enough to ask to right kind of questions and there are some truly memorable moments in the 9 chapters that comprise the story.Nilin, who already stands out from most video game protagonists by being a woman of colour, is written with the right balance of emotion and toughness. She feels vulnerable but is always capable of getting the job done. In between each chapter Nilin monologues about what's she done and how she feels; there are some genuinely interesting moments of pathos for her that flesh out her personality. She's much more interesting that other characters in these types of games such as Kratos or Dante.Remember Me's biggest fault is the gameplay. This is a character action game with a total of 5 combos. Changing what your combos do is a good idea in theory and having multiple enemy types helps but it doesn't change that you essentially are pushing the same combination of buttons for the entire game. This is going to be a problem for many people, especially if you're looking for a challenging experience. The combat doesn't nearly have as much depth as competing games in the same genre.If you're new to the action genre, or you want an adequate action game with a good story, then I recommend Remember Me. If you want a highly polished action game, look elsewhere.			"

												This one is a hard recommendation. For all the things Remember Me does right, so many others it does wrong. I try to explain following my experience the first time I started the game up to the last second in which I unlocked all achievments for it and deleted it from my harddrive. So here it goes:==Story==At first I was confused. I played, things got explained to me, I didn't really care. Something about evil cooperations, and memory hunters of which our lead chracter is part of. We're playing Nilin, who lost her memories and gets guided to her rescue through some dude called Edge before the evil cooperation could delete the rest of her memories. The game is divided into episodes and with each episode we try to help Nilin remember more of her memory and in the end trying to stop the evil cooperation. It's a well written story but it unfolds very slowly and uninteresting. The stories high-point are the interactive memory remixes. As a memory hunter Nilin lets the player break into someone elses memory and alter it to his liking, thus changing persons attitude forwards certain events in the past, affecting the future. Cutscenes in this game can't be skipped.==Gameplay / Combat==The gameplay is your typical modern 3rd-person action game. There are linear corridors, climbing sections and arenas in which the Batman-like combat takes places. Combat is fast & fluid. The game allows you to customize from 3 to 8 hit long combo-chains that unlock over time.The chains can be filled & customized through added presens. There are power presens and even presens that heal Nilin when she strikes. Later special abilities are introduced as well, so called S-presens. S-presens allow to stun enemies, manipulate robot foes, making your invisible for a short time to strike hard etc. Special Abilities have a cooldown. The cooldown can be reduced by adding cooldown reducing presens to your combo chains. There are also multiplier that can be added to the chains. These double the effect of previous presens in the combo chain. In the middle of a combo Nilin can dodge attack enemies and continue her combo. It sounds like a neat idea and it is IF combos wouldn't break each time Nilin strikes a different foe as the one she started the combo at. This can be very frustrating and it is and would explain why people think the combat is bad. But I enjoyed it due the possibility to change my combos accordingly to the enemies I was facing.==Visuals & Sound==The game looks gorgeous on highest setting. The only problem I encountered with the game is the constant studder due to Unreal3's texture streaming. There are certain ways to reduce or get rid of the studder on most systems. The soundtrack is a weird mix of electronic noises. The idea behind the music is that during combat a beat is played and each time a combo breaks or Nilin gets hit my an enemy the beat breaks too. But then there are instances in which overly epic music is played too loud that doesnt really fit with the shown scenes.==Replay Value==I mentioned that cutscenes can't be skipped. It's tedious to replay certain chapters to collect missing collectibles or to reach a certain point or fight that requires certain actions to unlock missing achievments. Having a collectible / achievment guide by your side comes in very handy. On the plus side: Once you finished the game Nilin will keep all her unlocked abilities and presens (even thouh abilities can only be used from the point onward in which they are unlocked during the story).==Conclusion==So why do I recomment the game? It's a short game delivering an well written and interesting story. It takes time to get used to the combat but once combos & presens are fully unlocked someone can have a blast with it. Achievment Hunters can also get their fair share of fun since It's easy to unlock those. But after you have done all that is to do in the game there is no big motivation to return to it. The story and the well done memory remixes are still worth to give the game a go. "

												It took me a while to begin enjoying this game - It seems like there is just so much more to be given. Beautiful graphics and absolutely stunning music were the only bits which perked up what was otherwise a rather weak storyline. The gameplay, unless on controller, felt clunky and unusable. However, the action and the sometimes troublesome foe still made the game entertaining enough to continue playing throughout.The different types of level such as the standard adventure, the action sequences and the remix levels, as well as the very significant need to adjust combos as to the types of enemies being faced, give the game a nice relaxed aire, with nothing too samey.If you are willing to give in to the immersive nature of this game, I am sure you will be at least entertained for the 6+ hours of gameplay it offers.

												Remember Me never quite meets it's full potential but it's still a robust experience overall.For starters, it's one of the most visually striking games I've ever played. The graphics and art direction are absolutely phenomenal. I'd almost solely recommend this game on the strength of it's visuals, it's that good.The game has a very uneven story though it's bursting with originality. The writing is smart enough to ask to right kind of questions and there are some truly memorable moments in the 9 chapters that comprise the story.Nilin, who already stands out from most video game protagonists by being a woman of colour, is written with the right balance of emotion and toughness. She feels vulnerable but is always capable of getting the job done. In between each chapter Nilin monologues about what's she done and how she feels; there are some genuinely interesting moments of pathos for her that flesh out her personality. She's much more interesting that other characters in these types of games such as Kratos or Dante.Remember Me's biggest fault is the gameplay. This is a character action game with a total of 5 combos. Changing what your combos do is a good idea in theory and having multiple enemy types helps but it doesn't change that you essentially are pushing the same combination of buttons for the entire game. This is going to be a problem for many people, especially if you're looking for a challenging experience. The combat doesn't nearly have as much depth as competing games in the same genre.If you're new to the action genre, or you want an adequate action game with a good story, then I recommend Remember Me. If you want a highly polished action game, look elsewhere.			"

												I recommend this game to anyone who likes futuristic urban settings, kick♥♥♥♥♥style gameplay, and a great musical score soundtrack and well-voiced characters.  The story is nothing short of amazing, as you take on the role of female protagonist, Nilin, in the year 2084 Neo-Paris.  She is a memory hunter, and the game starts with her imprisoned in the Bastille fortress, and the mega corporation Memorize, who has basically taken over the entire population's memories, is erasing her memories.  An underground resistance movement, known as the Errorists, breaks her out and their leader, named Edge, helps Nilin escape before they can erase all of her memory.  So, she starts off with a form of amnesia, which is fairly common in a lot of games, but this is one of the better adaptations, imho.Sadly, I can't explain too much of the game, because it would start spoiling the game.  I've seen some denounce the gameplay as repetitive and boring, but I find it fun and exhilarating, trying to figure out on the fly what disciplines I need to put my powers into, because you can reconfigure them even in the middle of a fight to fine tune whether you're regaining willpower, health, or doing extra damage...or a combination of two or three of them.  It can get a little confusing at times, but it's fairly easy to master.  I feel like if I can do it, then most people won't have any trouble.Then there are the Memory Remix segments.  The parts of the game that make it so unique and intriguing.  They are puzzles of an event that you have to watch and then figure out how interact with certain parts of the memory to find out the right combination to ""unlock"" your goal.  And that's just fun as you rewind and fast forward a segment of time and finally get all the pieces to fall into place.  It reminds me of the Batman Arkham Origins crime scene review mechanic, only Remember Me's take on it is waaaay better.The platforming segments remind me a bit of Prince of Persia (some of the more recent ones), with similarities to how it worked in Tomb Raider (recent ones, including the 2013 reboot too).  Just fun and interesting to play.  I give it an 85/100 and that's saying something for this little known developer (DONTNOD) that might be going out of business due to lackluster sales.  I feel like people really missed the point with this one.			"

												This game is crazy-good from the story, cut-scenes and gameplay. the game is exciting and looks stunning in most areas. Neon Paris looks incredible with a lot of detail. The combat design is pretty good with different combo buttons you can set up to do more damage or regenerate your health which is unique and interesting. It has some nice surprises in there but I won't spoil them.Grab it full price or on sale!			"

Kind of a cross between Deus Ex and Blade Runner set in a futuristic vision of Paris, I could not stop taking screenshots of how beautiful this game was to experience. The gameplay itself is unfortunatley very linear and doesnt bring anything new to the table but it is interesting enough to pull you through. The idea for the story is very intriguing as well but the plot line does leave a little to be desired.			"

												I'd love to say Remember Me is a great game, but it isn't. It falls on the ""full of potential yet average"" category. On the pure aesthetic aspect its simply gorgeous, creative and original. The story despite its slow beginning manages to be excellent once you reach the second half of the game. Its well written with the collaboration of one of the best French sci-fi authors of this generation making it an overall great experience. A great plus is that it has a female main character that does manages to not fall into the usual tropes, which is great.The main theme of the game is memory and the possibility of a technology able to manipulate and change it. It articulates with society issues and personal traumas of the characters asking a few interesting questions like how far we can go to be able forget the pain and suffering in our lives. Indeed, there's a few great puzzle sequences where you'll have the “remix” people's memories in order to achieve your goals. As strange it may sound its actually done in a fairly interesting fashion, giving a lot of depth to the characters.Now about the gameplay : The platforming in this game is unchallenging and requires nothing than just a bit of attention, making it a tedious process and the few puzzles and actions you'll progressively unlock barely improves anything.On the combat side, it starts off with a lot of good ideas. The fact you can create your own combos in the beat'em all style of gameplay sounds wonderful on the paper, but in reality you'll have only five rigid sets of combos and you are only allowed to customize their effects. The combat mechanics actually rely more on using a handful of powerful powers once your combo bar is full. However there's quite some depth to this system and it even allows you to be creative have a lot of  fun once you've unlocked everything, alas this happens way too late. My overall feeling is that Remember Me would have been a better as an action RPG rather than a beat'em all.My main problem with the game is that despite its good ideas and good pacing, it takes just too much time to fully show how good its story is and to unlock all the fun elements to make its combat interesting. The whole experience feels like a lengthy tutorial full of potential, that ends way too quickly after approximatively 10 hours. Hopefully, Remember Me 2 is already in the works, lets hope that this time the developers will actually achieve their vision to make a great game. Technical info : This game is a console port but like most recent Capcom titles its works great. However the default camera is annoying as hell. You can easly improve that by using a tweak posted on the steam forums to change the FOV. "

												So this game was awesome, but not without it's problems.The graphics were gorgeous, the soundtrack was topnotch, and the story was refreshing. The only thing this game really missed on was the combat.That's not to say that the combat isn't good... it just doesn't... feel good after a while. The game's method of increasing difficulty ends up throwing more and more baddies at you in a never ending stream of punching bags. The boss fights are also something of a bore. Most of them consist of 'Use DOS, proceed to win'.The, well, spamminess of the spammer is also a little dull on the last few boss fights (there's a prompt that actually reads 'SPAM'). There's also some wierd camera shifts while on the platforming bits of the game, and sometimes the controls shifted in wonky directions, resulting in a few frustrating deaths.Probably the biggest letdown of this game is the lack of actual memory rewriting you do in the story line. This part of the game comes in relatively early, but then you spend a good couple hours before coming upon your next 'victim'. In total there were maybe 4 instances where your character did what your character was supposed to be known for doing. Rewriting memories should have taken a bigger role in the actual gameplay outside of the few times it was used after boss battles.Despite its shortcomings, this game is amazing. It's a shame so few people have heard of/played it.9/10 would play again. I'll probably end up buying this game as a gift for my friends when the holidays roll around this year.			"

												With a very well developed story, combined with breathtaking visuals and great use of music, I would highly recommend this game despite it being marred by various issues.The game constantly has mouse sensitivity issues and you can find your camera flying to god knows where, especially during combat and when things get hectic. Remixing memories was also very hard because the game sometimes could not detect me rotating my mouse. I switched to a controller and everything became a lot easier to control. It seems like the game was not optimised for the keyboard and mouse.Combat was the most horrible experience for me. You are told that you can continue your combo if you dodge over an enemy, but half the time, your character chooses to dodge out of the way, making you miss your combo and precious PMP points.Overall, the game was presented and developed very well, and I applaud DONTNOD for their hard work.Story 8/10Art 9/10Music 8/10Combat 6/10 "

												Ca. 14 hours until the end for me.I saw no bugs or had any crashes I remember. The game has good graphics and the controls are good.You are playing a woman protagonist in levels which are more or less corridor levels. There is always only one good way to go. Sometimes you find clues about secrets, then you should look at that clue, find the secret and go back to your old route.The fights are melee fights, where you always use combos. You can just try to ignore the combos but because some combos start with repeated use of the same attack you can even customize this.A combo consists of a different number of either fist or foot attacks. And each but the first attack has to be of a kind. These ""kinds"" are things like ""concentrate on damage"", ""heal yourself"", ""gather points for your other special attacks"" or just enlarge the bonus of the last attack.The farther behind in a combo the attack is, the larger is the bonus you get.Imagine something like normal+heal+enlarged heal+even more enlarged heal against a boss.You can change these combos all the time, even in the middle of fight when you realize all your combos suck against the current enemy.The fights are fun. There is no but to this.The moving is a bit like in Assasin's Creed, but not as good. You can do cool moves and climb and jumb and run but only when the game allows it for a certain spot at this time.So one moment you fight for your live or just want to jump on a knee high platform... not possible. The fight is over, you can climb there without problems. Two spots look the same, but the one is the ""right"" way, so to one you can do an incredible cool jump, to the other not, you die. That can be very frustrating.If you are used to the open worlds from Assassin's Creed then you should start the game with a VERY open mind, because it is really NOT like Assassin's Creed, even if the fighting and the moving are a bit like it.The story is ok or even good, not sure, it was good enough to keep me playing.If you get the game for non-full price, yes, try it, it might be your new favourite.But it might be you get bored after 10 minutes.This game was not half as good as I expected because of the vidoes and reviews.But still, it was fun. I'd give it a 6.5 / 10. Meaning, it is better than average, but not one of the ""you must have played it"" games.			"

												It took me a while to begin enjoying this game - It seems like there is just so much more to be given. Beautiful graphics and absolutely stunning music were the only bits which perked up what was otherwise a rather weak storyline. The gameplay, unless on controller, felt clunky and unusable. However, the action and the sometimes troublesome foe still made the game entertaining enough to continue playing throughout.The different types of level such as the standard adventure, the action sequences and the remix levels, as well as the very significant need to adjust combos as to the types of enemies being faced, give the game a nice relaxed aire, with nothing too samey.If you are willing to give in to the immersive nature of this game, I am sure you will be at least entertained for the 6+ hours of gameplay it offers.

												What a ride.I had heard about this game from a few friends before getting the opportunity to play it myself (gifted by one of those friends, intent on ""spreading the gospel"" of Remember Me), but I attempted to go into it with no expectations. It was, after all, a stand-alone game - a new IP, too - from Ubisoft, who, it can be argued, reigns as the King of Sequels and Tie-Ins. The reviews for the game were mostly positive, but largely unremarkable, and Remember Me had flown under my radar until the last few months of the year.After having flown through the game, unable to put down the controller for more than an hour or two, I can say this about the game: Remember Me is one of the most unapologetically beautiful, engaging and emotional games that I've ever had the privledge of playing. Everything about the game shines with a blinding light - the storytelling is top-notch, the environments feel real and immersive, the characters are interesting and emotive, and the music is bizarrely beautiful in its fusion of glitch drops, synthesizers, and orchestra. The gameplay is interestingly engaging, combining elements of the run-of-the-mill platformer with the action-soaked sequences expected from combat-heavy blockbusters like God of War, complete with satisfying QTE events that allow Nilin to dole out special attacks.The combat within the game is easy to pick up, and not difficult to master - by the middle of the game, you'll be dodging nearly every attack (if not every attack). And yet Remember Me's ""Combo Lab"" feature, which allows the player to customize both the moves and effects of the combos Nilin performs, keeps the action interesting in spite of the system's ease of use. The enemies, too, are diverse enough to keep Nilin and the player on their toes, with new enemies being introduced even in the last chapter of the game.The story itself is mindboggling and supremely interesting, presenting a dark, forboding world that we may well be heading into. In a world full of speculative science ficiton, Remember Me's storyline takes an old concept of the monetezation of human memory (thanks William Gibson) and brings it down to a more personal level; though the story initially places the player within the grand scheme of the ""Errorist Revolution,"" as it progresses it focuses more and more on the player character, Nilin.Nilin herself is a fantastically realized character: she is emotive and introspective, and displays her thoughts eloquently in brief soliloquies between chapters. A strong female character, she is neither oversexualized nor depicted as dependent on any other force but her own strength of will and a desire to rebuild her lost memories. Her journey through the game is emotional and engaging, with the game's finale ultimately culminating in a sequence of self-realizations that can be easily translated back onto the player him- or herself. I can't recommend this game enough.			"

												Okay, Remember Me is a good game. It is absolutely stunning even on lower graphics settings, with a gorgeous cyberpunk setting and beautiful (if very, very linear) environment, and has an interesting story and compelling main character that made me want to play it all the way through. It also has a terrific soundtrack.All of that said, the gameplay gets difficult and tedious quite early on. Combat simply takes too long and is too predictable for it to be really fun, especially during boss fights where missing a single quick-time event (which flash up extremely quickly) will force you to get that last bit of health down again (and again). I feel like a simple counter button would have helped speed things along a lot, given that the only way to avoid attacks without it is dodging (pretty much always breaking your combo).Other minor complaints I have would be the fiddly, fiddly controls during the remix sequences (otherwise a very neat and interesting addition), and some of the dialogue writing - it often sounds very false and purple-prose-ish, particularly whenever Edge is on the line. I don't find that it detracts overly from the story, it's just a little jarring at times.Like I said, Remember Me is still a good game, and I would recommend it if you're looking for a interesting story and a great main character (how many non-white female protagonists do we get in video games at the moment?). I definitely also recommend, however, waiting for a good sale, and preparing for a few rage quit moments along the way.			"

												Remember Me has an amazing dystopian setting and a solid story - in that regards it can be put right next to Deus Ex and Blade Runner.However, it's not nearly as good as a game. Locations are beautifully designed but absolutely linear (with occasional branch-offs containing secrets), camera is twitchy, battle system is a bit boring (finished the game on the hardest difficulty). There are only 4 combos in the game, but you can alter their effects by changing individual punches. For instance, you can chain the hits so the combo both damages your enemies and heals you. This system has a lot of potential, but feels unfinished, though. You will quickly find the best combination for you and stay with it, making everything a tad repetetive. On the other hand, boss fights are not so bad, and there are some twists during battles with common enemies which there are a few varieties.Memory remixing, when you change someone's memory by altering small details, is one of the major features of the game. While this makes the gameplay more diverse, you get to remix memories only a few times and there're usually just half a dozen items to interact with. So this also feels like a cornerstone for something better.Anyway, setting and story make for a very strong experience, so I would recommend Remember Me even despite it's flaws.			"

The criticism of it being linear is accurate thus far, but the storytelling and atmosphere and characters are so rich and exquisite that the linearity, rather than being a drudge, is actually contributing to making this a better experience.

												A game that received mixed reviews. Some loved it and others hated it. I can best sum it up this way: if you love atmosphere, fun characters, sci-fi, and don't mind a linear experience, this is going to be one of your cult favorites. I really enjoyed the experience and found the environments a pleasure to run through. The concept of remixing memories is probably the best thing about it -- I wish there were more opportunities to do that in the game. Definitely recommended to those that enjoy sci-fi (think Blade Runner) atmosphere in their action/adventure experiences.			"

												Remember Me is one of the best games ever made. It's top notch story, artwork and graphics that will leave you stunned, and great musical score makes this game something you 'll never want to forget. The only downside is the first few levels leave the combat a little meh(~2 Hours).The Story:      Without spoiling anything Remember Me is a game where you think you know what's going to happen. When you finally play it you'll see that there is even more then you thought. The story in this game is one of the best stories ever told in a Big Budget released titles. The world feels real and the story plays off this amazingly constructed world perfectly. It may even make you rethink how you view your own memories.The Graphic/Artwork:        The detail in this game is above any other I've seen. Little robot float by with signs showing you the specials of places to eat or shops. The floating text  of the signs are at the perfect depth in order to feel as if they are realistically placed. Dirty places feel dirty and not over done just like clean places feel just the right amount of clean. Nothing is over done and the detail is so perfect it's insane to think about. You really feel as if you are part of the world. The 3D is also very good.The Sound/Music:        The Musical score in this game is perfect as well. It combines classic big orchestra sound with corrupt technology sounds in the perfect manner. Sound is one of my favorite things in a game so even if this styles sounds crazy even at first I didn't believe how well it sounded.         The voice acting in the game is great only maybe 3 lines in the game feel out of place. Each actor adds emotion to their character and draws you into the story and scene. The combat sounds can get a little repetitive though because the enemy are always saying the same one liner all the time. Nothing that can't be over look.        The combat noises and ambient sounds are also really well done. You heard ADs over a PA system about a product in the world or what just happened in the news. Robots talk about protocol for the area or you just hear people talking in the streets.  You can hear the distant sounds of computers running around a corner or a leaper hiding the shadows. The combat noise of punches landing and other abilities hitting are fine as well. Things sound satisfying when they land and never out of place.The Gameplay:        The gameplay is one of the weakest parts of Remember Me at the start of the game. You don't have many abilities, pressens, or combos and it can feel as if you are just spamming the one or two combos you do have in order to just get through. When you finally unlock everything the style of combat you do is almost an art of itself. It flows so well and looks very good. At the beginning of the game it can seem that the combat is down right bad but give it time it gets really fun.       The platforming in Remember Me in very linear as the game is pretty much 95% linear. There are a few places you can go in order to find collectibles but other then that it's pretty much follow this path. The platforming is pretty easy and really just something you do in order to find the solutions to puzzle as it's pretty hard to fail these sections. Overall the platforming is neither good nor bad it's pretty ok.        All in all if you are looking to pick up Remember Me I strongly suggest you do. I played it the whole way through in Nvidia 3D and it was great. I recommend using a controller so you can lean back and enjoy this amazing game.By far the Must Play Game of 2013.			"

If you love that game, you should surely love this one!Like Mirror's Edge, it has all the nice elements (story, atmosphere, music, graphics) that make it a moving, compelling experience. It also has a lot of backstory info about the world. While the gameplay can be slightly repetitive, it definitely can still be challenging, and the skill configuration system is a neat feature for adapting to different enemy types as you level up.Hey, you should get this game! :)			"

												I liked Remember Me. The style of this game is fantastic. Its vision of 70 years in the future was interesting and believable with a lot of fancy new tech around, but not too far technologically advanced. Frequently it was fun to stop and check out the scenery. There are a lot of nice little touches that add a lot of detail and flesh this world. There is some real stunning visuals in this game. Unfortunately, there are a few texture and lighting problems that make some areas just overall look crappy and don't sparkle like most of the rest of the game does. There's far too much time spent in sewers and drab dark places. Also, the world does feel empty as there aren't a lot of NPCs to fill out the levels to make it feel alive. Honestly, the story was mediocre, but not terrible. And the actual format of the game has been done so many times before. Travel to a big room and punch up a bunch of dudes and then continue on until the next fighting room is reached. The fighting wasn't anything special, but I did enjoy it. The combo system made for some interesting fights that reminded me a lot of the Batman series. The story involves a chilling future scenario where memories are bought and sold like commodities and memories can be rewritten at will by jacking into peoples brains. The expression 'Remember Me' does have a significance to the story, but I kept getting the feeling the makers weren't exactly confident in the game they were making and they kept repeating the phrase in the game so people will remember to tell their friends about the fun time they had playing through this game. The game is fairly easy. There were only a couple of difficult boss battles. It took just over 12 hours to complete the game. I liked this new mechanic where someone's memory would play out on screen and as it progresses key details can be changed to alter the memory in sometimes insignificant, sometimes profound ways. It was fun trying different combos to see how the memory changes in sometimes wildly different ways. Tweaking to get things to play out just right. This game does kind of remind me of a kinder, gentler take on the Resident Evil series. Instead of shooting missiles at genetic mutant freaks and driving down zombies, you're punching security guards. And instead of blood and monster puss stained walls, everything is covered in neon. But the RE vibe is definitely there. It's a fun game and I recommend it.			"

												I recommend this game to anyone who likes futuristic urban settings, kick♥♥♥♥♥style gameplay, and a great musical score soundtrack and well-voiced characters.  The story is nothing short of amazing, as you take on the role of female protagonist, Nilin, in the year 2084 Neo-Paris.  She is a memory hunter, and the game starts with her imprisoned in the Bastille fortress, and the mega corporation Memorize, who has basically taken over the entire population's memories, is erasing her memories.  An underground resistance movement, known as the Errorists, breaks her out and their leader, named Edge, helps Nilin escape before they can erase all of her memory.  So, she starts off with a form of amnesia, which is fairly common in a lot of games, but this is one of the better adaptations, imho.Sadly, I can't explain too much of the game, because it would start spoiling the game.  I've seen some denounce the gameplay as repetitive and boring, but I find it fun and exhilarating, trying to figure out on the fly what disciplines I need to put my powers into, because you can reconfigure them even in the middle of a fight to fine tune whether you're regaining willpower, health, or doing extra damage...or a combination of two or three of them.  It can get a little confusing at times, but it's fairly easy to master.  I feel like if I can do it, then most people won't have any trouble.Then there are the Memory Remix segments.  The parts of the game that make it so unique and intriguing.  They are puzzles of an event that you have to watch and then figure out how interact with certain parts of the memory to find out the right combination to ""unlock"" your goal.  And that's just fun as you rewind and fast forward a segment of time and finally get all the pieces to fall into place.  It reminds me of the Batman Arkham Origins crime scene review mechanic, only Remember Me's take on it is waaaay better.The platforming segments remind me a bit of Prince of Persia (some of the more recent ones), with similarities to how it worked in Tomb Raider (recent ones, including the 2013 reboot too).  Just fun and interesting to play.  I give it an 85/100 and that's saying something for this little known developer (DONTNOD) that might be going out of business due to lackluster sales.  I feel like people really missed the point with this one.			"

												Remember Me never quite meets it's full potential but it's still a robust experience overall.For starters, it's one of the most visually striking games I've ever played. The graphics and art direction are absolutely phenomenal. I'd almost solely recommend this game on the strength of it's visuals, it's that good.The game has a very uneven story though it's bursting with originality. The writing is smart enough to ask to right kind of questions and there are some truly memorable moments in the 9 chapters that comprise the story.Nilin, who already stands out from most video game protagonists by being a woman of colour, is written with the right balance of emotion and toughness. She feels vulnerable but is always capable of getting the job done. In between each chapter Nilin monologues about what's she done and how she feels; there are some genuinely interesting moments of pathos for her that flesh out her personality. She's much more interesting that other characters in these types of games such as Kratos or Dante.Remember Me's biggest fault is the gameplay. This is a character action game with a total of 5 combos. Changing what your combos do is a good idea in theory and having multiple enemy types helps but it doesn't change that you essentially are pushing the same combination of buttons for the entire game. This is going to be a problem for many people, especially if you're looking for a challenging experience. The combat doesn't nearly have as much depth as competing games in the same genre.If you're new to the action genre, or you want an adequate action game with a good story, then I recommend Remember Me. If you want a highly polished action game, look elsewhere.			"

												Remember Me is a nice surprise.It has a very unique et personal feel, and a peculiar atmosphere emerges from this title. The city of Neo-Paris has been throuroughly designed, with its architecture mixing past, current, and future elements. The result is a very plausible place, where you can feel both the frivolity of the rich an the despair of the poor.The story itself, although it does not boast any big surprises, is pleasant, and cleverly written to talk about very contempary topics, using sci-fi elements. Heroes forgetting about their past has been used extensively in video games, but it is brought to another level here, and twisted with gameplay elements to make it actually believable and useful.The gameplay is quite standard, with an interesting a-la-Batman combo-style combat system, and Darksiders-like powers to bring just enough fresh ingredients to make it interesting.The memory remixing is a very good idea, but it could have been used a little bit more. As it happens here, the scope is limited, but still enjoyable.If you go straight through the game, it will probably take you 10-15 hours to finish it. There is not much room for replayability unless you want to crack those achievements.All in all, I recommend this game. It may not be the game of the year, but it is enjoyable and quite unique in its own way. The game could probably have used more marketing, too.			"

												Wow, I was really surprised by this game.It starts off with a fantastic strong open that leads into one of the most beautifully crafted game worlds I've seen. The Combat seems rough at first but over time you realize how genius it is. Combo's become more than just button combinations, they become tactical. With certain combo buttons healing you, other doing extra damage and other granting cool-down on you special moves (S-Pressens) it becomes tactical to decide which combo to do next and how you want to build them. The game gives you many many questions and doesn't answer most of them until near the end. If I had to compare this to another game I'd call it a Character Action Deus Ex basically. The Cyber-Punk architecture layered throughout future Paris is woven together with the ancient structures of the past in a way that is beautiful. The main character is fantastically written as she doesn't just follow orders without thinking about the consequences but in the end she must follow them in order to regain her memories.9.5/10			"

												For some reason I find this one of the best games I've ever played. Perhaps it's the interesting and well written story. Or the pretty much flawless motion capture, voice acting or dialog? Could be that the futuristic Paris is one of the must stylish and well imagined sci-fi settings I've seen. Possibly the slick game elements of the memory re-mixing and building of the fighting combinations. But perhaps the most probable reason is that the game made me think a lot. Not only about the game aspects, but mostly about the story and its implications.Anyway, it is despite being quite a linear game one of the most enjoyable solo gaming experiences I've had in many many years. I will make sure to keep my eyes open for anything else made by the same artists.			"

												Remember Me is a hard game to recommend outright. As a whole it is a largely linear campaign with plaforming sections. You basically go from platforming to combat room to more platforming. The game does try to be unique with the create - a - combo mechanic that was fun to mess with even though you'll be pressing the same two buttons most of the time.  The memory scrubbing that you do are like modified cut scenes that you play with going back and forth to find the best way to achieve the objective. Now, I am a huge cyberpunk fan. And the setting is the main reason why I bought this game in the first place.  The gameplay and story kept me going to the end. And, that is pretty much all I ask of a game like this. In the end, I am happy I played it.  I recommend it if you can find it on sale.  Since this such a short game, this is a game that is worth your time.			"

The gameplay is not so great, battles with bosses are repetetive and the game is easy (even on the highest difficulty) overall. Memory remixing is fun and a very interesting concept, I would love to see more of it, though (you get to do it only 4 times). The game is lineral, which is not necessary a bad thing, but I wanted to see more of the beautiful Neoparis. What is absolutely flawless, is the OST. Post Scriptum- Play this with a controller if you can, gameplay with keyboard is really bad. At least it was for me.			"

												A short but sweet cyberpunk action game that will likely leave you ""remember""ing the storytelling far more than the gameplay itself.In 2080-something, the world of Neo Paris is addicted to memories. All citizens have a device attached to their spinal cord that allows them to share and download memories from other people and other lives. Cool, right? Except for when the devices malfunction and spur mutations in the host, leading to ""leapers"", or half the enemies you fight in the game.You're Nilin, a 20-something kung-fu pro that has had her memories stolen and has been imprisoned. You spend the game running, jumping, and kicking your way to reclaim what was lost. The platforming is remniscent of the Tomb Raider games, except easy mode. There are AR-style icons to indicate where you need to jump next, and the magnetism is enough so that you'll very, very rarely ever miss a jump. If manual platforming isn't your strong suit, then no worries here, as it doesn't really add much to the game except a nice sense of verticality.The combat is much stronger, but still not the game's strongest point. It's solid and snappy, and dodging is very fluid and easy to do, so no complaints there. Unfortunately, while you can customize your combos in the sense that when you press 'X' here, you regen health or do more damage, your combos themselves are static, and there's only four - a 3 hit, 5 hit, 6 hit, and 8 hit respectively that unlock through game progression, and the button patterns are always the same. While this allows you to learn the combos quickly, it leaves very little in the way of innovation. More fun are the special abilities that you learn which allow you to take out certain enemy types with a consumption of Remember Me's equivalent of a Super bar. Without giving away too much, you essentially ""hack"" the world and enemies around you for extra-powerful attacks.All of that takes a back seat to the storytelling though, which is where the game shines. The writing is never longwinded, the characters are (usually) interesting and have their own strong motivations and desires, and you'll even occasionally discover some fairly poignant quotes and very well-written lines of dialogue. The plot culminates quite solidly at the end, despite some shortcutting in the final chapter that leaves a little bit more extrapolation of the final boss and his motivations to be desired, but all in all it's a satisfying and extremely pretty adventure that you might even want to revisit after the game's moderately short 8 hours with the new game plus feature.Pros:+Very good writing and interesting setting+Solid heroine+References to Gibson, Ghost in the Shell and other well-known cyberpunk franchises+Excellent graphics+Smooth combat+Collectibles and worth replaying for completionist statusCons:-Platforming is not challenging at all-Few puzzles with easy solutions-A bit short			"

												I finally decided to give this a go. I must say it is much better than I had anticipated. It combines a number of scenarios and games as far as setting and gameplay are concerned. The envrinoments remind of Deus Ex, the combat and upgrade system is very close to the Batman Arkham series (memory restructuring equals 'Detective Mode' etc.), it also has something from Dead Space as far as the camera angles and mechanics are concerned, and of course there's a side of Assassin's Creed with perhaps a pinch of Tomb Raider.This does make for a great combo. The game itself is quite linear (meaning not open world), but the pace and storytelling are very compelling, and you don't mind the linearity of it at all. The various locations are introduced with a nice camera swoop, and the use of light and shadow does add drama.If you are expecting a 'but', you're right. While the in-game combat very much reminds of the Batman Arkham games, the controls are not as fluid. The same goes for the usual walking around. The best way to describe the controls would be to say, 'a little clunky at times'. This is not a game breaker by any means, but I wish they would have chosen better camera angles, and that the movements felt more fluent, especially since the protagonist, Nilin, appears quite athletic and believably capable of all the moves without the 'superhero flair'. Another gripe I have are the boss fights, but that is the same for the Batman games. I find them unnecessarily complicated, and the overwhelming count of 'foot soliders' is just ridiculous at times. You can't click as fast as you ought to, but, with some practice and patience, you eventually get past all of them.I have not yet completed the game at the time of writing this review, but I can already recommend it to anyone who liked the games I mentioned above, or simply enjoys a good game in a Sci-Fi setting that's neither improbable, impossible, nor too far in the future.

												A very positive experience. Remember Me is a French sci-fi action adventure set in ""Neo-Paris."" Europe has descended into a corporate future where human memories are a commodity. There is no fascist regime but the people have become memory consumers out of choice. In one street scene there is a man buying a memory of a first kiss and many others want painful memories removed from their minds altogether. The lead, Nilin, is a strong character who overcomes doubts and anxieties to accomplish something larger than herself. She is capable but not a demigod and is not sexualized in any way. She has an unique skill of re-writing people's memories so their personalities and goals change. The process is, of course, incredibly immoral and Nilin is painfully aware of this.While the setting and other characters besides Nilin are what makes Remember Me so special, the gameplay is good too. There is practically no exploration involved but the platforming looks and plays great. Close combat follows the general Arkham Asylum - pattern as practically all post - Arkham games tend to do, but it is entertaining with some original twists. Graphics and sounds are stylish, with a cool temperature.I was surprised and disappointed at the lukewarm reception Remember Me recieved, but I enjoyed the 10-hour adventure very much, and would definitely try any DLCs or sequels.

												I picked up this game because it was developed by the same studio who made Life is Strange, a game that I enjoyed immensely. Although nowhere near as good as Life is Strange, Remember Me is still worth playing if you can get past its shortcomings.The characters and the story are well developed and engrossing; they are the main driving force that will keep you playing this game until the end. Graphically the game holds up very well, and the art direction really makes the game world come alive. It is a shame that there isn't more freedom to explore the streets and the world of Neo-Paris, as the fictional world created here is really interesting.Gameplay, however, is where this game completely falls apart. First of all, the game is extremely linear. Although, I don't find that to be a problem by itself, but it renders the parkour elements in this game redundant as there is no chance for exploration or discovery at all. The combat is also extremely repetitive and frustrating in the worst ways possible. It is as if they looked at the combat from the Arkham games and decided: hey let's implement a crappy version of this. The enemies take way too many hits to go down, and you cannot beat multiple opponents with your combos, only one enemy at a time. In the end, however, the story and the world created in this game is enough to warrant a playthrough.			"

												The game itself is pretty cool, but there are some things which make it bad again..The Pros:- Good looking levels- Good but a bit fishy gameplay- Overall ""cool"" story (im gonna write something about it, at the bottom of the review)- Good Characterdesign- And nice graphics  - Nilins abilities are cool afThe Cons:- The Camera is crap- The Performance is okay but not the best- The Combat ""system"" is just mashing two buttons in the right orderTo the story:The Story is okay, not good and not bad.. and keep in mind its just my Impression of the gameThe whole story is at the beginning just a big question. You fight a Company named Memorize (im not exactly sure) which is ""enslaving"" the whole world with the idea to save tons of Memorys in a big Harddrive which makes the people like Zombies.. If you dont wanna see spoilers dont go over the black bar  It was pretty obvious to me that this memorize lady is your mother and stuff but i was really shocked that the guy who's talking to you alltime, is these cluster of pure memorys that was a part where i thought wtf this is brilliantOverall its cool but it still needs some development which wont come, so buy it in a sale but not for the whole price.

												Remember Me is a nice surprise.It has a very unique et personal feel, and a peculiar atmosphere emerges from this title. The city of Neo-Paris has been throuroughly designed, with its architecture mixing past, current, and future elements. The result is a very plausible place, where you can feel both the frivolity of the rich an the despair of the poor.The story itself, although it does not boast any big surprises, is pleasant, and cleverly written to talk about very contempary topics, using sci-fi elements. Heroes forgetting about their past has been used extensively in video games, but it is brought to another level here, and twisted with gameplay elements to make it actually believable and useful.The gameplay is quite standard, with an interesting a-la-Batman combo-style combat system, and Darksiders-like powers to bring just enough fresh ingredients to make it interesting.The memory remixing is a very good idea, but it could have been used a little bit more. As it happens here, the scope is limited, but still enjoyable.If you go straight through the game, it will probably take you 10-15 hours to finish it. There is not much room for replayability unless you want to crack those achievements.All in all, I recommend this game. It may not be the game of the year, but it is enjoyable and quite unique in its own way. The game could probably have used more marketing, too.			"

												Ok, I'm gonna review this after only a few hours play, but short of any game breaking crashes or up coming mind-blowing gameplay, i think i can speak to this game.I had skipped it at launch, because of all the bad reviews at release. Its now been several months, so I assume that any problems have been patched. So far I have not encountered any technical issues. Will update if I do.What do I think? I think its an awesome game and a worthy successor to Deus Ex. Judging by the start only, its almost better than that lackluster sequel we had few years back. The story has a very strong French distopian feel to it, that only the first Deus Ex pulled off.  The maps are gorgeous to look at, but limited and linear...""game-like"" not open world, but still very  effective.  More than good enough. If Splinter Cell can do it, why not this game?So why was everyone hating on it?  Probably has something to do with the fighting system. to be perfectly clear, I hate all button mashing fighting games.  Memorizing X Y X X, block, jump x is not my idea of fun. you may disagree.  The recent batman games looked amazing, but I hated that fight system. didn't stop everyone from praising those games! So why the hate here?  I don't know, feels the same to me. I'm probably missing some mind-blowing nuance that a fan boy reading this may point out to me.  I just set the game on easiest difficulty and enjoyed the story.And that is my final point, its a slick and beautiful to look at story experience. all the negative reviews have tanked the price, so especially on sale you can probably get it for song.   I would recommend it to any fan of futuristic sci-fi. "

												So far I am really liking this game. The fighting is similar to the Batman Arkham games, only the combos are easier to remember and you can customize them to make them heal you or increase their damage, and dodging is easy and a lifesaver! The environment is really well done, the graphics are pretty, and the story is interesting. Although there are people around and stores and such, so far I cant really interact with them. The memory remapping is neat too once I figured out the controls(move the mouse in circles, dont just twist it :P ). Death, so far isnt frustrating, seems to be many checkpoints and no negatives to it. The only thing some people might not like is that it is not open world. There is a set path to follow, so dont expect freedom to explore like in Batman. There have also been instances where I want to spare someone, but it doesnt seem like I have a choice. I dont mind it though because the story is moving it forward and the sci fi feel is coming through. I would recommend people to try it, though if you are not sure, wait for it to be on sale. I cant wait to see what happens next! =)			"

												Trust the reviews on this one.  The gameplay is divided into two distinct sections: combat and traversal.  The traversal mostly involves jumping between ledges indicated by orange arrows, eliminating any sense of exploration or discovery.  The combat is repetitive, alternating between boring and frustrating.  The story is average at best.Credit must be given to the art department though.  Neo-Paris is a beautiful city, and one I enjoyed seeing, albiet in a completely linear way.  There are no open areas to explore sadly, but what you do see is beautiful and full of interesting details.  I wouldn't advise against picking it up on sale to check it out, but I wouldn't pay more than $10.			"

												Underwhelming  combat stops this game from being an instant  classic. Story on the other hand was fantastic. If it was on sale I'd  recommend  one to buy it.If they ever release a sequel, they should consider  revamping the combat  system and give more flexibility  on the memory segements for branching plot  lines.

												""Augmented reality at its best""I would like to say this for this game. but unfortunately Remembe Me has its flaws. It  is certainly a bold game. It has very ambitious elements in all directions, from story to the gameplay. But they are not very well implemented, putting the game in an position between average and good in a relative (to the player) matter.Gameplay can be defined in one word: simple. Button-mashing and easy platforming, full linear. Game gets most of its critism from this simple gameplay. However...Setting is unique. This is somekind of a cyberpunk game. But the focus is on the augmented reality via memory alteration and the glimpse of the world that we see is a rough dystopia rather than the embraced thrill of a cyberpunk.The game reminded me Omikron and the anime serie Ergo Proxy in some ways (through some atmospheric elements). It is a shame that we see very little of Neo Paris. What a wonderful game this should be if it were an open world sci-fi.I know there are people who would neglect the simple gameplay for a unique sci-fi/cyberpunk setting. If you are so, then I recommend Remember Me. Grab it on a sale and you won't regret. Game deserves a solid 7/10, and thanks to its interesting setting, you will ""remember"" the game.Note: You should play this game with a gamepad controller.			"

 Close to perfect Remember Me is an awesome game. Set in ""Neo Paris"", a beautifully crafted Paris of the future, it tells the story of a woman - Nilin -  fighting a huge corporation that is controlling everything, including memories. The story is paced well, tense and interesting. Gameplay works well, consisting of a great combat system (basically the one from the Batman Arkham series with the added ability of creating own combos), climbing sequences, short puzzles and well designed, Inception-ish ""memory manipulations"", where you have to twist perceived reality to reach your goals.The only downside is that while playing you start to wish you could explore Neo Paris, as its great art style and graphics know how to impress, but the linearity of the game does not allow it.-> 9/10Note: I played the game on a different account, so the shown playtime - obviously - is incorrect.

This was worthwhile for me .First, I'm interest many architectures in this game and how to describe the story in each character. Especially in minigames have many way to patch in each person memory. These included with high quality graphic , just few being bak during play time but that not all the time. If who focus in collected achivement like me ,I recommend you because each pieces not too difficult to collecting but you need to have some guideline that you can watch on Youtube.			"

												A fun game, a really neat concept, but it seemed to be lacking in content. Let me explain:Throughout the game you come across various shops and civilian npc's, however, non of it is interactable. Which is fairly disappointing since the game came out in 2013, 2 years after Dues Ex Human Revolution, (which is way more interactive). It seemed as though the devs were trying to win a race or they belived the system capabilities would not be enough to handle an interactive enviroment. A couple more years, (2016), and they would not be able to sell the game without this.Another feature of this game is that, bear with me here, it is French made. Let me expand on this: if you are looking for a violent platformer, might I suggest assassin's creed, but this is not the game for you. It has a VERY intricate story, arguably 2 ""energy"" guns (its an upgrade on 1 gun), and a WHOLE LOT of martial arts moves. It also has this wierd feel to it, its kind of hard to explain, that you need to damn near die to beat the game (there is no coming out powerfully on top, it will always be a pyrrhic victory), and I played the game on the easiest difficulty.Lastly, it is arguable that there are too few ""bosses"", and too many ""swarms"" where in place of a boss, they just pack the room full of enemies to Chun Lee your way through.Some other minor problems I have had might be because I'm using a mouse and keyboard, but the controls at times, such as dodging and selecting buttons. Also, there are a few minor glitches, (I only counted 2 and they weren't gameplay changing). You also can't skip cutscenes.I know I did a lot of complaining here, but overall, the game has a great story, a huge concept (the devs need to make a second one), and an overall good game.$20? No       $10? Maybe        $9 or less? YesP.S. I just noticed that there is some sort of dlc for this game, I didn't have it, so I don't know if it makes the game better or not.			"

												I'll be the first to admit that this is an odd action adventure game. The combat relies on the execution of well-timed combos. Combos which you can and must define yourself. An interesting idea that breaks with usual genre conventions, but ends up feeling not really satisfying. Maybe because this mechanic forces you to perform accurately timed button presses all the time, which keeps the player from truly enjoying some sort of flow of combat.Another quite interesting aspect is the ability to remix memories. Basically you have to manipulate an ingame cutscene, which you can forward and rewind, to ultimately change the outcome to the one you desire. From a purely gameplay perspective this is indeed questionable, but it's an interesting variation of storytelling and does build atmosphere. You don't get to do this often during the game though.The rest of the gameplay mainly consists of horribly stilted platforming, trivial puzzles and walking around a scrictly linear path. Doesn't sound too exciting overall. The reason why I still immensly enjoyed Remember Me lies in the unusual science fiction scenario that manages to build an immersive atmosphere. Certainly not for everyone!			"

												With a very well developed story, combined with breathtaking visuals and great use of music, I would highly recommend this game despite it being marred by various issues.The game constantly has mouse sensitivity issues and you can find your camera flying to god knows where, especially during combat and when things get hectic. Remixing memories was also very hard because the game sometimes could not detect me rotating my mouse. I switched to a controller and everything became a lot easier to control. It seems like the game was not optimised for the keyboard and mouse.Combat was the most horrible experience for me. You are told that you can continue your combo if you dodge over an enemy, but half the time, your character chooses to dodge out of the way, making you miss your combo and precious PMP points.Overall, the game was presented and developed very well, and I applaud DONTNOD for their hard work.Story 8/10Art 9/10Music 8/10Combat 6/10 "

												Ca. 14 hours until the end for me.I saw no bugs or had any crashes I remember. The game has good graphics and the controls are good.You are playing a woman protagonist in levels which are more or less corridor levels. There is always only one good way to go. Sometimes you find clues about secrets, then you should look at that clue, find the secret and go back to your old route.The fights are melee fights, where you always use combos. You can just try to ignore the combos but because some combos start with repeated use of the same attack you can even customize this.A combo consists of a different number of either fist or foot attacks. And each but the first attack has to be of a kind. These ""kinds"" are things like ""concentrate on damage"", ""heal yourself"", ""gather points for your other special attacks"" or just enlarge the bonus of the last attack.The farther behind in a combo the attack is, the larger is the bonus you get.Imagine something like normal+heal+enlarged heal+even more enlarged heal against a boss.You can change these combos all the time, even in the middle of fight when you realize all your combos suck against the current enemy.The fights are fun. There is no but to this.The moving is a bit like in Assasin's Creed, but not as good. You can do cool moves and climb and jumb and run but only when the game allows it for a certain spot at this time.So one moment you fight for your live or just want to jump on a knee high platform... not possible. The fight is over, you can climb there without problems. Two spots look the same, but the one is the ""right"" way, so to one you can do an incredible cool jump, to the other not, you die. That can be very frustrating.If you are used to the open worlds from Assassin's Creed then you should start the game with a VERY open mind, because it is really NOT like Assassin's Creed, even if the fighting and the moving are a bit like it.The story is ok or even good, not sure, it was good enough to keep me playing.If you get the game for non-full price, yes, try it, it might be your new favourite.But it might be you get bored after 10 minutes.This game was not half as good as I expected because of the vidoes and reviews.But still, it was fun. I'd give it a 6.5 / 10. Meaning, it is better than average, but not one of the ""you must have played it"" games.			"

												Ca. 14 hours until the end for me.I saw no bugs or had any crashes I remember. The game has good graphics and the controls are good.You are playing a woman protagonist in levels which are more or less corridor levels. There is always only one good way to go. Sometimes you find clues about secrets, then you should look at that clue, find the secret and go back to your old route.The fights are melee fights, where you always use combos. You can just try to ignore the combos but because some combos start with repeated use of the same attack you can even customize this.A combo consists of a different number of either fist or foot attacks. And each but the first attack has to be of a kind. These ""kinds"" are things like ""concentrate on damage"", ""heal yourself"", ""gather points for your other special attacks"" or just enlarge the bonus of the last attack.The farther behind in a combo the attack is, the larger is the bonus you get.Imagine something like normal+heal+enlarged heal+even more enlarged heal against a boss.You can change these combos all the time, even in the middle of fight when you realize all your combos suck against the current enemy.The fights are fun. There is no but to this.The moving is a bit like in Assasin's Creed, but not as good. You can do cool moves and climb and jumb and run but only when the game allows it for a certain spot at this time.So one moment you fight for your live or just want to jump on a knee high platform... not possible.

Forget you soon.The GoodDamn. Before I played Remember Me, I've been told quite frequently that it was a mixed bag, but nothing could have prepared me for this. After a short introduction, you find yourself in the incredibly stylised Neo-Paris, which is without a doubt its best asset. The visual design is one of the most beautiful locations I have ever experienced. Everything is perfect. The city itself, the buildings, the denseness of everything, the neon lights, the struggling people, the robots.  The atmosphere is amazing as well, both the environmental sound design and the soundtrack. Everything screams cyberpunk. But how about the inside, under the hood?The BadYou see, while the outside is one of the most gorgeous settings, the actual game is riddled with flaws. It's one of the very few games I wish had a film or animated film set in the same universe, because it doesn't play well. The incredible design of Neo-Paris yearns to be explored, to be discovered and appreciated. Instead, you're walking an awfully straight linear path, and most of the times basically a hallway with nice decorations. It's such a shame, and I wonder how greatly this game would have benefited from an open-ended design with a focus on exploration. Besides the linear level design, the combat system is also rather unappealing. Making your own combos sound pretty good on paper, but the fighting itself just isn't a lot of fun. Pardon the metaphor, but it feels like the mentally challenged niece of the Batman Arkham series. And to make matters worse, you'll be fighting pretty frequently. The enemy placements are illogical, there's no thought behind it, except for artificially increasing the game length.Besides those two big flaws, I've also experienced some smaller flaws. The story is pretty uninteresting, and the characters are even less so. Which is a shame, because th. Also, the collectibles are pretty useless, since you can easily and very quickly regain your Health and Pressens through the Regen and Cooldown moves in your combos. In short:+ Incredible visual design, one of the most highly stylised settings I have ever seen.+ Soundtrack is good.+ HUD disappears outside of combat, which makes for a very clean screen.+ Mixing memories can be pretty fun.- Extremely linear, a huge waste of Neo-Paris.- Uninteresting story with uninteresting characters.- Mediocre combat system.- Fighting the same enemies with little diversity is tiring.- Final boss is stupid and misplaced.- Collectibles are basically useless.

												SCORE: 7/10This was a fun game overall, with a very interesting story, and mostly enjoyable gameplay. It is part Batman combat, part Assassin's Creed parkour, part Life Is Strange rewind mechanic, and part sci-fi dystopian novel. The parts mostly come together and you can definitely see how Dontnod took the rewind mechanic and improved upon it in Life Is Strange. Still a fun game and solid dystopian story. Definitely worthy of your purchase and play on a sale.			"

												Half way through Episode 3 and really enjoying the game. It received poor reviews but I think this is a case where the reviews should be ignored. The gameplay is very enjoyable and creating new combos brings a fun aspect to the game. One recommendation is to use a controller with this game as keyboard/mouse is a pain. It is a very linear game so do not expect to go exploring.The graphics are crisp and nice on the eyes and the mechanics of the game fit very nicely. Scaling walls and looking for upgrades is a nice addition to the story. It is not a button masher (GoW style) but more a skilled linking of attacks to ensure a good execution.Give it a shot			"

												Set in a not-too-distant dystopian future, Remember Me tells a compelling story, one that draws here and there on classic cyberpunk, particularly Ghost in the Shell.  The combat mechanic is generally fluid, though I was often confused about what I needed to do in order to defeat a particular boss and the camera, which whipped around crazily, frequently made me dizzy during fights that took place in narrow corridors.  The levels are also very linear, and the collectibles are a bit lackluster.  If the developers can fix the camera, open up the levels, and add some depth to the combat system, they could turn this game into a *memorable* franchise.			"

												Ironically it's called remember me and yet after 2 or 3 days to i will forget about it.dont expect to explore paris cause you will only see a glimpse of it , the game throw at you new characters in each lvl (the voice acting, the cutscenes tries so hard to make you feels bad and sad about them but it will only makes you feel uneasy it's almost pathetic)-well first of all the plot , start good and catches your attention right in the beginning but start to fall apart near the end of the game plus its filled with plot holes.(the sad part is that this game was supposed to be storytelling oriented kinda like MGS but fails to deliver)-slow painful repetitive and restricted gameplay, restricted because you do what the game wants you to do (do this do that , push this, dont do that ,kinda remind me mobile games tutorial but this time its not just in the beginning but in the whole  game)repetitive cause you will be doing the same combos on the same enemies on the same levels over and over again.slow and painful cause you cant skip the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ long cutscenes even after you finish it and if you're like me trying to get all the achievements you will have to finish the game at least twice and you have to watch every cutscenes each time you start a level + walk 5 steps and boom conversation that you have to hear all over again explaining to you what to do like you're a 2 year old mentally challenged boy or something ( you can't even walk during those discussions).-graphicly it's mediocre, not bad but could be better much better for an A game and as always with capcom (32 bit/DX9) horrible low textures just like in RE games ( screw small details right !!! )- voice acting is weird (they didn't even bother doing the french accent), the music is very load and annoying (during fight sequence) but the sound effect are good-the only bug i faced was in 2 levels , the sound of the game goes off or becomes almost mute-easy achievements but it will be a challenge to get them all cause you will have to replay the game and lose a lot of time watching the cutscene all over againand the sad part is that the devs blames the failure of the their game on gamers , said that they didnt like it cause the main character is a girl, lol we dont live in the 80s anymore and they are still charging 30$ for it ( it should be mx 15$ )finally i don't really recommend this game for people that wont a game that deliver in terms of good plot and great gameplay , for 30$ you can get at least 2 great game5/10( and whats with the ""Remember you soon"" catch phrase ?!!! its really dumb			"

												Remember Me has excellent visuals and a cool post-cyberpunk (is that a thing?) storyline, but its combat mechanics are fairly shallow (and indeed most of the depth in them is unnecessary for completing the game), and its free climbing is pretty much always limited to a single path that's spelled out for you step by step.The memory remix scenes are conceptually some of the coolest stuff to come out of games in a long time -- you can dive into peoples' memories and change little details to radically alter how those memories play out and affect them -- but in execution, it's pretty much just trial and error.Pick it up on sale and for the price of a movie ticket you'll get a story and effects worthy of a fun summer sci-fi flick. Just don't expect much of the mechanics. "

The following sums up the game: Great artwork Great 3D visuals The memory remixing (altering) is really interesting concept (A source of inspiration for Life Is Strange) Linear Around 10 hours gameplay at max.

This is called ""fridge horror"" by some...Pretty believalbe as well.Except that I personally find it unplausible for Nilin to end where you take control of her in the prologue, given who she is and what her... certain connections you learn near the end of the game are.Such people just don't end being dumped into vivisectionist prison as test subjects with zero chance of survival.Everything else... is realistic.And that is what makes this game so scary.It is not a ""dystopian fantasy future"" you are going to laugh about, thinking ""well, that won't happen ever"". No. Here, you'll think ""oh my god, if such a technology is ever invented, it WILL turn out like this eventually, 100%.""			"

												I picked this game up in a sale a while ago, because what I had previously seen and read of it sounded interesting, but initial reviews weren't really encouraging. It took me a long time to actually play this game - and boy, am I glad I finally did!On many accounts the reviews were probably correct, especially in regards to the combat system. The fighting is ARPG style, similar to other brawlers like Batman or the recent Shadow of Mordor, and mainly takes place in smallish arenas along the path. Fights can be quite challenging, because of the many emenies attacking from all sides, requiring you to dodge and evade, and stringing together an 8-hit combo can be rather tricky. The bit that falls flat is the ""combat lab"", which allows you to create your own combos out of different moves. All moves have the exact same timing, albeit different animations. The only difference is in their effect. Some moves heal, others reduce cooldown on your super moves or give you bonuses for your next combo. Overall this seems more like a gimmick than a fully fledged system. Because as mentioned above, stringing together longer combos is already quite tricky.However, it is not so much the combat that kept me playing, but the intricately realized, dystopian world in which Nilin, the main protagonist, tries to make sense of her purpose and fights to regain her memory and identity. The game is beautiful to look at. Vibrantly coloured, high fidelity environments give Neo-Paris a believable not-so-distant-future vibe. Between fights, Nilin will have to frequently traverse rooftops, building facades and other obstacle courses, Tomb Raider style. This breaks up the pace really nicely, and makes room to get the story moving while exploring.The story is another strong point of this game. The tale as such is nothing groundbreaking, but it explores some interesting themes through unconventional means, like the memory manipulation scenes. These sequences let you re-arrange an NPCs memory of past events, to effect a different outcome in Nilin's timeline. All of these are tied neatly into the overall narrative, and provide some very welcome depth to Nilins character development, which overall is very strong - for a game...I am very happy that I didn't just let this one pass me by! If you like Tomb Raider mixed with a bit of Deus Ex, you should have a look at this title.My scores:Graphics: 9/10Story: 9/10Combat: 7/10Overall score: 8.5/10Cheers.			"

												7/10    Remember Me caught my attention via Youtube, like many of us I hadn't heard any of it before that point. I bought this game much later though, last year to be exact as I saw it on Humble.  Remember Me is a game where you play as a memory hunter, Nilin, in futuristic Paris where everyone's memories can be changed or stolen. What first was supposed to be an utopia without misery, has turned into a nightmaris situation, just like what happens with any other too-good-to-be-true worlds.   Your job in this game however, is to gain your own memories back and stop whatever is destroying people's minds and memories.    This game is console ported game, and sadly it shows time to time with controls. Otherwise the port has seemed to work out alright. However, I recommend playing this with a controller if possible.  Pros:     - Beautiful aesthetics, background arts ect.   - Interesting, unique concept   - Satisfying combat - Soundtrack on point - Characters are memorable along with the story-line Cons:    - Not so well done console port, clunky controls on keyboard.  - Main charcter is main focus, you do not interract with other characters more than once or twice. - Ending will most likely leave you unsatisfied -  Quicktime events tend to start without any kind of warning, sometimes it's even unclear what you're supposed to press and where.- Despite the story-line being good, it was fairly short and left some questions unanswered or added more confusion to the cart.  This game could've been so much more than it is, but the flaws of it weight it down quite bit. It would've been awesome if the game had had more free, parkour like running instead of locking you to specific areas to go up and down from.   I recommend grabbing this game from sales. It is quite underrated game, but woth playing at least once.			"

Product received for free
												Remember Me is an excellent action adventure with an intriguing story. The year is 2084, the human memories have become a commodity, as they can be traded or even removed from a person. This happens via the 'Sensen', a technology that not only allows access to the human memory to outside sources but also augments your reality, allowing you to see information literally floating in the air, e.g.: ""Store is closed due to..."" and can be used to communicate, like a cell phone. You play Nilin, a memory hunter that ironically has lost all her memories. You were the best in what you did, as you could not only steal memories, but you could remix them. While remix is perhaps not the proper word, in-game you'll find out that it means that you can alter memories by partially changing them. The gameplay is divided among 3 major categories, fighting, exploration and puzzle solving. -Fighting: Nilin will have to fight if she wants to survive and she re-learns that  early in the game. To fight you use certain combo moves, a combination of punches and kicks that depending on the combo are used in different sequences. The very first combo you'll have access is the triple punch. Now to spice things up, you can modify these combos with special moves called 'pressens', there are 4 categories to utilise, damage, healing, cooldown and chain. All do damage, but damage pressens deal more damage, healing pressens restore some HP, cooldown pressens reduce the remaining time of your special moves, and finally the chain pressen can deal any of the other three and further amplify its special property, depending what type of move was placed before it, in the combo. Also, the further a pressen is from the combo start, the higher its effect. So a 'punch-heal punch-damage punch' will do more damage and heal less than a 'punch-damage punch-heal punch'. Additionally, as the story progresses, you will unlock some ultimate moves, that once used trigger a cooldown that can be reduced by using cooldown pressens on your combos. Finally, you can edit your combos on the fly, be it in combat or even at 1 HP left. There are also boss fights, each quite unique and with different phases, all end with an interactable fighting scene, where you'll be prompted to use certain moves, failing to do so will result in the boss healing a bit and you'll have to do it again. Most boss fights will provide Nilin with an upgrade upon victory. As far as game difficulty goes, it just alters your enemies durability and damage. If you enjoy the combo system then I suggest you put the game on hard.-Exploration (or platforming): Sadly the game's world feels too linear, meaning there is only 1 way to move forward, and besides Nilins excellent wall climbing abilities, you are allowed to use only certain ledges, pipes or platforms to proceed. However, to cleverly fix this, the developers but several collectables to find in each area, making your time to explore worthwhile and makes you notice how awesomely well the level details are. Said collectables can increase your combat stats or unlock artwork. Most of the combat related ones are hinted by an image preceding them. As the game progresses these will become harder to notice and, if you want them, you'll have to look for them.-Puzzles: There are few of them overall. Some will be in the 'real' world, like altering platforms in order to make a path to proceed, and other will be in 'memories'. Memory related puzzles are truly the jewel of this game, you enter a person's memory and you have the ability to alter certain, seemingly minor, elements, be it a switch or making a bottle fall, the end result can surprise you! I strongly encourage you to try different combinations as most options have a noticeable effect and as each memory remix has its own bonus achievement! Sadly there are only 4 of these puzzles.The graphics are quite good as each area is well detailed, be it slums or high society. Enabling postprocessing will further amplify your game experience. However, I was amazed by the music! The soundtrack is simply amazing, I was in the main menu for 10 minutes just listening to that one track! The voice acting is also good, making the characters more lively and believable.The controls are quite simple and easy to get used to as the game will give you tips on what you need to do, especially if it's something new to your arsenal. The game supports both keyboard-mouse and controller inputs. However, only the keyboard can be customised, with the controller having a fixed layout, which left me with the dodge button being uncomfortable to use while combo-ing. But controller has a unique advantage over keyboard, on the boss execution/finish-off scene, where you'll be prompted to press certain buttons, the controller will display directly the button that needs to be pressed, e.g.: X/Y/A, while keyboard will display the move e.g.: punch/kick/dodge. While it's not a big issue, it may confuse players as some of these icons, e.g.: dodge, are rarely displayed during the game.The only negative areas of Remember Me are that combat can feel repetitive, which can be solved by setting the game on easy, also, while the outside areas feel and look massive, they are limited by the linear progression of the level. And finally, that there are only 4 memory remixes. However, while I certainly want more of those, given the level of detail into the 'action-effect' part of them I understand why these are only 4.On a grey area is the DLC, that, while it's certainly not a must buy, it will increase the number of pressens you have available and most importantly will almost double your chain pressens. The only real benefit is that you'll be able to make complete combos sooner in the game and have more complete combos later on.Overall Remember Me is a great game and a game that you will remember (pun intended). I enjoyed every bit of it and I'm going back to do the memory remixes again! It easily scores 8/10 on my list.-----------------------------------Introducing Gamephasiswww.gamephasis.com is a new gaming website featuring a talented team of game writers from around the world.

												Great presentation, characters, good story, fun combat system (although a bit too systemic and detached).My complaint is that there are only four memory remix sections in the game... it was an underdeveloped and underused concept that I would have loved to see more of. A few of the platforming parts were boring.Other than that it's a really good game that I would heartily recommend. Underrated in my opinion.			"

												Pros: Intriguing story setting. Some of the outdoor environments are gorgeous. Memory remixes are fun and novel. Nilin is a stylish heroine. The English voice over is unforgettably well done.Cons: Extremely limited level design. ""Invisible walls"" everywhere. An outstanding example of the opposite of open world. Extremely linear level design. The game holds your hand and guides you through the levels. No exploration at all. Lack of diversity in enemy types. Leapers and Enforcers are your only foes. Combo customization doesn't have real impact on the combat, even in the highest difficulty setting. Unimpressive supporting characters. "

												Wanted to like this game though I'm not a big fan of the gameplay style but I just had to give up.The controls are way too bad... I tried both keyboard/mouse and gamepad but it doesn't work. Even in the easiest difficulty the fights are way too hard not because of the ennemies but because of the unresponsive controls. I tried changing the bindings see if a different key would work better but no it doesn't so it's clearly the game engine at fault. I'm stuck at one boss that I just can't pass because the only way to kill it is by aiming your special gun while moving and clicking to shoot at the same time and everytime the aiming button is not responsive so you press on it and nothing happen, you have to depress it and repress it to hopefully have it to work, but of course during that time you get hit... it's like this button would only work when the game allows it to in a way. And of course, getting rid of that boss is in 3 part and no checkpoint at the end of each part therefore if you die you have to start all over again and get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by those controls all over again.. till you are fed up with it and just give up. Too bad, I wanted to see where the story was going (even thoguh it was far from being very original) but won't be able to (unless I find a savegame that put me through that boss but then again I'd probably be stuck again a little while later) So my best guess is to find a playthrough on Youtube... I'm glad I got it in a sale. Would be very upset if I paid full price. Now, I understand why the studio went bankrupt... If you like the genre of action/platform with way too much fights and unresponsive controls, go ahead, otherwise you might want to try it out first.UPDATE: I finally managed to get through that boss fight thanks to some playthrough I found on Youtube. It seems to me that fight in particular really had a problem of lag with the Aiming button. The lag is always present but less noticeable in other fights. Lol, the fight right next after the boss fight I got stuck too... as predicted I might say but I managed it after a few retries. I'm glad I am able to go through the story and the game but I will not change my recommendation (as it either yes or no) because those fights are way too repetitive and frustrating in my opinion. I stick to my previous conclusion: try it first if you can.			"

												Ironically, the game ""Remember Me"" is very forgettable. It's combat is very Arkham-esque, and it's very counter-intuitive. Unlike the Arkham series it draws from, combos are pre-determined and have to be timed. This leads to a really stiff and unforgiving combat system. The story itself is interesting at first, but it struggles to keep you engaged.  I myself didn't complete the entire campaign, so please keep that in mind, but at no point was I really emotionally invested in Nillin's story. Just bland and boring for the most part. The memory mixing is a great gimmick, in theory, but it's extremely linear and doesn't really allow you to mess around with memories. It's just ""press button to do this specific remixing"". The parkour and platforming elements are pretty rough, in my opinion. They don't feel very fluid, and tend to be frustrating. I'd give this game a hard 5/10. It borrows from other games, and it's story tries to be unique, but it just falls flat in it's execution and leaves me wanting more.  "

Beautifully detailed in its presentation and an interesting story that left me satisfied in a good way! (not a ""that was alright, I guess"" kind of way)I would highly recommend you pick this up if you enjoy games that offer fairly straightforward pacing and storytelling (read: linear). It is totally a STEAL at its on sale price! But I have to say, after playing this all the way through, I would have been happy had I paid full asking price.Ugh! Just, completely underrated.

												This game sports a fascinating setting and gripping plot. It's future dystopia/paradise Neo-France and they invented the technology to alter and delete memories. Now we can erase all the pain without turning to booze, drugs, or sex! What's-the-worst-thing-that-could-HAPPEN. It's an action adventure game, so prepare to climb ledges and lunge from platforms like Just Cause. No guns though, so rev up that melee combo system. Combat is a real downer and at one point was so frustrating and poorly implimented I was about to quit. Damage increases alongside your combo meter but you can only RARELY execute the full combo without being interrupted which way more often than not makes it impossible to finish your combo. Too many enemies and crowds that attack way too fast. There are some KICKASS bosses and even a really interesting game mechanic where you enter someone's mind and alter their memories in a FMV sequence. The accumulation of your small changes to their memories results in HUGE differences in their perception. This is ingeniously executed and by far the most gratifying and unique part of the game.You can really tell combat is the weakest link in this otherwise forgotten (hah) video game. That's why their next project Life Is Strange catered to the studio's strength--the story.  "

While not without its flaws, the overall experience was really good, in my opinion. The art direction in this game is stunning, the game looks absolutely beautiful. The fighting gameplay reminds me of the Arkham games, though not as polished, but still quite fun. I wouldn't overlook Remember Me simply by the bad scores.			"

												Fun game, but it is first and foremost a brawler. If you don't like mashing left and right click several hundred times every few minutes, it will be very unpleasant.You can customize your combos in limited ways. Performing the 2nd-8th maneuver in a combo can give you either bonus damage, health, or reduce the cooldown on your S-Pressins (special attacks).The combos are as follows:Punch-Punch-PunchKick-Punch-Kick-Punch-KickPunch-Kick-Kick-Punch-Kick-KickKick-Kick-Kick-Punch-Punch-Punch-Punch-KickYou will unlock a number of the Pressins (slotted combo pieces) as you progress through the game, and each one is restricted to kick or punch. So if you only have free 2 health punch Pressins, you cannot make anything more complex than the simple 3-punch combo.Each stage of the combo does progressively more of the perk (i.e. a step 5 health Pressin will give more HP than a step 3 one), but don't expect to regularly reach anything beyond the 5-combo, because you will get interrupted all the time. You have to hit a stun S-Pressin or have 1 enemy remaining to get a long combo to completion.Some of the combos can just be easy cheesy, like Punch-Health Punch-Chain Punch. Such a combo will give you significant more HP than you lose by attacking an enemy that damages you when you hit them. Using a  6 combo of Punch-Cooldown Kick-Cooldown Kick-Cooldown Punch-Cooldown Kick-Chain Kick will allow you to completely remove the cooldown on the stun S-Pressin before it even wears off (you do have to perform it twice during the stun).There is some serious platforming, but the camera will change to fixed locations when you do certain areas. This can make it hard to see the indicator that you can make a jump or whatnot because you're looking at a 2D indicator from the side. When in these fixed camera locations, when you turn a corner, the camera jumps to a new fixed location and it can be disorienting, as well as your character will keep going on inverted controls for a second (pressing A to go left, then the camera changes, you character will go right while holding A until you let up for a second).The bosses LOVE to turtle. They will be unattackable unless you hit them with the stun S-Pressin, and will otherwise hurl explosives and minions at you endlessly until the stun S-Pressin comes off cooldown. Once you have managed to injure the boss to a critical state, the finishing move will be a Quick-Time Event. Failing the QTE will return them to non-critical health and you will be on cooldown for the stun again. A cooldown-heavy combo is highly suggested if you don't want to hear the boss repeat their lines for half an hour.Remixing memories is what we're all here for, and they're amazing how you can change little details to change a person's memory to a more favorable outcome for you. Unfortunately there are only 4 of these events, and pausing the memory on the glitches that you can interact with can be frustrating, as sometimes you have to hit the pause button before the ""glitch here"" icon appears onscreen.All-in-all, a fun game to get on sale. Replayability would be pretty subjective to the player, but I would think it to be low unless you just want to get all the collectables, as the cutscenes are unskippable and the fights tedious.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. Its got a beautiful level design, interesting story, though it seems pretty forced, and some interesting mechanics. Regardless, I hate this game. I hate the camera which is either delayed on movement or in a number of locations you can't move it at all to try to see where you need to go. The arrow indicators to show you where to go are a curse and a blessing. Its good that it shows you where to move most of the time but there are areas where the up/down arrow indicators are wrong. I spent 10 minutesd looking for away to go only to find out the pipe that has an up arrow really meant for me to go down. Now, I could forgive all of these minor flaws, all of them, but I can't forgive a game that CONSTANTLY KEEPS TAKING AWAY MY CONTROL. I'm about 20-25% of the way through the game and it keeps introducing more information and new mechanics at the worst possible time. Yes, that is what I want to do, read 5, 6 or 7 informaiton messages right when I'm in the middle of a fight. Pulling me out of the game and story to contantly give informaton I should have been shown at the start of the game is not ♥♥♥♥ing fun at all. That, on top of all the constant cutscenes makes it frustrating to actually lose onself in the world they are trying to build. Maybe one day I'll go back to visit it and finish, but I doubt it, and I don't say that very often.			"

												The first thing I want to say: ""Yes! ... It is totally overrated."" I really tried to like this game. It all starts out well. The first cutscenes were promising. Beautiful, a wonderful atmosphere and with a lot of details. The Soundtrack could win an Oscar. Boy, what could they have achieved with it. But when it comes to interaction: Zero.As marvelous the world may look like, there is nothing you can do beside walking and climbing the marked path. There are even screens indicating the locations of secret items, though it would be hard to miss them without the hints. And even the fighting scenes are boring and repetitive.The whole game consists of cutscenes, predefined paths, cutscenes, innovative but stupid minigames and cutscenes. The gamer’s part is minimal. If you are in to cinematic games with minimal interactions, grab it. I won't recommend it for gamers liking to explore and having more interaction.

It seems at times that there might be things that could have been improved, or changed. Voice acting was certainly a plus in this game, making the characters very believable. And even with all the technical bugs and missed opportunities, this game is worthy of being played. Unfortunately this game was created in the sense of being a console game, but it has been ported within acceptable parameters. In the end Remember me is a fun and worthy of it's price game.

												Highly recommended if you like cyberpunk or rain... so every fan of Blade Runner is invited ;-) I really felt sucked into the drama, mainly because you do not fight for or rescue the whole world but instead are confronted with a rather personal story around Nilin... very european style of storytelling if you know what I mean (the developers are French so that is no surprise).  I really enjoyed the game as a whole and also liked the fighting. But you have to learn the combos and master some strategies to be successful. Expect AAA graphics and a fantastic sondtrack / score by Olivier Deriviere (Obscure 2, Alone in the Dark).			"

												It's not the greatest new IP to come out recently, but it isnt as bad as the scores may lead you to think. I've only just hit the final hours of the game, and it's definitely not worth the full price. Get it on a sale, it's too short to merit anything beyond $15, but definitely worth your time.-The graphics of the world are amazing in some areas, even with them on low I found the world to look rather stunning, it's a shame there's so little going on where you're supposed to be. I would have to interact with the enviorment more. It is indeed extremely linear, so if that turns you off just stop right here.-I personally loved the music and sound effects, though I do wish they had used some scores in more location or at least not where they did. I sometimes found myself listen to what seemed to be battle music in an average climbing section, though the majority of the time it fit the mood. I don't know if it was just me, but I experienced quite a few audio bugs. Multiple times I had duplicate sounds playing over each other, and the audio cut out entirely in some sections.-The story is definitely alright, but having just finished DX:HR my expectations may have been a bit high :P There are a few plot twists and I really enjoyed it, though I did wonder why I had to revist so many areas.- The combat, everyones favorite gripe. I recommend playing with a gamepad if you have it, I found some difficulty in managing everything, as unlike Arkham City or the majority of other games you dont have large amounts of time to react, or a counter. Unfortunately the dodge mechanic is rather lacking. I often found myself trying to dodge an AOE attack only to rebound over the back of the guy next to me and still be in the blast radius. Which is sad considering it's your only escape tool. The 3 hit combo is rather useless in my opinion, but being able to see the moves you'll use in the combo lab makes it fun to create the flashiest combos etc. I loved the design of the S-pressens, but losing all of your focus if you die was incredibly frustrating.-The controls are a bit finicky, as you can tell from my difficulty with the dodge in combat. Often in climbing I found myself headed back the direction I came when I wanted to back eject instead. Overall it definitely felt like it was designed for consoles in mind, but it's nothing too difficult.-DLC I found the majority of the dlc moves to be rather useless, but the Spinning Bird Kick is incredibly handy as the last hit of a combo, as it's rather an aoe meelee move, and as the last hit does alot of damage. The rest I never really used, but I loved that one.It's definitely not the greatest game ever, but its a fun few hours of distraction, and I hope we'll see a more expanded universe from this IP in the future.

												This is one of those games that is way more worthwhile than it's metascore would lead you to believe. It's not perfect, but it's engaging, it's gorgeous (especially if you've got a rig that can crank the settings up), and the story is solid with punctuated moments of impressive depth.The combat and traversal isn't wholly unique or innovative, really, but it's done well enough that it doesn't feel prohibitive to progressing through the story. The combat in particular, while it can take some getting used to, does allow for some creativity on the player's part, and can be customized through the swapping of individual strikes to form combos to suit your playstyle, or different situations.The memory sweeping mechanic is an interesting one, and probably had the most promise of anything in the game, however it winds up being under-utilized, with only a few points during the game giving you the opportunity to use Nilin's signature skill. The process itself is neat at first, but sort of unravels into a time-consuming trial-and-error experiment, with no real indication of which triggers that the player can control will actually have any desirable effects. Honestly, my one hope is that DONTNOD get's another crack at a game set in this world so that they can really hone this particular aspect of the game maybe create something really cool the next time around.Anyway, this game wound up flying under many radars, between the fledgling developer, the new IP, the middling reviews... But it's definitely worth your time, especially if you're looking for an action/adventure game featuring a strong and interesting female protagonist, and a beautifully realized world, wrapped in a quality storyline that will pull you along to a satisfying end.

												I can safely say that this one was one of the rare innovative games in the last couple of years. Unique art, interesting gameplay mechanics and a creative/fresh-blood story. I'm especially surprised by the female protagonist, I can count on my one hand how many games have that currently. What was kind of a bit disappointing is the tunnel-linnear route of each chapter, probably because most of the games nowadays is going towards sand-boxing theme even if sometimes its filled with nothing (yes I'm looking at you Maffia 2), so I cannot really complain, but to be honest I dont think many people will play this game more than once. The combat mechanics is pretty much Batman-Arkham style, with this combo-lab improvement, interesting although the fights were quite frustrating from the 1/3 of the game even on normal! Invisible enemies? Enemies who constantly reflect damage? Gang-rap? There is no real tactics here, but teeth-grinding. I must admit by the end of the game I was pretty much at the verge of chucking my controller at the wall, eh oh yes, its seriously a controller-game, I warned you. Closer to the end of the game I have found some tricks, and it got a bit easier, although I always hated games where the common/filler fights were 3x harder then the boss fights. And one more thing, directed at all game companies: DO ENABLE US SKIPPING CUTSCENES! Hordes of angry mob of videogamers will storm your castles, if you do not stop making games WITH achievements AND unskippable cutscenes! Goodnight.			"

												Set in a dystopian future Paris, the attention to detail to the level design is quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, I find myself wishing this was an open world along the lines of an Assassin's Creed game. However, it plays more like Mirror's Edge where each level involves following a predetermined route, solving simple puzzles interspersed with combat and ending with a boss fight. Rather like playing through a movie or novel with a set path. The thematic elements and storyline are what draw me to this game more than anything else and in that sense I enjoy it for all the same reasons I enjoyed Mirror's Edge.			"

												You know what this game reminds me of? ONI. Oh my god, how much I miss ONI. Playing this game really did make me feel like I was having that kind of experience again, with characters that I enjoyed interacting with (that were just as odd and interesting as Bungie's characters were). I would recommend this game for anyone who wants a game a bit off the beaten path; perhaps it's a bit easy, perhaps it's a bit repetitive, but it's still an adventure and a fun time. It also helps that I enjoy cyberpunk. ;)			"

												This is such a fantastic and different game. The art and scenery of this is gorgeous, the story is heartbreaking and amazing all in one, and the combat is fun. They made just basic combos with punches and kicks a fun time. Also, definitely play in Memory Hunter mode. Really get a good experience with that.			"

												I picked this game up on a whim during the Winter Sale. I had never even heard of this game before or it's developer (DONTNOD). But after watching a trailer or two I decided to pick it up and I have to say it was well worth the $13 I paid for it. The game is currently $50 on Steam, I'm not sure it's really worth buying at full price, but if you can get it on sale I would highly recommend you do so. The game has a good mix of action/fighting, climbing challenges, and puzzle solving. I really enjoyed the combat in this game, it was pretty fluid and I liked the combo system as well. Although I will admit some of the fights got a little frustrating at times, but it made it that much more worth wild when you were able to finally get past them.Definitely a thumbs up from me.			"

The Good+ The overall style and aesthetics and level design looks fantastic + Gets away from the bland  post-apocalyptic style that a lot of games has+ The dialogue is so bad its good sometimes+ Platforming mechanics are decent, level design is straightforward, not much guessing work+ The cutscenes are very well done+ Decent use of quick time events(used well in this scenario)+ The sounds for the game are greatThe Bad- The story is pretty bad, I won't give much away but its just so corny. Like really corny.- The boss battles are pretty bad, I don't know how to elaborate more than that - Combat system is ""different"" but also just bad The Ugly -- The combat system is pretty atrocious -- The dialogue and voice actors are straight gutter quality(bad enough that it made me laugh - so I gave a +)I would recommend this game for maybe like $5-$10 - no more.

												Eh, it's okay.What you have here is a neat cyberpunk setting where, as you might expect, new technologies that have great promise (in this case, the ability to alter one's memories) lead to the creation of a world that... isn't so good. There's this massive corporation that, through it's control of this new memory-altering technology, is able to use that to exert a great deal of influence upon society and undertake some really messed up experiments. You play as Nillin, who is a ""memory hunter"" who is also to not only steal memories from other people, but to actually dig into their minds and change what they remember about them. It only happens about 4 times, but the memory altering is pretty cool as you try to find what you need to screw with in order to make a past event change - at least in the eyes of the person whose memories you are altering. I'd say the gameplay part of it kinda reminds me of Life is Strange, but... that's no surprise because it's the same devs who made both that and this game.The rest of the gameplay consists of some simple platforming, punching people, and... boss fights. I'm no fan of platforming, but here it basically tells you where to go next so at least this time I didn't sit around scratching my head about what to do. The combat that you engage in regularly involves using combos (that you adjust yourself which is pretty cool) and some special abilities that you unlock throughout the game. And while the regular combat is pretty neat, the boss fights... basically are a dodge-fest as you wait for special ability cooldowns (though you can shorten those cooldowns via yer combos). It's easily the weakest part of the game for me. Oh yeah, and the fact that the cutscenes are unskippable is rather annoying and is keeping me from hunting down the rest of the achievements. >_>So, overall? Yeah... this game is okay. The setting and story are competent, though a bit forgettable. The memory altering and combo building parts of the gameplay are pretty cool, but those have to share the same space as lame platforming and smelly boss fights. In other words... this would be a ""maybe"" recommendation from me, but is going to end up with ""yes"" because there is no such option.If the setting sounds interesting, then I suppose you can pick this up and check it out. Have funs! :o			"

												Make no mistake, this game is a delight to look at.  The city of Neo-Paris has been rendered in a way that lends considerable creedence to their vision of the near future.  Lots of little details are included that make the environments believable.That task was probably made easier by the highly-linear nature of the game.  On the one hand, you can lament how incredible this would have been to have the same level of detail in an open-world, but the linear nature allows for a high degree of polish on the path you follow through the world and story.The story's competent, and told well enough, though I don't think I was invested as the story expected me to be.  Nilin comes across as introspective, yet more than a little cold.There's a neat memory-remix mechanic introduced early on and it felt like I was nearly halfway through the game before it came up again, though there are several instances before all's said and done.  I'll echo the sentiments of several other reviewers who wished there was ""more of that, please.""The combat itself is also competent, in the Arkham vein but with a dodge rather than a counter, with a few nice touches to spice things up.  Depending on your play style, it's easy for some fights to overstay their welcome, but once you become comfortable with the combo system and fight mechanics (or like me learn to stop hoarding your special attacks) you can dispatch with most battles relatively expeditiously.  It's got QTE's, and while the button you press corresponds to the action executed it still feels more like a match game than a act of skill, but they're used to cap off certain battles rather than as a routine mechanic.I played with a mouse and keyboard and occasionally felt like the game wanted me to be using a controller, but it was never a serious handicap.  (Here's a tip if you're using a mouse and kb like me - the ""Rewind"" motion is like drawing a counter-clockwise circle with your mouse.  Perhaps I missed a critical instruction, but that really threw me off during the first memory remix.)I think there was something else I wanted to say, but I just...can't remember.			"

												Remember Me is an enjoyable game with amazing atmosphere, reasonably challenging fighting mechanics, and a decent story with some emotional twists. The memory remixing portion of a game where you need to change a person's memory is quite interesting but can be heart wrenching, as you need to rewind/forward some ""painful"" segments many times. Futuristic Neo-Paris is a good escape for the 10 or so hours of a play through. I would recommend. :)			"

												Nilin in WonderlandDespite some technical limitations, Remember Me is simply gorgeous with an intriguing premise but ultimately the experience becomes flat and repetitive long before the games final episode.Players assume the role of Nilin, an errorist agent who has been captured and her mind erased. After being commanded to follow a drone to a chair to complete the final process, a voice guides her on how to escape. The voice is that of Edge and he'll remain with you throughout the entire game as he instructs Nilin from each objective while Nilin herself isn't too sure if she trusts him.Once Nilin has escaped, Edge aids her further by telling her to meet another agent by the name of Tommy who gives Nilin her trademark outfit and a device that will help her remix the memories of others. Nilin is a memory hunter and has the ability to go into the minds of others and change their memories and as she is attack by Olga, a bounty hunter, this is where one of the games more interesting gameplay mechanic comes into play.During these remix sections, a scene will play out as a typical cutscene but once over, players are then given an objective to complete. Control is then given to the player who then must rewind through what they’ve just seen by rotating the left analog stick and interacting with part of the scene when a glitch appears. These can play out in completely different ways as experimenting can lead to its own rewards. Unfortunately these parts are so few and far between, half of the game goes by before encountering another. While it would've been predictable to have these remix parts for every episode, I found the ones there extremely enjoyable and would've happily done a dozen more if not only to spice the core gameplay up.For the most part, Remember Me plays out like the combination of a bad Uncharted with a bad Batman. You’ll do a bit of dull platforming for a bit then reach an area that looks like a fight will happen then a fight happens. The fighting mechanics do offer a unique take as combinations can be changed to suit how someone plays the game. For example, you can have one combination that focuses on attacks while another focuses on health regen. However, it only remains interesting for the first few episodes as the game just dolls out wave after wave of enemies. Even on the easiest difficulty this becomes as chore.The same too can be said of the games characters. Characters such as Olga and Tommy seem interesting at first appearance but nothing is done with them, especially Olga who is seemingly written out after the second episode only to randomly appear for a few brief seconds at the end of the game. Episode two goes one step further as players are introduced to X-Mas Kid. He’s given quite the spotlight as you’re given an idea of who he is and how he behaves through TV ads all with himself boasting all which lead up to a very special boss encounter.While the core gameplay is bad impression of other much better playing games, it can at least stand proud of its art design and visuals. The game grips you with the slums you first find yourself in to the beautiful streets of Saint-Michel but I quickly found myself very bored of the locations by the latter half of the game after visiting similar locations and running around very familiar looking hallways.The game is a very mixed bag and really falls in the last half of the game as the story becomes a mess that’s weirdly hard to follow and is at odds with the intrigue and mystery of the beginning but in the end, I wish I could remix it into a better one as the ironically titled Remember Me is a forgettable brawler that fails to deliver on its own premise.I would still really recommend this game though but only to those who know that this isn’t a great game by any means but to see the potential of what’s on offer here. There’s a really great Remember Me somewhere but this isn’t it.			"

												One of the most beautiful games I have ever played. The world is perhaps the most meticulously detailed that I've ever seen. The story is, although slow at first, fantastic once it's fully set up a few hours in. And the customizable combat system is a pretty cool idea that was well implemented.However, this game has many downsides to it. Mainly on the gameplay aspect. The combat basically consists of button mashing, QTEs, and the occasional dodge, which means it gets repetitive and old really quickly. The platforming is fun, but gets a bit repetitive halfway through the game, since the platform design gets somewhat reused. I'm tired of typing sentences... Here's it's pros and cons.Pros:+Great Puzzles+Original Combat Customization+Good Story+Memory Remixing Ability+Beautifully Crafted World & Atmosphere+Great Soundtrack+Epic Boss FightsCons:+Platforming Is Clunky And Rarely Reuses Areas+Combat Gets Repetitive And Boring+Only 5 Memory Remixes (They were so interesting, it was an injustice to not add more.)+The H30 Puzzle6/10			"

												I went into this game not really knowing what I expected; I was slightly dissappointed by my early playtime in the game. However, the more of the game I played, the more I liked it.DONTNOT Entertainment made several design choices in this game that made it very unique. The result was a game that may not have been fine-tuned to satisfy the masses' desire for a cookie-cutter game, but instead a work of art. The world that you are immersed in while playing this game is stunningly beautiful; a cyberpunk universe that's not just gritty but also gleaming is rarely touched upon by world designers, and it really paid off. The characters are all well-thought-out as well. Though some of the diologue gets cheesy and some lines are fairly predictable, there's a lot of effort that was done to stay true to an artistic vision, and that's something I really like.Now, on to the gameplay! This game has a little bit of everything--you have uncharted platforming, some third-person shooting, the unique remixing mechanic, some puzzles, and the fantastic combat. While the combat can get repetitive, it's very polished. The ability to create and manage your own combo strings is really cool, and encourages you to explore the world to level up faster. The wide variety of abilities you can select really do a good job of making you feel powerful and in control. To call it 'immersive' would be a stretch, but you get more of an ability to 'choose' how combat will flow (similar to say...Prototype). Most of my issues with the game are it's pacing; the levels are pretty linear, and the long platforming sections are sort of distracting from the combat. Can I call it a perfect work of art? No. However, it is a game that I would recommend people to take a look at. The gaming industry should certainly take a look at this game, because we need more innovation and new ideas out there.			"

												I've bought this game when it was on sale, personally I wouldn't pay the full price, the full price it's a bit expensive for me, but I am very glad that I got the game. I love a good strong women lead character and Nilin is amazing, the voice acting is great, the figure the movements of her are great. I am just in love with her, and it's always good to play with a female character (feminist alert). The storyline is simple, you are a person who lost her memory, can't remember a thing, you're trying to remember and everything just completes itself really. The world is set in Neo-Paris, very futuristic, but it has a dystopic vibe to it. You're feeling like you're in a chaotic world, which I liked. There are some puzzle bits in the game, they are enjoyable, complicated enough but not too hard too. There is a hospital bit which is very enjoyable, I never played a part like that and I absolutely loved it. My computer isn't great so I played in low-medium graphics but they were good, so I believe that if you have a good computer you'll enjoy the graphics very much. I think the soundtrack is very good, especially the main theme is amazing. First of all, I am not an action gamer, This paragraph is about the action of it. I am more like a simulator, casual, indie game kinda person. Euro Truck Simulator, Cities Skyline, Don't Starve kinda... I am not good with FPS games, or any kinda action games really. But I could manage the mechanics easily, they were easy enough for me to be comfortable with, I could arrange MY OWN COMBOS. Which was amazing, I litereally made combos focusing on gaining health and used them like 100 times in every single fight. The boss fights were bit tricky for me, I played each fight like 6 times but I did it, eventually. And I played on easy mode so if you're good with them you can always play them in harder modes, make more complicated combos, make more fancy moves idk. You can configure them according your skills, it's up to you! So I think that's good. Some people may think that the mechanics are not good enough but they were good enough for me. I'd give a solid 7/10 to it. And btw I am a keyboard/mouse player so if you're using controllers, it has to be much more better.Overeall I'd give a solid 8.5/10 to the game.			"

												[4/5]{TL;DR:Pros- Excellent female protagonist, good story, and beautiful environmentsCons- Game wants to be a movie, my knowledge of physics keeping the combat from being more than a bad joke}Set in a perfectly realized cyberpunk future, Remember Me is deeply satisfying. The environments are beautifly detailed and complement the free running elements of this title, even if it can turn into a ""look at the pretty skybox"" stlye staright path a times. On the subject of free running, you might expect a free running brawler to include some moves that include jumping on your enemies from a higher point, but this is sadly not the case, despite some of your early enemies utilizing this exact tactic. Instead you, playing as asmall, skinny woman, must stand on the same level as larger, sometimes hulking, enemies. Of course the protagonist does this with great ease, you don't want to design a game to be too frustrating, after all. I'm not saying Nilin should be weak and helpless like so many other female characters in games, in fact, I think she maybe the best example of a female protagonist in a video game yet. That said, while I can imagine that anyone of her size who can run and jump all around the obstacles Nilin encounters just on her way to the local bar to have the endurance and speed to hold up in a fight, the boss fight against X-Mass Kid is a mahor breaking point of this logic. Regardless, the combat is simple, yet fun. Besides, the size difference isn't the biggest problem with the game, the problem is that Remember Me desperately wants to be a movie. I may have only just started episode 3 (something Valve can no longer use as an excuse), but a good chunk of the game, about 1/3 of my playtime, has been spent in cutseens, scripted sequences and ""pretty skybox"" segments. I know this might be the ""no"" moment for those considering playing this, but hold on just a second. It turns out that the story is really good, so the ""want to be a movie"" problem is very neglegable. Also, in my opinion, the exploration and combat parts (you know, the game part) of the game show up enough to keep the movie bits from overstaying their welcome. All in all, this is a nice story with some fun, anarchist-cyberpunk brawler action. There are some flaws, as there are with any game, but nothing that can't be ignored when put next to the better elements.			"

												Graphics are fantastic. The sounds and game environment are rich and immersive. Gameplay is good, especially with a controller. I used an XBox 360 controller. Was a bit difficult with keyboard/mouse, probably because I don't play many linear games like this one. In fact the one complaint I'd have about this game is how linear it is. You go from one fight sequence to the next. Your character Nillin spends most of the game on route to an objective. There are lots of corridors to navigate and every 3rd or so hallway opens out into an arena/courtyard of some type where something always falls down behind you to trap you until you defeat several foes, after which some forward obstruction miraculously falls away allowing you to continue.This formula gets a bit tiring and persists throughout the game but when it was done, I realized that I had enjoyed it far more than I thought I would. So given that this is not my favorite genre, I have to give it a thumbs up. In fact I didn't even come to the store page to write a review but to see if there was DLC so that I could continue.			"

												Remember me is one of those games that you should play, but would annoy you at times during play.I recommand the game, but I have my issues with it.Pros:The game has an interesting plot, and the setting (the city of neo paris) is extremely well thought of. The fights are fun and fluid. The remembrance mechanisms are well thought of and enjoyful.The game also brings forth important questions, and (unlike some games) is not really afraid to try and answer.Cons:However - the linearity of the game is obscene. Doors lock down and open to lead you in a straight line through the city.Your character can jump from ledge to ledge (assasins creed style / farcor style), but can't go over a 2 inch cardboard box on the floor. The fights are a bit repetitive and there's not enough remembrance mini games (perhaps 5 throughout the game).I also have an issue with the fact that it's a future paris with robots and virtual reality, but there's only one gun in the entire city (and someone shoots himself with it). Only bots and gunships seem to have real guns.And lastly - at some point during the endgame, you get attacked by a horde which shouldn't really be there, isn't a real obstacle at that point (you finished a far harder horde 5 minutes before), and has no real point. That single fight scene really damaged the immersive experience that was a big part of the end game.  "

												3rd person, action, fighting game with platforming. You play as Nilin, a memory hunter as they call her in 2084 Neo-Paris. Story is very good in my opinion, that unravels as you go on, with unexpected twists, wont spoil.Game has some great environments, but most of the levels are linear, small, closed off sections. Tutorial system that will help you learn the basics, that I found very useful. There is simple platforming element, in form of climbing walls, ledges, pipes, etc., most of them are highlighted and you can't climb any wall you want. Basically you run couple dozen meters, climb a bit, then get cutscene and begin fighting some enemies. There is no particular order, but it's not as bad as it sounds.Fighting involves punch and kick combos that you combine in ""Combo maker"", dodging is also vital, to avoid damage. You unlock more and more moves as you play the game, there are different kinds of combat moves, some add more damage, some restore your health, some reduce cooldowns on more powerful moves, etc.Movement animations are good, didn't notice anything troubling, voice acting is also on level and is enjoyable, cutscenes are nicely done and angled. You will notice some low resolution textures here and there, but generally it's good looking game.There are a lot of collectibles in form of Data packages in game, that award you health upgrades, as well as some art and 3D models in Extras. Personally I very much liked how game levels looked, as well as Nilin and her small little bosom. I recommend this, have fun!			"

												A strong opening for Dontnod. The story and atmosphere of this game are superb, though the gameplay is a little lacking - I found that I enjoyed the fights with normal enemies more so than some of the boss fights. That, however, doesn't ruin the overall experience of this title. I bought remember me during a sale and would recommend it for purchase in another one. I am looking forward to seeing how the developer's next game shapes up.			"

												It starts off a little slow. You don't unlock all of your abilities until a ways into the game. And you can't skip the cutscenes. Really annoying. The camera is also annoying sometimes (how limited it is). But if you can get it on sale, then it's worth a play. Some of the movement puzzles remind me of Tomb Raider. There's not as much freedom as in Tomb Raider, though. It's much more on rails.			"

												I'm on the fence about actually recommending this game. It has a gorgeous world and level design with a beautiful soundtrack and great character / enemy designs. It also has an intriguing lore with good voice acting. Gameplay and combat are decent, but the game as a whole is short and many of the ethics and issues that are brought up in conversations are never fully discussed. This game could have been much more engrossing and thought provoking, especially when the best aspect of the game, the memory remixing, is under used. In the end, I am going to recommend this game (flaws and all) because of the need to support new IPs and female protagonists in gaming. Not worth full price, but certainly worth a look.			"

												This game is better played with a gamepad.     For any cyberpunk lover ""Remember Me"" is a must-play. A world it presents is vivid, full of life, believable. The game is linear, but many locations I've been to looked amazing. Every object and entity looked like it was carefully incorporated into this world. The futuristic Neo-Paris could serve as an excellent background for an RPG (ah, if only). Though the story goes really fast,  I coldn't help but stop for a minute or two and take a good look around at the commoners, the dutiful valets, the beautiful landscape.     The combat system is really simple once you get the hang of it. The customizeable combos you create are quite simple to remember but not that easy to do once you're in a crowd of enemies. I sometimes cursed the lack of lock-on but overall it's not needed. Some fights take much longer than they should because attacking multiple enemies at a time is quite difficult. Performing a healing combo correctly can be vital at times, due to Elite Enforcers' ability to constantly damage you when they're hit, for example.     As for protagonist, our little slim smartie Nilin, she really kicks♥♥♥♥♥ She mistakenly seems fragile, but she can climb walls like Lara Croft and fight like Neo. A really adorable girl that has the ability to remix and steal memories. That's what the story revolves around: the great invention of the 21st century which can help rebuilding the world ravaged by war, or destroy it.The design, the animations and the visuals of the game are really amazing, but it could be so much better. A few levels are utterly boring (almost the entire Bastille). There are only four ""memory remixing"" episodes. And last is the combat which is spectacular but a little flawed, sometimes repetitive and tedious (I, for instance, have died about 20 times when fighting two Leapers that stole Trace's memory).If you're still in doubt, get this game on sale. It is really worth playing once. If you cope with the few flaws it has, it presents a great movie-like experience.			"

												A unique action adventure game in the vein of your traditional hack 'n slash or brawler action adventures. If you're into games like God of War or Devil May Cry, you may take a liking to Remember Me. It combines a fluid brawling mechanic with the Combo Lab, which allows you to construct your own hit combos to your own liking. The combat controls themselves are simplistic, alternating only between punch, kick, dodge, special techniques that trigger unusual conditions in the environment against your enemies, and using a sort of blast gun. On top of this, you get to do some parkour-style navigation and platforming through the environments, which strongly resembles the Prince of Persia games but is fairly simplistic. It even throws in a handful of easy puzzles here and there to mix things up, most notably the ability to ""remix"" certain people's memories during the storyline to make them change their beliefs.The setting, story and characters are by far Remember Me's strongest point. It's a very good cyberpunk scenario, revolving around themes of questioning the nature of personal identity and what kind of value you can place on memories. The graphics, sound effects, music, and overall atmosphere are excellent. The story concludes on an interesting ending and the journey there is at times unsettling—in all the right ways, as is appropriate for the scenario's genre.The game's weakest point is its total length and replayability. I played the game on the highest difficulty from the start, and was finished with the story within 12 hours. Now, this is not to say that it's super-easy or I'm very good, because I felt adequately challenged considering the setting and some fights and bosses gave me quite a bit to chew on till I had figured out how to beat them. The game has an excellently smooth learning curve and maintained an entertaining difficulty throughout. The amount of hand-holding was kept to the minimum of what's expected of modern games and some of the fights and boss scenes surprised me in how the game designers wanted players to think outside of the box and inject some variety outside of the regular brawling with common enemies throughout the game. However, the issue still stands: the length and replayability is extremely limited. Outside of going back to hunt for all achievements and hidden items, because the level designs are very linear and there are no additional challenge modes or anything else to extend the play experience.Everything gels nicely in this game. Nothing feels contrived or redundant, which is often a problem with games in this genre, where you'll complete the game with abilities you never used or features that you ignored. If anything, I wish it were longer so I could get more use out of its many cool features, and I'm looking forward to any games that DONTNOD produces next. If anything about this game looks or sounds even remotely interesting to you, you should give it a try.			"

												I went into this game not really knowing what I expected; I was slightly dissappointed by my early playtime in the game. However, the more of the game I played, the more I liked it.DONTNOT Entertainment made several design choices in this game that made it very unique. The result was a game that may not have been fine-tuned to satisfy the masses' desire for a cookie-cutter game, but instead a work of art. The world that you are immersed in while playing this game is stunningly beautiful; a cyberpunk universe that's not just gritty but also gleaming is rarely touched upon by world designers, and it really paid off. The characters are all well-thought-out as well. Though some of the diologue gets cheesy and some lines are fairly predictable, there's a lot of effort that was done to stay true to an artistic vision, and that's something I really like.Now, on to the gameplay! This game has a little bit of everything--you have uncharted platforming, some third-person shooting, the unique remixing mechanic, some puzzles, and the fantastic combat. While the combat can get repetitive, it's very polished. The ability to create and manage your own combo strings is really cool, and encourages you to explore the world to level up faster. The wide variety of abilities you can select really do a good job of making you feel powerful and in control. To call it 'immersive' would be a stretch, but you get more of an ability to 'choose' how combat will flow (similar to say...Prototype). Most of my issues with the game are it's pacing; the levels are pretty linear, and the long platforming sections are sort of distracting from the combat. Can I call it a perfect work of art? No. However, it is a game that I would recommend people to take a look at. The gaming industry should certainly take a look at this game, because we need more innovation and new ideas out there.			"

												Paris, 2084. It felt like I was part of the future of humanity and although the game didn't have the best graphics, I felt it was good enough to pull me in and place me in this grim future where you play as Nilin, a Memory Hunter. The story was great and the atmosphere only added to it. Combat was kind of repetitive but they do continue to add new or stronger enemies throughout the entire playthrough of the game. Unlocking pressens, which are basically just extra moves in your combos, to combine with other pressens will allow you to customize the way you fight, but only to a degree. There are only 4 combos in the game but you are able to re-arrange or change how your combos work. One that will heal a great deal or do as most damage as possible. There are also 5 abilities you unlock throughout the game that can change the course of a battle entirely. Setting a bomb on the chest of an enemy or using an enemy mech to do damage for you. Exploring is limited as it's quite a linear game, however there are collectables hidden throughout the game that you will only find if you actually try to find them. Some are hidden off the main path and not easy to see. Others are right in front of you.Memory Remixes allow Nilin to change how someone might behave in their life. Changing someones memory in order to change the way they feel about someone, or something that happened in their life will change the path they choose to follow in the game entirely. Although there are many different outcomes in each memory remix, you can ultimately only choose one to complete the remix.I played on Hard Mode and finished the game 10 and a half hours with 30/50 achievements. The game also offers a New Game+ where earning PMP to do your skills is much harder to get. At $49.99 I would hold off, however, I paid $33 for it and was very pleased with my purchase and would recommend anyone into Action games to give it a try. I thoroughly enjoyed it.			"

												I liked it.The visuals are pretty amazing, the fake 3d on my monitor worked well with them too.The memory remix mechanic is cute though it's impossible to fail, just a matter of repeating a short segment until you've found all the glitches required.  You only do it about six times in the game so it's not a constant thing.The game has an interesting plot and they've put considerable thought into the ramifications of a single technology.  In some ways, the plot or at least the background, resembles Syndicate Wars a little.  I guess all Cyberpunk dystopias look a little bit alike.The gameplay mostly falls into parkour that is almost but not quite on rails and Over-The-Shoulder brawling which is quite a lot like Oni with punch/kick combos that you customise a little with various side abilities like regen/damage/cooldown as well as some special abilities that you build up focus for.  The fights aren't so frequent that you get bored and there's enough variety in enemies to keep it interesting.All in all, a very well executed cyberpunk game with a dash of philosophy to it.Time to complete: 14 hours at a casual pace.

As Nilin fights to remember and retrieve her memories, she relearns her combat, reminisces with her friends and makes It back to the top of the food chain, as the master memory hunter. You discover that Memorize, the game's tyrant Is running everyone's memories down, turning them Into creatures, mutants, monsters. Find a way to stop them In this action-packed, Immersive combat, and fast paced, heart racing Cyberpunk world.     I was quite Impressed when I first played the game. The first hour was very Immersive, with the world taking you Into it. I am a huge fan of Cyberpunk and this game captures It all. I knew this would be the game for me once I saw It. The combat Is fluid and varies depending on you. You can change up the combos with different types of effects, such like regenerating health, adding onto combos, amplifying damage, or even prolonging your combos! The story Is great, 'nuff said.     10/10			"

												Great game if you like story-based action-adventures. The combat is fun but not very deep, the customization system does add an interesting layer of resource management though as you can tradeoff healing, damage and your special moves.Now, the big positive is the storytelling. Not just cinematics, a lot of it in game also. Text entries, playable 'memories' where you have to deconsruct and change events in someone's memory and general flow of the settings. I don't plan on spoiling any of the actual characters or plot itself but it's all A+ by game standards.Overall, don't expect the gameplay to hold you for weeks or anything, but it's a fun ride with an amazing story.

												Remember me is a game that manages to still be fun and worth my time even when it has some critical flaws. I'll start with the biggest flaw: to many enimies. This would not be a problem if you were able to attack more than one foe at a time, but that is not the case. In a game that has such a strong focus on making your combos have useful effects it is really sad that it is rare to complete a combo. You will have to dodge an attack from some other dude before you can complete the combo you crafted that heals your character as well as lowers the cool down on other abilities. I ultimately just made all my combos three or four moves instead of the eight or so moves possible in some of the combos. The fact that there was no way to really do crowd control without your special abilities (which have a cool down timer after use) really just made the millions of crowds this game threw at you annoying. Fights were awesome when it was one on three or even one on four reasonable enemies, but once hoards of leapers came in or guys who when you hit them electicuted you, the fun left and was replaced by tedious dodging and little jabs here and there. I turned down the game difficulty towards the last hour just so I could use my combos without worry.But I did manage to have a good time with this game. Despite the flawed combat, it was sometimes still really fun, especially when using special powers or performing takedown moves. All your powers in this game look like cubist modern art and it's so awesome. Boss battles were fun as well, while not on the caliber of Metal Gear Rising, still nice multistaged fights in some really slick environments.Neo Paris is just such a well realized world. Orange lights just are glowing everywhere surrounded by urban decay except for in the richest part of town with the pure blue skies and pristine clean buildings. It helps that the graphics are just dazzling. The port is very solid without framerate hitch or stutter even once with everything cranked up all the way with to many enimies on the screen. I played this game to explore this city. To do genaric style ""grab the ledges and poles"" platforming over a destroyed factory with that orange glow under my feet. To fight to many enimies in a dream esc cubist world inside somebody's head.One more aspect of this game that kept me coming back was the plot. While the story wasn't perfect, the main character was well written and was forced to explore a lot of moral grey area. A lot of the really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ things you do end up helping you, and never bite your♥♥♥♥♥ The plot does not stick to karma in a boring way most videogame plots tend to do, but rather just tells a mostly realistic-ish story with realistic-ish results for the character's actions. Also, the plot is closely tied with these segments called ""remixes"" in which you change a person's memory. While they don't happen that often, when they do it is a real treat. They tell good little stories and just let you play around with variables to change the end. Of course there is a desired set of variables, but I had fun playing with the wrong ones and seeing what happened. It was a cool mechanic.So overall, the gameplay is the worst part of this game really, which should be criminal. But somehow, the super slick polish and the smart story won me over.

												Setting/VisualsThe game had me at cyberpunk. I am a huge fan of the genre and an even bigger fan of fully-realized world building (Fallout 3, Deus Ex etc.). So imagine my surprise when I hear of a new setting, a Neo-Paris, to explore. Each character feels unique no matter their screen time and Nilin has some cornball dialogue but overall feels like a solid character and is torn between being a rebellious memory hunter and the conflict in the story (""This red-riding-hood has a basket full of kickass!"" per example of bad writing).The textures and visuals are beautiful and the neon is well-balanced with the trashy dim lighting for a cyberpunk vision. Seriously, when you first start each level take a minute to just swing the camera around and view everything. It's all designed with love and the little touches make everything truly come alive. Consider the mass produced Valet androids that are running around holding grocery bags, walking dogs, playing piano. It's amazing and I will definitely ""remember"" that ;)GameplayIt's an old school beat-em-up with some HD visual packaging. Your only incentive to unlock and experiment with new combos in the branching combo system is achievements and dispatching enemies quicker but once you find 2-3 combos that work you won't deviate from them; it's just too taxing to keep opening the menu to try new things. There are a decent amount of enemy types and some engagements are multiple types at a time which keeps things fresh. Platforming is light and engaging but tends to drag on. However, it only seems that way in hindsight perhaps because the environment and atmospheric splendor is so engaging.Gotta split this up to take an average because the visuals and world building left such an impact on meSetting/Visuals9/10Gameplay6/10Overall7.5/10  Would play again			"

												Remember Me is a uniqe attempt of a beginner studio at making a clever story about time travel. Since it's 2016 now, we have  Life Is Strange - so go play that first, and then play Remeber me as a ""back to basics"" vesrion. Many concepts and even gameplay elements have a similar feel to them, but this one also offers combo-based combat (which is very well-made for busy people who cannot remeber a combo since they play on a weekly basis).The story is comparable to a book, but the experience is a game-exclusive one: you could never just watch it on a screen or just read it from paper. You have to DO it yourself. Basically, 10/10 for effort and ideas, 8/10 for execution. Shouldn't be played as anything other than a storytelling experience, since that's what it is (although battle mechanics are quite nice).			"

												This game might have some flaws when it comes to the combat or jumping/climbing, but it certainly did teach me something. The voice inside you that was always there to guide you, that experience that made you grow, not only from the positive memories, it's also from the negative ones. The path you walk is the one that is true and full with life, but only if you accept the truth of what has happened and that what still has to happen. Now aside from all the deep words.I really enjoyed this game, i will still continue to play it again and maybe again... and again. I love the combat even though it's a little bit glitchy it seems, but that only makes me try harder.I will remember this game.wipetears.jpg			"

												I had this game on PS3 but didn't had enough time to finish it (free month on the store ^^) completely so here I am on computer! But that's not the question... Here's why I'd recommend this game:I would start with a good story.There's a backstory on how it all started, how the city was created etc. Okay, it's pretty linear but still it could be a great movie or so and that's what I love with games (just forget CoD things...).Then, graphics and backgrounds. Because every ""new"" games after 2004 need to be good looking and SUPER realistic and stuff like that (I hate it but it must be said). Remember Me is one of those futuristic games that makes you dream about the real life because of the background, wich is Paris (Neo-Paris), a real place. There's a lot of thing happening when you play, a lot of little details like people talking behind a window, robot playing piano, someone shouting at you from a balcony... And the devs want you to discover those little things by making you looking for ""bonuses"", that's pretty cool, actually!Well, I will end the evaluation by saying Remember Me is a good game that you can't really describe or argue on. It depends what you want when you play and this game could possibly give you that. ^^End of transmission!			"

												One of the best games I've ever played._ Gorgeous environment : graphics are great, very detailled. Design of the city is superb, and I like the universe._ Eargasmic soundtrack : maybe exagerated but it gives you the emotion of the moment. Unique, as some would say, because it's special._ Good gameplay : I like the fights, not always easy to dodge but the combo system lets you edit and make your owns. Easy to move and climb. Camera glitching a bit sometimes. Some would say it's too linear and not open-world : I don't think it's how it should be played. COD is linear too and no one complain._ Nice story : you discover the world in the same as Nilin does. She lost her memory and you don't know what's going on either. Hidden collectibles will help you to understand this world better.I give it a 9.7/10. Awesome game, but a bit short to me.			"

												Good story, good setting, bad combat system. I honestly got a trainer just to skip over the combat, to see the end. That said, I also didn't like the Arkham series combat, so it might not be that bad. But if your willing to put up with annoying combat, like the combat style, or are willing to get a trainer, Remember Me is good fun.			"

												Remember Me is an entertaining game with an interesting concept that was unfortunately not executed to it's fullest potential. Players take control of Nilin, a memory hunter with the ability to ""remix"" people's memories. She herself has had her memories erased, and is working with a mysterious man named Edge and the ""Errorist"" cause to take down Memorize, the company that has commercialized memories and is slowly corrupting the population.Playing as a character who's memories have been wiped puts the player in an interesting place where they know as much as the character knows. This concept is good for story development, however it also tends to be the game's own undoing. The game does a poor job of making the player ask questions about who and what Nilin is, so when the game makes reveals about the story they feel almost unimportant and unneccesary.The concept of remixing memories is interesting, however if felt almost tacked onto the game in most scenarios. I would have liked to see more applications for this concept, but unfortunately it only comes about four or five times in the game's rather short 8 to 9 hour campaign.The game's combat and other mechanics are fun, but they seem familiar save for the concept of building your own combos. However, I didn't find myself using that concept as much as I think the player was intended to use them; typically i only needed two or three of the five available combos to get through combat instances. These instances were very fast-paced, however, and were fun to play through, if they were just a tad on the easy side.Remember Me's soundtrack was probably one of my favorite parts of the game, and really served as one of the best atmospheric elements of this game.All in all, Remember Me is definitely a fun game that can be played in a weekend. It's not one that you'll be missing out on if you skip it, but it's definitely worth picking up if you see it on sale.			"

												Interesting story with a pretty interesting take on the whole singularity/post-humanism concept in the style of memories being commoditized. Set in Paris, the game has a very original aesthetic, with excellent art, music, and an interesting narrative.The combat is a little boring, but I wouldn't say it hinders the story in any way. Some of the puzzle sequences are a bit frustrating. Sometimes selecting a lot of small items on a wall to pick one to move took WAY longer than it should have, and some of the riddles took me a few too many listens to figure out (but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥RIDDLES IN A GAME it's 2015). Overall, if the aesthetic/story doesn't grab you immediately, you can probably pass on this, as the combat isn't anything revolutionary.			"

												This game was pretty amazing from the beginning. It takes an hour or two to figure out the system and basic layout of the game, but its a shame this game didnt take off and sell a million copies. The story is a big driving force in the game and the main heroine is likable and charismatic. The battle scenes are top notch and the overall gameplay is similar to Enslaved with a mix of combos.The combo system is unique and original, and its actually beneficial to learn each one (there are 4).Each combo can be tailored to your liking and play-style and they become a major necessity. There are very unique moments in the game where you have to alter people's memories to achieve a particular reaction from them, and this is one of the greatest aspects of the game. The combat remains interesting throughout the game and the story remains clear and there isnt a moment where it becomes boggled in confusion or side-tracking. Over all, I really enjoyed the game and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a medium length game with tons of action, some character development, and combo and quick time event sequences.			"

Overall, I recommend Remember Me.Pros -----Female protagonist, not overly sexualized; Nilin is a believably strong heroine with doubts and insecuritiesBeautiful landscapesElegant, futuristic building architectureUnlockable extras; models, artworkNo map or minimap, minimal HUD, drawing you into the worldImmersive world which you learn about in-game by listening to news broadcasts or reading articlesGameplay mechanic: Memory remixingCons -----Combat; the combo system is stiffClose camera; sometimes it was hard to see enemies or look around the worldNo map or minimap means linearity; mostly one path with minor detours for collectablesI only listed 3 cons, but unfortunately, they are major parts of Remember Me. However, I would still buy a sequel / prequel; Dontnod Entertainment has great potential and I look forward to their future games.			"

												I really recommend buying and playing the game till the end!So the game starts of horrible, the graphics and everything looks amazing don't get me wrong, but the gameplay in the first half of the game is super boring. So  just turn off your brain and keep on trucking untill you reach chapter 4-5. You need to parcour your way through a city, but it's all pointed out for you so you just follow a path. They don't even give you the illusion that you can figure your own way out. So that's really sad. The combat is fun for how long it lasts, which isn't long at all. When you reach chapter 4-5'ish the game really starts. The combat gets fun, rewarding and challanging. The story starts to blossom and the parts inbetween become shorter and less of a choar and more of a puzzle.Speaking off puzzles, there are some really cool and thought through puzzles in the game where you rearrange memories of people and solve riddles. The combat gets awesome because you learn different combo's and sick cooldown moves.You'll hopefully notice a lot of winks and references to all sorts of things in the game which is always fun.The environment is so well put together that it's a shame they didn't make it open world for the player to discover.It's hard to explain why you should buy and finish this game without spoiling anything. But I can say you will enjoy awesome boss fights, beautifull environments and graphics and the best part about the gameis the great storyline which is like a mix between Inception and Memento in the best way possible :) This game could've easily been a great movie.

												This game features some of the most underappreciated graphics I've seen in a while, and that's running the game on medium settings with a low-power graphics card. Altough combat gets less and less exciting the further you progress, the impressive detail gone into the design of Neo-Paris and the storyline accompanying draws your attention away from the more minor flaws.Pros:- Stunning visuals- Runs well on low spec CPUs- Interesting storylines- Memory remixing mechanic is well built- Customisable combos with different moves- Voice acting is not too badCons:- Fighting is easy and reptitive- Little variation between enemies- Camera angles can be ambiguous- Controls while scaling walls are awkward- You can backflip away from enemies any time you like?- Very linear storyline- Arrows are constantly telling you where to go: all difficulty of finding your way is lost.My favourite part of the game so far is being able to admire all the scenery and effort that has been put into the level desing - especially while climbing up pipes (you get some of the most amazing views while climbing up pipes on the sides of buildings). The tall, majestic buildings of the city and the deteriorating pits of the slums. I only wish fighting wasn't so easy. You can beat your way through several enemies very quickly by simply spamming the LMB and RMB keys. Even once you have defeated an enemy, if you keep clicking, Nilin will backflip straight to another enemy and continue fighting immediately. There is a very low level of difficulty between most enemies, the hardest being those that can disappear at will. On the other hand, I do enjoy the fact that you can customise your combos with different moves, or ""pressens"". However this also can make fighting simple as there are pressens that can regenerate your health. As soon as you equip these very close to the beginning of a combo, any damage you happen to take has virtually no impact as you can just brush it off by beating up more enemies.TL;DRIf you enjoy games with very appealing graphics and games which aren't CPU intensive, this is the game for you. It has a good storyline, but fighting is too easy and repetitive.			"

Very emotional and powerful cyberpunk story that put me in mind of William Gibson. The beat-em-up and collectibles gameplay is pretty basic though the memory remix sequences really stand out in both mechanics and in relation to the plot. While I would have liked to see more of the memory puzzles I felt the pacing of the game as a whole is actually really good. Excellent electronic music soundtrack as well.			"

TL;DR: 11/10 needs remix edition But seriously, I actually enjoyed this game so much that I couldn't help giving it a full review.  (Please don't take this to mean that my typical brief reviews indicate any lack of enjoyment!)Summary:  An eccentric-but-enjoyable mashup of Tomb Raider, Inception, and Trace Memory, Remember Me features phenomenal storytelling, artwork, and voicing, marred only by some loose ends and slightly buggy controls.StoryThe story begins, as most do, with the introduction of the protagonist.  Nilin is preparing for induction at La Bastille, a maximum-security prison in Neo-Paris, A.D. 2084.  Inmates there are stripped of not only their belongings, but their memories as well, thanks to Sensen technology developed by the Memorize Corporation.  Sensen allows users to capture, remove, and share memories as easily as digital photos, but like any technology, it can be abused.  Memories are the new recreational pleasure drug, and an entire culture has built up around buying, selling, and stealing them.  Nilin, however, possesses the rare ability of changing them....Of course, there's a lot more to it than that, which I won't reveal in the interest of keeping spoilers to a minimum.  But, all told, it's attention-grabbing, thought-provoking, and has some curious twists that actually make sense in retrospect.  My major gripe is that there are a few loose ends left dangling:  for instance, what will happen if and when Olga discovers that her memory has been altered?  But I'd like to give the benefit of the doubt and say that maybe they're just leaving options open for a sequel.GameplayThe gameplay switches somewhat regularly between three modes (or, really, one mode split up into stretches of different types of actions), with an additional fourth mode that appears only at certain points in the game.The first is what I call ""Exposition Mode,"" and consists mainly of walking through a relatively safe area while listening to someone (usually the mysterious ""Edge"") giving instructions and/or backstory.  This is the first mode introduced as you stumble through the prison hallways, and comes up several times per episode, usually as ""breathing room"" between high-tension scenes.The second is an ""Adventure Mode,"" involving lots of climbing, jumping, and other dangerous acrobatics dozens of feet above the ground -- if there is any ground.  This is typically more a puzzle than a test of skill, as Nilin will automatically perform the maneuvers if you press the proper direction and action buttons, so you needn't worry much about your aim.Third is ""Combat"" mode, in which Nilin unlocks her ""Pressens,"" a variety of combat skills.  You start with a limited set of Pressens, but collect more through the course of the game.   You can customize Nilin's attacks by chaining Pressens into Combos, with each strike having effects such as extra Power, Regenerating health, or accelerating the Cooldown of Special Pressens (S-Pressens).  Pressens have greater effect further down the chain, so modifying Combos can be a valuable strategy in certain situations, especially at Memhunter difficulty.  Mechanical enemies can't be attacked with regular Pressens, though:  you'll have to rely on a weapon or certain S-Pressens for them.  Combat is mostly about timing and strategy, as Combos only work properly if you attack a single enemy with them, but you'll need to keep an eye on the others so they don't blindside you.  N.B. Combat occasionally includes QTEs.  It's just a few button-presses usually, but they can catch you off guard, and missing them may force you to replay a segment.Fourth, the defining special mechanic of the game, and, sadly, appearing only rarely (four or five times altogether) is the ""Remix Mode.""  You don't play Nilin directly in this mode; instead, you watch a scene from a character's memory, then rewind it and alter details to ""remix"" the memory according to your objective.  (Keep in mind that this alteration occurs only in the subject's memory -- it doesn't change reality.  This is a minor plot point a couple of times, as well as the key to a few achievements.)  I really wish this had been used more, as it's really what makes this game stand out from others in the genre.As mentioned above, I had a couple of control problems.  The main one is navigating choices with the mouse:  when making a selection (such as menu items, or selecting a target with some S-Pressens), the game handles mouse motion like a gamepad rather than giving you a cursor, and moving the mouse continuously moves the selection continuously.  This gets very, very frustrating after a while.  As a workaround, I found that WASD also changes the menu selection, so I stuck to that.Another problem is that, at times, the camera would ""stick"" at a certain angle and be difficult to adjust, and sometimes at extreme vertical angles it would start to flip rapidly (i.e. possibly symptoms of no vertical angle limit).  These particular problems were only occasional, and for the most part I actually found the camera worked extremely well, keeping everything you needed to see in view.GraphicsI actuallly went and bought a new graphics card to play this game (and others) in its full high-definition, all-settings-maxed glory.  And I'm glad I did, because while my old card might have managed to play the game, it would only be at about half the resolution and the lowest quality settings, and even then would've been a bit slow.  The real-world graphics are amazing, hyper-realistic, artfully blending high-tech holography with backdrops of run-down slums and high-fashion districts alike, somewhere between cyberpunk and ""cyberpreppy,"" if you will.  In contrast, the realms of memory realize the fuzzy, fragmented nature of human memory:  still detailed, but disconnected and unstable, dominated by empty space and shifting features.  In short, even if Remember Me had no story at all, it could probaby still sell as an art piece.SoundI'm no audiophile, here, but I will say that I had no issues with sound quality.  The voicing was beautifully done, and I noticed very few instances, if any, of awkward dialog.  Music was interesting, though I mostly remember (haha) the credits song, a classical-style piece with some rock/metal worked in and quite a bit of glitching that I think was intentional.OverallRemember Me includes a number of elements familiar from other titles, uniquely ""remixed"" into a pointed story about the importance of remembering the past; the settings and characters are well-crafted and believable, even whilie the story rides the bleeding edge of science fiction; the gameplay introduces a new, but underused, mechanic that provides a refreshing shift in perspective.  If you like hard sci-fi, cyberpunk, Inception, Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell -- or just about any science fiction ever -- this is a game to pick up, for the story alone if nothing else.			"

												Summery:Graphics: 10/10 (Never seen a game as detailed)Music: 10/10 (Contributes perfectly to atmosphere and great quality)Sound: 8/10 (Could do with some more bang)Gameplay: 5.5/10 (Very railed. Controls feels sticky and tricky if not used to it. Also a few GAME BREAKING BUGS)Story: 10/10 (Sci-fi/action/drama masterpiece movies only dream of... very deep)Detail:From the entry you are thrown into a world full of motion, intense detail and great effects. Capcom have gone above and beyong the call of duty to make this most likely the best looking game out there. Seriously, this is something special. The world constantly changes and every section feels unique. You sometimes stop to take a closer look. If you play for only graphics, you seriously can't miss this out.The music is epic and placed well throughout the game with varieties of the theme song popping up now and then.The sound is great, but could have done with some more bang in it. You don't always get that sense of doing damage or chaos happening. Well, you do, but it could have been so much better.Once you start playing the game, the first bit of issues pop up. Controls are not as slick and fast as for example Batman Arkhum. Yet it requires a way faster response time in combat. Climbing around also does not feel fluid. You get amazing views, but sometimes it is as if the camera wants you to see the view and not the character, making navigation a bit difficult. The real problem is all the bugs. Now, some bugs one can live with, but here we have a few that get you stuck. For instance, not killing all the enemies before terminating a boss when he is subjected to overload, will combat stuck the game and you will have to restart. Even if you follow those rules, you sometimes still get stuck and have to kill the boss from checkpoint restart. This is such a HUGE shame for this game, since...The story being told in Remember Me is of epic proportion. Many games try to have a great story. Only few succeed. This one goes beyond succeeding though. If you are willing to go through the bugs (which are not a lot, but they really break the game at times) you will be treated with an original and gripping story that you will not forget easily.			"

												As always the initial hype will ruin the actual game experience, but it was still an enjoyable game. Really liked the whole dystopian setting but the story barely explains anything (it barely explains the main plot even) unless you go and read the extra collectibles throughout the game.Gameplay is okay, they wanted the fighting to be like Batman but it feels a bit clunky and not as freeflowing. Apart from fighting, it's mostly linear traveling, with a lot of unskippable ""cutscene dialogue"" you can't skip (and will stop you from running, literally).

												Confession time: I've really tried my best to like the Elder Scroll series. Seriously. I've purchased almost all of the recent games and given them each a few hours to win me over and none of them have done it. It's confusing to me because I really enjoy sprawling dramatic RPGs. I spent over 100 hours on the Fallout games and another 200 on the Mass Effect series. I think my problem is the fantasy setting; thees, thous, spells and swordplay never seem to resonate with me as much as the future (dystopian or otherwise). That's how I found Remember Me. I was reading some of the forums posts about the recent port of Deus Ex: The Fall and someone recommended it instead. Thankfully it was also part of the Steam Sale. Remember Me takes place in the Sci-Fi Dystopian Future of 2084. We've figured out how to backup, restore and replay human memories. These memories can also be bought, sold, shared or stolen. You play Nilin who is a memory hunter in New Paris who has the ability to manipulate and ""remix"" memories. Oh and she doesn't remember her past!1! So yeah - dramatic political intrigue, conspiracy, etc. Fun stuff. No swords. The city reminds me of Deus Ex except it is 3rd person and not gold tinted. It's really pretty beautiful. The gameplay is really reminiscent of the recent Batman Arkham games. There's a simple, but fun combo system interspersed with counter-attacks and some gadget weapons. I enjoyed the flow of fighting in the Batman games and this really scratched that itch. You can also customize your combos so that as they stack they'll do different things, such as do extra damage, refill your health or recharge your gadgets. For the most part it is really well done and has full controller support. I've played the game for about 6 hours and I've had two chances to ""remix"" memories and that mechanic is pretty fun to. Kind of reminds me of the crime-scene mechanic in Batman Arkham Origins. You can rewind and replay the memory to notice and interact with certain items. As you do so - that person's memory may change in ways that further the story. Fun stuff. Also worth mentioning that Nilin is a cool main character. She's in good company among Jade (Beyond Good and Evil), April/Zoe (Longest Journey) or Kate Wilson (Hydrophobia). So far the story is interesting and the voice acting is good. The two downsides for Remember Me are 1) it is only available for Windows and 2) the Steam Sale has ended so the game back up to $29.99.  Other than that I highly recommend this as an alternative to a game with swords or gold tint.			"

												It's not often I get choked up by a game, but this one nailed it.  Absolutely beautiful story, beautiful setting and some interesting mechanics.   As the game starts, Nillin is completely amnesiac, so you know just as much of what's going on as she does.  It's hard to write a really positive review about this game when its strongest point is the story, so I'll move on to some of the other aspects of it.Aside from the story, one of Remember Me's best points is the combat.  It's a free-flow, combo-based system reminiscent of the Arkham series, except that YOU choose the effect that the attacks have.  Extra damage, health regeneration, and a reduction in your special ability's recharge time (more on that in a minute) are the three choices you have, but in addition to that you can use a chain effect which mimics and magnifies the effect of your previous hit in the combo.  These can be changed mid-combat via a menu in the pause screen, to suit your needs in a particular fight. Nillin gets a TON of character development, but most of the other characters you meet don't really get explored.  Early on you meet someone who is supposedly one of your closest friends, but he never appears again after Episode 3.  This is, understandably, Nillin's story, but the game could have done with a bit more character development.  My only other big complaint is with the climbing.  When you're first introduced to the climbing mechanics, it feels like a tutorial, but the training wheels never really come off.  It has the look of Assassin's Creed-style parkour, but it feels very restrictive and not at all fluid, in several cases almost to the point of immersion-breaking.  I think that if DONTNOD had put some more time into the climbing mechanics, it could have been better than it is.All in all, weighing the bad with the good, I'd give this an 8.5/10.  The few issues I have with the gameplay aren't enough to really take away from the phenomenal story that this game has to offer, and I can honestly say that I was at the edge of my seat for a fair portion of it.

												I got this game in a sale and it was worth every penny.  Even at full price this game is worth it compared to many AAA titles that are $60 plus.It has an engaging story with likeable characters that you grow to care about and the voice acting is spot on.  The atmosphere in the game is really well done.  The game is set in a futuristic Paris where people's memories are a hot commodity and an evil company misuses their power to create a gap between rich and poor.  Overall I liked the story and it last about 7 hours (my gameplay time is higher because I alt+tabbed for a while). This game would have benefited from being more open as the futuristic paris looked great, I just wish I could have explored it more.I've seen a lot of people complain about the fighting mechanics, I suspect this is because they couldn't get to grips with them because I really liked them.  You can devise your own combos adding in different elements to change what your attacks do.  You also get a select few ""special"" attacks which do different kinds of damage.  At the end of the story with them all unlocked you can really pull off some cool combos and techniques.Unfortunately the game has little replayability value given its very linear story, save for going back to collect things you missed.  Unless you're an achievement hunter though, I doubt you will do this.  There's not much to be gained.Pros:- Strong female lead- Well written and voice acted- Interesting and at times philosophical story- Intriguing combat and cool combos- Great atmosphere and good graphicsCons:- Quite short (7hrs, max)- Not much replayability			"

												The game is decent. It's not super great, but it's not terrible. It takes awhile to get adjusted to the combat system because they don't explain it clear enough(I had to look up a guide to figure it out, but once you understand it, it's semi-smooth sailing from there). The levels are very linear, but they're very detailed and they look great. Some of the fights are very difficult no matter the difficulty level,  and the boss fights are a little longer than they need to be.Long story short, it's decent at best. If you're patient and look past the repetitive combat and super linear levels, it's decent. I'd suggest buying it on sale, though. The original retail price is not worth the headache. Buy it on sale, it's worth the sale price. I do recommend it, though, there's little plot twists that make the story worth your while.			"

												I was really excited to play this game when I read about how most game sites didn't want to shine light to the fact it was being released. When I played it and tried to indulge in the story, I did find myself wanting to play all the way through. I loved the perspective of the storyline, atmosphere and setting of this game. I also really enjoyed the fighting style. However, this game doesn't really let you explore neo paris like you would hope to. Each mission is in sections, once you've moved forward, you can't go back unless you restart. I would have loved to roam around this game more. I think it has so much potential and if you're looking to get this game, keep in mind you may finish the game quite fast, other then gaining all the achievements theres not much else to do with the game.

												I found this game to be a surprise gem. It has a combat system that reminds me of Batman Arkham, but it is not nearly as good. Instead, it seems that this game relies on it's story, presentation and music, which I found to be very good. It is a linear game where you go from room to room, stopping to fight enemies and solve puzzles. The puzzles were not too complex, but I found that they change the pace of the game and keep it feeling fresh. In my opinion, this game would have been perfect if they took the time to further develop combat system. In the end, I enjoyed this game very much. It took about 8 hours to beat, but it felt about right. It was not too long or short.			"

												I've been wanting to write this review for quite some time, so here goes (spoiler free):Remember Me is an action adventure / platformer hybrid with a length of roughly 12 hours by DONTNOD.This review focuses on its platforming, combat, visuals and story.The platforming is a bit simple, as the game always points you in the right direction using arrows. If you don't like platforming, you probably won't have much to complain. However if you actually like platforming, you will find it much too simple - it's not bad per se, but a bit sad.The game's combat has been compared to the Batman Arkham games. In this regard, it does not hold up, as it's not nearly as versatile and fluid. However, I think that the combat system of Remember Me shouldn't be compared to it, as it is fundamentally different. Instead of different combos, you learn ""pressens"", which are a certain sequence of button presses. These pressens must be unlocked and their effects can be customized to increase the combat's depth. If you can let go of the expectation that the combat is supposed to work like the Batman games, it's relatively easy to enjoy and find it satisfying.So far, the game is a mixed bag - the platforming is simple and the combat is a bit disappointing. Checkpoints are usually placed okay and rarely get you into unfair situations. The only real annoying thing about the combat is that the tutorial explanations pause the game until you do what they want and this happens on your second playthrough as well.As you probably know, the game is set in the world of Neo Paris. The developers have pictured their unique vision of the future where everyone stores their memories using the ""sensen"" program by ""memorize"". Overall, the world looks visually impressive and its developments seem believable. I especially love their way of doing buttons, switches, etc inplace by overlaying information without showing a HUD (and breaking immersion of the game). As there are techniques to store your memories, this way of augmented vision is believable.So far, we have a good looking attempt at a new game with a fresh world. But that's not all of it:Remember Me really shines when it comes to story. I found it to be greatas it takes you on a wild ride through the life of various personalities and tries to explain their past. This can be compared to Arkham Asylum, where the game is like riding a rollercoaster. As you drastically change peoples memories, you can see how your actions alter their character and actions. The plot is full of surprising twists and concludes with a very satisfying ending, unlike many other games lately. Unfortunately, I don't think I can find the right words to capture it, so I really think you should experience it for yourself.All in all, the game really is a mixed bag. If you can live with an emphasis on story and less focus on the mechanics, you will certainly be rewarded for your patience with a new, exciting game. I recommend you pick this up when it's on sale :) Oh yeah, and do yourself a favor: play it with a gamepad!			"

												This game gets a lot of Sh*t even though it's pretty good. But it still feels unpolished.+Well done story.+Great Concept+Strong Female Lead+No Escort Missions-Audio Glitches-General Cutscene Glitches-Camera Glitches-Poor Controls that cause you to die a lot.-Glossed over side characters.-Swarming, Annoying Enemies.While the combat is nice, I'd like to actually be able to pull off that 8-hit combo consistently. Usually, either an enemy interrupts you or your target dies before the combo's complete. Either way, that's no fun.For something that advertises making your own combos, the different moves don't really make a difference. It's just about the 4 categories and that's really it.If you can get it for cheap, it's a good buy. But I don't recommend paying more than half price for it.			"

												Remember when games were fun, innovative, and just plain awesome. Me too!Seriously, this isn't the best game in the world but it does have a strong design and narrative backing it up with a strong sterile aesthetic that really brings Neo-Paris alive. Mixing all that together truly makes it a memorable experience.The combat is reminscent of the FreeFlow combat mechanic of the Batman games which is always a plus in my books. Its nothing new but with the combo-lab giving you the power to create your own combinations of attacks it mixes up the combat immensly.The controls are a bit wacky at times and the camera doesn't seem to want to be your best friend when you need it the most. This game has made me a fan of Dontnod, I'm looking forward to what they do next! (I'm aware of Life is Strange that's an awesome game as well!)The cyberpunk setting in my opinion is something that is a niche concept, considering that in games it's embraced. With games like Deus Ex and Shadowrun pioneering the Cyberpunk genre/setting Remember Me is a different interpretation of the very Cyberpunk ideal but it does it in such a way that it resonates with the core themes that Cyberpunk present.

												I did not finish the game, beware.Remember Me is a beat-em-up game with a unique plot. It also features a build-your-own-combos mechanic which is really cool, where you get to customize your combos to fit your style (both cosmetically and gameplay-wise) - say you want a combo to do a lot of damage; you add damage ""presens"" to your combos, etc.The setting is cool, however a bit linear. Would be cool with a more open world, but it's still awesome.You play as Nilin, a former memory hunter. You have the ability to alter people's memories and change things depending on what they remember. Not gonna spoil anything, of course.Very much recommended!			"

												Remember Me is an underrated rare gem within all the other AAA games out there. But of course it's not perfect. Really not perfect.+Unique ideas such as Remixing, which means reading someones mind, then altering a specific memory, creating very different outcomes, altering that persons personality and personal past which changes the present and future. With 2 words:  Butterfly Effect.+Customizable combat. You can create your own combos from Pressens. And there are 4 types of Pressens: Healing, Block Breaker/Stronger hit, reduces cooldown of your special abilities, and the final one which increases the effect of your latest Pressen in your combo+Variable enemies+Beautiful visuals+Comfortable controls (with Xbox 360 Controller, I never tried with KB+M)+Challenging bossfights, where you always have to have a unique tactic+Speaking of tactics, when the game senses you're struggling with a boss/puzzle, after a while it will help you, but at first it will only help you a little bit, and then you still have no idea what to do it will tell you the soulution. Saves you from searching it on YouTube+Many cool abilities. ""Memory gun"" to telekinetic powers, and lots of more.+Story is very good, not that mind blowing type, but still very good with many twists+Tickets to the feels train! I warned you+Music is very well composed. Slightly futuristic, but (thanks god) not exaggeratedly+/- Many bosses have QTE finishers. Personally I like QTEs but many people don't so yeah warned you again+/- I found kind of enough the memory remixes, but it wouldn't be a problem if there would be...let's say 5 more...or at least one in every episode.+/- Kinda average optimisation. Not that Ubisoft type slideshow, but not that impressive-The game uses Unreal Engine 3, which wouldn't be a problem, but it uses a very old version, which has it's own problems. Common in-game streaming, which causes FPS-drops like hell; sometimes textures are missing, invisible/stuck enemies etc. Certainly not a problem on a personal nuclear power plant, but still...-I found the included binkw32.dll pretty outdated, which caused some annoying echo during cutscenes. This could be easisly fixed by replacing it with a newer one.In overall: As I said before it's a gem, certainly a must have one. The bugs can be forgiven, because this is Dontnod's first game and later they gave us Life Is Strange, which is for me the one and only GOTY. But turning back to Remember Me it's one of the most refreshing big budget title for years, which will suck you in so much that you won't want to make the acts you have to do, because of some heavy pre-remorse. It really worth it's full price. Dontnod deserves it. "

												Setting/VisualsThe game had me at cyberpunk. I am a huge fan of the genre and an even bigger fan of fully-realized world building (Fallout 3, Deus Ex etc.). So imagine my surprise when I hear of a new setting, a Neo-Paris, to explore. Each character feels unique no matter their screen time and Nilin has some cornball dialogue but overall feels like a solid character and is torn between being a rebellious memory hunter and the conflict in the story (""This red-riding-hood has a basket full of kickass!"" per example of bad writing).The textures and visuals are beautiful and the neon is well-balanced with the trashy dim lighting for a cyberpunk vision. Seriously, when you first start each level take a minute to just swing the camera around and view everything. It's all designed with love and the little touches make everything truly come alive. Consider the mass produced Valet androids that are running around holding grocery bags, walking dogs, playing piano. It's amazing and I will definitely ""remember"" that ;)GameplayIt's an old school beat-em-up with some HD visual packaging. Your only incentive to unlock and experiment with new combos in the branching combo system is achievements and dispatching enemies quicker but once you find 2-3 combos that work you won't deviate from them; it's just too taxing to keep opening the menu to try new things. There are a decent amount of enemy types and some engagements are multiple types at a time which keeps things fresh. Platforming is light and engaging but tends to drag on. However, it only seems that way in hindsight perhaps because the environment and atmospheric splendor is so engaging.Gotta split this up to take an average because the visuals and world building left such an impact on meSetting/Visuals9/10Gameplay6/10Overall7.5/10  Would play again			"

												Remember Me is a uniqe attempt of a beginner studio at making a clever story about time travel. Since it's 2016 now, we have  Life Is Strange - so go play that first, and then play Remeber me as a ""back to basics"" vesrion. Many concepts and even gameplay elements have a similar feel to them, but this one also offers combo-based combat (which is very well-made for busy people who cannot remeber a combo since they play on a weekly basis).The story is comparable to a book, but the experience is a game-exclusive one: you could never just watch it on a screen or just read it from paper. You have to DO it yourself. Basically, 10/10 for effort and ideas, 8/10 for execution. Shouldn't be played as anything other than a storytelling experience, since that's what it is (although battle mechanics are quite nice).			"

												I had this game on PS3 but didn't had enough time to finish it (free month on the store ^^) completely so here I am on computer! But that's not the question... Here's why I'd recommend this game:I would start with a good story.There's a backstory on how it all started, how the city was created etc. Okay, it's pretty linear but still it could be a great movie or so and that's what I love with games (just forget CoD things...).Then, graphics and backgrounds. Because every ""new"" games after 2004 need to be good looking and SUPER realistic and stuff like that (I hate it but it must be said). Remember Me is one of those futuristic games that makes you dream about the real life because of the background, wich is Paris (Neo-Paris), a real place. There's a lot of thing happening when you play, a lot of little details like people talking behind a window, robot playing piano, someone shouting at you from a balcony... And the devs want you to discover those little things by making you looking for ""bonuses"", that's pretty cool, actually!Well, I will end the evaluation by saying Remember Me is a good game that you can't really describe or argue on. It depends what you want when you play and this game could possibly give you that. ^^End of transmission!			"

												9/10This game follows a story that is at times deeply angers you and at others, fills you with sorrow but at all times, is quite intense. The depiction of an Orwellian world in the future is terrific, as are the powers that be and every other person who is surviving in the regime of Memorize. Each chapter's story is very well crafted around the checkpoint based gameplay and even though the story is totally linear, it's a journey you don't want to miss and must finish. This is one those games in which you're living a part of the protagonist's life as in a novel or movie. The best parts of the game are when you get to remix memories. Although it would have been interesting if I could create armies or create total anarchy by remixing anyone's memories I chose, the developers chose not to trivialize memory remixing by limiting it to only some select people and moments in the story. Those parts draw parallels to Inception, to say the least. The action is the only part of the game that can get a little repetitive and monotonous, but not if you keep changing the combo moves to suit every battle sequence, which is something I learned. The very fact that the combos could be modified as and when the player chooses was a fantastic idea. A very beautiful game with an intense plot.			"

The beat-em-up action is well done, perhaps a little too easy, but feels a really poor fit for the brain-hacking plot & puzzle sections. Stylistically it bears a close resemblance to Deus Ex: HR, often found myself wishing it was part of that universe.The French voice acting is excellent, really adds to the atmosphere.			"

Actual combat was a bit tricky at first and at times very frustrating. Once I did get the hang of things combat was actually quite simple. It was just a matter of remembering the combos that I had set up and utilizing the special abilites. If you are considering purchasing this game I highly recommend Remember Me.  Updating this review for the Steam Awards nominations. I nomintated this game for the category ""The “I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye” Award""For me Remember Me was so emotionally compelling where often I wasn't crying but Ihad something in my eye.

												It is a cyberpunk tale of a dystopia where people can trade, steal, implant and delete memories. The game feels very linear and there are some camera issues, but the gameplay is sound, the memory tampering mechanics are great (though there are only 4 of these ""remixes"" in the game) and the combat system requires the player to think a little which is not a bad thing. It plays like ""Tomb raider"" meets ""Deus Ex: human revolution"", but it's lacking in environmental interaction, which doesn't alleviate the feeling of being on rails.Who is this game for? Mainly for science-fiction fans. Some of the dialogues could have been better, and there are a few questions left unanswered at the end of the story, but the plot would make a better movie than 90% of the current holywood blockbusters.And if you're french or would like to see a vision of Paris in the future, it's the perfect game. The art is beautiful, even stunning, and the atmosphere at some moment is enthralling. The cutscenes blend seamlessly in the game, and make the cinematics all the more engaging.			"

												If you can forgive it its linearity, its European styling and its at first baffling fight-combo construction interface, you're in for an absolute treat.Yes it's linear but it's also one of the best games I've ever seen; it's absolutely beautiful.			"

												I was slightly hesitant to buy this game.  Other reviews really seemed to put it down pretty fierce.  Gameplay wise, faults can be found.  Story wise - if you buy what this game is trying, begging, to sell you, it is an absolutely amazing experience.  Cyberpunk done right, with an interesting mix of Batman Arkham games and Deus Ex.  Caught me by surprise, and by the end of it I was so happy to have found this game in the first place.			"

												Roughly 20+ hours, medium setting and 90% - finished.Really good about 8 out of 10 impo... A very strong story with some very original mechanics specifically woven with the concept of the game's story which is completely original to my knowledge. Musically charming, fantastic artwork and quality conceptualisation with a very believeable background running up and side offering of readables building it's universe. Unlike a lot of modernized futuristic games, it does bear it's own unique identity that is very appealing about it and makes you stop and look if you're into Sci Fi and games that offer something more than point click (bang) shoot em ups. But it only falls short of the open world side that obviously allows titles like Deus Ex to triumph due to it's designing, but you can still miss in game upgrades and artsy things by not going down dead end corridors or rushing through, which at no point are you really forced to, (I'll certainly be replaying sections).It incorporates fighting that is very similar to the Batman series and boss fights, with some exceptional fighting extras that are very fun and interesting to decipher including a design it yourself fight move User Interface. You have climbing that is very much similar to the Assassins creed series, puzzles reminiscent of both the previous titles mentioned but delivered wholly & uniquely enough to stand on it's own merit. You do have an environment with a set path and story to go through, you can't unless just for admiring purposes stand on one spot or go down every alley way or on every rooftop like Deus ex for example, it's a 3rd person view and if the second title is bold enough to be first person and then third person for fight sequences (or optional) it will save itself and make it with all the previous title's exceptionaly strong ingredients probably one of the best anticipated future titles due as a contender, it has so much of a world to offer it's designated format unfortunately cuts it short and limits it's immersive appreciability making it underrated and not fully able to deliver every nook and cranny of excellence it truly is, - thank you it was awesome!-Industrialism (Thiervery TuT) UK			"

												Remember Me is one of those titles I would never have gotten around to play if it wasn't for a grand sale.If I had to give it a score I would rate it 7/10Pros:+ Strong female lead with a great character development+ Great character development for other characters despite the short time you act around and with them+ Easy to master combat+ Great story+ Some nice plot twists here and there+ Beautiful enviroment+ Good voice acting+ A nice feeling of progression (new combos, unlocks and different ""Mini games"" that come along when you progress)+ Lots of different gameplay (Again, lots of ""mini games"")+ Tons of checkpoints+ Super useful collectables+ Combat craftingCons:- Super linear- Easy to master combat- No options to change outcome and story of the game- Only one ending- Not nearly enough time spent with other characters at all- Repititive combat- Took me 12 hours to finish (2.25 euros pr. hour if full price was paid)- A few easily forgetable characters (because they didn't get enough time to develop and be a part of the story)- A ton of checkpoints- Bad camera angles at times (Annoyed me at max 3-4 times)The list of cons might sound large, but the biggest and almost three only flaws for me would be how linear it is, no choises and the lack of ""socialising"" with other characters to devolop their storyI would recommend this for anyone who likes an excellent story, a beautiful enviroment and a great main character and can you live with no choises and just give in to a linear story and gameplay this is definetly something for you.If you do though want a massive amount of great combat, you should probably skip this one.If you still wanna try it while being a little sceptical, get it on a sale, but the game is definetly worth it for its story.NOTE: Play on the hardest diffculty, the normal and easy are both super easy, escpecially with the amount of checkpoints in the game.

												Pros- Great storyline and world building. There is honestly a lot of thought that went into making this world, it feels really massive, despite being a linear game. - None of the characters felt underdeveloped- Combat system is decent, I don't know what everyone's complaining about. It's not as great as other games, but it's like a slightly more combo based version of Arkham, I suppose. - The art is great. Not the graphics, the actual art style and world created. The game feels linear, but still feels as if it's massiveCons - Feels a bit empty - besides coming across some people early on, the only people you get to see are either those relevant to the plot, random robots continuously doing tasks or those whose faces you'll be punching in.- The camera can bug out sometimes, and hoooly♥♥♥♥♥♥is it annoying. Doesn't matter what it is, if you're in battle and you just took damage because the camera ♥♥♥♥ed up, or if there's a view and you can't see it because the camera is fixed for some reason. It's all pretty much annoying. This is the major gripe I had with this game, if this got fixed, then I genuinely think most of my frustration with this game would be fixed with it.			"

												If you were entranced by Mirror's Edge's futuristic setting and enjoyed the chain attack mechanics of Batman, you're going to really get a kick out of Mirror's Edge.  Although other games have done each of its mechanics better, Remember Me's concept and setting are unique and enthralling enough to overcome what might have otherwise been a mediocre game. The game offers mouse control, but it's flawed; aggressive mouse acceleration and a small, artificial dead zone (re: controller centric design) make managing the camera awkward.  The worst technical sin, however, is that the gameplay and visuals are obstructed by the very narrow FOV.  Even on a 30"" LCD panel, I constantly felt cramped.  This has the effect of magnifiying the control issues by demanding that they constantly move the camera around.			"

												Very pretty but clunky brawler with some really interesting story ideas.--------+ Great setting.+ Interesting and smart story.+ Cool character designs.+ Good graphics.+ Memory remixes.+/- Hidden collectables.- Clunky, basic combat.- Annoying combat camera.- Linear, predetermined platforming.- Feels like it drags on a little bit.----Remember Me is a game full of interesting ideas, some of which work and some of which unfortunately do not.The story is both interesting, and does that thing all good science fiction does by feeling like a relevant reflection upon the difficulties in our lives. I feel like it would have benefitted more from really focusing on that aspect rather than proceeding as it did, however.The combat gameplay is akin to that seen in the Arkham Batman games, except without the countering or dynamism. It includes a system of designing your own combos that manages to feel very limiting as opposed to the freedom an idea like that should give. The combat camera is also less than helpful, often causing enemies to begin their attacks from off screen which obscures the visual warning. One aspect I did like however was the special ""Pressen"" attacks you could use. After charging a gauge in combat you can opt to unleash one of several special attacks for a variety of devastating effects.The environmental traversal gameplay is a case of follow the clearly marked climbing path with literal flashing arrows telling you where to go and being unable to deviate in any way. Cinematically this is okay - watching someone climb is more interesting than running down a long corridor I suppose - but it would be nice to be able to actually explore the world a bit more or for there to be some kind of a challenge involved. The gorgeous landscape absolutely begs for it.Overall, Remember Me is worth playing for it's excellent sci-fi memory dystopia world and for it's memorable ""memory remix"" segments. It has some good cinematic set pieces and graphically looks great but don't expect to be impressed by the combat or climbing.			"

It is a story-driven game made by DONTNOD Entertainment (Life is Strange). It has beautiful graphics and a great storyline keeping you on the edge of your seat wanting to play more and more. It is split up into 8 episodes that take place in different areas around Paris and normally introduce new enemies changing the rules of the game.~Pros:    -Great Graphics    -Awesome Storyline    -Multiple Gameplay Mechanics    -Constant Changing of Mechanics    -No Bugs/GlitchesCons:    -Repetitive Combat    -Rage Inducing~Gameplay:     The gameplay in this game consists of making your own combos and using them to your advantage. Before or during a fight you can go into the combo lab and change your combos to appeal to the enemies your fighting. Combos are used with X and Y (Example: X, Y, Y, X, Y) and there are 4 different combo slots and combo moves to implement. You can outfit your combos with a Damage Multiplier, Health Regenerator, Cooldown Regenerator, or Loop.          Aside from the combat there is Parkour. The parkour in this game is very straightforward, you cannot pick your path. The game is set on one path the entire time that you have to follow, no branching out on another for a different outcome in the end. While doing parkour there is an orange arrow that follows you around and tells you where to go, making the game annoying because it's always telling you where to go.7.5/10 I would recommend this game to you and all of your friends.

												I recommend this game for those of you who own a controller-- the way it works is obvious from the beginning that it was made more for console games, and as much as I loved the plot and characters and everything story-related, the combat was choppy on PC with just the mouse (and it may have been just my computer, but a lot of bugs appeared, including frozen enemies so I was forced to redo the battle many times). Great characters, wish there had been waaaay more remixes, and wish it had been a longer game what with all the potential it had, but it was still overall a great game.			"

												This game got a lot of flak when it first came out for the combat system, and I'll give it that. The combat does feel repetitive after a while of playing the game. However, the music, graphics, story, everything else the game has to offer is excellent. After a few hours of playing the game I had to go and download the soundtrack because the music is just awesome. I was expecting okay graphics but they ended up being much better than I expected.

												A visit to Neo-Paris 2084 itself is worth playing this game. It has good action and puzzles, great storytelling, and an absolutely amazing setting. The environment and the methods that require use of the remixer glove to navigate make me think that this is what Hydrophobia Prophecy, a different game from a defunct indie developer, should have been.'Remember Me' takes place in a beautiful futuristic city, with a little cyberpunk slum thrown into the mix. You play as Nilin, a wicked-awesome memory hunter that starts off with her memory being wiped, and goes on an adventure to get her memories back and take down a corrupt system. To help along theway, she has a glove that does everything from opening doors and moving objects (similar to Kate's keytool in Hydrophobia), to taking down enemies like a cannon, and ultimately steal/remix memories.The climbing and navigating challenges were fun, and there's also a very unique puzzle system, which exists in this game here; remixing memories at major points in the game were pieces of art themselves! However, these were used rarely (only on key characters), but I suppose the writers wanted to emphasize that this was a power not to be abused by the heroine. Still, I wouldn't have minded if they added one or two more events along the way.The story is interesting and tight, avoiding inconsequential side-quests that don't contribute to anything, and instead opt to let you see the amazing sights around you while pursuing your objectives.There are several QTEs, which I found a little annoying, but the combo system they have is entertaining and allows for interesting combat. I would really like to see whatever improvements DONTNOD might have planned if we're ever fortunate enough to see Neo-Paris again.Meanwhile, go and play this game!			"

												This game was full of action and a very rich story. The main character, ""Nilin"" in which you play is intelligent and acrobatic, making her sexy, strong, and elegant.There are some puzzles, and some parkour which is easier to get into than you may expect. Puzzles which are mind boggling yet simple when you get to the core of it.Overall, I really enjoyed this game, the mixture of cutscenes and game play with the overall story was excellent, the art and fluidity of the system wasn't entirely perfect, yet it is better than most other games.

												I think this is a cool game that’s maybe a little underrated. I enjoyed the gameplay quite a bit, I liked the combat I thought it was nice and flashy and flowed nicely and I also enjoyed the fun but simplistic and easy platforming. I think this game has an interesting concept and setting and a decent story overall. I also liked the soundtrack quite a bit too. I wasn’t a big fan of the actual storytelling, most of the objectives and missions in the game were not very interesting and they didn’t really add to the story or make the story anything more than a decent one when it could have been much better. The missions themselves just felt like small steps to achieve a larger goal and it didn’t really have any impact and sadly that’s what you end up doing for the majority of the game. I thought the characters were pretty average, I wasn’t really emotionally invested with the protagonist but I was mildly curious on how her story will pan out. The game is very linear in design which I didn’t mind at all because I think they use it to their advantage to make the gameplay focused. It could have been great but for what it is and for what it does well it is a very good game.  7/10 (Good)			"

												Graphics are fantastic. The sounds and game environment are rich and immersive. Gameplay is good, especially with a controller. I used an XBox 360 controller. Was a bit difficult with keyboard/mouse, probably because I don't play many linear games like this one. In fact the one complaint I'd have about this game is how linear it is. You go from one fight sequence to the next. Your character Nillin spends most of the game on route to an objective. There are lots of corridors to navigate and every 3rd or so hallway opens out into an arena/courtyard of some type where something always falls down behind you to trap you until you defeat several foes, after which some forward obstruction miraculously falls away allowing you to continue.This formula gets a bit tiring and persists throughout the game but when it was done, I realized that I had enjoyed it far more than I thought I would. So given that this is not my favorite genre, I have to give it a thumbs up. In fact I didn't even come to the store page to write a review but to see if there was DLC so that I could continue.			"

												Setting/VisualsThe game had me at cyberpunk. I am a huge fan of the genre and an even bigger fan of fully-realized world building (Fallout 3, Deus Ex etc.). So imagine my surprise when I hear of a new setting, a Neo-Paris, to explore. Each character feels unique no matter their screen time and Nilin has some cornball dialogue but overall feels like a solid character and is torn between being a rebellious memory hunter and the conflict in the story (""This red-riding-hood has a basket full of kickass!"" per example of bad writing).The textures and visuals are beautiful and the neon is well-balanced with the trashy dim lighting for a cyberpunk vision. Seriously, when you first start each level take a minute to just swing the camera around and view everything. It's all designed with love and the little touches make everything truly come alive. Consider the mass produced Valet androids that are running around holding grocery bags, walking dogs, playing piano. It's amazing and I will definitely ""remember"" that ;)GameplayIt's an old school beat-em-up with some HD visual packaging. Your only incentive to unlock and experiment with new combos in the branching combo system is achievements and dispatching enemies quicker but once you find 2-3 combos that work you won't deviate from them; it's just too taxing to keep opening the menu to try new things. There are a decent amount of enemy types and some engagements are multiple types at a time which keeps things fresh. Platforming is light and engaging but tends to drag on. However, it only seems that way in hindsight perhaps because the environment and atmospheric splendor is so engaging.Gotta split this up to take an average because the visuals and world building left such an impact on meSetting/Visuals9/10Gameplay6/10Overall7.5/10  Would play again			"

												Remember Me is an action game set in a futuristic (and somewhat dystopian) Paris, with an interesting story centered around memories becoming the new form of social interaction. In the world of Remember Me, a company called Memorize has managed to digitize memories, allowing people to share them, which, theoretically, could lead to a more peaceful society. However, this is not the case, as society is still divided between the powerful and the poor.In the game, you play as Nilin, member of an activist group known as ""Errorists"", who seek to stop Memorize, as they consider the digitalization of memories has led to a worse society. At the start of the game, you've been captured and have no memory of who you are, and it's only through the help of a mysterious ally, known as Edge, that you manage to escape. From there, you start searching for clues of your past, while helping the Errorist cause. The story is pretty good, with some interesting twists here and there, which is why I won't write more about it, as there's risks of spoilers. There's also lots of collectibles scattered around that add a bit of background information regarding the story of the game.As far as gameplay goes, well, it's somewhat simple. The game is combat oriented, which means you'll be fighting plenty of enemies; it offers a certain degree of customization through the ""Combo Lab"", which allows you to modify four different combos with different skills that increase their power, or grant you things like regeneration; not to mention the different special abilities you'll unlock as you progress. There'll also be sections of the game in which you'll be exploring around (although this is a bit of an overstatement, as the game is pretty linear), climbing buildings and solving puzzles. I'd say both gameplay aspects are well balanced in their execution.The environments are gorgeous, with a great level of detail; it is unfortunate, however, that there isn't much exploration, since, as I mentioned above, the game is pretty linear. Even then, I've got to appreciate the amount of detail they gave to Neo-Paris, you can even find some recognizable Paris landmarks, like the Eiffel Tower, although you'll never access them. The soundtrack is excellent; I really loved the music, and it really set the tone of Neo-Paris being a sort of futuristic re-imagining of a classical Paris, if that sentence makes any amount of sense.Still, I must say this game had flaws, and, even though it's a good game, it could have been much, much more. The linearity isn't the biggest of its problems, as the game is somewhat buggy, which can cause you some trouble. Another problem I found is that the combo system isn't really effective against large groups, since the combo only works on a single enemy at a time; there's no freeflow between enemies (besides a special ability), meaning that your combo will be broken when switching enemies, not to mention that if an enemy hits you, the combo breaks as well. The camera can be a bit problematic as well, especially since there's no ""lock-on"" when fighting; sometimes you'll end up in a corner unable to see some enemies. Another big problem (at least for me) was the unskippable cutscenes. Now, I understand making them unskippable for the first time; but when I keep dying to the same enemy and being forced to watch the same (lenghty) cutscene over and over again, it gets annoying; however, I must say that I'm glad that, at least, they made it possible to pause the cutscenes, as that's another thing that annoys me, ""unpausable"" cutscenes.Well, despite its problems, I think Remember Me is a pretty solid and fun game, so I can recommend it.

												Remember Me is a uniqe attempt of a beginner studio at making a clever story about time travel. Since it's 2016 now, we have  Life Is Strange - so go play that first, and then play Remeber me as a ""back to basics"" vesrion. Many concepts and even gameplay elements have a similar feel to them, but this one also offers combo-based combat (which is very well-made for busy people who cannot remeber a combo since they play on a weekly basis).The story is comparable to a book, but the experience is a game-exclusive one: you could never just watch it on a screen or just read it from paper. You have to DO it yourself. Basically, 10/10 for effort and ideas, 8/10 for execution. Shouldn't be played as anything other than a storytelling experience, since that's what it is (although battle mechanics are quite nice).			"

												Remember me is a pretty great game:If you like art involving futurisic urban areas. This game has some great built environments from the flooded paris slums to the misture of ""classical"" and futuristic architecture in the city centre. The soundtrack is also very good and plays well with the art style. If you like casual arcade-style gameplay. This game isn't a super-hardcore one. The main controls involve chaining combos in order to attack enemies in different ways. I think the way that the game uses this is pretty well executed, especially in that you can customize how the combos are built [each combo 'hit' can be an attack, a heal, a power regen, etc.].If you like trans-humanism. The story revolves around implants that let people share their memories, and the inevitable moral complexities that arise in this. The technologies involved allow overlays on the screen, a la ""augmented reality"", which is how most of the UI is played, but it brings up an interesting point: The technologies involved are what lets characters fight each other. If you didn't have one of these implants, would you still be affected? If you like to think about these kinds of things, I'm sure the game will give you lots to work on.Overall, just a very good action game.			"

												I was pretty sad to see this game go straight into the clearance bin at a few local stores, because it's overall a fantastic game. The atmosphere is visually stunning with a great soundtrack, and the story really pulled me in as well. The boss fights were personally my favorite part of the game, because each one is so unique from each other. They all have different mechanics, and even though some took me forever to beat, I had a blast finding out what each one had in store for me (especially the final boss). The gameplay is great, and I loved personalizing my own combos for combat. Other than just punching and kicking everything in the face, the powers you aquire are super cool, and really add to the fun gameplay. Definitely play this game, because if you don't, then you're really missing out!!			"

												This game, along with the Batman: Arkham series has re-invigorated my interest in action games. Firstly, let's talk about the game quality of Remember Me. Aside from Nilin when she's talking (lips don't always match her speech), and another when one of the enemy bosses temporarily left the area I could fight in, I noticed no errors. There wasn't any empty map areas, there wasn't any low quality texturing anywhere, and everything I interacted in worked flawlessly.However, there are a few problems. First is the fighting 'combo' system. While it's good and innovative, the lack of time between enemies (especially when they're rather aggressive and you're trying to fight back 5 of them) means anything other than the first combo of 3 punches is likely to get unused, especially late game. The powers available are a mix of good and meh. Sensen Fury is a good power but unfortunately useless for the majority of late-game due, normally due to the ammount of enemies you're facing meaning one is always ready to strike you and break the combo, and the fact there's more useful powers available. Some of the enemies are hard to defeat too. The large robot, for example, unleashes a shockwave power you have trouble escaping from, and then has a vulnerability which, if you get caught in the shockwave, cannot get to in-time to attack the robot. Some boss battles are hard to do due to lack of guidance (e.g. you need to do power X and then Y). The upgrading system is good - it's not as you level up, it's as you find parts of the upgrades... which is a good ploy for you to search the maps for upgrades. However, you occasionally have a hard time finding said upgrades. While I'm talking about collecting, might I add how hard it is to find all the Scarabmechs. The story, however, is the crown jewel of Remember Me. Thoughtful, logical, and if you have a good mind, you can link up so much of the story elements as you play you can link things together, often before the story reveals them to you.Lastly, the soundtrack. From stirring pieces to real gritty, electronically re-cut ""you're about to poop yourself"" moments, I have never heard such a good soundtrack. There's parts where it sounds normal, and others where it's been remixed in such a way it blends in with the whole experience.Remember Me is - without a doubt - one of the best games I've ever played. It joins my pedestals of other excellent games, like No One Lives Forever 2, Railroad Tycoon 2 and Sid Meier's Civ series from 4 onwards. "

												I've bought this game when it was on sale, personally I wouldn't pay the full price, the full price it's a bit expensive for me, but I am very glad that I got the game. I love a good strong women lead character and Nilin is amazing, the voice acting is great, the figure the movements of her are great. I am just in love with her, and it's always good to play with a female character (feminist alert). The storyline is simple, you are a person who lost her memory, can't remember a thing, you're trying to remember and everything just completes itself really. The world is set in Neo-Paris, very futuristic, but it has a dystopic vibe to it. You're feeling like you're in a chaotic world, which I liked. There are some puzzle bits in the game, they are enjoyable, complicated enough but not too hard too. There is a hospital bit which is very enjoyable, I never played a part like that and I absolutely loved it. My computer isn't great so I played in low-medium graphics but they were good, so I believe that if you have a good computer you'll enjoy the graphics very much. I think the soundtrack is very good, especially the main theme is amazing. First of all, I am not an action gamer, This paragraph is about the action of it. I am more like a simulator, casual, indie game kinda person. Euro Truck Simulator, Cities Skyline, Don't Starve kinda... I am not good with FPS games, or any kinda action games really. But I could manage the mechanics easily, they were easy enough for me to be comfortable with, I could arrange MY OWN COMBOS. Which was amazing, I litereally made combos focusing on gaining health and used them like 100 times in every single fight. The boss fights were bit tricky for me, I played each fight like 6 times but I did it, eventually. And I played on easy mode so if you're good with them you can always play them in harder modes, make more complicated combos, make more fancy moves idk. You can configure them according your skills, it's up to you! So I think that's good. Some people may think that the mechanics are not good enough but they were good enough for me. I'd give a solid 7/10 to it. And btw I am a keyboard/mouse player so if you're using controllers, it has to be much more better.Overeall I'd give a solid 8.5/10 to the game.			"

												It's too short fr its original value but I got it on the cheap and it was definitely worth putting money on it. Great universe, good story and characters (actually one of the few good female character in a video game). It's not black and white, it has nuances. The gameplay is okay, at times frustrating but you work through it fine.I definitely recommend this for those who like sci-fi and/or cyberpunk. The art is great and gets a lot out of old gen and UE3.			"

												Remember me is one of those games that you should play, but would annoy you at times during play.I recommand the game, but I have my issues with it.Pros:The game has an interesting plot, and the setting (the city of neo paris) is extremely well thought of. The fights are fun and fluid. The remembrance mechanisms are well thought of and enjoyful.The game also brings forth important questions, and (unlike some games) is not really afraid to try and answer.Cons:However - the linearity of the game is obscene. Doors lock down and open to lead you in a straight line through the city.Your character can jump from ledge to ledge (assasins creed style / farcor style), but can't go over a 2 inch cardboard box on the floor. The fights are a bit repetitive and there's not enough remembrance mini games (perhaps 5 throughout the game).I also have an issue with the fact that it's a future paris with robots and virtual reality, but there's only one gun in the entire city (and someone shoots himself with it). Only bots and gunships seem to have real guns.And lastly - at some point during the endgame, you get attacked by a horde which shouldn't really be there, isn't a real obstacle at that point (you finished a far harder horde 5 minutes before), and has no real point. That single fight scene really damaged the immersive experience that was a big part of the end game.  "

												A fantastic, and incredibly underrated game. I remember looking forward to this before it released, but then being discouraged by all of the negative and mixed reviews. So unfortunately, it took me a while before I finally bought and played the game. Moral of the story: don't listen to the critics! The developers have created a beautifully imaginative future, complete with stunning graphics and a captivating soundtrack. Gameplay mostly consists of platforming through the streets of Neo Paris, battling enemies with an innovative combat system, solving puzzles and generally interacting the environment with augmented reality tools. All together, it's an incredible concept, and a joy to play. It feels a bit like the mechanics of a Prince of Persia game, with graphics reminiscent of Mirror's Edge and a setting and story not unlike Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness. This reviewer finds that to be an excellent combination.As much as I enjoyed the game, I now have a better understanding of why some players may have become easily frustrated with the combat system. I did not understand it for the first hour or two of gameplay, and I very nearly quit the game for good. But after the first memory remix - easily the best concept in this game and sadly underused - I was determined to keep playing to continue unraveling the story. With a bit more patience, I came to love the combat system and realize just how fun it could be (and, mind you, I'm not usually a melee/combat sort of gamer). By the end of the game, I had pretty much mastered the combat system, and found myself customizing combos on the fly depending on the battle at hand. So if you're struggling with the combat, be patient with it and don't let it ruin the whole game for you.I do however have one major gripe with the game, which is how excessively linear it is. You're in this incredibly vibrant world, and 9 out of 10 of doors are closed off to you, steering you down a narrow path to your objectives. And it's a one way street - almost every single time you go through a door, it closes behind you, sealing off any secrets or powerups you may have missed. The game uses a unique premise for offering powerups - you catch a glimpse of where they are and have to remember the location before you pass it by, which is trickier than it seems. And as far as the platforming goes, you're limited to climbing on very specific objects the whole way through, indicated in orange. With how vast the world is, I suppose this makes sense or otherwise you could be climbing in every direction. As much as I want another massive open world game, (what can I say, I've been spoiled by Assassin's Creed) I understand that that may have been beyond the scope of the debut of this IP. At the same time, considering the immense amount of time that must have gone into this meticulously designed city, it's a shame to breeze through it all in a matter of hours. Me personally, I finished the game in about 10 hours. I look forward to replaying it again at some point- it's definitely worth it. Remember Me does allow you to reload chapters so you can find powerups and secrets that you missed the first time through - and I may end up doing just that.One thing that I must applaud this game for, in stark contrast to many other games out there, is how it continues to innovate and evolve over the course of its 8 chapters. New enemies appear and old ones grow stronger, you gain new abilities and unlock more powerful combos, and the tools and puzzles grow ever more complex, right up to the end. Boss battles and memory remix scenes add an extra challenge that serves to end each chapter with a satisfying resolution. The memory remix dynamic is very original, I really don't think I've ever seen anything like it. It's just a shame it only appears four times in the game. The soundtrack is also fantastic, built from notes of somewhat familiar classical Parisian orchestra, remixed with what I can only describe as futuristic and chaotic glitches - in a way that feels natural. The music also is well-weaved into the combat. I was reading that the composer wanted the soundtrack to feel as chaotic as the world of Remember Me itself - a world where memories can change or be erased at a whim. I think they did an excellent job in that endeavour.I was also very impressed with the story, which kept me hooked, surprised, and emotionally engaged all the way to the end. This is a story that does not feel too far off from our own world, and closes with a powerful and appropriate ending. I found the final boss battle to be a bit strange, and perhaps a bit too easy, and at the same time I enjoyed it thoroughly.Personally, I think this game is worthy of a strong 9/10, however if I end up posting this review online anywhere I'd bump that to 10/10 to even the scales a bit. I honestly believe that the game is short on flaws, and the only ones that do exist are most likely a reflection of what particular gamers like and don't like in their games. I see many bad reviews from those who tried an hour or two of the combat and gave up, just like I almost did, and missed out on the rest of a great game. And I acknowledge that not every game has to be open world, and that I'm a bit spoiled to expect that. So even my biggest complaint does not really stick. So now that I've completed the game, perhaps this review finds me doing a bit of my own memory editing, to put some of my own minor gripes into perspective. This is a fantastic game, one of my top favorites of the year and one I won't soon forget. Highly recommended. 9/10			"

												Remember Me takes and sets In a futuristic Neo-Paris In 2084. You are Nilin, the memory hunter. Everyone, the government Is afraid of you-- until you are wiped of everything you knew. As Nilin fights to remember and retrieve her memories, she relearns her combat, reminisces with her friends and makes It back to the top of the food chain, as the master memory hunter. You discover that Memorize, the game's tyrant Is running everyone's memories down, turning them Into creatures, mutants, monsters. Find a way to stop them In this action-packed, Immersive combat, and fast paced, heart racing Cyberpunk world.     I was quite Impressed when I first played the game. The first hour was very Immersive, with the world taking you Into it. I am a huge fan of Cyberpunk and this game captures It all. I knew this would be the game for me once I saw It. The combat Is fluid and varies depending on you. You can change up the combos with different types of effects, such like regenerating health, adding onto combos, amplifying damage, or even prolonging your combos! The story Is great, 'nuff said.     10/10			"

												Overall Score: 7/10My advice: If you enjoy a game for its story and can overlook repetitive fighting, pick it up on sale.Genre: Action Adventure, PlatformerAlright, let me get all of the puns out of the way first. While Remember Me does have some memorable moments, a sound track that won't get out of your head, and an environment that sticks out in your memory, the combat was utterly forgettable and left me nostalgic for other fighting games. *Ahem*With that out of the way, you play as Nilan, a girl who's forcably lost memory of who she is, but is saved from having her mind completely wiped thanks to a mysterious figure named Edge. He belongs to a group called the Errorists, people determined to cleanse a society that uses memories as a form of tradable commodity, and experiments with memory itself to produce a stable, segregated city. As you venture through the game, you come across the nightmares of such experimentation and ultimately begin to take part in the most fun aspect of the game --remixing memories of certain people you come across and changing elements of what they recall to get them to join your cause.It's really hard for me to figure out the kind of game Remember Me is trying to be. It gives this rich and interesting world but confines you to a linear path. It develops a wealth of interesting characters, but such flat development that at times feels forced. It tries to put together a unique combat system, but with such simple mechanics, most matches devolve into acrobatic button mashing. The coolest element of the game, memory remixing, doesn't happen nearly enough for it to hold the game up on its own. The worst part about it is a certain amount of pretentiousness with how it knows it's an artsy, smart game. Still, the music and atmosphere are astounding, and I have to give credit where it's due --it's a damn good story. Just wish the other elements had more thought put into them.			"

												Pros:+Deeply moving storyline with excellent character development, rare for a game to have a female protaganist that I actually care for.+The best level design I have seen since Half Life 2. Around every corner is something that makes me say ""wow"".+Beatiful visuals (after an essential tweak) and a vivid, colourful world.+Dynamic and fluid combat mechanics with a number of strategies available.+Parkour is smooth and simple to master.+Memory Remixing is a stroke of genius, and can be an emotional rollercoaster.+Fabulous music that adds well to the immersion.Cons:-Levels can sometimes feel a little too linear, despite the game being non open-world by design.-Memory Remixing, probably the game's strongest point, is simply not explored enough.-Very little replayability aside from completing all collectibles.-Rather duff final boss, despite the superb and moving build-up.-Combat and some other elements are poorly explained with no tutorial leaving the player to figure out what to do.-Default game has a stupid film-grain effect which ruins the visuals, but this is easily removed (PM me).-Camera difficult to control, FOV can be restrictive and is not editable.-Although it functions well, parkour remains fairly simplistic and could have been expanded.Overall I really enjoyed the game experience, despite the cons. This game recieves 9/10 bacons.			"

												3rd person, action, fighting game with platforming. You play as Nilin, a memory hunter as they call her in 2084 Neo-Paris. Story is very good in my opinion, that unravels as you go on, with unexpected twists, wont spoil.Game has some great environments, but most of the levels are linear, small, closed off sections. Tutorial system that will help you learn the basics, that I found very useful. There is simple platforming element, in form of climbing walls, ledges, pipes, etc., most of them are highlighted and you can't climb any wall you want. Basically you run couple dozen meters, climb a bit, then get cutscene and begin fighting some enemies. There is no particular order, but it's not as bad as it sounds.Fighting involves punch and kick combos that you combine in ""Combo maker"", dodging is also vital, to avoid damage. You unlock more and more moves as you play the game, there are different kinds of combat moves, some add more damage, some restore your health, some reduce cooldowns on more powerful moves, etc.Movement animations are good, didn't notice anything troubling, voice acting is also on level and is enjoyable, cutscenes are nicely done and angled. You will notice some low resolution textures here and there, but generally it's good looking game.There are a lot of collectibles in form of Data packages in game, that award you health upgrades, as well as some art and 3D models in Extras. Personally I very much liked how game levels looked, as well as Nilin and her small little bosom. I recommend this, have fun!			"

												If you like thought-provoking science-fiction this game is for you. With a great story and breathtaking world design – Neo-Paris looks spectacular! – Remember Me is a very memorable experience. Especially because of the four memory remix sequences scattered throughout the game, where you must change the memories of certain people in the story. While four does not sound much, the sequences gives one very much food for thought – I think even more so because of this low number. This memorable experience is coupled with an interesting combat mechanic, somewhat reminiscent of Arkham Asylum/City, where you can and in some situations must mix the effects of your combos in mid-combat. Furthermore, Remember Me has an atypical and very striking musical score, which supports the game’s themes very well. The only thing somewhat lacking in this game is its very limited platform sections, due to its level design, which almost entirely does not give any room for any exploration deviating from the main path. However, this problem with the weak platforming sections is somewhat alleviated by the beautiful and atmospheric world design, and the combat sections throughout the game. If you want to support an original IP, with a great and thought provoking sci-fi story, excellent world design, outstanding musical score and superb gameplay (thanks to its combat and memory remix sequences) only marred by a weak platforming mechanic, then Remember Me is for you.Info: I played Remember Me with a controller, with French audio/English subtitles language settings, and on the highest difficulty.

												Remember Me is an action game set in a futuristic (and somewhat dystopian) Paris, with an interesting story centered around memories becoming the new form of social interaction. In the world of Remember Me, a company called Memorize has managed to digitize memories, allowing people to share them, which, theoretically, could lead to a more peaceful society. However, this is not the case, as society is still divided between the powerful and the poor.In the game, you play as Nilin, member of an activist group known as ""Errorists"", who seek to stop Memorize, as they consider the digitalization of memories has led to a worse society. At the start of the game, you've been captured and have no memory of who you are, and it's only through the help of a mysterious ally, known as Edge, that you manage to escape. From there, you start searching for clues of your past, while helping the Errorist cause. The story is pretty good, with some interesting twists here and there, which is why I won't write more about it, as there's risks of spoilers. There's also lots of collectibles scattered around that add a bit of background information regarding the story of the game.As far as gameplay goes, well, it's somewhat simple. The game is combat oriented, which means you'll be fighting plenty of enemies; it offers a certain degree of customization through the ""Combo Lab"", which allows you to modify four different combos with different skills that increase their power, or grant you things like regeneration; not to mention the different special abilities you'll unlock as you progress. There'll also be sections of the game in which you'll be exploring around (although this is a bit of an overstatement, as the game is pretty linear), climbing buildings and solving puzzles. I'd say both gameplay aspects are well balanced in their execution.The environments are gorgeous, with a great level of detail; it is unfortunate, however, that there isn't much exploration, since, as I mentioned above, the game is pretty linear. Even then, I've got to appreciate the amount of detail they gave to Neo-Paris, you can even find some recognizable Paris landmarks, like the Eiffel Tower, although you'll never access them. The soundtrack is excellent; I really loved the music, and it really set the tone of Neo-Paris being a sort of futuristic re-imagining of a classical Paris, if that sentence makes any amount of sense.Still, I must say this game had flaws, and, even though it's a good game, it could have been much, much more. The linearity isn't the biggest of its problems, as the game is somewhat buggy, which can cause you some trouble. Another problem I found is that the combo system isn't really effective against large groups, since the combo only works on a single enemy at a time; there's no freeflow between enemies (besides a special ability), meaning that your combo will be broken when switching enemies, not to mention that if an enemy hits you, the combo breaks as well. The camera can be a bit problematic as well, especially since there's no ""lock-on"" when fighting; sometimes you'll end up in a corner unable to see some enemies. Another big problem (at least for me) was the unskippable cutscenes. Now, I understand making them unskippable for the first time; but when I keep dying to the same enemy and being forced to watch the same (lenghty) cutscene over and over again, it gets annoying; however, I must say that I'm glad that, at least, they made it possible to pause the cutscenes, as that's another thing that annoys me, ""unpausable"" cutscenes.Well, despite its problems, I think Remember Me is a pretty solid and fun game, so I can recommend it.

												Remember me is a pretty great game:If you like art involving futurisic urban areas. This game has some great built environments from the flooded paris slums to the misture of ""classical"" and futuristic architecture in the city centre. The soundtrack is also very good and plays well with the art style. If you like casual arcade-style gameplay. This game isn't a super-hardcore one. The main controls involve chaining combos in order to attack enemies in different ways. I think the way that the game uses this is pretty well executed, especially in that you can customize how the combos are built [each combo 'hit' can be an attack, a heal, a power regen, etc.].If you like trans-humanism. The story revolves around implants that let people share their memories, and the inevitable moral complexities that arise in this. The technologies involved allow overlays on the screen, a la ""augmented reality"", which is how most of the UI is played, but it brings up an interesting point: The technologies involved are what lets characters fight each other. If you didn't have one of these implants, would you still be affected? If you like to think about these kinds of things, I'm sure the game will give you lots to work on.Overall, just a very good action game.			"

												As I've just finished Remember me I will just write this up for people. The story was great and the visuals was brilliant, the game's 3D graphics were really good, one of the best I've seen in a long time, they were simple yet brilliantly detailed. Kind of like the visuals of mirrors edge at times, the game play was at times also like Portal 2 as you can move things from a type of gun, called the hammer, on the main characters arm who is named Nilan. The story was great and at the end, the character figure out what's going on the same time you do, so the developers don't teat you like you are stupid and explain everything you've been doing all over again at the end.The fighting can get annoying because it's so repetitive but that is the only real downside on this game, there are a few other things like, they never implemented a parry system, so instead of blocking attacks, you have to jump to dodge, but it works well.I also like that the girl isn't 'Hot' she's good looking, but she isn't like some anime girl and they haven't used any sex appeal, just a really good story.

												This game was pretty amazing from the beginning. It takes an hour or two to figure out the system and basic layout of the game, but its a shame this game didnt take off and sell a million copies. The story is a big driving force in the game and the main heroine is likable and charismatic. The battle scenes are top notch and the overall gameplay is similar to Enslaved with a mix of combos.The combo system is unique and original, and its actually beneficial to learn each one (there are 4).Each combo can be tailored to your liking and play-style and they become a major necessity. There are very unique moments in the game where you have to alter people's memories to achieve a particular reaction from them, and this is one of the greatest aspects of the game. The combat remains interesting throughout the game and the story remains clear and there isnt a moment where it becomes boggled in confusion or side-tracking. Over all, I really enjoyed the game and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a medium length game with tons of action, some character development, and combo and quick time event sequences.			"

												The key feature of this game was the unique storyline and the flow of it. Graphics were great and if the world was more open this game would be totally awesome. The first few episodes might make the player little boring but when going on with the main storyline and learning about major plot twists makes this game addictive. Memory remixes and awesome pressens makes the gameplay so much interesting. I would totally recommend this for players who love RPG/Action. This would be better if they had a collection of more DLC packs or additional content. For $29.99 people might hesitate to buy this because its not yet mainstream.			"

												Remember Me has been given a raw deal. True the combat gets repetitive at times, the memory remixing is perhaps under utilised and the game is very much ""on rails"" (to be fair they never said that it was going to be anything but and I'm a strong believer that sometimes it's nice to just be led through a story - Last of Us is pretty much linear for example). However the world the game inhabits is extremely rich, the sounds and graphics add to that. The story is fascinating and gets pretty far out towards the end. It's what I lazily deem ""high concept"" with some of the ideas - something that rarely goes down well with the mainstream reviewers. It's a real shame though. Unlike some of the other ""better"" games out there, I sat down and played Remember Me over the course of a week or so and finished it. It drew me in, told a great story and offered some extremely memorable moments....and a fantastic sound track.Sometimes we really should just celebrate art.			"

												It's not often I get choked up by a game, but this one nailed it.  Absolutely beautiful story, beautiful setting and some interesting mechanics.   As the game starts, Nillin is completely amnesiac, so you know just as much of what's going on as she does.  It's hard to write a really positive review about this game when its strongest point is the story, so I'll move on to some of the other aspects of it.Aside from the story, one of Remember Me's best points is the combat.  It's a free-flow, combo-based system reminiscent of the Arkham series, except that YOU choose the effect that the attacks have.  Extra damage, health regeneration, and a reduction in your special ability's recharge time (more on that in a minute) are the three choices you have, but in addition to that you can use a chain effect which mimics and magnifies the effect of your previous hit in the combo.  These can be changed mid-combat via a menu in the pause screen, to suit your needs in a particular fight. Nillin gets a TON of character development, but most of the other characters you meet don't really get explored.  Early on you meet someone who is supposedly one of your closest friends, but he never appears again after Episode 3.  This is, understandably, Nillin's story, but the game could have done with a bit more character development.  My only other big complaint is with the climbing.  When you're first introduced to the climbing mechanics, it feels like a tutorial, but the training wheels never really come off.  It has the look of Assassin's Creed-style parkour, but it feels very restrictive and not at all fluid, in several cases almost to the point of immersion-breaking.  I think that if DONTNOD had put some more time into the climbing mechanics, it could have been better than it is.All in all, weighing the bad with the good, I'd give this an 8.5/10.  The few issues I have with the gameplay aren't enough to really take away from the phenomenal story that this game has to offer, and I can honestly say that I was at the edge of my seat for a fair portion of it.

												I got this game in a sale and it was worth every penny.  Even at full price this game is worth it compared to many AAA titles that are $60 plus.It has an engaging story with likeable characters that you grow to care about and the voice acting is spot on.  The atmosphere in the game is really well done.  The game is set in a futuristic Paris where people's memories are a hot commodity and an evil company misuses their power to create a gap between rich and poor.  Overall I liked the story and it last about 7 hours (my gameplay time is higher because I alt+tabbed for a while). This game would have benefited from being more open as the futuristic paris looked great, I just wish I could have explored it more.I've seen a lot of people complain about the fighting mechanics, I suspect this is because they couldn't get to grips with them because I really liked them.  You can devise your own combos adding in different elements to change what your attacks do.  You also get a select few ""special"" attacks which do different kinds of damage.  At the end of the story with them all unlocked you can really pull off some cool combos and techniques.Unfortunately the game has little replayability value given its very linear story, save for going back to collect things you missed.  Unless you're an achievement hunter though, I doubt you will do this.  There's not much to be gained.Pros:- Strong female lead- Well written and voice acted- Interesting and at times philosophical story- Intriguing combat and cool combos- Great atmosphere and good graphicsCons:- Quite short (7hrs, max)- Not much replayability			"

												9/10This game follows a story that is at times deeply angers you and at others, fills you with sorrow but at all times, is quite intense. The depiction of an Orwellian world in the future is terrific, as are the powers that be and every other person who is surviving in the regime of Memorize. Each chapter's story is very well crafted around the checkpoint based gameplay and even though the story is totally linear, it's a journey you don't want to miss and must finish. This is one those games in which you're living a part of the protagonist's life as in a novel or movie. The best parts of the game are when you get to remix memories. Although it would have been interesting if I could create armies or create total anarchy by remixing anyone's memories I chose, the developers chose not to trivialize memory remixing by limiting it to only some select people and moments in the story. Those parts draw parallels to Inception, to say the least. The action is the only part of the game that can get a little repetitive and monotonous, but not if you keep changing the combo moves to suit every battle sequence, which is something I learned. The very fact that the combos could be modified as and when the player chooses was a fantastic idea. A very beautiful game with an intense plot.			"

												Pros: Impressive graphics, adheres to all stereotypical Cyberpunk tropes, runs wild with the post-armageddon corporate dictatorship theme, criticisms of human nature, intriguing storyline, snarky dialogue at times, vague contemporary references, semi-customizable combo sequences, entertaining boss fights, hidden objects to find, (overall) user-friendly tutorial, and especially MEMORY REMIXING. what's more godlike than being able to tamper with others' history to your own advantage?Cons: Extremely linear gameplay, NO exploration or environmental interaction at all, everything is guided, fights are very repetitive, unskippable cutscenes, almost no replayability, hard-to-control UI, selectively displayed HUD, repetitive dialogue in bossfights, no death penalties, occasional lag spikes, short gameplay (only 8 hours and you're done), lots of keyboard smashing, poor PC porting/optimizations, only 4 memory remixing scenes, and way too much parkour.Graphics: 9/10Story: 6/10Gameplay: 5/10Quality: 4/10Overall: 6/10Get it while it's on 80% discount!

												Graphics are fantastic. The sounds and game environment are rich and immersive. Gameplay is good, especially with a controller. I used an XBox 360 controller. Was a bit difficult with keyboard/mouse, probably because I don't play many linear games like this one. In fact the one complaint I'd have about this game is how linear it is. You go from one fight sequence to the next. Your character Nillin spends most of the game on route to an objective. There are lots of corridors to navigate and every 3rd or so hallway opens out into an arena/courtyard of some type where something always falls down behind you to trap you until you defeat several foes, after which some forward obstruction miraculously falls away allowing you to continue.This formula gets a bit tiring and persists throughout the game but when it was done, I realized that I had enjoyed it far more than I thought I would. So given that this is not my favorite genre, I have to give it a thumbs up. In fact I didn't even come to the store page to write a review but to see if there was DLC so that I could continue.			"

												I was pretty sad to see this game go straight into the clearance bin at a few local stores, because it's overall a fantastic game. The atmosphere is visually stunning with a great soundtrack, and the story really pulled me in as well. The boss fights were personally my favorite part of the game, because each one is so unique from each other. They all have different mechanics, and even though some took me forever to beat, I had a blast finding out what each one had in store for me (especially the final boss). The gameplay is great, and I loved personalizing my own combos for combat. Other than just punching and kicking everything in the face, the powers you aquire are super cool, and really add to the fun gameplay. Definitely play this game, because if you don't, then you're really missing out!!			"

												This game, along with the Batman: Arkham series has re-invigorated my interest in action games. Firstly, let's talk about the game quality of Remember Me. Aside from Nilin when she's talking (lips don't always match her speech), and another when one of the enemy bosses temporarily left the area I could fight in, I noticed no errors. There wasn't any empty map areas, there wasn't any low quality texturing anywhere, and everything I interacted in worked flawlessly.However, there are a few problems. First is the fighting 'combo' system. While it's good and innovative, the lack of time between enemies (especially when they're rather aggressive and you're trying to fight back 5 of them) means anything other than the first combo of 3 punches is likely to get unused, especially late game. The powers available are a mix of good and meh. Sensen Fury is a good power but unfortunately useless for the majority of late-game due, normally due to the ammount of enemies you're facing meaning one is always ready to strike you and break the combo, and the fact there's more useful powers available. Some of the enemies are hard to defeat too. The large robot, for example, unleashes a shockwave power you have trouble escaping from, and then has a vulnerability which, if you get caught in the shockwave, cannot get to in-time to attack the robot. Some boss battles are hard to do due to lack of guidance (e.g. you need to do power X and then Y). The upgrading system is good - it's not as you level up, it's as you find parts of the upgrades... which is a good ploy for you to search the maps for upgrades. However, you occasionally have a hard time finding said upgrades. While I'm talking about collecting, might I add how hard it is to find all the Scarabmechs. The story, however, is the crown jewel of Remember Me. Thoughtful, logical, and if you have a good mind, you can link up so much of the story elements as you play you can link things together, often before the story reveals them to you.Lastly, the soundtrack. From stirring pieces to real gritty, electronically re-cut ""you're about to poop yourself"" moments, I have never heard such a good soundtrack. There's parts where it sounds normal, and others where it's been remixed in such a way it blends in with the whole experience.Remember Me is - without a doubt - one of the best games I've ever played. It joins my pedestals of other excellent games, like No One Lives Forever 2, Railroad Tycoon 2 and Sid Meier's Civ series from 4 onwards. "

												I've bought this game when it was on sale, personally I wouldn't pay the full price, the full price it's a bit expensive for me, but I am very glad that I got the game. I love a good strong women lead character and Nilin is amazing, the voice acting is great, the figure the movements of her are great. I am just in love with her, and it's always good to play with a female character (feminist alert). The storyline is simple, you are a person who lost her memory, can't remember a thing, you're trying to remember and everything just completes itself really. The world is set in Neo-Paris, very futuristic, but it has a dystopic vibe to it. You're feeling like you're in a chaotic world, which I liked. There are some puzzle bits in the game, they are enjoyable, complicated enough but not too hard too. There is a hospital bit which is very enjoyable, I never played a part like that and I absolutely loved it. My computer isn't great so I played in low-medium graphics but they were good, so I believe that if you have a good computer you'll enjoy the graphics very much. I think the soundtrack is very good, especially the main theme is amazing. First of all, I am not an action gamer, This paragraph is about the action of it. I am more like a simulator, casual, indie game kinda person. Euro Truck Simulator, Cities Skyline, Don't Starve kinda... I am not good with FPS games, or any kinda action games really. But I could manage the mechanics easily, they were easy enough for me to be comfortable with, I could arrange MY OWN COMBOS. Which was amazing, I litereally made combos focusing on gaining health and used them like 100 times in every single fight. The boss fights were bit tricky for me, I played each fight like 6 times but I did it, eventually. And I played on easy mode so if you're good with them you can always play them in harder modes, make more complicated combos, make more fancy moves idk. You can configure them according your skills, it's up to you! So I think that's good. Some people may think that the mechanics are not good enough but they were good enough for me. I'd give a solid 7/10 to it. And btw I am a keyboard/mouse player so if you're using controllers, it has to be much more better.Overeall I'd give a solid 8.5/10 to the game.			"

												I found this game to be a surprise gem. It has a combat system that reminds me of Batman Arkham, but it is not nearly as good. Instead, it seems that this game relies on it's story, presentation and music, which I found to be very good. It is a linear game where you go from room to room, stopping to fight enemies and solve puzzles. The puzzles were not too complex, but I found that they change the pace of the game and keep it feeling fresh. In my opinion, this game would have been perfect if they took the time to further develop combat system. In the end, I enjoyed this game very much. It took about 8 hours to beat, but it felt about right. It was not too long or short.			"

												The game is decent. It's not super great, but it's not terrible. It takes awhile to get adjusted to the combat system because they don't explain it clear enough(I had to look up a guide to figure it out, but once you understand it, it's semi-smooth sailing from there). The levels are very linear, but they're very detailed and they look great. Some of the fights are very difficult no matter the difficulty level,  and the boss fights are a little longer than they need to be.Long story short, it's decent at best. If you're patient and look past the repetitive combat and super linear levels, it's decent. I'd suggest buying it on sale, though. The original retail price is not worth the headache. Buy it on sale, it's worth the sale price. I do recommend it, though, there's little plot twists that make the story worth your while.			"

												Make no mistake, this game is a delight to look at.  The city of Neo-Paris has been rendered in a way that lends considerable creedence to their vision of the near future.  Lots of little details are included that make the environments believable.That task was probably made easier by the highly-linear nature of the game.  On the one hand, you can lament how incredible this would have been to have the same level of detail in an open-world, but the linear nature allows for a high degree of polish on the path you follow through the world and story.The story's competent, and told well enough, though I don't think I was invested as the story expected me to be.  Nilin comes across as introspective, yet more than a little cold.There's a neat memory-remix mechanic introduced early on and it felt like I was nearly halfway through the game before it came up again, though there are several instances before all's said and done.  I'll echo the sentiments of several other reviewers who wished there was ""more of that, please.""The combat itself is also competent, in the Arkham vein but with a dodge rather than a counter, with a few nice touches to spice things up.  Depending on your play style, it's easy for some fights to overstay their welcome, but once you become comfortable with the combo system and fight mechanics (or like me learn to stop hoarding your special attacks) you can dispatch with most battles relatively expeditiously.  It's got QTE's, and while the button you press corresponds to the action executed it still feels more like a match game than a act of skill, but they're used to cap off certain battles rather than as a routine mechanic.I played with a mouse and keyboard and occasionally felt like the game wanted me to be using a controller, but it was never a serious handicap.  (Here's a tip if you're using a mouse and kb like me - the ""Rewind"" motion is like drawing a counter-clockwise circle with your mouse.  Perhaps I missed a critical instruction, but that really threw me off during the first memory remix.)I think there was something else I wanted to say, but I just...can't remember.			"

												A fantastic, and incredibly underrated game. I remember looking forward to this before it released, but then being discouraged by all of the negative and mixed reviews. So unfortunately, it took me a while before I finally bought and played the game. Moral of the story: don't listen to the critics! The developers have created a beautifully imaginative future, complete with stunning graphics and a captivating soundtrack. Gameplay mostly consists of platforming through the streets of Neo Paris, battling enemies with an innovative combat system, solving puzzles and generally interacting the environment with augmented reality tools. All together, it's an incredible concept, and a joy to play. It feels a bit like the mechanics of a Prince of Persia game, with graphics reminiscent of Mirror's Edge and a setting and story not unlike Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness. This reviewer finds that to be an excellent combination.As much as I enjoyed the game, I now have a better understanding of why some players may have become easily frustrated with the combat system. I did not understand it for the first hour or two of gameplay, and I very nearly quit the game for good. But after the first memory remix - easily the best concept in this game and sadly underused - I was determined to keep playing to continue unraveling the story. With a bit more patience, I came to love the combat system and realize just how fun it could be (and, mind you, I'm not usually a melee/combat sort of gamer). By the end of the game, I had pretty much mastered the combat system, and found myself customizing combos on the fly depending on the battle at hand. So if you're struggling with the combat, be patient with it and don't let it ruin the whole game for you.I do however have one major gripe with the game, which is how excessively linear it is. You're in this incredibly vibrant world, and 9 out of 10 of doors are closed off to you, steering you down a narrow path to your objectives. And it's a one way street - almost every single time you go through a door, it closes behind you, sealing off any secrets or powerups you may have missed. The game uses a unique premise for offering powerups - you catch a glimpse of where they are and have to remember the location before you pass it by, which is trickier than it seems. And as far as the platforming goes, you're limited to climbing on very specific objects the whole way through, indicated in orange. With how vast the world is, I suppose this makes sense or otherwise you could be climbing in every direction. As much as I want another massive open world game, (what can I say, I've been spoiled by Assassin's Creed) I understand that that may have been beyond the scope of the debut of this IP. At the same time, considering the immense amount of time that must have gone into this meticulously designed city, it's a shame to breeze through it all in a matter of hours. Me personally, I finished the game in about 10 hours. I look forward to replaying it again at some point- it's definitely worth it. Remember Me does allow you to reload chapters so you can find powerups and secrets that you missed the first time through - and I may end up doing just that.One thing that I must applaud this game for, in stark contrast to many other games out there, is how it continues to innovate and evolve over the course of its 8 chapters. New enemies appear and old ones grow stronger, you gain new abilities and unlock more powerful combos, and the tools and puzzles grow ever more complex, right up to the end. Boss battles and memory remix scenes add an extra challenge that serves to end each chapter with a satisfying resolution. The memory remix dynamic is very original, I really don't think I've ever seen anything like it. It's just a shame it only appears four times in the game. The soundtrack is also fantastic, built from notes of somewhat familiar classical Parisian orchestra, remixed with what I can only describe as futuristic and chaotic glitches - in a way that feels natural. The music also is well-weaved into the combat. I was reading that the composer wanted the soundtrack to feel as chaotic as the world of Remember Me itself - a world where memories can change or be erased at a whim. I think they did an excellent job in that endeavour.I was also very impressed with the story, which kept me hooked, surprised, and emotionally engaged all the way to the end. This is a story that does not feel too far off from our own world, and closes with a powerful and appropriate ending. I found the final boss battle to be a bit strange, and perhaps a bit too easy, and at the same time I enjoyed it thoroughly.Personally, I think this game is worthy of a strong 9/10, however if I end up posting this review online anywhere I'd bump that to 10/10 to even the scales a bit. I honestly believe that the game is short on flaws, and the only ones that do exist are most likely a reflection of what particular gamers like and don't like in their games. I see many bad reviews from those who tried an hour or two of the combat and gave up, just like I almost did, and missed out on the rest of a great game. And I acknowledge that not every game has to be open world, and that I'm a bit spoiled to expect that. So even my biggest complaint does not really stick. So now that I've completed the game, perhaps this review finds me doing a bit of my own memory editing, to put some of my own minor gripes into perspective. This is a fantastic game, one of my top favorites of the year and one I won't soon forget. Highly recommended. 9/10			"

												When I wrote the evaluation, I had finish the game once, have found 80% of the items and have 58% of the steam succes of the game.As you may know, the topic of the game is memory. In the game memory is what we can call freedom and right to privacy in our actual world.This is a good game, with a good quality of graphism, picture, cinematic. The dialogue and the voice you can hear in the game (news, other caracter) are good and well placed. It had been well dubed in french and english, I haven't try other languages. This is game is not repetitive all the time. The challenge is to use all the combos, find all the Sap Patch and Boost or it will be a little bit harder to finish it. When you fight, the best thing to do is to focus on the buttons you push to win a lot of power and not pushing as fast as you can to beat the ennemies because it will take more time to beat them, this is why the gameplay is fine for me.I played it in french, the first riddle was hard. But the others are really simple. In english I saw a video of the riddles and they are quite simple.I only found 1 glitch (Épisode 2) and 1 bug (Boss of the Episode 7). There is no camera bugs, in fact you totaly control it, so it's to you to put it in the right way.It's worth to pay the game if you like thrillers, beat'em all and riddles and taking your time instead of pushing as faster and harder on the buttons to beat the ennemies.I give it a 16/20.

												#prayforneoparisAlthough I did not play the whole game (yet), I really do love this game. The graphics, the storyline and the combat system melt into an interesting and turning adventure with Nilin as the main character. I personally was reminded of Mass Effect 3 while playing, with the SciFi things like robots. I waited for a long time to buy this game on sale, cuz I´m a poor bub, so that now I can say the 28 euros are a good price for such a masterpiece. "

												The game is well made. I did not have probelms with the combat system. It felt very Arkham-ish, but less forgiving. The FoV is really small (even for 3rd-preson), but the FoV can be increase via Flawless Widescreen (flawless widescreen . org) with ease. The audio is very good all around. The soundtrack is well done and works wonderful in creating a believeable atmosphere as and combat sounds bring home the hand2hand combat. The english voice actors are nice and especially the protagonist has a good VA.* I think it is equal to FemShep. It is easy to change to multiple spoken language. Ital, engl. franc. and germany as well as other are choosable via ingame menu. The menu language is always your install-language, which you can change from the steam library.The game and story is linear, but this is no problem. It is a good, well designed journey with some interessting ethnical question for the player. You can't change the outcome, but you can ask yourself how you feel. The story and actions aren't as black&white as in many other videogame storys.Performance: Mostly very well, but some frame rate dips, when the game was loading. I only had one camera bug, where i had to restart from a checkpoint ~3 minutes away.As a resume: well designed world and charakters, animation are good and voice actiong excellent*. The combat system is okay, but the default camera makes it more awful, than it is. The game could have a bit more enemies. Performance is good and i had only one bug in 10hrs gameplay.Nilin/10*english is not my native language			"

												Awesome game! Just finished it and really enjoyed the whole experience. It's been a long time since I've actually played through a single player game, often times I get bored of the combat and stop playing. Remember Me really had a interesting story line that grabbed my attention and engaged me from the very start. Aside from the the story the different characters and enemies grab you based on their uniqueness. I really enjoyed the combat system, and I reccommend playing the game on the hardest difficulty. It was fairly straightforward but kept me entertained the whole time. You don't waste time fighting through hordes of endless enemies, to win you must strategize how to beat the current battle. If you find yourself breezing through every battle then you should make sure you are on the hardest difficulty. When I lost a battle it's because my strategy was off, not my mechanics. The settings and the music really led to a great environment to play in. I really recommend playing this game!			"

												(This is my first review so bear with me)I'm just going to list off the points that I liked and disliked about the game:+Creative combat for something that is basically just RMB + LMB (and space)+Cool soundtrack+Decent story and setting, very immersive+Biracial female protag!!! And a well-done one at that too!+Unique and great art style that meshes quite well with gameplay and UI-Combat can get REALLY frustrating/repetitive at times-Bonuses are hard to find-Very linear gameplay (e.g. with Assassin's Creed you have a variety of ways to approach your missions... Not here though)-Not much replay value (unless you're the type to 100% complete everything)			"

												Remember me can be best described as an hybrid between a fighting  and a platformer game. Developed by Dontnod Entertainment, it takes place in a futuristic version of Paris (known in the setting as Neo-Paris) from year 2084, where a new technology, the Sensen, has allowed men and women to influence their own memories and store or even cancel them as they please. The protagonist, Nilin, is a memory hunter, a woman capable of interfering with the others' minds easily. The beginning of the game shows Nilin suffering a severe case of amnesia and finding herself into a terrorist group seeking to destroy the Sensen and free Neo-Paris. The story of Remember Me therefore revolves around Nilin trying to recover her memories back.The main beef of the game is about navigating the various levels and survive the fistfights you are thrown in at times. Nilin is very agile and can get a good grip on many edges and jump between them easily: that's where the platform elements come from. There are always little visual clues on screen to tell you exactly where you should jump or hang on next. As the game progresses you'll be asked to overcome some small stealth sequences (there are sometimes patrolling droids that will instantly kill you if you get in their range) and puzzles: as Nilin acquires more skills you'll have to use them all to carve your path. Remember Me also features a really large collection of collectables items, which unlock concept art and 3D models in the main menu: some of them are hinted at during gameplay with some sort of maps, but the majority of them are incredibly well hidden and my require more walkthroughs to find.The combat in Remember Me is your usual fighting game fare: you must achieve combos on enemies for massive damage while being careful to dodge the attacks thrown at you. The game features an unique combo system: the in-game menu allows you to actually build your own combos, deciding how many hits each must contain and what each hit may actually do (while some hits just damage the enemies, others may heal you, for instance). Nilin can also use special attacks and temporary boost called Sensens: they are available after achieving enough focus and have different results (using some of them become mandatory to overcome some bosses). Many enemies in Remember Me can't be really taken on using sheer force and require special attacks or strategies first. While this element always keeps on your toes, on later level such enemies become more and more common and therefore more and more frustrating (they are also always escorted by lesser mooks who will disrupt your combos, making your job even harder). The game also features four boss battles, each with its unique flavor and rather challenging too.An unique gameplay element from Remember me are the Memory Remix sequences, which are more akin to an adventure game: you are presented with someone's else memory and have to change some particular details in order to change the ultimate outcome and proceed. Such sequences aren't that hard to overcome and are mostly trial and error in nature.It's also worth mentioning that the presentation in this game is absolutely gorgeous: the landscapes are very faithful to Paris itself and well crafted; the enemies design is original and extremely detailed; the soundtracks makes a great job at enhancing the overall mood.It can be argued that Remember Me tries to throw in many elements from different genres and doesn't manage to produce something truly unique for itself and the story could had been made far better for the truly incredible setting, but I still find this game to be severely underrated and I'd advise pretty much everyone to try it out regardless			"

												This is a truly beautiful game. The city is as majestic as the top sci-fi cities of Deus Ex and Dreamfall, but on top of that you also get some truly gorgeous menus and cyberspace-y cut scenes. Unfortunately the interactive part of the game is not so great. The biggest problem for me is that it is a linear console shooter, except instead of shooting you are punching and kicking. Most of the game you just walk through a corridor till you get to an open space where you need to kill some baddies, then repeat. That said, just like Mass Effect 2 and 3, which had equally mindless button-spamming combat, the game is saved by its mythology. Remember Me is set in a fabulous cyberpunk world and features one of the best female protagonists since Faith from Mirror's Edge. The story is a bit chaotic, but there is plenty of melodrama to keep you entertained. The graphics and music are exceptional. I wish they had ditched the combat in favor of stealth and parkour, but hey, you can't have it all. It's not Deus Ex, it's not Mirror's Edge, but if you liked either of those you will probably like this. It's a great ride.			"

												Remember Me is interesting, because it has a lot of things in it that should make a game bad, but it's crafted so well together, that it makes it great.As a game it's not the best at what it does, it doesn't have anything new that I haven't seen before, and some parts of it feels more like an interactive movie, rather than a game. But as a whole it's an extremely well assembled fun game, with a great story.THE COMBAT is quite simple, therefore it's really repetitive, but not easy, and it's spectacular. The fighting parts are sectioned out very well, they short enough that won't become a grind, but challenging enough to be satisfying to beat them.THE BACKGROUND WORLD is very well built, it's multifarious, it's interesting, it's important to the story but not forced upon the player. It's introduced over the right amount of time that you feel that you saw everything, but it's not overwhelming.THE STORY is very well written, and in my opinion is without clichés. The story telling is executed flawlessly. This is a very strong aspect of the game, so the replay value on this one is low.OVERALL there are games where you feel you should have had more fun playing them, but this is the exact opposite. If you break down the game to its different parts, like combat, exploring, the remix levels or boss fights, not one of them could stand up on their own, but as they tied together with the story it creates a quite unique and really fun game. It's simple but challenging, it's short enough to be interesting all the way, but long enough to be satisfying when you finish it. "

												Pros- Great storyline and world building. There is honestly a lot of thought that went into making this world, it feels really massive, despite being a linear game. - None of the characters felt underdeveloped- Combat system is decent, I don't know what everyone's complaining about. It's not as great as other games, but it's like a slightly more combo based version of Arkham, I suppose. - The art is great. Not the graphics, the actual art style and world created. The game feels linear, but still feels as if it's massiveCons - Feels a bit empty - besides coming across some people early on, the only people you get to see are either those relevant to the plot, random robots continuously doing tasks or those whose faces you'll be punching in.- The camera can bug out sometimes, and hoooly♥♥♥♥♥♥is it annoying. Doesn't matter what it is, if you're in battle and you just took damage because the camera ♥♥♥♥ed up, or if there's a view and you can't see it because the camera is fixed for some reason. It's all pretty much annoying. This is the major gripe I had with this game, if this got fixed, then I genuinely think most of my frustration with this game would be fixed with it.			"

You make people believe whatever you want. Seeing this power - and its effects - makes me question my power.Gameplay is ok, linear but beautiful (I like it anyway), graphics are nice, but why do you play it?The story.The story is amazing. Although a single main character seems to be fakey, it makes sense towards the end.Can't say much because of spoilers, but what you can do, make others believe, see, and hear Nilin say will lead you to accept things that need this game to accept.The last scene. The last scene made me ~cry, but not really. It made my throat feel like I wanted to cry without the underlying sadness. More like a profound acceptance.This game may not be able to relieve your pain, but it will bring you at peace. At least it did for me.			"

												It is a cyberpunk tale of a dystopia where people can trade, steal, implant and delete memories. The game feels very linear and there are some camera issues, but the gameplay is sound, the memory tampering mechanics are great (though there are only 4 of these ""remixes"" in the game) and the combat system requires the player to think a little which is not a bad thing. It plays like ""Tomb raider"" meets ""Deus Ex: human revolution"", but it's lacking in environmental interaction, which doesn't alleviate the feeling of being on rails.Who is this game for? Mainly for science-fiction fans. Some of the dialogues could have been better, and there are a few questions left unanswered at the end of the story, but the plot would make a better movie than 90% of the current holywood blockbusters.And if you're french or would like to see a vision of Paris in the future, it's the perfect game. The art is beautiful, even stunning, and the atmosphere at some moment is enthralling. The cutscenes blend seamlessly in the game, and make the cinematics all the more engaging.			"

												Tl;DR - beautiful game with medicore gameplay, very good setting and a pretty good story. Overall 7/10.Those are the 4 elements I'll be writing about. Let's start with what this game surprised me the most - the visuals. Art direction in this game is astounding. The colors, light, graffities, models, all tell the story of the Neo-Paris. Despite the fact that the assets themselves are not really good quality (not bad either though, especially considering it was a previous gen game) the game still has a lot of wow moments and it's all thanks to a very smart and beautiful usage of the listed elements.That, alongside multiple dialogues, fluff announcments audible in the background and notes found as collectibles creates a very detailed, believable and scary vision of the late 21st century. However, the world was not used correctly, in my opinion. Personally I wish we'd spend more time on the streets of the city, watching how the people live, what problems they have etc. We've only heared or read about the world (which again, was done very well), but almost never saw it, spending most of the time in some labs/prisons etc. That was one of my big issues with the game, lots of wasted potential there.Learning about the world and seeing the beautiful environment was what kept me playing most of the time, as the rest was rather obvious from the start.Story set in this world is not as good as it could be. It's full of cliche solutions, lacks any choice and sometimes it's hard to emphasise with main character's actions. The story itself lacked something more inventive, unusual.Finaly - gameplay. Most of the game is split into 2 sections - Batman-esque fights and exploration. Both aspects are done poorly. There's very few enemies and most of them are more or less the same. Instead of introducing new, more complicated opponents, at later stages the game becomes more difficult just by throwing in more enemies. It clearly tried to go full Batman, but failed (also, it gets boring at this point too). Combo system associated with the combat also felt lackluster. By the time I've finished the game I had 3 full combos and 1 unfinished one. Instead of building a database of my combos that I could use as I see fit, depending on the situation, in the end I just built 2 universal ones that I used all the time, depending if I needed utility (most of the time) or damage (rather rarely). Exploration left some to be desired as well - you can only climb the very specific objects that the game allows you to, so pretty much if you can climb something - you should. It was done similarly to Enslaved: Odyssey to the west, where you just moved the stick, pressed the jump button and watch your character perform animations. No room to fail, no challange, no threat. Just a filler.The unique gameplay element, that also has to be mentioned, was the memory rewriting. Sounds very cool and about half of the time it was, but the other half, at least to me, felt rather unlogical. The solution to the problem felt random, which led to continous rewinding just to try another, sensless combination. Additionaly it lacked a functionality that would improve the system in general (not the unlogical sections, though) - ability to quickly jump to identified memory glitches and changing them much faster that way.In the end I still recommend this game, a bit. It's not great, but it's good. It has increadibly well done elements, some pretty good ones and if you don't bounce off the medicore ones, you might still have fun.			"

												Remember Me is one of those titles I would never have gotten around to play if it wasn't for a grand sale.If I had to give it a score I would rate it 7/10Pros:+ Strong female lead with a great character development+ Great character development for other characters despite the short time you act around and with them+ Easy to master combat+ Great story+ Some nice plot twists here and there+ Beautiful enviroment+ Good voice acting+ A nice feeling of progression (new combos, unlocks and different ""Mini games"" that come along when you progress)+ Lots of different gameplay (Again, lots of ""mini games"")+ Tons of checkpoints+ Super useful collectables+ Combat craftingCons:- Super linear- Easy to master combat- No options to change outcome and story of the game- Only one ending- Not nearly enough time spent with other characters at all- Repititive combat- Took me 12 hours to finish (2.25 euros pr. hour if full price was paid)- A few easily forgetable characters (because they didn't get enough time to develop and be a part of the story)- A ton of checkpoints- Bad camera angles at times (Annoyed me at max 3-4 times)The list of cons might sound large, but the biggest and almost three only flaws for me would be how linear it is, no choises and the lack of ""socialising"" with other characters to devolop their storyI would recommend this for anyone who likes an excellent story, a beautiful enviroment and a great main character and can you live with no choises and just give in to a linear story and gameplay this is definetly something for you.If you do though want a massive amount of great combat, you should probably skip this one.If you still wanna try it while being a little sceptical, get it on a sale, but the game is definetly worth it for its story.NOTE: Play on the hardest diffculty, the normal and easy are both super easy, escpecially with the amount of checkpoints in the game.

												This game is better played with a gamepad.     For any cyberpunk lover ""Remember Me"" is a must-play. A world it presents is vivid, full of life, believable. The game is linear, but many locations I've been to looked amazing. Every object and entity looked like it was carefully incorporated into this world. The futuristic Neo-Paris could serve as an excellent background for an RPG (ah, if only). Though the story goes really fast,  I coldn't help but stop for a minute or two and take a good look around at the commoners, the dutiful valets, the beautiful landscape.     The combat system is really simple once you get the hang of it. The customizeable combos you create are quite simple to remember but not that easy to do once you're in a crowd of enemies. I sometimes cursed the lack of lock-on but overall it's not needed. Some fights take much longer than they should because attacking multiple enemies at a time is quite difficult. Performing a healing combo correctly can be vital at times, due to Elite Enforcers' ability to constantly damage you when they're hit, for example.     As for protagonist, our little slim smartie Nilin, she really kicks♥♥♥♥♥ She mistakenly seems fragile, but she can climb walls like Lara Croft and fight like Neo. A really adorable girl that has the ability to remix and steal memories. That's what the story revolves around: the great invention of the 21st century which can help rebuilding the world ravaged by war, or destroy it.The design, the animations and the visuals of the game are really amazing, but it could be so much better. A few levels are utterly boring (almost the entire Bastille). There are only four ""memory remixing"" episodes. And last is the combat which is spectacular but a little flawed, sometimes repetitive and tedious (I, for instance, have died about 20 times when fighting two Leapers that stole Trace's memory).If you're still in doubt, get this game on sale. It is really worth playing once. If you cope with the few flaws it has, it presents a great movie-like experience.			"

												Remember Me is a mixed package. You have some good, you have some meh. Overall, though, I would absolutely suggest it to anyone who fancies science fiction (particularly post-cyberpunk), mysteries and just plain old thrillers. Everyone talks about the memory remixes, so I am going to skip those in this review. Really, they are fantastic exposition and they are all truly heartwrenching, and messing with the outcomes yields both achievement and wistful ponderings about what could have been achieved with them. The remixes are a neat mechanic, but they are few and serve as little more than getting to know a major character's background better before the story continues rolling along.The game has got a lot going for it in the presentation department. The graphics and animations are wonderful to behold, and the world of Neo Paris is a sensational delight. Everywhere you look you see details lovingly ingrained into the surroundings. The game has no doubt about its settings or its style, and very rarely does a game deliver fully on its concept art, but Remember Me is one of those that does so and doesn't look back. Some of the boss fights have the most exhilerating visuals in gaming from 2013. And the soundtrack? The soundtrack ebbs with dark rhythms and soaring, mournful orchestral bits. The best pieces, however, blend the two into a single thrilling, heart-pumping thread.The combat is fluid and features combo sets that you create from individual moves—kicks or punches—that you unlock as the game goes on. You can build for sustaining yourself by using regeneration pressens ('pressen' is just the game's terminology for 'move'), or strength by using power pressens. In the end you'll have, I think, five combo sets to tinker with and customize, each one longer than the last. Getting the timing down so that you're flowing from one combo to the next without a break is immensely satisfying and almost a bit like a rhythm action game, except you're getting pressure from incoming attacks and special enemies as well. Boss fights are interesting, with phases and gimmicks, and they will keep you engaged. However, if you fail a QTE during the coup d'grace phase, you will have to go back to the regular boss fight phase until you manage to nail down that QTE. A minor nuisance, or major depending on how one feels about QTEs in general.The story itself, however, is the reason you will enjoy this game. The main character, Nilin, is a memory hunter—a criminal hacker who specializes in stealing people's memories through the digitizing implant known as a Sensen. Sensen technology has basically rewritten the rules of the world because now, people could actually opt into amnesia and get rid of their painful memories, preserve their favorites as if they were video clips, and share subjective experiences with others. which itself could usher in a new age of empathy. But Sensen in turn is also applicable in truly horrific ways, which is why the Errorist movement exists—they wish for an end to Memorize and its Sensen technology. The story involves both the quest to end Memorize and its peripheral agencies' abuses, and a personal side in which Nilin seeks to rediscover the person she actually was. When you join Nilin, she has zero recollection of her past, and herein is her personal motive for fighting forward. The endgame is truly riveting, and I would recommend this game for that alone.However, I must now get to the downsides, that mixed bag I mentioned earlier. Targeting in combat can get hairy when there are many targets on screen, and you will rarely ever fight just one. All I have to say is good luck hitting the guy you intended on hitting, as there is no indicator of who Nilin is targeting at any given moment.The platforming is super linear; you will not get the chance to explore often, and even if you do it is for scarce more than 20 feet down a different hallway or alleyway. Those who intend on collecting every collectible are further warned that the game loves to shut down backtracking by making it impossible, so it would be wise to take it slow if you intend on getting every bit of lore and power up. Overall, it makes you wonder why they even bothered with giving Nilin the ability to climb and jump all over the environment when the ways you can go are essentially predetermined with context-sensitive hints.Speaking of hints, there is no way to turn them off. Even at the highest difficulty, you will be assailed with constant handholding. This is by far my biggest complaint about the game, that and the linear exploration.For me this is a give-or-take, but cutscenes. There are a lot of them. If you dislike your gameplay frequently getting interrupted for a bit of exposition, prepare to be annoyed. It is nowhere near the level of Metal Gear Solid 4, with its behemoth 30-minute minimovies, but some of them can run a bit on the long side. For me, I was so eager to see what came next that it rarely bothered me.In conclusion, I deem Remember Me a flawed gem—a truly rare and personal story that also rewards on every level with its art direction and fabulous orchestral-electronic soundtrack, brought down by flawed controls, a lazy camera, and little replayability. I happily recommend this game to lovers of cyberpunk, slick, stylish combat; and existential horror whenever it's in the $10-15 range.			"

												Remember Me is an exciting and immersive fighting game set in the sci-fi world of NeoParis. The campaign should take anywhere from 8-10 hours and is broken into 8 episodes. Each episode generally brings new, more difficult enemies along with some fantastic top of the line scenery. Seriously, one of the best features of this game is its environment. It's absolutely beautiful.The game's story is fullfilling as well. Despite what others may say, the story is captivating and emotional. You can feel the main character's pain, Nilin, as she attempts to cope with relearning all her past actions as a memory hunter. You'll finish each episode yearning to know what happens next.The combat is crisp and rewarding, and plays similarly to Batman. The variety of pressens available - aka the types of combat moves (power, regen, cooldown, and chain) - add variety to the combat system. On top of that, each combat move is unique so you can customize your combo bars in which ever manner pleases you most.There are also S-Pressens, which are special power moves on a cooldown. These allow you to activate powerful abilities that will come in very handy during boss fights or other tough situations. There are 5 unique S-Pressens that come with their own special effects and purpose throughout the game.I would highly recommend this game to any gamer who enjoy a story centric campaign with fighting elements.

												This game is like that cousin that you like, and you think he or she is cool, then after hanging out with them one time you just hope tha it never happens again, not in this life at least.A game that values replayability yet it doesnt allow you to cut scenes. how the ♥♥♥♥ does that work?If u will buy this game to play it casually or for the story then go ahead.  but if you are seeking those sweet acheivments then you better have tons of patience. The story is okay. nothing special.The gameplay however is more linear than albert junior's 8 inch♥♥♥♥♥♥of steel trapped between 2 flat steel beams. they say its about customization and free will. that every person will be different. NOPE.  hop on the train cause you aint going anywhere where the tracks arent going to.I was about to replay the game for those acheivments but then i was faced with the failure of the developers to add a skip scene function. it is like the developers themselves didnt even bother playing the game two times  to check it for bugs or something.  only reward you get for replayability is unlocking skills and scheivments and maybe collecting items you missed in the first walk through. still recommended for the concept tho, I did have fun playing in the first walk through but as soon i hit that ""no skip"" cut scene, i nuked alt+F4 right away and i hit that uninstall button.

It is comparable with Spec Ops: the line, which is great in its own way, but kind of confining, if you are used to walk around and explore the scene.			"

												Okay, so I've had this game on my wishlist for a long time.  I was very interested in the dystopian future setting of the game, but kind of turned off by some of the negative reviews. I picked this game up for 9.99 on sale, and I'll be completely honest:  It was well worth it.The story was a little confusing at first, but hey.  The chick lost her memory, so it is relevant.  Eventually it started making sense, and although this game is kind of old, the graphics and setting were very  immersive.  I think this game would have been worth the full price, and I dont say that often.Overall, very cool setting, story is pretty decent, and the combo lab and memory remix scenes were great.  I mean, there were some great scene in the game.  Almost like a movie at some points.  The ending was great story-wise, and there were a bunch of plot twists leading up to it.  The final boss fight was a little bit of a letdown ( I think I was jsut expecting something more) but the story at the end makes up for it.  I would give this game a 8/10.  Strong points:The combo labMemory remix featurePuzzlesGreat atmosphereThe topic of memory manipulation is extremely unique in the game world, and I this title really stands out for thatThe game falls short in a few areas though:Fights become a TINY bit repeitiveSome bosses are recycled throughout the gameVery few graphics options I could list more pros and cons, but honestly, pick this game up.  Especially if you see if on sale.  Worth the playthrough, and I will be doing it again on the hardest difficulty.  The setting of a Neo-Paris and the theme of memory manipulation is definitely unique and was a breath of fresh air.  Overall a great Port to pc: No bugs/glitches/errors, No framerate issues, and the controls are fine (don't listen to the negative reviews about controls, those people are probably just mongoloids).8/10  Would force a man to commit suicide again			"

												Pros:+ Great artstyle/aesthetics+ Storywise this is one of the most interesting games I have played recently+ Memory remixes are interesting but very scarce 4 in totalCons:- In theory being able to customize your own combo moves with every punch/kick sounds great, however the combos are simple and there are few moves which can't be accessed without getting enough xp- Combat is boring and repetitive due to the combo system being lacklusterSidenote:The game is very linear and scripted which some people might not like.

												Remember Me is a pretty good action game, but the true ingenuity of Nilin's journey throughout Neo-Paris is how well the universe, story and main character comes together to form a cohesive and interesting game. Thus I ended up finishing the game in a single sitting, and despite the amount of linearity and somewhat lackluster combat, it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience.			"

												One Of Capcom's Best Games In Recent Memory Looks Great Graphics On My GTX 670, Excellent Story, Combat Is Above Average For A Beat'em Up, Hardly Any FPS Drops Besides When Coming Out Of A Cutscene. This Is A Must Buy For Around $10 or less. Hopefully Capcom Makes A Part 2			"

												Okay, so I've had this game on my wishlist for a long time.  I was very interested in the dystopian future setting of the game, but kind of turned off by some of the negative reviews. I picked this game up for 9.99 on sale, and I'll be completely honest:  It was well worth it.The story was a little confusing at first, but hey.  The chick lost her memory, so it is relevant.  Eventually it started making sense, and although this game is kind of old, the graphics and setting were very  immersive.  I think this game would have been worth the full price, and I dont say that often.Overall, very cool setting, story is pretty decent, and the combo lab and memory remix scenes were great.  I mean, there were some great scene in the game.  Almost like a movie at some points.  The ending was great story-wise, and there were a bunch of plot twists leading up to it.  The final boss fight was a little bit of a letdown ( I think I was jsut expecting something more) but the story at the end makes up for it.  I would give this game a 8/10.  Strong points:The combo labMemory remix featurePuzzlesGreat atmosphereThe topic of memory manipulation is extremely unique in the game world, and I this title really stands out for thatThe game falls short in a few areas though:Fights become a TINY bit repeitiveSome bosses are recycled throughout the gameVery few graphics options I could list more pros and cons, but honestly, pick this game up.  Especially if you see if on sale.  Worth the playthrough, and I will be doing it again on the hardest difficulty.  The setting of a Neo-Paris and the theme of memory manipulation is definitely unique and was a breath of fresh air.  Overall a great Port to pc: No bugs/glitches/errors, No framerate issues, and the controls are fine (don't listen to the negative reviews about controls, those people are probably just mongoloids).8/10  Would force a man to commit suicide again			"

												While some may argue that this is a prime example of what's wrong with the gaming industry today; High linearity, countless of cutscenes and handholding. Its world building, atmosphere and story should not go overlooked.While this game markets itself as an action adventure, which it is to some extent, i think you'd be better off coming in with the perspective of somebody who likes ""walking simulators"" and adventure games. Because if you do, you're in for a real treat.Fortunately i am such a person and i enjoyed Remember Me immensly, the gameplay isn't unbearable, just generic. What appealed to me the most was as previously mentioned, the story, atmosphere and world building. And how amazing it is indeed, everything comes together so nicely, the futuristic art direction, the glitchy orchestral score, the scenes, the pacing. If you're into cyberpunk this is absolutely and essential to add to your collection.The main 'issue' with this game i think is that it exceeds in all aspects except gameplay, and whether or not that matters to you is something you will have to ask yourself.

												This game is really have good arts and good soundtrack! even for the story is good too.if you like the action game that you can remix your style a little bit. You're coming in the right way about this game. This game is totally an action game combine with a little bit of strategy. You can mix up a little about your combo effect. You can go with real power to crush your enemy or you want to get some buff to support you to survive longer.maybe not much combo for using but mixing them quit effect the battle a lot. you wanna fight to get special move or fight directly with your combat skill is your choice. Some type of enemy can't attack normally like other dude but that's your job to find the way to finish them.Story of this game is great. (personally, I play Life is Strange before played this game) It will confuse and annoy you at first. But it will going to be fun after that. Some part of this game have a clue to think about. It's quite good for thinking practice. if you stuck it's okay to have a hint that help you to get through. But in fact. You must have been stuck for a long time first. ( for me it's the good point to make people stop and using there brain a little)Graphic quit great. I like the way shader do in this game. Reflection, Noise grain theme in neo-Technology is quit really the good concept. I always like the floating HUD around in this game. It's seems to be really the kind of what it should be like in the future. it make me really want to see this in real life and feel like it can be true to have it in nearly days.at last. Don't forget the music. One word : AWESOME![Pros] :- Good combat mixing style. Choose what it should be like for your style.- Repeatable game, you can replay this game for more detail like extra artwork or the story and stuff detail.- Artworks and Graphic are unique. Quit really good quality piece of work.- AWESOME soundtrack. I believe you don't want to miss this.[Cons] :- Camera angle that can't adjust and dizzy 3rd person camera angle.- Rain and water reflection still not quit good in optimization.- a little bit short for a story. But not that disappointed.For now. This game is really one of the good game that should play if you like the quality of work over the game play.			"

												This game was really great when I played it on PS3. Truly a game that simply needs a controller for me to enjoy it. This port doesn't have controller support though. That's a lie. I have tried it with countless controllers but it keeps recognizing two controllers at a time even though there is only one device that can be classed as a controller plugged in. Tried quite a few fixes from around the web but none have worked. I have also tried deleting and reinstalling and nothing works. Real shame.			"

												Why have I never heard of this game before?In case you are looking for a singleplayer actiongame without any openworld stuff an some few puzzles, that are somewhat complex, this game has it.Additionally there are no control issues, asides the ranged weapon targeting can be tricky, and not as many glitches as you are used to nowadays. I only got stuck in a corpse once, and that's it.The enemies are really annoying and the combat system, with its complexity and variability is one of the most challenging I know of so far. At long last, the atmosphere is just brilliant, and the idea of Human Memory Organization via computer controlled implants is just as ineteresting as the memorable soundtrack.Will play again for sure!

												I played the game two times from the start to the end and have unlocked all achievements. At the end I will recommend this game but it has some major flaws. Here are my pros and cons about this game:PROS:- marvelous scenes and overall graphics (reminds me of Bladerunner)- fresh uncommon and well told story- nice mini-games (rewriting the past)- perfectly playable with mouse and keyboard- good but not outstanding fighting mechanics- overall a piece of artCONS:- totally linear and feels like being imprisoned- to many gameplay interruptions when telling the story- camera take-over by the game is very annoying- not very challenging even at the hardest mode- no replay value at allIf you won't like to miss the uniqueness and art this game has to offer and are willingly to pay for a one time trip, you should definitively buy and play this game. It is comparable with Spec Ops: the line, which is great in its own way, but kind of confining, if you are used to walk around and explore the scene.			"

												The Good:- An imaginative and well realised setting- Fluid combat, ala Batman- Nice visuals, enhanced by clever stylisation- Excellent soundtrackThe Mediocre:- A limited number of cards to play regarding content, you fight, you climb, and you get to mess with people's memory a handful of times- Lack of emphasis on storytelling and characterisation makes the game's ""big moments"" lack emotional impact- Upgrade system is too limited to sustain interest- Having to continually re-configure combos is frustratingThe Bad:- Completely linear. Once you've played the 8 - 10 hour campaign, there's nothing to draw you back.The Verdict:A good game that could have been great. With a longer, non linear structure, a more robust upgrade system, and a little more time on the story, Remember Me could have been great. Still, hats off to the development team. As it stands, it's a worthwhile game, that's worth picking up if on sale.			"

												Remember Me is a game with a high grade of immersion, interesting storyline and the character, level and everything else is very nicely animated.I would love if you could alter some more memories. Something like more random persons on the street have memories to alter and you can bring them to do something helpful for you, but only as an alternative way.Fazit: I would buy it again and i will play it again. I would recommend it to people who like stuff like cyberpunk.			"

												Take Uncharteds climbing sections, Batman Arkham Asylum brawling, pack em into Mirrors Edge aesthetics and you get a damn good game. If you dont know these games (pff) basically you climb alot and hit alot of dudes and mutants and robots and it all looks very pretty.Theres a twist in that theres on the surface just kick, punch and evade buttons but these are freely ""configurable"" (Godhand is that you in there too?). You unlock different ""blank"" combo strings by game progression which can be filled with attacks of different attributes like damage or healing (among others) unlocked by earned XP Points. For example the first string you get is three slots with three blank kicks - you could fill these with a damage kick, healing and another damage or all damage or all healing. Theres longer strings with varying kick and punch slots and other attributes and those are divided into kicks and punches as well but thats the basics of it. Gives quite abit of depth to what would otherwise be just buttonmashing.Its very linear but the environment and map design is quite varied so thats never that noticeable. Gamepad a must prolly.Since its prominently mentioned on the store page, the ""Memory Remix"" is fun sequences where you can mess around with stuff but theyre really a very minor part of the whole game.Great game, recommended			"

												Remember Me is a pretty good action game, but the true ingenuity of Nilin's journey throughout Neo-Paris is how well the universe, story and main character comes together to form a cohesive and interesting game. Thus I ended up finishing the game in a single sitting, and despite the amount of linearity and somewhat lackluster combat, it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience.			"

												Extremely underrated and under reviewed, Remember Me is a truly amazing piece of science fiction. The combat feels like it was pulled from a bad 90s action game, levels are linear, and it has a slew of other problems. That being said it still stands up as a great game because of the world everything takes place in, memory remixes, and music. There are few goo science fiction story based games these days and if you want to see more pick up a copy.			"

												DONTNOD did a fantastic job on this game. The concept is great, and I love the multifaceted game mechanics. The combat is sometimes frustrating, but I found myself actually enjoying attempting to hit combos by the end. The story is engaging and reflective of the human condition, and I enjoyed the game from start to finish. I wish however, that it had been more open-world, and that they had expanded a little more. The more open world vibe of 2013 Tomb Raider would have suited this game so well. Only complaint is that I wanted more. I was engrossed in the world.That being said, excellent music, voice acting, graphics and a wide array of enemies to keep you on your toes. DEFINITELY worth picking up.			"

A wonderfully-realized version of future Paris, original characters, a beautifully-orchestrated musical score, a tale that begs you to think of things intellectually.This game is as much a challenege to one's thinking as it is to one's dexterity.

												One of the best art direction I've seen in a video game. When I say art direction, I include graphics, sound and writing.- graphics: Neo Paris is stunning. Backgrounds are full of details. Architectural styles merge in both an organic and a fantastic way. Character models are not the main appeal of the game, but they're at least original.- sound: Music always feel adequate, and enhance the experience. It seems more like sound design than melody : it reacts to what your character is doing, action has its own music. Besides, environmental sounds are well thought and full of details (ie. you hear flies buzzing around)- writing: The world is coherent and overall well thought despite the quite unoriginal evil megacorp. Characters are well documented, they have their own agenda and believable motivations. As for the story elements, well, they managed to avoid many clichés. The plot isn't needlessly ambitious and ties the fate of the main character to the overall plot. It ends up more as a personnal journey than anything else and somehow managed to move me at times.As for Gameplay, well, it sure could be better, but it has many merits. The game tries to be many things: an innovative beat'em up, a beautiful exploration game and a classical adventure one. Despite some new and original ideas, Remember Me never excel in any of this style of gameplay. But the whole is better than the sum of its parts. In conclusion, I'd recommend this game either to aesthetes looking for an original setting or to open-minded gamers looking for a fresh twist in a classical gameplay.			"

												Funny story on how this game came to me. For my brothers birthday a few years ago I was in JB Hi-Fi looking for something to get him. I saw this game, thought he would enjoy it and bought it. On his Birthday I gave it to him and to say the least, he seemed pretty intrigued. I think at the time It wasn't particularly new (or at least not really heard of) so the both of us were a little curious. He played the game, finished it and then said that he liked it but thought combat was a little boring. So I asked if I could give it a go, and he let me. Nek minnut I was up all night playing the game on his computer. Of course, I couldn't keep playing it on his computer because he wanted to use it. And since he activated it on his steam I couldn't play it on my computer (at the time I don't think sharing was enabled) so I left the game mostly unfinished. Until now! Now, the game is one of my favourites of all time, I think it's diverse, unique and refreshing to play for someone casual like me. I like playing things casually, but the game also has some puzzle to it too. I like parkour and I have to admit, I like a female protaganist.This game will launch you into the future of France, set in Neo-Paris. The game's unique aspects tie into Storyline, Setting and the Character (plus some gameplay aspects)The Game utilises Parkour in which our heroine uses to get around Paris. She has a very special ability that enables you to do very special things such as changing peoples futures  The game is very visual heavy, relying and competently giving a beautiful and well thought out Level design. Allowing the Player to interact with the environment and exploring it, the game introduces the Player to new aspects just by simply letting the player play the game. Just how a game should teach you.The combat system is a little repetitive, this is why I prefer to play on Easy. If you play on any other difficulty then killing the enemies will result in massive boredom. Basically in battles all you do is jump around, dodge, hit, do a custom combo and jump around some more. The combo system is nice, can be a little hard to memorise but their customisability is nice. If you play on easy you can still have a little bit of difficulty with the enemies but not to the point where you're missing the story and losing interest in the game. So don't be fooled by the name of the difficulty.Anyway, the game's a worthy buy in my opinion. The storyline is like an M. Night Shymalan movie, the twist at the end is like top tier. I think there's also some Michael Bay worthy explosions too.Anyway, if you like a diverse female protaganist with a strong punch and agile lifestyle *cough* Mirrors Edge *cough*Then you'll like this game!

												This game has a very unique concept and storyline that catches your attention right away.                 The story line is fantastic and will take you on many turns of emotion. You follow the main character Nilin through her journey of self discovery. Luckily, it's not nearly as boring as it sounds.           The special ""Remix"" mechanic that is the signature of the game, used to rewrite people's memories, always makes a huge impact on the story when used. I'm glad the ""Remix"" mechanic isn't used in every chapter of the game, as it adds to the significance of the plot. However, be prepared because due to the game being a PC port and not originally intended for PC use it can seem clunky or overall impossible to use until you get accustomed to preforming the action with a mouse.           The combat is overall simple, using predetermined combos that are unlocked as the game progresses. Some of the battles seem to be drawn out, lasting longer than needed and requiring you to save up ""Focus"" to use the same special moves in order to progress in battle. This causes many of the bigger battles to be a little grind intensive. Also, many of the boss battles end with quick-time events so be ready for anything. The actions are predetermined, but don't give you a particularly long time to preform them.          There are also a couple riddles thrown in there as well, adding to the variety of the game. You spend a decent amount of time swinging from building to building, ledge to ledge, which also helps break up the monotony of battle. TL;DR      -Great Story, Unique Idea     -Badass female lead, wicked good voice actress w/ accent     -""Remix"" memories, watch out for funny mouse antics     -Easy to grasp battle system, monotonous battles sometimes     -Riddles and Scaling walls/Hopping fences 9/10, so worth.

												The button-mashing gameplay is what takes its toll on patience but thankfully its not the primary focus. Its not necessarily the action that makes it a great game but the personality that radiates from it. From the environments and the music, to the story and the characters, even the background lore that is uncovered by finding clues throughout the areas all come together to make a fantastic and engrossing game. The weakest aspect IS the fighting: the combo system gets tired by the third chapter and sadly it never adds anything new besides punches and kicks. No weapons, just fist and feet. As you fill up the combo bar, shown on the bottom of the screen, each hit can replenish health, add damage, and reduce the time between Sensen abilities; player-activated special moves that induce major damage for a short time. The story advances in leaps and bounds during the memory manipulation puzzles. These parts are a way to slow the game down from all the ledge-hanging and button-mashing and its impossible to really fail these moments.The graphics are fantastic and Neo-Paris *feels* alive and real. From the first moment you see the skyscrapers rising through an alleyway you get a sense that most of the care was put towards the details. Even the latter chapters that take place inside the technology-laden government buildings have been crafted and no one place feels repeated The music is both orchestral and techno blended together which elevates during fights and gives depth to the surroundings even when just standing around. The voiceacting is superb and never sounds phoned in. There aren't many ambient sounds, though, since most of the effort was put towards the music. Nilin is a great character and never comes off as two-dimensional: she's haunted by her forgotten past and plagued by the actions of the present. The secondary character's personalities feel alive but there are only a few of them. The rest of the world is populated by enemies of varying difficulty and its sometimes a chore to have to stop and beat up a few of them only to traverse to the next area to do the same. Boss battles don't really vary it up either with predictable patterns and repetitive dialogue but thankfully only occur at the ends of chapters.Its main focus is on telling the story and it succeeds in doing so. It only falters with the fighting. If you hate games that show and not tell then its simply not for you. As far as value goes, you probably won't find all the lore and collectibles in the first playthrough but its definitely worth it to try a harder difficulty level next time.			"

												Not sure why this game got poor reviews when it first came out. Solid story, great action, decent mechanics even if they seem a little familiar and graphics that still look good by today's standards. If you like the fight mechanics of Batman: Arkham, the fun but unrealistic climbing/jumping mechanics of the Uncharted series, unlocking and creating your own fight combos in a unique, well thought out environment similar to Mirrors Edge then this is right up your alley.It may seem like a button mashing fest at first but there were times when I knew I needed a faster way to regain health during a tough fight and I could rearrange my combos to assist. Pretty clever and handled well. I don't feel it's worth full price ($30 when writing this) but definitely worth the $5 I bought it for during a holiday sale.			"

												Remember Me is an enjoyable game, although not quite what I expected. The interesting memory remixing concept is actually a very small part of the game. Most of the gameplay is a Batman style brawler, where you can create combos that heal you, generate energy for special moves, or do extra damage. These combos can be adjusted at any time depending on how you want to approach a particular fight, and this flexibility creates good tactical depth. There are also some Tomb Raider style climbing sections, but they are rendered kinda pointless by constant waypoint markers holding your hand. The 9 hours long story is strong, it certainly made me think about the morality of manipulating memories if this technology existed in real life. Voice acting is good, but at the same time its disappointing that, in a game set in Paris, nobody speaks with a French accent. Controls are fully rebindable and work well with mouse and kb, but there are occasional framerate issues. Definitely work checking out.			"

Good adventureWhilest browsing through my library I was looking for something unique to feast my attention on. My eyes fastened upon 'Rememeber Me', third person action adventure game developed by DONTNOD Entertainment (the same guys who developed 'Life is Strange). You play as Nilin, a memeory hunter who has (ironically) has amnesia and is on a journey to not only save Paris from a corrupt corporation, but to discover the truth about her identity. The Good- Unique setting = Set in Paris in the year 2084, society has advanced to the stage where robots are common throughout everyday life and peoples' memorise can be altered and therefore, commercialised.- Great visuals- Good cutscenes- Good voiceacting- Good audio- Decent story - Although there were plot holes here and there, I though the story was good at moving the game forward.- Collectables - Unlock artworks, intel, 3d models and health and energy upgrades.- Wide range of enemies- Fast combat = Reminiscent with Batman Arkham games except without the gadgets or counters.- Customisable combos- Unlockable abiilities = Unlocked as you progress in the story, such abilities include : increase combat speed, invisibility and taking control of robots.The Bad- Poor camera = Get annoying during cambat as it isn't positioned high enough to show the entire arena like batman.- Not much to do outside story- Poor save system = Saves are done automtically. Health stations are basically save points but are never indicated to player. Checkpoints don't save the game after you close the application down and play again, so you lose progress.- Poor navigation indicator = A tiny arrow is a bit too small to see and may make you get lost in levels easier.- Tacked on stealth segments  - Annoying boss fights = Mainly due to the quick time events, but also because some bosses bring their 'friends' along as well.- Quick time events = Mainly in bossfights where you have to press the correct sequences to win or else you are forced to reduce the boss's health again. Also a few of the button prompts aren't clear either so you are forced to go check your key bindings to see what to press.- Combat may get stale after a while = The problem is that although you can customise your attack combos, your moves are generally the same through out the game 9witht he exception of your abolities)- Few bugs = There were rare moments where enemies would become invincible (when they shouldn't be) and when your character gets stuck in the environement.FinaleOverall 'Remember Me' was a good action-adventure game with few issues here and there that prevented it from being perfect.

												I expected a game like this from Square Enix.It's that good, and a new favorite.I would compare it to Batman with a story like Life is Strange, that mingles with Dues Ex. (My son describes it as Devil May Cry and Mirror's Edge)Pros+Story is intriguing, flowing, well acted, and likeable. AI grows in difficulty, with awesome complexity, adding a move that actually strips focus and resets skill timers.Gameplay is somewhat similar to other action games with climbing, treasure hunting, and skill combo.*I think Capcom really has something here, with a new approach to combat* ( Cooldowns, healing, and power mixed in, that can interchange into a 3, 5, and 6 hit combo )The price on most sales is by far worth the price.Cons-I use a 940m notebook video card not capable of running at max settings.Playing with higher settings, there is some minor / major stuttering, but happens no matter how low. Level designs are sometimes better/worse on FPS, as well as certain parts (a few) of the story being unoriginal.( Example - The Leaky Brain is demolished, similar to DMC 3)Didn't like not having an alternate memory choice for Chapter -Remix Forlan's Memory DONTNOD YOU DID AN EXCELLENT JOB ON THIS ONE, AND CAPCOM DEFINITLY HELPED.

												Background: Not many games let me tool around in Neo-Paris.Combat Mechanics: Remember Me combines a Combo system with a small selection of Special Abilities in the middle of a linear storyline. Combat happens 99% on a flat plane with a few aerial enemies that you have to deal with with a single ability you receive early on in the story.  Personally combat began to bore me as the Combo system slows down combat so enemies are constantly changing speeds just due to how the system works.Memory Mechanics: Normally Social Mechanics but the only real social interaction you have beyond your contact named Edge via commlink is memory rewriting to change people's memories. These interactions are mostly Linear but has some variance but still creates the same solution overall. Random Fanboy Note: The voice of the main character is the same actor that voices Tracer in Overwatch.Final Thoughts: This game is one of those cool nerdy gems that you find in the store nowadays for $10. Although the story is cliche and made me almost quit half way though it is an emotional thrill ride that wants you to keep playing. I just hope you do.			"

												Remember me is the kind of fighting game, that if you're not into fighting games, you just might want to make an exception for this one. Remember me is a fighting game with a lot of RPG elements in it - so much, actually, that a lot of players have critisized it for being too linear, forgetting it's true nature. It's a visual masterpiece IF you're into visual beauty but then again it's just one aspect that makes this game as awsome as it is. Some parts of the level design does feel like a rip-off from other games, for example the beginning totally looks like Dishonored and Bastille looks like Citadel form Half-Life 2 but instead of holding it against them, I felt happy to rediscover those places in another context. I agree with the overall consensus that the main character is one of the key elements, that make this game what it is. We have a female protagonist, racially diverse AND with a compelling history. She fights like a badass and makes tough descisions throughout the game. It's one of my all time favorites. Below are pros and cons:Pros:+ Incredibly beautiful cityscape (reminds the movie Fifth Element).+ Supreme level design.+ Interesting futuristic story.+ Interesting character build and choices she has to face.+ Customizable fighting combos.+ Really useful powers/ abilities.+ Visually the fighting sequences are a masterpiece.+ Tactical approach to battles.+ Build your own combos.+ Supreme dodging mechanics that make battles dynamic, rapid and visually marvellous.+ Apart from many other players, I actually liked the QTE endings of boss battles, that gave a meaning to the cinematic killmoves.Cons:- One gamebreaking bug in the worst place imaginable - right after a boss battle, forcing you to replay the lengthy fight.- Main character's face should have been modelled, textured and animated better since you see it so often in the game.

												I'll do this in bulletpoints and delve into details with each.The Good Interesting scenario. Its 2084 in Neo-Paris and the technological giant Memorize (seemingly) controls all facets of society through its massive influence gained by pioneering memory-related technologies.  Creative design choices in art and stylistic direction. Since this is the future everything is holograms, and since everyone has a chip in their mind then gameplay prompts and messages can be incorporated into the game through holograms in an unobtrusive manner that makes sense. It's really unique and keeps the UI as minimalistic as possible There's also a ton of graffiti in the city that looks cool. Original game mechanics in the mind sequences whereby you alter past memories by changing things in the environment to lead to a different conclusion. You'll see a cutscene play out, then prompted with a task which is carried out by rewinding and fast forwarding the scene and changing various little things in it that lead to a different conclusion. So you might close a cup holder or move a table slightly; these small changes lead to a logical change in outcome that is always interesting to see. Sadly, there's only 4 of these sequences, but what's there is still good.The Bad Interesting scenario that is barely touched.Just as with Mirror's Edge, the game has this interesting scenario that feels as if it hasn't been fully taken advantage of. You have a future world where memories have been digitized and there is apparently vast disparity between rich and poor, but the game is about you helping a resistance movement wreak havoc on the city. It's difficult to really understand what exactly has led to societal disparity to such extremes since it's never fully delved intoAll we know is that these rich people have it well off and this other area looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥ The megacorporation Memorize, which has pioneered digitized memories, is a multinational monolith that is propped up as evil, but what exactly is so evil about societal progress isn't explained. It's as if the idea of the overworld exists, but why it exists as it does and the problems underlying it are never delved into. You're just supposed to look at the sh*t areas and think, ''wow, Memorize sucks, it's somehow their fault cause rich people amirite feel the bern''. Even one of the civilians during the chaos asks why you did this to them from their windows, and....nothing comes of it. I'm standing there thinking, ''yeah, why are you doing this again?''. Sh*t even the protagonists asks herself this but doesn't persue the train of thought. Ultimately its a personal story about the protagonist recovering her memories, and it seems like the idea behind the rebellion is just a plot device rather than having any significance. Linearity without challenge. There's nothing wrong with a linear game, but there IS an issue if the linearity makes the game too easy. My problem with this game isn't that you're essentially going down a winding corridor, it's that there's no challenge while you're doing so. Since you just have to press A to do all actions, and since you're following a small prompt that tells you what ledges to get on and off of (and since they're the ONLY ledges you can get on anyway), all you're doing for the majority of the game is pressing A in the right direction. Sure, it looks nice as the scenery unfolds and the camera changes angles, but halfway towards the game that was no longer enough to keep me entertained. You can have linear platforming (Megaman, Sonic) without being overwhelmingly easy. The game might as well play itself.And now for the in-between:The Fight system. It's pretty much the Arkham battle system: you press a button (X or Y) to keep a combo going and have to dodge enemy attacks in the middle of combos. Where it sets itself apart is in three ways:-There are four pre-set combos. XXY, XYYXYY, YXYXY, and one other that I never used.-Customization comes in using keys (unlocked by gaining experience) to unlock one of 4 types of nodes. There's power nodes (increased damage), chain nodes (increases damage of all previous nodes), health nodes (health restored), and time nodes (lowers cooldowns of special moves). In order to use a combo, it has to have a node in it. So you can't just press XXY, X needs to be a node, as does the other X and Y. So combos can have different effects depending on the nodes used.-There are 5 special moves unlocked as the game progresses that have cooldowns once used. Some are instrumental to fighting particular types of enemies.It's pretty interesting, but the lack of complexity shows itself midway through the game as you'll most likely settle on one combo for pure damage, one for health restoration, and one to decrease cooldowns. There's variety in enemies that keeps the fights somewhat interesting and requires slight alterations in fights, but it's nothing that can hide the simplicity in the mechanics themselves. In the end, you'll be pressing the same combo in fights and switching to health restoration when necessary.Overall I'd say the game is....alright. The scenario could've had something grander in it, but it settles on being a personal message about the protagonist's own life that I didn't care for. It's difficult for me to fully appreciate a twist when the other character involved in the twist was just introduced and only talked about 5 minutes prior. Shrug.This isn't a downvote cause the game is bad; it isn't. It's just overall underwhelming and really nothing special. Its mind sequences are pretty interesting but there are only 4 of them, and the platforming is following a prompt telling you what ledge to jump on and pressing A with a few fights in-between. It's not bad, it's just not worth it and slightly disappointing. Was fun halfway through, until I stopped caring as much and just wanted to get to the end. "

												Quick Summary: Third Person Action game in a semi-dystopian world with intriguing story, but some buggy gameplay. The combat is mostly hand to hand with a simplified “combo” system where you alternate between punches and kicks. Overall it’s a fun game and makes you think about the benefits and drawbacks of memory manipulation.You play Nilin, a “memory hunter” in a world where technology now allows the storage and deletion of human memories. Unlike the “Total Recall” movies, the technology can’t really make up new memories and implant them into people. Instead, it’s possible to selectively delete memories and/or remove them from people and give them to someone else. As a memory hunter, Nilin is able to do a whole lot of unusual things such as steal passwords from a person’s mind, “remix” memories, and use cyber power attacks in combat.The game is mostly linear with a lot of free climbing like Assassin’s Creed or Tomb Raider games, and the combat is similar to the brawling in the Batman Arkham games or Sleeping Dogs. However unlike Batman, Nilin doesn’t “counter” attacks, only dodge. Also, note that unlike the Arkham games the reaction time is shorter (You pretty much have to dodge as soon as you see an attack warning). The combo system I mentioned earlier is based around unlocking punches and kicks as you “level up.”  These attacks can be chained into 3, 5, 6, or 8 hit combos which do increasing damage as they get longer. This is why the short reaction time to enemy attacks is so annoying (they keep interrupting combos).  Other special powers you can unlock throughout the story are Fury (short term damage boost), DOS (area effect stun), Logic Bomb (area affect damage) along with a couple others. Pros:+A unique and complex world with a thought provoking story line.+The boss battles are interesting because of cyber manipulation of virtual worlds based around memories.+The “memory remix” sections of the game let you view and make subtle changes to a person’s memory, with the overall effect of making them remember things that never happened. It’s like the butterfly effect in action, tiny changes can change the outcome in drastic ways.Cons:-The game has some noticeable bugs, like the sound suddenly cutting out, or not being able to aim your spammer “gun” at various points in the game.-The combat system is really annoying when you’re surrounded by enemies and can’t get a combo going because everyone keeps attacking. In the Batman games, the enemies usually attack one at a time (or you can use a multi-takedown). In Remember Me, you have to dodge and start your combo over.You probably have Remember Me from the Humble Bundle last year so don’t be afraid to give it a shot.			"

												I just finished this game.  Steam has me clocked in at 11 hours.  11 hours of pure awesome if you ask me.  I went in not knowing what to expect.  And loved every minute of it.First off I'll talk about the combat since thats one of the things people have a hard time enjoying about the game.  At first glance it looks like an Arkham game with the freeflow.  This is a mistake.  Its nothing like it at all.  Take everything Batman taught you about fighting and forget all about it.  This is far too different to even have that comparison.  Once you remove that the combat becomes more enjoyable.  Not to say its great.  The combat was the weakest part of the game but it was still fun IMO.There is climbing that is pretty much completely ripped from Uncharted.  Which is fine.  Why fix what ain't broke?Memory remixing.  The most unique gameplay element about this game is sadly lacking.  In a short game like this I can understand having only a handful but they give you just enough to make you want more.  Its lacking in depth.  Just find the glitches in the memory and activate them and find the right ones to change the memory.  And the game wastes no time telling you exactly what the memory should be changed to kinda removing the mystery.Finally the story.  This is where the game truly shines.  Its one of the most compelling stories in a game I've experienced in a while.  The premise is kinda scary.  Memories can be tampered with even stolen and the results are not good.  Hey a video game protaganist with amnesia and there's a very good reason for it for once lol.  With a few good plot twists it was a real treat going through this story.What makes me love the game so much is the little details.  Early in the game there are camera shots establishing a nice view of the city.  Finding the little bits of info on the world and history was also a treat.  And Nillin is another great female character. Dontnod built a really cool world here and even if a sequel is very unlikely I am happy to have visited it.			"

												This is a really good cyberpunk game (and there are not too much of them) but somehow I got the feeling that with more love from the editor and more polish this game would have reached its full potential which is a 10/10. As it is now I would rate it 8/10.The good:- a well written story in the line of the best cyberpunk litterature you can find: things looks simple at first with the Big Evil corporation that is enslaving the world, but things get quickly more subtle and deeper. - the universe is well thought and beautifully designed: there are some cut scenes à-la Blade Runner which are really breathtaking. There are lots of small details, references and puns that gives credibility to the story.- the voice acting and the music.- the Memory remix is a great idea and fun to play. I wish there was more of it.- the powers you acquire through your initiatic journey are really cool: conceptually and visually.The so-so:- I really liked the platformer part since I enjoyed games like Prince or Persia, but highlighting the path takes away all the challenge. There should have been an option to remove the hints.- the combo lab is really a great idea, unfortunately it's one of those ideas that didn't reached its full potential. I ended up spamming the same combo of 5 moves because it just works. I would have expected the choices to be more tactical.The bad:- the combat system is quickly boring and even annoying at times. The options are too limited: dodge or attack. Nilin can't pary or counter attack. So the fights are very repetitive and consists of dodging until you can land a combo without being interrupted, or start dodging again if you are about to be hit during a combo.- it's too short and linear. First playthrough on Errorist level took me only 12 hours, even when trying to find collectibles.  There are too many questions left unanswered that would have deserved side quests to extend the game time.			"

												Set in the late 21st century, after a corporation known as Memorize has turned Paris into a dystopian metropolis living off positive memories and forgetting the negative ones, you play as Nilin; a memory hunter with the ability to alter specific events in peoples lives or make them forget altogether the truth.The game itself is pretty basic. You run, you platform and you fight. There's a ""gun"" you get early in the game called the Spammer, that lets you shoot at and stun, or sometimes kill, enemies. But for the most part, it's a fighting game and a pretty alright one at that. There's not much to say aside from that. The gameplay is standard without anything revolutionary.The setting, however, is interesting, and Memorize is an impressive antagonist. You get to see a lot of Neo-Paris, too. From the dirty slums, to the sewers, to the tallest penthouses and the Memorize headquarters. And there's a great variety in the environments. The richer areas of the city are clearly rather sterile and have robots working to take care of people. The poorer areas are dirty and cluttered with decals and small objects, giving you a sense of the attention the developers put into them.All in all? Pretty fun game. Worth a fiver or a tenner if you're in doubt.			"

												The art desing in Remember Me is so gorgeous, it just might kill you.I'm serious, that's how my dad died. He looked at St-Michel, with its jaw droppingly beautiful classic parisian architecture being merged with the thematically disparate aestetics of the game's futuristic setting so perfectly that the two styles essentially came togheter to form one miraculous masterpiece of artistic design, and it brought him to tears. In the end, he cried so much, he ended up dying of dehydration.You have been warned.			"

												Wow...... just wow. Long time since I played a game and I said ""Okay I stop now cause it is too good I don't want to finish it so fast....""This is definitely one of those games that just makes you sit in front of it eagerly to see what is going to happen cause damn it is so interesting.... the story just sucked me in and gripped on me....... the athmosphere is amazing so are the soundtracks landscapes and the fighting aswell. The bossfights are cool almost each has something new. So much to say, but I don't want to make you bored if you spare time to read this, so I  try to be short.Overall there is no problem with this game everything just fits it really good the character became one of my favourite tho I did not finish the game yet. Maybe some little detail will change by then but definitely not my opinion about the game overall.But ... nothing is perfect. On  the other hand it has some tiny issues. I rarely had some camera bug (maybe cause of the pc port or I dunno...) but sometimes I just turned the screen with mouse and boom stuck in wall no idea where the heck I am. O.O But it barely happened so it is forgetable. Lets see what else is here.... well yeah what I really did not like in the beginning is when the quick time events pop up the buttons are unique... I mean for instance the left mouse button is  for kicking and in the quick time event it shows a leg. At first I had no idea what the hell is the game asking me to do so I had to check the buttons in options.... it is not really something negative just if they really cared they could have make better signs for players like an actual mouse with a glowing right button like in other games as we got used to it. But okay this did not ruin anything in 2-5 mins you can get used to it. The most annoying was the lack of freedom. We have to stick to the storyline and there is no chance exploring Neo-Paris that really disappointed me cause it looks BEAUTIFUL. (okay not everything like the sewer is really not a fancy place xD) But seing the Eiffel Tower in game... lights on. (I never been in Paris and only saw pictures) it was amazing and I loved it.Well since I can't think of anything bad but a bunch of good things... I guess this is the end of my review cause I really don't want to run throught the game and everything I loved or at least liked a bit in it.... it would really become a novel xD.(note: I will edit it when I finished the game but I know that will happen in a month... cause I really don't want to finish it xD I love it <3)But so far if I had to rate it with all the amazing things and the tiny issuesTo me : 10/10			"

												[Game completed in 13 hours.  Not all collectibles, and not a speedrun.]I'll start out by saying I really wanted to like this game.  The concept is great and original, and some of the core ideas are solid.  Unfortunately, the execution is deeply flawed.  Even though I got this on sale for 1/3 its normal price, I do not feel I got my money's worth.  Much of the hype/marketing is incorrect, so I'll address each point as advertised below:Speculative, Stunning Vision of the Future - delivers pretty well here, but for some reason, the writing/plot just seems barebones to me.  You get a few lines of exposition, then punch 87 guys in the face, and then repeat.Play as Nilin - um...  yup, you do.  As to stealing memories to progress, you really only do this 7-8 times in the whole game.  So, true on this point, but not optimal.Memory Remix - total marketing oversell.  This is used literally 4 times in the entire game.  When it is used, it's actually a pretty cool idea that's executed well.  Using it so sparingly seems like a waste of a brilliant game mechanic.A balanced mix of combat and exploration - Ummm...  no.  There is no real exploration, first.  There are a series of highly linear levels, each with 1-2 small side rooms with a hidden collectible each.  The platforming is not terrible, but the controls seem very loose.  Then the combat...  BUTTON MASHING REPEATEDLY.  On a PC, it is actually less annoying with a gamepad than mouse/keyboard (shudder).  However, one nice thing is the God of War-esque ability to dodge/abort in the middle of an attack.  That is very cool and works well.  But, my god, the BUTTON MASHING...Combo Lab - customizing combos is cool, as is the ability to change them up mid-fight.  Literally at any point, you can switch up combos, even in mid-attack!  But, your combos are fixed to punches or kicks per slot, and all you change is whether the hit does extra damage, regen, resets cooldown timers, or chains/multiples the previous effect.  So, this is a high point of the game.So overall, just a so-so execution of some brilliant ideas.  A darn shame really, as this could have been something special.  Imagine a Deus Ex level of alternative options and exploration.  Oh well, I suppose this was 13 hours that were not *that* badly spent. "

												I'm not sure why so many people didn't like this game; while not the greatest ever, it is a really enjoyable game with a unique story and features.  Sure, its very linear; but not every game has to be open-world.  Games with a strong narrative, such as Remember Me, would not work very well as an open-world game (the devs would have to impose annoying restrictions on where you go in the open-world anyway to enforce any kind of narrative).  So, if you're looking for GTA or something, this isn't for you.  That said, the story is very compelling: you are a memory hunter whose memories have been stolen in a future-parisian city where memories can be traded, bought, and sold.  The gameplay reminds me of something like Uncharted or Tomb Raider where you have to climb around, jumping and hanging from ledges.  The fighting, which can get a little repetitive is like a not-as-good version of the fighting from the Batman: Arkham Asylum games with some sci-fi elements thrown in.  However, the memory remix sequences were some of my favorite parts and something truly unique to Remember Me.  Basically, you can scroll through someone's memory and make tiny alterations to change how they remember what happened; for example, you can turn the safety off on their gun and move a stool slightly, causing them to trip on the stool and the gun to accidentally fire, shooting someone else.  The soundtrack is also really amazing; I sometimes listen to it while working.  Graphically, the game is pretty impressive, especially the remix sequences and other memory areas, which are very stylized; especially when you use 3x1 Eyefinity :)My only complaint with the game is that the fighting can get a little repetitive.

												Okay, so a friend requested that I actually put some thought into my review of this game, and I was like... alright?I am nearly done with it, going through to collect missed stuff...Look, I am not gonna waste your time beating around the bush, the controls and fighting system are so effing bad.  I really do not like the combat in this title, which is a shame, as that is a majority of your gameplay.The graphics are ...okayish, I am not big on who has the flashiest styles, so I don't care, but you might.  It is built on a dated engine, but it performed well.So with combat and graphics out of the way, let's talk about the camera...Rather, let us recall the days of camera locks and auto follows that kill you.  That is where we are at here, absolutely malfunctive camera, I died a lot due to falls caused by unwanted camera movement and it is also locked at times so that you cannot position it how you would want to see. Combined with the controls and you find death happening quite a lot if you don't watch out.Okay, so camera, controls, combat... all suck, graphics are okayish... WHY SHOULD YOU BUY THIS GAME?Well, honestly... the voice acting is pretty bad too... but the story is good, cliche at times but there is a lot of interesting stuff to think about after playing, or while playing.I don't think this game was intended to be a blockbuster hit, but they did do a good enough job to interest me in their ideas and story.  The things they invisioned for the future of many technologies being worked on or existing today.  I think that their AR was an interesting way to show several of my friends what AR publishers want to do for us. (all that HUD type info)If you see it on sale for 5 dollars or so, I would say it is worth about that.			"

												Remember Me is set in future Paris in a world where Memories are digitized and people able to erase or even change them. First impressions are very good. The artdesign, various landmarks in Paris, all affected by this futuristic setting, is incredible, accompanied by a fantastic musical score that combines orchestral instruments with digitized effects. 


YouTube™ Video: Remember Me OST Soundtrack - The Fight

			Disclaimer: All content belongs to its respective parties, no infringement intended. Olivier Deriviere did an amazing job w/ this soundtrack.		

 If theres one award Remember Me deserved in 2013 it's definitely Best Soundtrack.Since the world of Neo-Paris has banished firearms, the game evolves around punching dudes and avoiding getting punched. It is very reminiscent of God Hand on the Playstation 2. You create your own combos and by executing them well you earn bonuses like reducing cooldowns on your skills or healing yourself. In theory nice, but it is sadly very poorly executed. While in the early stages of the game the combat is kinda fun and has a good pace to it, especially towards the later parts of the game they throw way too many enemies at you. The lockon system is not very good so you end up hitting the wrong guy a lot and disrupting your combo. In the last third a lot of new enemy types are introduced that are very anti-fun and make the combat boring and tedious.I really liked the various ways the theme of amnesia is implemented into the game, not just music and fighting, for example they make you memorize screenshots of locations where collectibles can be found minutes before you actually get to that spot. The ""memory remixing"" minigames are really well done and even serve as narrative platforms, I wish there would have been more though.I still recommend Remember Me for its very interesting world. The story carries it a lot too, albeit some poor voice acting and dialogue it convinces with a strong beginning and a memorable ending. It's a shame that the gameplay is forgettable.			"

												One of the best games I've played in a while. The combat can get a bit samey and tedious toward the end because of certain enemies that require you to use attacks with long cooldowns and mobs of smaller enemies interrupting your combos, but that's really my only complaint. It's a unique concept, striking visuals, a good story with a few holes. I strongly recommend it.			"

												While it may not be the most revolutionary when it comes to gameplay otherwise, the REMIX scenes are immensely fantastic, and one of my few complaints is that there weren't ENOUGH of them. At a scant 4 scenes in the game, I feel the game under-utilized what could have been one of it's most fantastic mechanics.The rest of the gameplay was fun, even though not very innovative.Story was a B+, but still very enjoyable; and, there were several moments that I felt very emotionally attached to the game.The best feature of this game is the absolutely fantastic score by Olivier Deriviere (who previously worked on Alone in the Dark 2005's score). An artful and amazing blending of electronica and orchestral makes this another hit soundtrack and on my top 10 playlists.			"

												I've barely played three hours and I have to tell you now. At first I was disappointed. I was expecting a Memory Puzzle focused game, its definately more a combat focused game, however.. what it does. It does exceedingly well. The Leapers and their kin, can be terrifying in the right (or wrong) light, the references between Memories and the digital effects in the game, even the combat based music that plays (the better the combo the more flourished the background audio).And thats before I've even touched on any plot. If you can find this cheaper than £30: GET IT. For £30 though I would suggest you look into what Remember is beyond the initial trailers.			"

												Okay, so a friend requested that I actually put some thought into my review of this game, and I was like... alright?I am nearly done with it, going through to collect missed stuff...Look, I am not gonna waste your time beating around the bush, the controls and fighting system are so effing bad.  I really do not like the combat in this title, which is a shame, as that is a majority of your gameplay.The graphics are ...okayish, I am not big on who has the flashiest styles, so I don't care, but you might.  It is built on a dated engine, but it performed well.So with combat and graphics out of the way, let's talk about the camera...Rather, let us recall the days of camera locks and auto follows that kill you.  That is where we are at here, absolutely malfunctive camera, I died a lot due to falls caused by unwanted camera movement and it is also locked at times so that you cannot position it how you would want to see. Combined with the controls and you find death happening quite a lot if you don't watch out.Okay, so camera, controls, combat... all suck, graphics are okayish... WHY SHOULD YOU BUY THIS GAME?Well, honestly... the voice acting is pretty bad too... but the story is good, cliche at times but there is a lot of interesting stuff to think about after playing, or while playing.I don't think this game was intended to be a blockbuster hit, but they did do a good enough job to interest me in their ideas and story.  The things they invisioned for the future of many technologies being worked on or existing today.  I think that their AR was an interesting way to show several of my friends what AR publishers want to do for us. (all that HUD type info)If you see it on sale for 5 dollars or so, I would say it is worth about that.			"

												[Game completed in 13 hours.  Not all collectibles, and not a speedrun.]I'll start out by saying I really wanted to like this game.  The concept is great and original, and some of the core ideas are solid.  Unfortunately, the execution is deeply flawed.  Even though I got this on sale for 1/3 its normal price, I do not feel I got my money's worth.  Much of the hype/marketing is incorrect, so I'll address each point as advertised below:Speculative, Stunning Vision of the Future - delivers pretty well here, but for some reason, the writing/plot just seems barebones to me.  You get a few lines of exposition, then punch 87 guys in the face, and then repeat.Play as Nilin - um...  yup, you do.  As to stealing memories to progress, you really only do this 7-8 times in the whole game.  So, true on this point, but not optimal.Memory Remix - total marketing oversell.  This is used literally 4 times in the entire game.  When it is used, it's actually a pretty cool idea that's executed well.  Using it so sparingly seems like a waste of a brilliant game mechanic.A balanced mix of combat and exploration - Ummm...  no.  There is no real exploration, first.  There are a series of highly linear levels, each with 1-2 small side rooms with a hidden collectible each.  The platforming is not terrible, but the controls seem very loose.  Then the combat...  BUTTON MASHING REPEATEDLY.  On a PC, it is actually less annoying with a gamepad than mouse/keyboard (shudder).  However, one nice thing is the God of War-esque ability to dodge/abort in the middle of an attack.  That is very cool and works well.  But, my god, the BUTTON MASHING...Combo Lab - customizing combos is cool, as is the ability to change them up mid-fight.  Literally at any point, you can switch up combos, even in mid-attack!  But, your combos are fixed to punches or kicks per slot, and all you change is whether the hit does extra damage, regen, resets cooldown timers, or chains/multiples the previous effect.  So, this is a high point of the game.So overall, just a so-so execution of some brilliant ideas.  A darn shame really, as this could have been something special.  Imagine a Deus Ex level of alternative options and exploration.  Oh well, I suppose this was 13 hours that were not *that* badly spent. "

												Wow...... just wow. Long time since I played a game and I said ""Okay I stop now cause it is too good I don't want to finish it so fast....""This is definitely one of those games that just makes you sit in front of it eagerly to see what is going to happen cause damn it is so interesting.... the story just sucked me in and gripped on me....... the athmosphere is amazing so are the soundtracks landscapes and the fighting aswell. The bossfights are cool almost each has something new. So much to say, but I don't want to make you bored if you spare time to read this, so I  try to be short.Overall there is no problem with this game everything just fits it really good the character became one of my favourite tho I did not finish the game yet. Maybe some little detail will change by then but definitely not my opinion about the game overall.But ... nothing is perfect. On  the other hand it has some tiny issues. I rarely had some camera bug (maybe cause of the pc port or I dunno...) but sometimes I just turned the screen with mouse and boom stuck in wall no idea where the heck I am. O.O But it barely happened so it is forgetable. Lets see what else is here.... well yeah what I really did not like in the beginning is when the quick time events pop up the buttons are unique... I mean for instance the left mouse button is  for kicking and in the quick time event it shows a leg. At first I had no idea what the hell is the game asking me to do so I had to check the buttons in options.... it is not really something negative just if they really cared they could have make better signs for players like an actual mouse with a glowing right button like in other games as we got used to it. But okay this did not ruin anything in 2-5 mins you can get used to it. The most annoying was the lack of freedom. We have to stick to the storyline and there is no chance exploring Neo-Paris that really disappointed me cause it looks BEAUTIFUL. (okay not everything like the sewer is really not a fancy place xD) But seing the Eiffel Tower in game... lights on. (I never been in Paris and only saw pictures) it was amazing and I loved it.Well since I can't think of anything bad but a bunch of good things... I guess this is the end of my review cause I really don't want to run throught the game and everything I loved or at least liked a bit in it.... it would really become a novel xD.(note: I will edit it when I finished the game but I know that will happen in a month... cause I really don't want to finish it xD I love it <3)But so far if I had to rate it with all the amazing things and the tiny issuesTo me : 10/10			"

												Could have been such a great game if it wasn't so hellbent on being a movie.With every ounce of gameplay you get to experience you can feel the deep resentment of the creative direction for the fact that they didn't get to make a movie. Having to settle for something they consider a lesser medium where the player gets in the way of telling a story. Gameplay and story are divided and kept on two different planes, one for the player, one for the composers to tell their story. That disconnect that the fact that nothing important ever happens when the player is in control is where the game failed to utterly and disappointingly.The game tells a nice little sci-fi story that has great idea no depth but a neatly fleshed out world around it. All in all it's not worth watching a million little cut scenes, non needed, to play mediocrely implemented Arkam-style combat.			"

												I really don't see why this got so much hate, it's really not a bad game at all. The worst thing they had was the combat but even that wasn't too bad (on Memory Hunter difficulty anyway). The combo creation system, although being basic, was still fun as hell to use although it could have maybe let you choose the buttons you'd press. The story is fantastic and the setting/graphics are both incredibly beautiful. I haven't tried playing with a keyboard and mouse but this game feels like it was made for a controller anyway, so I'd recommend one if you haven't picked one up already.Overall I love this game to pieces and I'm determined to get this to completion 100% - 9/10			"

												Do i like this !? - Ofc i do. This game i waited so much time... when it was about to come out. The fighting system is good, but the combo`s could`ve been better. I mean the healing it`s not that supreme at the begining of the game you are so easy to be killed by the enemy.At least you can shout from a distance, that`s kindà cool. And yet the game isn`t that easy as it seems. Way much different that i had expected. It needs brain -> strategy + to be aware of the numbers of enemies and always dodge their atacks. When they surround you .. you cannot even hit them, cause they`ll always stop you from doing atacks. Yeah yeah... you have skill that flashes them or stuns them for a while, but the cooldown is really big, and you cannot use both skills - like freeze them and use your punch arm.  The story is really interesting. Once i started this game than i stopped it, don`t know why... - maybe too much raging on some missions  .. just kiddin` .Anyway this game deserves 10/10 - Graphics are really good, story line is interesting - various ways to defeat enemies - like for example more defensive and wait for time to use skills or just fight them and dodge non stop almost, which is kindà not cool. Hmmm it`s good that you cannot jump - i mean die while you do the climbing because she isn`t goin  to jump when there is no shown spot to do it - which is really great. She is a really good climber. The sounds are great tho. Nilin is always communicating with the others. You can always guess the ways which you must go or you should go. Too bad it isn`t open world to get all the stuffs you didn`t collect, but hey who cares - it`s your choice.You should get this game if you are interested in that kind of fighting system. Also that female story is great - because she is "" God of Destruction "" . Can get so much information from the others and even kill them, at least some of them. You are a real "" Mind Reading Hunter "" - Killer for example, cause there are many bad guys.I think that`s all i can say. Oh and yeah enemies to be easy !? - That`s not even true. It always depends on how you fight them. Improve your skills than fight them again.			"

I understand that they were trying to do a music flow type system but it just didn't work and having to unlock combo chains was a waste. I was glad I got this on sale for like 2 dollars. If I had bought this at full price I would have been ticked. If you wanna give it a go wait for a steam sale or rent it for console if you can find it. Just don't pay for price. It requires multipule runs to get full achievements so its not even worth that.			"

												One of the best games that came out that year, People need to be dumb and underrate this game when they haven't played it.Here is the deal, very interesting background story. Speaking from a person who have completed the game, this game feels has if the devs have merged many other games in the past into one. For example, it feels like i am using street fighter moves, with customization to your combo so it is not as repeditive, another it feels like mirror's edge, god of war, etc. Wonderful cinematics, the soundtrack throughout the whole game is amazing, along with the interface very simple and easy to understand and the sound as you move through the options plays a beat that blends right into the music. This game primary objective is allow the player to concentertate only on one goal and that goal is to get right into the main story, unlike other games where there are so much things to do, you tend to stray off the path of the main story. This game also includes puzzles and riddles so it make the game very interesting if you are one of those players that like to have some brain teasers every now and then. Giving it 9/10			"

												This is my first review on steam ever, and I want to write it about this amazing game. It is as playing through your favorite sci-fi book or film interactive. Visuals, colors and the whole neo-paris concept is great. Remixing memories is awesome!I am not into fighting games, but I feel this one is really fun. I don't think it is repetitive. It is well balanced, and linear gameplay is really important for the story. The sandbox fever of nowadays would destroy it. I think people, who cannot see more than that are missing the real heart of this game. This game is unique, fun, it will surprise you many times, give you a lot of ""wow"" moments and when you play through it, your heart will cry out for more.If you cannot go deep with a story, maybe this game is not for you. But if you like a good story, some action, a bit of climbing around, a complex and well-imagined world, and need something unique, do not hesitate then. You will like this game.I want to thank the developers, and please: give us more quality games like this one! "

												This is my first review on steam ever, and I want to write it about this amazing game. It is as playing through your favorite sci-fi book or film interactive. Visuals, colors and the whole neo-paris concept is great. Remixing memories is awesome!I am not into fighting games, but I feel this one is really fun. I don't think it is repetitive. It is well balanced, and linear gameplay is really important for the story. The sandbox fever of nowadays would destroy it. I think people, who cannot see more than that are missing the real heart of this game. This game is unique, fun, it will surprise you many times, give you a lot of ""wow"" moments and when you play through it, your heart will cry out for more.If you cannot go deep with a story, maybe this game is not for you. But if you like a good story, some action, a bit of climbing around, a complex and well-imagined world, and need something unique, do not hesitate then. You will like this game.I want to thank the developers, and please: give us more quality games like this one! "

												I have to say I really enjoyed the story - yes the delivery was contrived at times, and sometimes the dialogue or the delivery was cringe-worthy, and I got a few of the twists before the end, but seriously, for a game (and remembering that 98% of game stories are utter claptrap) this had some great concepts and for the most part nicely executed.  It was emotive, and when you summarise the story I think it's pretty cool.  Of course it's not a novel quality story, find me one game (aside from the first Deus Ex) that actually delivers that.  I don't think the story is completely the ""regular cliche story"" - there are archetypes for ""journey"" models that are pretty much the staple of computer games through time immemorial, hero, discovery, realisation, gaining power etc.  But I think this had a little more to offer.  When I was thinking through the story in retrospect it did haunt me a little.  I would love to see a sequel, as all the faults that people mention (ie boring combat, sub par exploration etc) are all pretty valid, however it's just one of those games where if you go into it with no expectations, will take you on a great ride.  As an aside I would love to have Richard Morgan tunring this into a novel, that would kill. :)			"

												This game seems to have a fairly interesting story, but having spent about an hour navigating a bunch of parkour and playing wtih an inferior batman combat system I am only left with one impression: Really bad camera.  The camera seemed to need constant adjusting and never followed me the way I wanted.  Not only that, it followed WAY too closely so I could barely see anything past my character's body.  I cannot recommend this game as a result.			"

												For sure I will remember this game!--------------------------------------Before I bought it, I looked for some reviews of this game on inumerous sites and, even with an average score, I decided to give it a try.All right, this is not an open world game, it won't take more than 5~6 hours to finish it and the story is linear.But, what's the matter about playing a linear story? A book is linear, a movie is linear, can't a good game be it too?Even that you can't move freely through it, the environment is rich in details, the story is well narrated and the protagonist is so captivating that you want to discover her past and help her cause. For so many times I just relaxed and started to take screenshots to remember the places and the action scenes.The combat system is quite fun. While you advance in the game, you can mix buttons to create COMBOS and easily execute them. But, this is not the BATMAN ARKHAM SERIES combat system, so you CAN'T have a free flow between enemies and link the created combos. So don't expect huge combos like DEVIL MAY CRY for example.The Memory Remix is quite a piece of art. You really feel like you are in command. You can and you will modify people's memories to change history. And it's so easy and fun, that it invites you to try different combinations just to see what happens.If you're not a big fan of Achievements, just let the game take you through the story. I started to look for colectibles like an Achievement Hunter and soon the game became boring. So I just started to play the game despite of looking for trophies and it was a much better experience.So, to summarize it:Nice story, great soundtrack, captivating protagonist, amazing memory remix moments and everything placed on a beautifull, yet limited, fantasy world.Play it, you sure will remember.

												This is an enjoyable story-based action game. Set in an artistically brilliant futuristic Paris, the story follows Nilin, a woman robbed of her memories.The combat is enjoyable enough and the S-Pressens system gives it enough variety to be fun without being excessively complicated. Sometimes it can feel a little repetitive, but only moderately so. The game is very linear: this bothers some people more than others, but for me it wasn't a big problem.The game's strength, though, is the story and memory remixing.  The plot and storytelling together are sufficent to make this a great game.			"

												I'll be honest, at first I didn't really know what to think of this game. The fighting system is fairly original, but not very well executed. The environments look pretty, but are one-way only. However, if you're sci-fi fan this game really shines at it's story telling and artistic design. It's the story that kept me going until the end, and I'm really glad I didn't give up early on like I was tempted to.I'd say you'd only want to play through this once, but its well worth picking up next time it's on sale.

												First I am not the best at this type of game. At 64 my eye-hand reflexes aren't what they used to be. With that said my impression so far.  The story line is very thought out and interesting.  Cut scenes are amazing and the graphics set the atmosphere.Combat is a little tricky for me but very fluid and animations awesome. The location of the combo marker is horrible I just never see it appear on the screen. Maybe I am missing some hotkey not sure. The mouse in some situations doesn't work well, an example of is the memory rewind.Ok with this said I am happy and will continue playing.			"

												The controls are terrible for the computer, the story is predictable and quickly gets boring, and the memory editing controls are straight up broken. This game might be better on console (or with a controller for your PC) but for mouse/keyboard gaming it is not worth the trouble at all. The campaign is simply 6 hours of x/y mashing with a unrewarding ending to boot.			"

												If you want a cinematic experience in your game, this is a pretty good choice.  The art direction in this one is incredible.  The gameplay though...most of it is combat which is extremely similar to Batman: Arkham Asylum, only watered down.  If you want to feel like an action hero, this is a poor choice, but if you want a satisfying story with amazing environments, you found your game.  Overall, remember to pick it up if it is on sale.

												So much great potential wasted with scrub tier mistakes. GOOD-Story-World Building-Writing(its a good story but not told so well)-Combat combo system is neat and fun to mess with-Dodging mechanic thats fast intuitive and fun-Same Devs as Life is Strange though this is though Capcom and LiS is though Square Enix. BAD-Control (which destroys everything else)Movement is tied not to the mouse just the camera is. So you often find yourself walking or going in a direction you dont want to or getting stuck in a corner somehwhere because movement is based on your characters orientaton not the cameras. Targeting sucks because of this as well. Its pretty much the root of every issue that comes up in the game and ruins immersion. -QTE. Nuff said. Its not so punishing if you mess it up and its not RNG each time either. So its not so terrible but its still QTE.-Repetitive boss quotes. There isnt even a delay between when they are said, its literally the same 2-3 quotes on loop. Prepare to hear the same line 6-7 times in 30 seconds. Not even kidding.-Recycled content. Fight the same boss over again with no changes. Feels like padded gameplay-No mechanic to stop you from just walking off a ledge to your death. Your character freely falls off any ledge to previous area you parkor'd up from or to your death. This + poor character control = no fun.TL:DR I love the game and the idea. Shame it was let down with poor implimentation. Save your money and buy Life is Strange instead. Same devs MUCH MUCH better game. <3			"

												To put it short and sweet: The combat is lame. You get some skills unlocked, build a combo, and spam it with either Left or Right mouse button. It's basically batman arkarm knight combat, you know? See an enemy exclamation mark and hit a button to dodge, only to spam your attack button again to commit the same combo once more? Yeah, that's what you have in store for every enemy encounter, making it nothing special EVERY SINGLE FIGHT. You follow a linear route the entire game with barely any exploration. The story is a little dry, at first leaving you intreguied by what it may offer only to have it be a bit generic if you have played games with similar themes. Amnesia for main heroes is nothing new imo. As for graphics, they're well done for a 2013 title. The enviorments looks pretty good, but as I stated, you can't explore this interesting scenery, you're left to follow the beaten path. If you buy this game on sale like I did it may be worth it. So far I'd say for more than 5-6 bucks that I got it for, it wouldn't be worth a penny more.			"

												This is the first game I've ever taken the time to write a negative review about. It is TERRIBLE. TERRIBLE!!! Before I start my rant, it looks really good (not top-notch, but good), the combat mechanic is unique and interesting, and the customizable combos are really refreshing in a game like this. Now then... The story is predictable, the combat is X/Y mashing (Xbox controller), and the BEST thing about this game, the combo combat mechanic, is completely ruined if you're fighting more than one enemy at any given time. The combos don't keep long enough for you to dodge and hit again, and if you accidently target any other enemy and hit them instead, the combo is lost. Like I said, it is the best IDEA in the whole game, but it's also by faaaaar it's biggest and most highly annoying downside.  The Elite Enforcers I just button mash heal combos on them because there's no other consistently-viable way to beat them, and again, the combo is ruined if you're hit once, meaning you're lucky to get a 3-4 combo, NEVER the 7 (or whatever it is) big one that is ""so great."" At certain points of the game, I've gritted my teeth whispering under my breath ""just finish the game, then you can uninstall it and never touch it again."" I am on the EASIEST difficulty. If I were to try to play the hardest, my computer would probably be thrown out the window.  Every boss fight is AGONY!!! The first one with the boxing-match type deal wasn't that bad. Another one was a lady teleporting around and you just had to beat on guys (that do not even give xp when killed...) until you can use your DOS ability to hit her a few times. Rinse and repeat. A lot. Same goes for the twin uglies, the Greenteeth ugly, and I'm sure plenty of other bosses I can't recollect. And I remember one ""boss fight"" was just running from a ship that was shooting at you..? How is that a boss fight..?  There were minor bugs too, but not too bad. However, there was one that made me scream. Fighting the twin uglies that killed airship-dude, I killed them, the minions were still alive, and whatshisface started talking in my ear so i couldn't fight, dodge, or anything except walk EXTREMELY slowly until A. he was done talking or B. I'm dead and have to start the annoying boss fight all over again. Take one guess which happened to me... Had almost the same happen to me with the Greenteeth ugly, where everything was dead, but nothing triggered, so I had to restart the checkpoint and do it again. SO fun.  Also, all the cutscenes, talk-n-walk sessions, all unskippable. Even if you've saved and quit to play another day. Even if a TnW queues (cues?) happens at a respawn point and you have to listen to it EVERY TIME YOU DIE. Which is made far, far worse when the platforming is horrendous. Why put a bright orange arrow where I'm NOT supposed to go? Why make me die if I land on a floor too soon, even if that's exactly where I AM supposed to go? Why have I missed a jump half a dozen times, where she slides down a wall instead of grabbing onto it like the markers says she's supposed to? All the while having to rewatch a cutscene/listen to a TnW every time this happens. For a $60 game, all these things are nigh-unforgiveable. I'd rather swallow some stranger's spit than subject myself to this infuriating garbage again, and no, I'm not kidding.If you don't want to read all of that mess, Imma simply name the game what it should've been called in the first place: ""Wait for Cooldowns: THE GAME"" ......Can you at least see WHY I'm not recommending this game..? It's horrid.			"

												-It has a good balance between story and gameplay. -Immersive story but without much freedom of choice. -In my opinion you can't really attach to the main character (or any in a particular way), probably mainly because her initial memory loss, but this doesn't mean it doesn't become emotional at some certain points (I weeped a bit at some parts). -The concepts of the story are quite intriguing, fascinating and captivating, the memory mix is one of the most interesting aspects.-The cinematic effects are quite nice, adding to the futuristic ambiance.-It has nice transitions from chaos to peace and vice versa.-Despite having ""glitches video effects"" te game still has some actual glitches, for example after following some memories, the color would be stuck on an annoying reddish tint until restarting the chapter or going several rooms until a cutscene.-I think it can be played quite well with a controller, but I can say that with the mouse when hitting some certain edges, the camera goes berserk, not really pleasant (reminds me of Prototype).-Fighting can be quite limited at some points, but it compensates with customizations.-Has frequent auto-save points, so you won't get frustrated in case of failure.-Finding hidden stuff isn't hard and it is quite rewarding.

												Loyal readers and strangers of the internet, ‘tis I. It certainly has been a while, and I just know you’re all itching to read another page long review (This is the part you skip to the end, read the summary and leave.) Today you’re going to suffer through a review of a game that got huge amounts of hype, but was neglected when it game out. “Why?” you ask. Don’t interrupt me; I’m going to tell you why. What’s wrong with you? I go to all the trouble to write a review for the game, and you just come on in like you own the place. God, the nerve of you readers. Anyway, let us begin.Remember Me is set almost 80 years in the future in “Neo-Paris.” (Which is future talk for “Paris.”) Society has been completely ruptured and as a result of new technology known as “Sensen” that allows real memories to be digitised, manufactured, sold, bought and traded. Because of this, people have chosen to remove or replace any bad memories. This has drastic effects on people’s personalities, which we see often in the game when a single altered memory can turn friend from foe. Throughout the game, we see too very distinct classes. The upper class, who live in a beautiful utopian society, without any cares. This contrasts with the majority of people, who live in decaying ruins, desperate for money, work, memories, Ect. As you can see, this game has an abstract, beautiful concept, above and beyond most games produced now (*Cough Cough FC3 Blood Dragon.*) You take on the role of Nilin, an errorist agent who fights Memorise, the company who owns Sensen and have developed an immense power over 99% of the population, who are virtually addicted to Sensen. Nillin’s past shows her to be an elite errorist agent, capable of not only of stealing other’s memories, but altering and rewriting them. This power unlocks a unique mechanic that I’ll talk in a minute. You start the game in the clichéd manner of amnesia, having you memory recently been entirely wiped. The voice of the errorists, who goes by the name of “Edge” is the only thing that gets you out of the prison you and the other errorists are being kept in. As the game progresses, we see what the Sensen technology, despite having good intentions, has done to the world. In prisons, prisoners have their memories taken from them to prevent rebellions. People who have become so addicted to the technology, they’ve lost everything trying to afford it. However, as your actions, which are influenced by edge, have extremely negative consequences which impact on many innocent people, you start to doubt if you’re a vigilante, or a renegade.Now, moving on to mechanics. Remember Me’s combat is primarily based on combos, comprised of left and right clicks and dodging. The basic idea was, you were given a combo. (E.G Punch, kick, kick, punch, kick, kick) and you can change the effects on these different attacks (E.g., one of the punches could do extra damage, another could heal you slightly, Ect) The dodging system was integrated quite well into the combat, with the exception that if you dodged, you would have to restart the combo. The system was very good, especially when integrated with different unlockable abilities which were all creative and innovative, and a single ranged weapons, although, neither of these things was crucial to combat. I liked the combat system all in all, what I didn’t like was how clunky it felt. Often, because there was no particular was to select your targets (which I honestly didn’t mind, don’t get me wrong) you would attack whichever enemy was closest, in range and looking at. This system reminded me of the Batman: Arkham series, although, unlike the Arkham games, there was no easy way to move from target to target. In fact, it was almost impossible. Another problem was that sometimes you would try and fight an enemy, and the game would outright choose a different target. I don’t blame the developers for this, but allowing freeflow would’ve reduced this problem. Finally, I found that combat was often too busy, especially with enemies such as Leapers, who could jump onto walls and stay there before producing an attack that can only be dodged. This meant that, if fighting a hoard of leapers, one would constantly have to be dodging, and that can be a bit trying, especially when you were unable to complete any combos.The platforming aspect to the game had its problems as well. Every level design, regardless of how unique the art style, felt linear, like the world was closed, and didn’t exist short of this one path. The game even threw in little arrows on platforms you were meant to jump on, which was nice of them but really did take away the challenge of a platformer with such a strong puzzle aspect, although it was, undoubtedly, necessary, as the paths didn’t stick out like a sore thumb like they do in Assassin’s Creed (Seriously, God in that game must’ve been a parkourist.) All I’m saying is that this game would’ve sold much better with a slightly more open world.I’m going to touch on the art style and soundtrack by saying that they’re both great. The art style really brought to life the contrasts of the classes of Neo-Paris and the soundtrack contributed heavily to the atmosphereFinally, the mechanic that allows Nilin to enter somebodies memory and alter it was simply astounding. The way it was structured was a little bit of a trial at the time, having to re-watch the same cutscène over an over again to find memory glitches (Things in the memory you can change) and having you go back and select different glitches to change the outcome was tedious, especially because you had to deselect everything before re-watching the cutscène to find out what was wrong. Not even mentioning how memory glitches were only fractions of seconds long. I didn’t miss any memory glitches (Their animation was just the right amount of subtle to make it difficult, but entirely possible to find them if you were paying attention) but rewinding and replaying and pausing and fast forwarding and rewinding again trying to land on the exact place where the glitch was, was severely annoying, especially later on when they become even shorter.SUMMARY:Look, this game really tried to be a classic. Its storyline, art style, soundtrack and voice acting easily qualify. However, the clunky mechanics and linear environment didn’t work in the games favour. I enjoyed playing this game, but only for its storyline. It almost felt like it would’ve made a better movie than a game.Storyline 10/10Mechanics 4/10Art style & Soundtrack 9/10Overall: 7.5/10Thanks for reading.P.S, the game is pretty demanding of your computer, maybe free up some space or improve the RAM. You’ve been warned			"

												Before I start I want to state that I'm usually the person who thinks game reviews give way too high scores for lots of things.But this time I feel 65 is too low. Yeas, the game has its problems, but it makes up for it big time.The Good– The atmosphere and the level designs are top-notch. The future is futuristic but not far-fetched, and the memory-excange aspect is really thought out on how it may affect society. The graphical design really helps too.– Remember Me is almost purely story-based and it shows. The voice acting is decent at worst, great at best. The story itself unfolds in a perfect rythym and the two large and several smaller twists are not too clichéd to make them tiresome.– The Memory Remix minigames add an easy but very unique puzzle type in a somewhat ""timetravel changes the future"" kind of way. Depending on your taste they may be the absolute high or low point of the game. (Though in latter case you probably wouldn't pick it up in the first place.)Granted, the combat difficulty may vary for people. It's usually pretty easy even on highest difficulty but there are two ro three arena fights that are gimmicky and really frustrating.– The music is just plain awesome.– The achievements beside ""kill n enemies"" and ""do x move n+1 time"" are really fun to do, a rare thing in most games.The Bad– Unskippable cutscenes. And since the game is story-heavy it makes up almost half of NG+. It really hurts replayability.– Linear level design. The levels are very unique and make up for it somewhat but you are always on a corridor no matter what.– Short. Playing it casually can net an about 8 hour gameplay, I finished every achievement in little less than 20 with two playthroughs.– Combat and camera system can be against the player soometimes.The Neutral– Though many people complained about the controls I found the PC controls very well ported, combat was easier for me than in the Arkham games. The only bad point is the Spammer (your ""gun"") which most of the times would simply not go into aim mode.– Combat may seem repetitive as you use only four combos over and over but the Combo Lab customization system is pretty  innovative and makes combat a somewhat tactical challenge that can be adapted to various play styles.Altogether I'd say that the game is worth it for the story only, it's so good that you can replay it over and over again just like your favourite movies. If I'd have to give a numerical verdict it'd be around 72/100.			"

												It was very enjoyable for me to see a hot strong woman running, climbing and jumping around a futuristic city in France. The freeflow combat was fun and easy to master, with adjustable and upgradeable fighting styles. Wondrous story and ''mixing'' memories was great fun.Graphics are very good, with lots of details. I loved walking around St. Michel browsing the shops and listening to people's conversations. Excellent soundtrack, some of the songs are beautiful and when fighting the music changes appropriately. Very much recommended - especially when it's on sale.  :o)			"

												This game has potential it just doesn't live up to. The story could explore deep themes but it's told so poorly I don't care about it. The gameplay is interesting, but feels like it's missing something. Fewer platforming sections would have helped a lot.If you've got nothing else to play and it's on sale, it might not be a total loss, but generally speaking there are many much better games to spend your time and money on.

												Meh.That's the best I can say about Remember Me. I'm a big fan of fighting game mechanics, a big fan of melee, and a gigantic fan of cyberpunk/dystopia-themed fiction. But Remember Me is forgettable at best.The visuals and design are fantastic, don't get me wrong, and I like the main character. What I don't like is that the city appears to be built on Total Recall (2012) logic and the only font in existance is Helvetica, as if the world had been taken over by a disgruntled, out of work hipster web designer fascist regime. Heilvetica.The plot focuses on a society where memories are a commodity to be transferred, bought, sold and traded and uses this plot element very sparingly in gameplay - mostly a handful of sequences where you get to mess about trying to alter someone's memories. Some attacks and special powers are ""explained"" by using the ability to transfer and alter memories as a catch all, but it's a complete joke. In practice the takedowns and abilities have Jack and♥♥♥♥♥♥to do with memories, and Jack left town.The plot appears to have been written by someone throwing things together in an attempt to get you moving about, as though he or she came up with a vague idea for Paris in the 2080s and then just kind of tried to give you a reason to go around beating up random people and mutants with weird weak points and jumping over things. So, meh. It's not a bad game. It's not really a good one either. It's a pretty game (design-wise).			"

The story was incredibly good but the dialogue was laughably bad, you can tell this was made by a foreign studio (french infact). The combat can be a little annoying but it grows on you. It's basically like the Batman Arkham games but more rhythmic and less fluid. If you start a combo on one enemy, you can't continue onto another which I absolutely hated. The world, characters and artstyle were visually stunning and the memory gimmick is a fantastic concept I would love to see more of.I really loved this game and I sincerly hope to see more from the developers, Dontnod.

												This is not a good game.CombatOk gameplay first. It's tedious. The combat bits are fun but absolutely repetitive. You have these x,y combos that you can customize with different elements (when you hit, you will either heal yourself, do extra damage, or reduce the cooldown between your extra powers - you choose which of these forms each hit will take). Then you have your extra powers, like rapid hitting or getting a robot to fight for you for 10 or 20 seconds. All of this is fun but very quickly becomes rinse and repeat. The powers are mostly situation-specific, not really encouraging any kind of creative or improvisatory use. And it's very easy (I played on normal mode). When you've got combos that will heal you, there's almost never any point in the game where you can't quickly get back what health you may have lost. There is a boss fight at the end of every level. These all have brief QTEs at the end, which don't bother me. What does bother me is when the fights frequently require you to use one of your special powers to accomplish something which they never accomplished before. The game doesn't make an effort to let you know beforehand that it's even possible to do such things with your powers. An example is your fight against Madame, a prison warden. Late in the fight she creates copies of herself, and you can go around trying to hit them one at a time but after three tries your chance is over and she becomes invulnerable for a bit until she creates more copies and you do the same thing over again. You can use one of your powers to reveal which copy is the real her, but you won't know this until you’ve been going through the cycle for a minute or two and a tooltip finally pops up telling you what to do. This kind of thing happens in at least half of the boss fights. Again, most of the general combat is fun. It's just nothing to write home about. Level traversalWhen you're not in combat, you're just running through corridor after corridor going wherever the little orange arrows are telling you. There are a few spaces that appear wide open, but are just linear paths in disguise - you can only travel through these areas on one path, limited by whatever scenery is in the way. I'm personally fine with linearity, but there are times when what you can do and what you can't, in regards to level traversal, is inconsistent. Some rail guards you can leap over, when the game needs you to get to whatever is below. But some rails (of equal height) you can't, even if what's below is theoretically walkable space. There are environmental puzzles (the likes of ""rotate a crane!""), but there's almost never any margin for error. Everything you have to do is laid out in front of you, you just have to go through the motions. Rarely will you feel inventive or satisfied. Combine the lacking puzzles with the inconsistent traversal and fidgety platforming and you've got levels that are just joyless to move through. Memory altering!The brief moments where the game shines are found in the memory altering mechanic. You have a special skill that allows you to hack people's key memories in order to change how they behave in the present day. A scene will play out, and when you reach the end the game tells you what you are trying to accomplish (example: make x kill y). From there, you rewind and fast forward through the memory looking for ""memory glitches"", little details that you can change to alter the events. Not all of these are necessary, so you have to find the right combination of glitches to change, but even the wrong choices will still alter the scene, so you can see how it may play out in various ways before rewinding and trying again. This is super fun and satisfying and interesting, and it's a real shame these sequences don't come more often throughout the game, though I imagine they took a lot of work to script and animate. And sadly, the narrative potential of this aspect of the game is never fully realized. More on that below.Story and charactersYou are Nilin, a woman waking up in a prison, with no memory of your past. All you've got to guide you is a guy who calls himself ""Edge"", on the other end of a radio. His voice is your constant companion throughout the game. He tells you that you're an Errorist, a group dedicated to the eradication of Sensen, a technology that converts memories into transferable, deletable data, something every Neo-Paris citizen has taken part in. He helps you out of prison and you get to blindly follow his every order from then on, despite constant doubt over the morality of what you're doing. It's in this awful relationship that a huge disconnect erupts between the player and the protagonist. First off, he's just downright annoying. Everything he says is incredibly over-zealous, a very ""WE WILL BATHE THEM IN OUR RIGHTEOUS FIRE"" vibe. He consistently withholds valuable information from Nilin to get her to achieve his (terrible) goals for him.(Early-game spoiler in this paragraph) Second, early in the game Edge has Nilin commit an act of terrorism. No joke, by flooding a whole district of the city, Nilin engages in mass murder of families that Edge deems deserving of death because they were living comfortable lives while other people were suffering. Children. Yet, despite this, Nilin eventually goes on to be buddy-buddy with Edge, thanking him for his help in… being a terrible person, I guess. But even more concerning is Nilin's direct reaction to what she just did. ""I don't know what I'm doing. Was what I did right? Should I trust Edge?"" No, you ♥♥♥♥ing moron, what you did was one of the worst things a human being can do, and there was no justification for it, and no, you should not trust the guy who coerced you into doing it. The pathetic wallowing of Nilin's inner mind makes her completely unrelatable to the player at this point. The other major failing of the story is that it never really explores or even talks about the morality of Nilin’s memory altering. It condemns the memory technology as a whole, but Nilin’s actions in particular are never questioned, even though she is making use of the same technology that brought about this dystopia. The conflict does not go to places nearly as interesting or dramatic as it should when you're going around changing people’s realities in order to get them to fight for you. (More minor spoilers in the next two paragraphs) Here’s an example of this wasted potential. Very early in the game, a bounty hunter named Olga comes after you and attempts to kill you. Before she can do that, however, you seize the opportunity to hack into her memories and alter her reality. You make her think her husband (who is very much alive in reality) was killed in a way that ignites resentment toward the powers that be. As a result, she immediately joins your cause instead of killing you.She then helps you out by flying you in her hover craft to a certain location, where you ask her if she will join you on your current mission. She says she can’t, because she has family business to attend to. I assumed this meant she has to take care of arrangements for her husband, and when she finds out he isn’t actually dead, she’ll realize that Nilin altered her memory and Nilin will have to deal with those long-term consequences of memory altering. But none of that happens. In fact, the only time you interact with Olga after that is at the beginning of a much later mission where she just flies you to another location. And that’s that. Other stuff and conclusionOne great thing about the game is its music. It’s really well done. The themes that run throughout are strong. It does its best to carry the awful story, but of course good music does not make a good game. The combat is ok, the level design is bad, and the story flits between disappointing and disgusting. Remember Me is a bad game.			"

												Great concept, flawed execution, wasted potential.Remember Me is a game that largely went under my radar for the better part of a year until it had a price cut AND a sizable discount on Steam in early 2014. I picked it up mostly out of curiosity, as I had seen bits and pieces of its concept art floating around on the Internet, but I didn't expect too much. I was pleasantly surprised and yet disappointed by what I encountered in the eight or nine hours I spent playing through it.First, the good: The art direction is superb. It's rare that games look anything like their concept art, but this game nails it. If I had to describe the setting, it would be what you'd get if you threw Blade Runner, Total Recall, Mass Effect, Mirror's Edge, and Deus Ex in a blender. It does well with immersion by peppering the game world with small details, like the little augmented reality panels that pop up when you approach a shop or a hazard of some sort. In fact, a significant chunk of my game time was spent taking screenshots of the game world; DONTNOD's vision of Paris in 2084 is really something I would have loved to be able to explore more.Music is great as well. It's an orchestral score with some ""glitchiness"" mixed in, and the combat music changes dynamically depending on how you're doing in a fight. Do well and execute a combo, the music becomes more intense. Mess up a combo or get hit, the music stops and switches to a lower-key version of the same track until you start doing well again. It's not really an original idea, but it does help you get in the groove of fighting, so to speak.Dialogue and voice acting is hit-and-miss. For the most part, the voices are pretty good, with Nilin's voice actresses in both English and French doing a wonderful job, and most of the rest of the cast doing all right as well. One character's English voice actor, on the other hand, made me wish I could reach into my monitor and wring his neck to make him shut up (though, given the character's mental state, his hamminess was probably justified). Switching to French (which I did on my second playthrough) made him more tolerable and overall made the game feel more like it was actually set in France, but at the cost of ruining the lip syncing and having to play the game with subtitles.Memory remixing, where you dive into someone's head to ""remix"" one of their memories to influence their attitude and actions, is a very cool game mechanic. It involves going back and forth through a subject's memory of a past event, tweaking certain elements to reach a desired result, which drastically changes their outlook in the present. It's a unique and fun mini-game, unfortunately there's only four memory remix segments in the entire game.The story is decent. It could have touched more on the moral ramifications of memory storage/alteration and some other themes, and leaves quite a few loose ends hanging, mostly concerning those whose memories were remixed. It's nothing award-winning, and in fact has a quite a few plot holes if you look closely, but it works well enough.Now, the bad: The gameplay is average. Combat is standard beat-em-up fare, with two normal attacks, a token ranged weapon, some special super attacks you'll need to use in certain fights, and boss fights that involve whittling down their health till they fall over for an obligatory QTE sequence. It's reminiscent of the combat in the Arkham series, but less fleshed-out. There's a ""combo lab"" that lets you change the effect of each hit in your combo strings (of which you have four), but for the most part, you basically just push three buttons in four different combinations until everyone dies.The platforming elements are nothing special. There's _one_ path through each platforming segment, clearly labeled with orange augmented-reality arrows, and if there happens to be another path, it usually just leads to a small area in which some collectibles are squirreled away. The camera can be problematic at times, and you can't climb on anything that doesn't have the aforementioned orange arrows, which can be frustrating.The game is painfully linear, and while linearity isn't necessarily a bad thing, the game's world is so detailed and immersive, one just _wants_ to explore it outside of the strict path the game leads you on. If this had been a less linear game in the vein of Hitman or Assassin's Creed as was suggested by a gameplay trailer back in 2012 (video linked below), it'd probably have performed better. It really is a wonderful setting, held back by being shoehorned into a generic brawler.

To summarize, it's a mediocre game, but a beautiful art piece. I'd recommend buying this game on sale, but I'd also warn players to temper their expectations. It's an okay game that could have been better, but evidently something happened in the course of development that turned it into something very different from what it was originally. Still, not bad for a first game from a new developer. I'm hoping they make a prequel/sequel one day, because Neo-Paris is just begging to be explored further, but given how the game was received, I'm not holding my breath.			"

												Remember Me features gorgeous (and colorful) graphics and excellent world design, as well as an incredible soundtrack. The ""exploration"" is pretty limited, unfortunately, essentially consisting of mostly limited (and narrow) paths that serve little purpose other than to corral you from battle scene to battle scene. It doesn't help that the story is really, really dumb. It's hard to recommend the game on the basis of any of these things by themselves, but I daresay that the combat makes this game worth playing.I have a feeling that most people will disagree with me, but I think Remember Me's combat is the best part of the game. I don't know if I'm enjoying the combat for the wrong reasons, and I have a feeling that DONTNOD lucked into some of the more interesting aspects of the combat, but I think the combat in Remember Me hits its stride at the end of Chapter 4 and keeps you engaged through all of Chapter 7. Chapter 8 is absolute trash, though, and playing through it really made me wonder if DONTNOD even understands what makes Remember Me's combat so special.The problem with the combat for nearly half of the game is in how the game doles out your new abilities and introduces new enemies. I usually don't like games that require you to fight a bunch of weaker enemies while dealing with a stronger enemy, but Remember Me's combat thrives on this idea, and it actually made me appreciate the ins and outs of the combat system. You can unlock up to four different combos throughout the game, and you unlock individual moves that you can add to any given combo in order to change your attack attributes. Some attacks prioritize damage output, while others will heal you or decrease cool-down times for special abilities. Dealing with mobs of enemies really helps you to see the value in this battle system, as you're rewarded for taking risks with longer combos and customizing them according to each situation in order to prioritize certain attributes.For example, some enemies damage you whenever you hit them. You can kill them pretty easily if you don't mind burning some focus, but I think it's more interesting to simply customize a combo to prioritize healing. Alternatively, you can prioritize damage output for a longer combo for use against those enemies while milking other enemies for health with a shorter combo that prioritizes healing. It's actually really interesting.I doubt that we'll ever see a sequel to Remember Me, but I'd love to see this combat system implemented in a more cohesive way. I think it's worth experiencing, but I can understand why people who are used to the more polished experience of the Arkham games don't care for it. If you can pick it up cheap during a Steam sale, then I highly suggest playing until at least the end of Chapter 4 so you'll know for sure if you should stick with it. If you're impressed by that point, then you'll probably really enjoy the bulk of the game.			"

												As many others have said I really wanted to like this game. The concept of changing people's memories and using that as a core mechanic of gameplay seemed interesting. It is, but unfortunately is the only real saving grace in an otherwise unimpressive game. ProsThe much advertised main appeal of the game is actually altering someone's memories. This is actually fun and well done overall. You can see how different aspects of what you could change about a point in someones life that would truly impact their entire world views changing them fundamentally.These mini game type missions actually lived up to some of the hype. The only ways they didn't see the first entry in ""cons"".The game itself was stable, though admitedly this is much easier to do with linear levels with no choices in them.ConsThe cons list, sadly, also includes the memory altering. It was dissapointingly underused (only a handful of times you actually did it in the whole game). When it was used, you felt annoyed that they missed a lot of opportunity. It could have made the game so much better. They only have one outcome that works to solve each situation. You can't evaluate a person, decide what would be best for them, and try to alter the memory to fit that. Now if you did that for different people and saw the outcome of how that would effect their lives after the mission or even come back to bite you later that would be very interesting. It also doesn't really get into the morality of how you are really taking away an essence of who they are with this act. Which would make the game more interesting and thought provoking at least.

They tried for some conspericy with twists and turns, but it was very predictable as you went along, almost a cliche really. To be honest, it's not even very interesting since you didn't really have any connection or feeling about how it turned out (see below).Characters are mere charactures. None have any depth to them, so you don't actually care about what happens to any of them. The main character is probably the worst offender of this.The building of your combos was just an annoyance. I think they were going for something to make it more fun to play to give the illusion of choice in gameplay, but to me it really backfired highlighting to do it you still need to have the first thing be a punch followed by two kicks and a punch in that order, you only chose the different bonuses.When I heard about this game, I imagined that you would use memory wipes more and have a more open game to explore. It is instead very carefully laid out and you have to do exactly what it wants in order to ""win"" which is the definition of linear, and turned out to be completely boring. For a game creating hype based on you having the power to alter memories to what you want, you really can only alter them to exactly what the game wants you to do.For a game called ""Remember me"", it is extremely forgettable. I now read this as a desprite plea from the game itself, not actually as the title. Overall it is not worth full price, questionably worth picking up at all. "

												Damn that was a good game. Not perfect, but a damn good game none the less. The story was incredibly good but the dialogue was laughably bad, you can tell this was made by a foreign studio (french infact). The combat can be a little annoying but it grows on you. It's basically like the Batman Arkham games but more rhythmic and less fluid. If you start a combo on one enemy, you can't continue onto another which I absolutely hated. The world, characters and artstyle were visually stunning and the memory gimmick is a fantastic concept I would love to see more of.I really loved this game and I sincerly hope to see more from the developers, Dontnod. For a new game deveoper's first attempt, this was amazing.			"

The Combat mode is also another thing that stood out. Timing is essential in the game and the combos are outstanding. Parkour was also fun.I really liked the idea of actually going through character's memories and ""remixing"" them. -When i press shift to shoot, Sometimes it just stops targeting whatever i'm pointing it at, and it's really frustratingspecially on the boss fights.All in all i'd give this game 9/10.

												As many others have said I really wanted to like this game. The concept of changing people's memories and using that as a core mechanic of gameplay seemed interesting. It is, but unfortunately is the only real saving grace in an otherwise unimpressive game. ProsThe much advertised main appeal of the game is actually altering someone's memories. This is actually fun and well done overall. You can see how different aspects of what you could change about a point in someones life that would truly impact their entire world views changing them fundamentally.These mini game type missions actually lived up to some of the hype. The only ways they didn't see the first entry in ""cons"".The game itself was stable, though admitedly this is much easier to do with linear levels with no choices in them.ConsThe cons list, sadly, also includes the memory altering. It was dissapointingly underused (only a handful of times you actually did it in the whole game). When it was used, you felt annoyed that they missed a lot of opportunity. It could have made the game so much better. They only have one outcome that works to solve each situation. You can't evaluate a person, decide what would be best for them, and try to alter the memory to fit that.

												Remember Me features gorgeous (and colorful) graphics and excellent world design, as well as an incredible soundtrack. The ""exploration"" is pretty limited, unfortunately, essentially consisting of mostly limited (and narrow) paths that serve little purpose other than to corral you from battle scene to battle scene. It doesn't help that the story is really, really dumb. It's hard to recommend the game on the basis of any of these things by themselves, but I daresay that the combat makes this game worth playing.I have a feeling that most people will disagree with me, but I think Remember Me's combat is the best part of the game. I don't know if I'm enjoying the combat for the wrong reasons, and I have a feeling that DONTNOD lucked into some of the more interesting aspects of the combat, but I think the combat in Remember Me hits its stride at the end of Chapter 4 and keeps you engaged through all of Chapter 7. Chapter 8 is absolute trash, though, and playing through it really made me wonder if DONTNOD even understands what makes Remember Me's combat so special.The problem with the combat for nearly half of the game is in how the game doles out your new abilities and introduces new enemies. I usually don't like games that require you to fight a bunch of weaker enemies while dealing with a stronger enemy, but Remember Me's combat thrives on this idea, and it actually made me appreciate the ins and outs of the combat system. You can unlock up to four different combos throughout the game, and you unlock individual moves that you can add to any given combo in order to change your attack attributes. Some attacks prioritize damage output, while others will heal you or decrease cool-down times for special abilities. Dealing with mobs of enemies really helps you to see the value in this battle system, as you're rewarded for taking risks with longer combos and customizing them according to each situation in order to prioritize certain attributes.For example, some enemies damage you whenever you hit them. You can kill them pretty easily if you don't mind burning some focus, but I think it's more interesting to simply customize a combo to prioritize healing. Alternatively, you can prioritize damage output for a longer combo for use against those enemies while milking other enemies for health with a shorter combo that prioritizes healing. It's actually really interesting.I doubt that we'll ever see a sequel to Remember Me, but I'd love to see this combat system implemented in a more cohesive way. I think it's worth experiencing, but I can understand why people who are used to the more polished experience of the Arkham games don't care for it. If you can pick it up cheap during a Steam sale, then I highly suggest playing until at least the end of Chapter 4 so you'll know for sure if you should stick with it. If you're impressed by that point, then you'll probably really enjoy the bulk of the game.			"

												I would lump this game in the same group as Bioshock: Infinite in the sense that it's beautiful and full of great ideas and potential, but essentially hampered by lackluster gameplay and not as philosophical as it would’ve wanted in the end. The world is interesting and some of the levels are amazingly detailed and it would’ve been amazing if this game had been a (A)RPG with some C&C. However, we are delivered a linear action game with some climbing that’s even simpler than Assassin Creed’s. Luckily Dontnod redeemed themselves with the excellent Life if Strange and their next game, Vampyr, looks interesting as well at this point.That being said, there are some really nice scenes in Remember Me, the (too few) memory remixes are interesting and the story is decent, so I can still recommend this if it’s in a sale.

												This is a beautiful game. You're playing a lot for the environment and plot. If you've missed playing combo games, perhaps you're playing it for the fighting. Once you get the hang of how to time combos, the battles become interesting and not too challenging on the normal mode.Downsides: Learning the symbols and remembering the controls if you aren't playing in one long stretch. A bit too little explanation about how to fill in your combos in the combo lab. Not nearly enough space showcasing the fascinating memory remixing. Some of the indicators make it almost embarassingly easy to get through areas. Upsides: Original mechanic in remixing memories, parcore like Assassin's Creed, attractive graphics, pleasant voice acting, rememberane mechanic as a story element and challenge.All in all, I was expecting more out of this game. It was an excellent idea and there are beautiful scenes and cute 'puzzles', but a lot of times the mechanics managed one way or another to detract from my overall enjoyment of the game as opposed to providing an interesting challenge.

												This is atrocious.I tried to stick it out in the end to see how the story played out but I couldn't stomach another bugged boss fight where I spend 15minutes with failed dodged mechanics and inexplicable QTE. Then to only to be rewarded with the game not proceeding and having to repeat the entire experience. The premise of this game is interesting enough, you have a memory hunter, an ""errorist"" of the most extreme sense a political terrorist to take down the big bad corporation. Yadda yadda ya. First big problem: game crashes on Ch 0. Worrisome. Game cache to fix, downloads 1.1gb of missing data.... okay? How on Earth was that not installed?The story gives an illusion of choice. There were huge forks in the story where a good/bad moral choice system good have been implemented but Capcom decided to go on an rails route- which really makes for a wholey underwhelming story. The character debates through internal dialogue scenes about how her floating head compatriot Edge might be ""good or bad"" and he's ""super militant""- that's great- but we literally have no say, and we're shoved around in the story to do his bidding. If we just had our memory wiped (this is no spoiler, you're literally exposed to that in the first second of game play) wouldn't we approach things with a different perspective?The game mechanisms are boring, the combo system is boring and has no rewards. I just set up the 5 and 6 combo to basically be healing and maximum PMP/recharge gain. Never died unless I wanted to.  Summary of this stupidity:Gameplay: 4/10- at least you could combo somewhat seamlessly, the finishers had no variability and no bonuses for using themStory: 7/10- interesting premise, horrid executionOptimization: 2/10- when it worked it was incredibly pretty... when the bosses didn't bug out and you were stuck running around in an arena with the bodies of the slainProtagonist: 4/10- Boring and repetitive, could be interchangeable with any of the other ""mainish"" cast members, suffers from a marionette storyline and dialogue Overall character design: 8/10 pretty interesting of like... the 4 people you get to interact with. -2 for stupid enemy design with MMO gradient leveling (i.e. this bug is red instead of blue so is therefore higher level)Overall: 5/10Would not recommend. Do not waste your money, go play DMC or AC instead- at least you have some open world explorability and replayability.			"

												Around 8-10 hours of main storyline, this is DEFINITELY worth playing if only for the excellent storyline, strong characters and the beautiful art direction and soundtrack. This eerily convincing dystopia has elements of Deus-ex, Ghost in the Shell and Mirror's Edge at times.Note: Recommend using a Gamepad Pros:- The world is stunning with a lot of care and attention to detail put into it.- The storyline and characters are excellent. - The soundtrack is excellent and compliments the world perfectly.Cons- There are Quick Time Events on boss fights that feel really out of place and almost spoil the experience (But as these are restricted to boss fights they are reasonably infrequent)- Players of Rocksteady's Arkham games will find the combat frustrating due to a lack of counter in particular.- The world cries out to be explorable, so it's disappointing it isn't. The gameplay features a well paced mixture of physical puzzle solving, combat challenges and memory-remixing puzzles (one of the more interesting and thought provoking-parts of remember me).In comparison to the combat in say, Rocksteady's Arkham series, the lack of counter and quick cut off when trying to continue a combo after dodging can be frustrating. That said, Nilin, while capable of pulling off some ridiculous jumps, feels very 'human' as a resultThe sequence-based combat can take a little getting used to, but it IS pretty satisfying when mastered, especially due to the dynamic music that follows the combosThe main let down is perhaps more that Remember Me had the potential to be so much more and perhaps doesn't quite live up to (high) expectations:For example:- The memory remixing could have had multiple outcomes in the current day depending on your choices (rather than just finding the ""Right"" solution)- The world is so well presented that everyone wants to explore it and interact with npcs, but can't.- The Quick Time Events really felt unnecessary			"

												If you are looking for a captivating story with a VERY interesting concept, then Remember Me is one such game. It will have you questioning the morals of what you are doing throughout the entire game. The scenery, the city that you platform your way through is amazing, there is so much detail. So much thought has gone into building up the society that you witness. So, overall, if it is on offer, I would highly recommend you buy it.HOWEVER! The game is not without its own flaws. Although Remember Me has an amazing story, I felt there was parts of what you could see that was left untouched. I won't go into detail as to what I'm refering to, but I simply hope you can take my word for it. Apart from some parts of the games world being left out, the combat and perhaps gameplay is a little easy. It is not very difficult to put simply. The combo's give it a little bit of customisation, but I only really stuck with the two short combo's that I could customise, as I found it rare to be able to kick off a full 8+ combo hit (so much dodging).Still, it is a game that I would highly suggest you give a try. If you find the gameplay is too irritating, I ask that you TRY to look past it. I know for some of you that may be a little hard, but you will NOT regret it if you can. And for those who have finished the game but are intrigued by it. I suggest you look up two books, one is a 10 page one off comic called Remember Me: Cubed. As well as Remember Me: The Pandora Archive.			"

Platforming, pakour, and minor puzzle solving also drive the game. All of these are done well, including the music and graphics.The camera is a bit wonky though, and combat combos have a minor bug involving the ability to string together combos. The drawbacks are heavily outweighed by the sheer amount of things that are done well though. Primarily a story lover here, so I rank it quite high. Do recommend.			"

Very impressed with the music for this game. It fit the feel and utilized loops of music that actually evoked emotional responses from me. Every single time I heard the 'fear' music I would get nervous about the upcoming battle, even though there were no enemies that scared or even really challenged me. I would also feel a little thrill of excitment every time the combo completion music chimed. The composer went above and beyond for this game. But even with the masterful music, the game is crap.

The only bad thing about this game is the camera that sometimes can be a pain but it isnt game breacking by anymeans. The combat is an interesting system, you are given a combo and them you can personalize which kick or punch wich can very between damage, ability time reducing, healing and supers, and than you have these abilities which are pretty cool keeping the combat even fresher.In other words buy this game because it deserves to be bought, a game that was probably overshadowed because of not enough media coverage			"

												Such a shame. The world is beautiful and is accompanied by a great soundtrack, but you're led through it in a very linear way with constant handholding on any platforming move, which makes progress meaningless and boring. Then the combat, while having a clever system never really works because it doesn't have a sense of rhythm and it's VERY repetitive. It also includes the WORST boss battle ('Madame') I've ever experienced in a game. I gave up a little bit after that... What a wasted opportunity this game is. "

												This is not a good game.CombatOk gameplay first. It's tedious. The combat bits are fun but absolutely repetitive. You have these x,y combos that you can customize with different elements (when you hit, you will either heal yourself, do extra damage, or reduce the cooldown between your extra powers - you choose which of these forms each hit will take). Then you have your extra powers, like rapid hitting or getting a robot to fight for you for 10 or 20 seconds. All of this is fun but very quickly becomes rinse and repeat. The powers are mostly situation-specific, not really encouraging any kind of creative or improvisatory use. And it's very easy (I played on normal mode). When you've got combos that will heal you, there's almost never any point in the game where you can't quickly get back what health you may have lost. There is a boss fight at the end of every level. These all have brief QTEs at the end, which don't bother me. What does bother me is when the fights frequently require you to use one of your special powers to accomplish something which they never accomplished before. The game doesn't make an effort to let you know beforehand that it's even possible to do such things with your powers. An example is your fight against Madame, a prison warden. Late in the fight she creates copies of herself, and you can go around trying to hit them one at a time but after three tries your chance is over and she becomes invulnerable for a bit until she creates more copies and you do the same thing over again. You can use one of your powers to reveal which copy is the real her, but you won't know this until you’ve been going through the cycle for a minute or two and a tooltip finally pops up telling you what to do. This kind of thing happens in at least half of the boss fights. Again, most of the general combat is fun. It's just nothing to write home about. Level traversalWhen you're not in combat, you're just running through corridor after corridor going wherever the little orange arrows are telling you. There are a few spaces that appear wide open, but are just linear paths in disguise - you can only travel through these areas on one path, limited by whatever scenery is in the way. I'm personally fine with linearity, but there are times when what you can do and what you can't, in regards to level traversal, is inconsistent. Some rail guards you can leap over, when the game needs you to get to whatever is below. But some rails (of equal height) you can't, even if what's below is theoretically walkable space. There are environmental puzzles (the likes of ""rotate a crane!""), but there's almost never any margin for error. Everything you have to do is laid out in front of you, you just have to go through the motions. Rarely will you feel inventive or satisfied. Combine the lacking puzzles with the inconsistent traversal and fidgety platforming and you've got levels that are just joyless to move through. Memory altering!The brief moments where the game shines are found in the memory altering mechanic. You have a special skill that allows you to hack people's key memories in order to change how they behave in the present day. A scene will play out, and when you reach the end the game tells you what you are trying to accomplish (example: make x kill y). From there, you rewind and fast forward through the memory looking for ""memory glitches"", little details that you can change to alter the events. Not all of these are necessary, so you have to find the right combination of glitches to change, but even the wrong choices will still alter the scene, so you can see how it may play out in various ways before rewinding and trying again. This is super fun and satisfying and interesting, and it's a real shame these sequences don't come more often throughout the game, though I imagine they took a lot of work to script and animate. And sadly, the narrative potential of this aspect of the game is never fully realized. More on that below.Story and charactersYou are Nilin, a woman waking up in a prison, with no memory of your past. All you've got to guide you is a guy who calls himself ""Edge"", on the other end of a radio. His voice is your constant companion throughout the game. He tells you that you're an Errorist, a group dedicated to the eradication of Sensen, a technology that converts memories into transferable, deletable data, something every Neo-Paris citizen has taken part in. He helps you out of prison and you get to blindly follow his every order from then on, despite constant doubt over the morality of what you're doing. It's in this awful relationship that a huge disconnect erupts between the player and the protagonist. First off, he's just downright annoying. Everything he says is incredibly over-zealous, a very ""WE WILL BATHE THEM IN OUR RIGHTEOUS FIRE"" vibe. He consistently withholds valuable information from Nilin to get her to achieve his (terrible) goals for him.(Early-game spoiler in this paragraph) Second, early in the game Edge has Nilin commit an act of terrorism. No joke, by flooding a whole district of the city, Nilin engages in mass murder of families that Edge deems deserving of death because they were living comfortable lives while other people were suffering. Children. Yet, despite this, Nilin eventually goes on to be buddy-buddy with Edge, thanking him for his help in… being a terrible person, I guess. But even more concerning is Nilin's direct reaction to what she just did. ""I don't know what I'm doing. Was what I did right? Should I trust Edge?"" No, you ♥♥♥♥ing moron, what you did was one of the worst things a human being can do, and there was no justification for it, and no, you should not trust the guy who coerced you into doing it. The pathetic wallowing of Nilin's inner mind makes her completely unrelatable to the player at this point. The other major failing of the story is that it never really explores or even talks about the morality of Nilin’s memory altering. It condemns the memory technology as a whole, but Nilin’s actions in particular are never questioned, even though she is making use of the same technology that brought about this dystopia. The conflict does not go to places nearly as interesting or dramatic as it should when you're going around changing people’s realities in order to get them to fight for you. (More minor spoilers in the next two paragraphs) Here’s an example of this wasted potential. Very early in the game, a bounty hunter named Olga comes after you and attempts to kill you. Before she can do that, however, you seize the opportunity to hack into her memories and alter her reality. You make her think her husband (who is very much alive in reality) was killed in a way that ignites resentment toward the powers that be. As a result, she immediately joins your cause instead of killing you.She then helps you out by flying you in her hover craft to a certain location, where you ask her if she will join you on your current mission. She says she can’t, because she has family business to attend to. I assumed this meant she has to take care of arrangements for her husband, and when she finds out he isn’t actually dead, she’ll realize that Nilin altered her memory and Nilin will have to deal with those long-term consequences of memory altering. But none of that happens. In fact, the only time you interact with Olga after that is at the beginning of a much later mission where she just flies you to another location. And that’s that. Other stuff and conclusionOne great thing about the game is its music. It’s really well done. The themes that run throughout are strong. It does its best to carry the awful story, but of course good music does not make a good game. The combat is ok, the level design is bad, and the story flits between disappointing and disgusting. Remember Me is a bad game.			"

And did I mention it was beautiful? I just finished playing Alien Isolation and this game has SO much more going for it.

												The design of stuff in htis game is nice and ver detailed but the gameplay feels very boring later on as it doesnt change at all. YOu could play the first 20 mins of the game and that would be the whole game pretty much in a nutshell. Combat isnt very fun later on too because you pretty much get stuf with a 3 hit or 5 hit combo limit (as creating combos allow you to reduce the really bad cooldowns on abilites they you more or less need to use in every fight later on, regenerate health because enemies wont let you hit someone 2-3 times at once without trying to hit you and breaking your combo which makes the larger 7 and 9 combo limits rather useless), Also all the boss fights in this game are exactlly the same and that usualy involves fighting the exact same trsh/enemies you already fought before until your cooldowns reset over and over. Everything excluding the bad combat it nice though....maybe worth it when its cheap. Also dont even bother standing in a small space when you're on combat...the camera starts to feak out so good luck seeing where you are... D:			"

												A game to be forgotten.Good:Visuals and sound are nice, especially the art design.Memory remixing is a interesting idea.Bad:Basic movement feels slippery.Later fights rely too much on the specials that have to be “charged” by doing combos.In later fights there are too many enemies that are immune to all but one special.In later game there are too many fast enemies for you to perform long combos, making short ones only viable option.Because of above things, boss fights can become long grinds.Plot is very predictable.Characters are unmemorable.Levels are linear and exploring is very limited. There is hint of better game here but as it stands, Remember Me is best to be forgotten.    "

												When I initially saw a screenshot of this game, I thought that it would be an enjoyable experience in the same sense that Assassin's Creed was; You pick it up, play through it, and bask in the memories of having done so. It took me about a year to actually buy it, but I went into it as eager as ever. Finishing the game at about nine hours (mind you, this was on the easiest difficulty and I didn't go for all the collectables and or achievements) I can safely say that it was well worth the investment. The soundtrack to this game is fenominal and fits so perfectly into this 'Neo-Paris'. While I can't speak for the originality of a memory hunter, a protaganist with amnesia, or a rogue fighting the system, I can say that this is a fantastic RPG with a wicked story. Play this game and you'll certainly Remember It.			"

												5/10The road to mediocre games is paved with good ideas.It is clear that the designers wanted to create a game that was part Tomb Raider, part Arkham City, part The Matrix, and with a dash of Inception. In Remember Me, you play as Nilin, who starts off the game with her memory wiped. Just as she is about to be sent to a jail cell, she is broken out. It is revealed that she is a memory hunter and is a key asset to help a rebel group take down a big corporation that wants to mind-control people.The combat wants to copy the free-flow punching and kicking that was present in the Batman games, but it falls completely flat on its face. You are given set combos consisting of punches and kicks that are stronger as the combos become longer. However, longer combos are only unlocked as the game progresses. As soon as you unlock a longer combo, the shorter ones become obsolete. So you end up only repeating the one combo over and over again throughout the game.Your combo is also interrupted if you are hit by enemy attacks or by taking too long between hits. You can dodge the very telegraphed enemy attacks, but some dodge animations are so long that your combo is stopped anyway.There are also no AoE attacks except a few special moves that are used very rarely. As the game progresses, there are more and more enemies in any given battle, so it becomes very difficult to actually perform a combo.This becomes very frustrating and artificially inflates the difficulty of the game.There is significant platforming in this game. However, unlike Tomb Raider, you have arrows telling you where to jump, which defeats the purpose. It's a series of 'follow the instructions'.The story is interesting for the middle part of the game, but becomes extremely contrived towards the end. It feels like the developers tried to put in as many plot twists as possible.The redeeming feature of the game is the memory remixes. You are able to view the memories of some people and change small details to change the outcome of the memory. In one instance, you change a man's memory to make him think that he killed his wife, which drives him to commit suicide.You could play this game if you have a spare 10 hours, but honestly, it's really not worth your time nor money.Pros:- Interesting aesthetic style- Memory remixes - a pity that you can only do this 4 times in the gameCons:- Boring and frustrating combat- Platforming is disinteresting and is used to pad out the game- Story picks up slowly and then becomes contrived towards the end.

												Just completed this game 1 day before eur release. I've read lots of bad comments about this game on steam forums before it's been released. All the ppl were complaining about short story(5-8 hours) and boring repeative gameplay. At first i worried about it. After completing this game all i want to say is: stop listening all these gaming community ""review"" made by CoD fanboys! This game is all about story, this is not another dumb♥♥♥♥♥action-shooter-call-of-duter with lots of explosions and no sense at all. Gaming site reviews are false too. You can't review this game by a demo or few first missions. And about gameplay... Yes, it's good if you'll play at least half of this game. Remix memory puzzles, awesome boss battles which are pretty diffirent and not repeative. But as i said before this is not about gameplay, this is story-based game. If you're going to play it just for lulz - skiping all cutscenes and not giving a ♥♥♥♥ about what's happening in game - do not buy it, save your money for another dumb shooter about bad russians or islamic terrorists. Also 5-8 hours is false too! I completed it on medium difficulty in 10 hours. So what was idea of my review? Don't listen to all these kids screaming on steam forums and buy this game for 10 hours of great story. 9,5/10 for a not as great fighting system as it should be. I think it's totally worth-buying game. And i also think it's gonna be one of most underrated games of this year.Thanks for reading!			"

												I bought this game a while ago and completely forgot about it so I decided to give it a shot after a few years. I've played a few chapters and from what I gathered, I've experienced all the game has to offer and I do not recommend it.Remember Me is a linear experience that is very similar in gameplay and structure to Enslaved: Oddysey To The West, however I have not played enough of Enslaved to give it a fair comparison. The closest comparison I can do is with the Prince Of Persia series as they seem to have the same type of linear gameplay and combat.I don't have a problem with linear games. Uncharted, Prince of Persia: TSOT and Mirror's Edge are very linear games yet they are among my favourite games of all time. However, Remember Me is a game that I believe is too linear. From what I've played, The game holds your hand from platforming to combat over and over. Just that is fine as Prince Of Persia does the same but the reason POP succeeds is because of the amount of genuine player thought and effort that goes into each segment so memorable. Remember Me is too predictable. In platforming segments, you simply follow the obvious path (that is blatantly indicated via arrows) and you will progress. There is no thought from the player needed, just a continuous following of the path. There are some parts that are a bit different from the usual but after a moment of interest it becomes stale very quickly and still requires no effort to complete.Now one thing that Remember Me has which is kind of interesting at first is the combo fighting system but ultimately fails. In the game, you must try and ""remember"" how to do combo moves and then you get to decide which moves to use in the combo. There are moves you can use that are powerful, can heal you, can cool down specials, etc. When I saw this I was excited to play with it but it failed when the ""dominant strategy"" became evident. This is when you find the easiest way to do something and you use only that strategy. All I had to do to easily pass combat segments is make a short combo with powerful hits and one with lots of healing hits so I ended up spamming one combo then switching to the other combo if I got hit. Messing with complex combos can be fun but is too frustrating to pull off so you just do what's easiest. POP's combat isn't perfect either but at least it lets you experiment in a fight to figure out what to do for yourself when the game throws you a curveball. In Remember Me, the enemy weaknesses is told to you and it makes them too boring to fight.The only thing I can commend this game for is an interesting story (even if the characters are flat and boring), the puzzles altering people's memories which were really cool and a boss in which you had to fight a giant robot which was challenging and fun. However, none of this interested me enough to continue with the game. It was boring, too easy and never had a memorable moment (ironic, isn't it). If after reading this you still want to buy it, I recommend putting it on easy mode simply to get through it faster.			"

												If you are looking for a captivating story with a VERY interesting concept, then Remember Me is one such game. It will have you questioning the morals of what you are doing throughout the entire game. The scenery, the city that you platform your way through is amazing, there is so much detail. So much thought has gone into building up the society that you witness. So, overall, if it is on offer, I would highly recommend you buy it.HOWEVER! The game is not without its own flaws. Although Remember Me has an amazing story, I felt there was parts of what you could see that was left untouched. I won't go into detail as to what I'm refering to, but I simply hope you can take my word for it. Apart from some parts of the games world being left out, the combat and perhaps gameplay is a little easy. It is not very difficult to put simply. The combo's give it a little bit of customisation, but I only really stuck with the two short combo's that I could customise, as I found it rare to be able to kick off a full 8+ combo hit (so much dodging).Still, it is a game that I would highly suggest you give a try. If you find the gameplay is too irritating, I ask that you TRY to look past it. I know for some of you that may be a little hard, but you will NOT regret it if you can. And for those who have finished the game but are intrigued by it. I suggest you look up two books, one is a 10 page one off comic called Remember Me: Cubed. As well as Remember Me: The Pandora Archive.			"

												A really good game. Great story, actual character development - which is also good. Very compelling, as emotional values such as memories being the central focus. Platforming, pakour, and minor puzzle solving also drive the game. All of these are done well, including the music and graphics.The camera is a bit wonky though, and combat combos have a minor bug involving the ability to string together combos. The drawbacks are heavily outweighed by the sheer amount of things that are done well though. Primarily a story lover here, so I rank it quite high. Do recommend.			"

												Loved this game, the story, the art, the atmosphere, the music all great.  One of the few games I decided to play through a bunch of times to try to get all the achievements.  Play time once you have gone all the way through is not too long, this could be taken as a plus or a minus depending on what you are looking for.My only quarm would have to be the camera, I did found it glitchy in quite a few spots in the game.   Overall though I highly recommend it, just wish they would have released it on linux as well so I could play on my usual operating system.			"

												A very underrated game: fantastic universe, engaging story, excellent music, and beautiful art. The mechanics can be wonky at times and the game is pretty linear (not that that's always a bad thing), but that shouldn't keep anyone from enjoying this game for all the other great things it has to offer.

The combat is very similar to the Batman Arkham games.I had not heard of this game before finishing Dontnod's other game Life is Strange (which is also good though different from Remember Me), and I suspect that not many people know about it which is why I am writing this review.

												One of if not the best looking games I've ever seen. The level of detail is some of the best I've ever seen in a game. The graphics, artwork, and effects are outstanding. I can't think of too many games that come close to looking this good. One of the most underrated games I have played. The graphics/effects are outstanding and it has top-notch sound effects and music. It controls very well and combat is a lot of fun. Be prepared with a xbox 360 controller though for the best experience by far because since it is Capcom and they rank among the worst companies for programming pc games, keyboad and mouse movement is nowhere near as good as using a controller. Every time I walk into a fight I'm thinking ""♥♥♥♥ yes it's time to beat some serious♥♥♥♥♥quot; because combat has a great feel and you can really feel the hits landing. You also get a wide variety of combos and special powers. Overall, the combat really is very well done. It is pretty fun and very engaging. The story is very unique and well done also imo. I love Blade Runner-esque neo-noir futuristic settings in games or movies, and this is a really awesome setting. Everything looks superb in the world and the attention to detail is amazing. Being able to plug your glove into the back of a guys head and digitally blow his brains out is one of the coolest things ever. The combination of the way you jump around and the hot skinny female protagonist reminds me of a third-person style Mirror's Edge. The story, graphics/visual style, effects, and the combat are unforgettably good and the game isn't too short which is a problem with a lot of fun games in recent years. This game is plenty long enough.This game is so much fun. On sale at $10 was a steal. The only downside is that it is linear, but I really can't think of too many action games that aren't nowadays. An immensely fun ride, one of my all-time favorite games. 9/10.			"

												This is atrocious.I tried to stick it out in the end to see how the story played out but I couldn't stomach another bugged boss fight where I spend 15minutes with failed dodged mechanics and inexplicable QTE. Then to only to be rewarded with the game not proceeding and having to repeat the entire experience. The premise of this game is interesting enough, you have a memory hunter, an ""errorist"" of the most extreme sense a political terrorist to take down the big bad corporation. Yadda yadda ya. First big problem: game crashes on Ch 0. Worrisome. Game cache to fix, downloads 1.1gb of missing data.... okay? How on Earth was that not installed?The story gives an illusion of choice. There were huge forks in the story where a good/bad moral choice system good have been implemented but Capcom decided to go on an rails route- which really makes for a wholey underwhelming story. The character debates through internal dialogue scenes about how her floating head compatriot Edge might be ""good or bad"" and he's ""super militant""- that's great- but we literally have no say, and we're shoved around in the story to do his bidding. If we just had our memory wiped (this is no spoiler, you're literally exposed to that in the first second of game play) wouldn't we approach things with a different perspective?The game mechanisms are boring, the combo system is boring and has no rewards. I just set up the 5 and 6 combo to basically be healing and maximum PMP/recharge gain. Never died unless I wanted to.  Summary of this stupidity:Gameplay: 4/10- at least you could combo somewhat seamlessly, the finishers had no variability and no bonuses for using themStory: 7/10- interesting premise, horrid executionOptimization: 2/10- when it worked it was incredibly pretty... when the bosses didn't bug out and you were stuck running around in an arena with the bodies of the slainProtagonist: 4/10- Boring and repetitive, could be interchangeable with any of the other ""mainish"" cast members, suffers from a marionette storyline and dialogue Overall character design: 8/10 pretty interesting of like... the 4 people you get to interact with. -2 for stupid enemy design with MMO gradient leveling (i.e. this bug is red instead of blue so is therefore higher level)Overall: 5/10Would not recommend.

												Short, super linear beat-em-up. Does not require skill or tactics to complete. Beat it on the hardest difficulty in a laughably short time. The story was atrocious. The music was amazing. Very impressed with the music for this game. It fit the feel and utilized loops of music that actually evoked emotional responses from me. Every single time I heard the 'fear' music I would get nervous about the upcoming battle, even though there were no enemies that scared or even really challenged me. I would also feel a little thrill of excitment every time the combo completion music chimed. The composer went above and beyond for this game. But even with the masterful music, the game is crap. I wouldnt suggest this game, but if you do want to try it, wait for a sale.			"

												One of the best games I have played to date. I personally adored everything about it. From the gameplay, sound design and every little detail. Great premise and setting as well as creative story telling. Could go into detail praising this game but I suggest you experience it for yourself. Especially if you love games set in the future this is a must own, you get to experience a futuristic Neo-Paris.Edit: I suggest you get the No Grain mod to get rid of the annoying grainy filter and also grab the ""Remember me HD - 2K"" mod while you are at it... it improves some graphical aspects as well as removes all censorship on billboards through out the game. With these two mods combined the game looks really good.			"

												Recommended with a caveat: despite an enjoyable story, great art direction and an exciting world, there are serious flaws in the enemy design, puzzles and combat.  These are not wholly visible until suddenly they bring the game to a standstill. You are thrust into fights with enemies and combinations of enemies designed like puzzles but which are ultimately frustrating when presented to you over and over again.Remember Me suffers from curious game design choices which leave the player confused, when simply working through menus or when he or she should be having fun. The memory remix puzzles are at first exciting, but without any clear goals and precise understanding of cause and effect, you soon realise just how prescriptive the puzzles are and thus dependant on trial and error.So that's a huge caveat. Why then, do I recommend it? The combat can be worked through with patience. The irritating bosses and memory remixes can be solved with guides. After all that, there is a very interesting world to experience (to a point, as almost nothing is interactive unless its an enemy or game resource) and the story is memorable.The gameplay, however, can evoke memories you might prefer to erase.

												Before I get into the actual review for the game I'd like to place some comments that I think should've been in other reviews prior to me buying this game. 1. If you're looking for a game where you really get to know all the characters and lore of the world, then this game is going to be a bit of a disappointment.2. This game is not open world and is relatively short.3. I believe other reviewers overhype it a little. I am NOT saying this is a bad game.4. This game is not worth full price. Wait for a 70% to 80% sale.Before I continue I want to make clear that I am not smiting this game; nor will I make it sound like sci-fi Heaven. Remember Me is actually a hard game to place certain judgment. Like my comment said, you don't get to know any of the characters in depth except for the main character herself, Nillin. Neo Paris is definitely a work of art and it's torture to see how it looks in the background and knowing you will never explore it. But boy does it look beautiful. If you've played Mass Effect it would be most comparible with that series. The graphics in general is well done and detailed.The story is where I believe other reviewers overhyped. You start off lying on the ground being wiped of nearly all of your memory and a strange man named 'Edge' speaks to you over the intercom you have telling you what to do to save yourself. It starts off really confusing which I actually prefer since it adds interest rather than 'Okay here's exactly who you are and here's your exact destiny and goal'. I realize I've said this for the third time now but a huge factor in a story for me is getting to know allies and enemies well which doesn't happen. To be honest, I sometimes wondered how this got an M rating. Most of the things your friends and enemies say are very childish and rather laughable and/or annoying. The gameplay itself isn't top of the line but it is unique. You can customize your combos to give you either health, reduce your special skills downtime or increase the effect of one of these elements with a chain move. While this is unique, this isn't the highlight of this game. The highlight is the memory remixing. As Nillin you have special technology to go into people's brains and rewrite their memories by changing details; changing their outlook on life entirely. You can also steal memories to use yourself or drain enemies of their memories completely and kill them.Overall, I'd say this game is worth about $5-$8 dollars. There are aspects to it that I will definitely remember and I would recommend it on a hefty sale. To narrow it down, this is a combination of the combat style of the Batman Arkham games (minus the counters), the art style of Mass Effect, and the acrobatics of Uncharted and Tomb Raider (2013). If the developers made this an open world game with a much deeper background story and more content it would easily have been one of the greatest games ever released. If or when you play, you'll realize very quickly it had that potential.			"

This game is just big blast of fresh air the pros are these, lovable characters, super fresh environment, gameplay variety and enemy aswell, very original concept, a fairly good plot and just the idea of remixing memories is just awesome. The only bad thing about this game is the camera that sometimes can be a pain but it isnt game breacking by anymeans. The combat is an interesting system, you are given a combo and them you can personalize which kick or punch wich can very between damage, ability time reducing, healing and supers, and than you have these abilities which are pretty cool keeping the combat even fresher.In other words buy this game because it deserves to be bought, a game that was probably overshadowed because of not enough media coverage			"

												Around 8-10 hours of main storyline, this is DEFINITELY worth playing if only for the excellent storyline, strong characters and the beautiful art direction and soundtrack. This eerily convincing dystopia has elements of Deus-ex, Ghost in the Shell and Mirror's Edge at times.Note: Recommend using a Gamepad Pros:- The world is stunning with a lot of care and attention to detail put into it.- The storyline and characters are excellent. - The soundtrack is excellent and compliments the world perfectly.Cons- There are Quick Time Events on boss fights that feel really out of place and almost spoil the experience (But as these are restricted to boss fights they are reasonably infrequent)- Players of Rocksteady's Arkham games will find the combat frustrating due to a lack of counter in particular.- The world cries out to be explorable, so it's disappointing it isn't. The gameplay features a well paced mixture of physical puzzle solving, combat challenges and memory-remixing puzzles (one of the more interesting and thought provoking-parts of remember me).In comparison to the combat in say, Rocksteady's Arkham series, the lack of counter and quick cut off when trying to continue a combo after dodging can be frustrating. That said, Nilin, while capable of pulling off some ridiculous jumps, feels very 'human' as a resultThe sequence-based combat can take a little getting used to, but it IS pretty satisfying when mastered, especially due to the dynamic music that follows the combosThe main let down is perhaps more that Remember Me had the potential to be so much more and perhaps doesn't quite live up to (high) expectations:For example:- The memory remixing could have had multiple outcomes in the current day depending on your choices (rather than just finding the ""Right"" solution)- The world is so well presented that everyone wants to explore it and interact with npcs, but can't.- The Quick Time Events really felt unnecessary			"

												This is a beautiful game. You're playing a lot for the environment and plot. If you've missed playing combo games, perhaps you're playing it for the fighting. Once you get the hang of how to time combos, the battles become interesting and not too challenging on the normal mode.Downsides: Learning the symbols and remembering the controls if you aren't playing in one long stretch. A bit too little explanation about how to fill in your combos in the combo lab. Not nearly enough space showcasing the fascinating memory remixing. Some of the indicators make it almost embarassingly easy to get through areas. Upsides: Original mechanic in remixing memories, parcore like Assassin's Creed, attractive graphics, pleasant voice acting, rememberane mechanic as a story element and challenge.All in all, I was expecting more out of this game. It was an excellent idea and there are beautiful scenes and cute 'puzzles', but a lot of times the mechanics managed one way or another to detract from my overall enjoyment of the game as opposed to providing an interesting challenge.

Remember Me is an interesting story that's been walled off behind hostile game mechanics - a harsh reminder that interactive fiction and twitch action don't always mix.  It's a beautiful game with a great concept and fantastic performance, and it's completely crippled by tedious, rage-inducing, fun-destroying ""combat.""I have terrible reflexes.  I managed to pull off a five-hit combo once, by accident, after countless attempts. I tried to persist but my patience ran out when the ""invisible"" floodlight-sensitive enemies were introduced partway into episode 3.  There's no place to practice, no way to actually improve or get good at the game mechanics without pushing forward, automatically unlocking new complications that you have to master on the fly.  It's all on-the-plot training and if you can't get a handle on it the game stops being fun very, very quickly.  Quick load times don't help.  Tutorial tips don't help.  Mashing the punch button doesn't work past the second episode.  You can either do the moves required to defeat enemies or you can't.  There's no middle ground.  It's an either/or, and I'm very, very or.  Even reduced to the easiest difficulty setting I just get shredded.I haven't felt this frustrated by a video game since the first time I played Half-Life multiplayer in 1999, with a LAN full of bloodthirsty peers that had been living in first-person shooters since Wolfenstein.  If you're good at twitch gaming you might be able to get into the combat but if you're not, steer clear.  There is no fun here, only frustration and disappointment.			"

												This game is totally awesome! I am in love with the voice acting which is really well made! And the graphics are quiet nice, the story is absolut amazing! The Gameplay is reminding me a little bit on, Mirrors Edge, Tomb Raider, Assassins Creed and Batman Arkaham City. Its totally the money worth it!			"

												Finally played/finished this game and I must say it was well worth the time. Really good mechanics, beautiful level design and a refreshing story. It really deserves a closer look as you cannot really do anything wrong with this game. It may be short, but it is on sale every other week, so grab it when you have the chance ;)			"

												This is a great game, one of my favourites. From slums to the heights of society, every level is exquisite and well designed. In the nicer parts of Neo-Paris the enviroment has this polished clean look that adds to juxtaposition of the ramshackled slums and sewers. Overall graphically it is a very stunning game.Now gameplay. There are few things to talk about here. One is combat mechanics. This game takes an interesting approach to melee Arkham like combat. It has customizable combos, which can be accessed and altered at any time through the Combos Lab. This is a really cool idea and I love the game even more for it. The second thing to talk about is the memory remix sections. This is where you remix a person's memory so that their perception of reality is shifted in one case turning enemy into ally. This is a part of the story and part of the more morally questionable aspect of the protagonist Nilin.Lastly the story. I have to say I loved it. But then again I'm a huge fan of the Cyberpunk genre. If you don't like cyberpunk stories than you probably wont like this one. I thought is was a brilliant depication of a dystopian society masquerading as a utopia. Last advise: If you plan to get this game use a gamepad. With these melee combo centred games I prefer to use a gamepad. It just feels better.			"

												Remember Me is pretty good. Not great, but definitely not bad. Decent characters, interesting premise, okay story, reasonably fun gameplay. The combat is not as good as say Batman: Arkham Asylum or City, but it's still pretty decent. I'd say it's a game worth getting, especially on sale.You'll want to play this with a game-pad, though. Keyboard/mouse control is rather weak and not fun. Beware: it may be very unstable on less than optimal systems. I could not play the game beyond the intro without a crash-to-desktop on my old machine (a 2011 2.4GHz i7 MacBookPro 8GB RAM w/ 1GB Radeon 6770M and Win7 64), even with all of the settings set to their lowest. The game runs like a dream on my current machine (a current MSi Dominator Pro 24GB RAM with GeForce GTX 880M). Basically, you're definitely going to want to have power to run the game smoothly and stably.			"

												*Small spoilers alert*, you will see some things I say right in the start of the game so it won't ruin anything really.This game was really fun for me. Putting it on memory hunter difficulty (hard) will make the game actually a challenge, you die in a few hit from even the standard mobs. The mobs in the game have interesting abilitys that make them unique and can make you have to rethink how you must take them down and who you must take down first. I love how you can change your combos and what each hit does at any point in the game. The fact that your character has no memories and you are just asked to believe the past other people say you have makes the game interesting it leaves you open for some plot twists and leaves you trying to find your characters backstory to fill the gaps that even your character is trying to fill.9/10			"

												So I just be the game today and here's my take on it. Hope it helps for those considering to purchase this game!Story, Art, and Characters - Simply amazing. Everything in the game has great textures and you can see the developers really focused on making sure the graphics in every scene were done carefully to ensure a complete masterpiece. The story is very interesting, as you watch the main character struggle to find her identity, struggle with morality, and the broken society. If you like philosophy, you may enjoy this game as it quotes some historic guruus.  The cutscenes are unskippable which makes replaying some levels a pain. Also this is a straightforward, single-result (meaning no different endings) type of game with no side-missions or quests.Gameplay - Standard fights are repetitive, relying on the same button combos and limited variety of enemies. Often, I had to put the game down because the gameplay was too repetitive and not fun. However, the ""remixing of memories"" a feature used 4-5 times in the entire game was a blast and I wish the developers made that more prominent in this game. In addition, it took me about 8 hours of gameplay to beat it once through without searching for hidden items or achievement hunt.If you like a game that has beautiful art that takes ""Inception"" to a completely different level and that you don't mind putting down due to repetitive fighting and moving around the areas, then this should definately be a consideration to add to your library:			"

												I found Remember Me to be a pretty epic game, although I thought it a bit flawed.The world the game takes place is amazing, graphics are great (apart from some plastic lookig skin textures on the main character) and the developers seem to have spent much care in making a detailed world. The lore and backstory to the world is a different take on usual dystopian scenarios. On the downstide for the most part the game couldnt' get much more linear if it was a simple straight line. And I'm sure ""invisible walls"" went out many years ago. Or are at least better disguised. But those are minor points.Soundtrack is also awesome and fits in well with the game.Story was great. (I'm sensing a theme here :) )The combo system was an interesting mechanic I haven't really come across in other games. It worked well, albeit somewhat frustrating. In fact, my main peeve with this game was the damn combat as it's mostly nothing but mashing the left or right mouse button (with a few special actions thown in as you progress). Another letdown was the combat scenarious as time and time again they would trigger some foes to fight, then as soon as you dusted them off, they doubled the number of foes and had you go at it again. I didn't enjoy that, although the difficulty wasn't that hard really.Gameplay wise was nothing special - lots of platforming and with some akward camera angles at times. It worked though.As I said, the story was interesting, thought provoking, and easily capabably of producing a range of emotions. Without going into specifics for spoilers, I found one aspect of the remix sequences to be somewhat disurbing, doubly so when it was revisted towards the end of the game. However, as with so many things, it's down to personal experiances - and if you've never experianced this thing in RL, then you probably won't be fazed by this sequence in game either.So I found the combat flawed and the story disturbing at times but everything else top notch and well worth the play time.Hopefully some other games in this world will be released in the future.

 -So empty , But yet so true , The past is a foreign country- Well , when we talk about a game developed by a french studio then 2 things will blow your mind: the Story & the artwork.this game isn't mirror's edge or another hack N slash game , its way different.Its basically a new mix of martial art game , where you can mix combos of your own , light puzzle in an extraordinary style and light platforming.basically:-Graphics in this game is very decent and fair enough , artwork , textures , colors choice is really really awesome.-Gameplay is way too smooth , no glitches or bugs , yet you can also create your own combos , gives you more freedom in combat.-Soundtrack in this game is pretty much awesome , vocal choices are neat ( wish i know who was it ) , the timeing of soundtracks are well set aswell.-Story , is mind blowing , not only full of plot twists but you will get to make the plot twists yourself !!.-Artwork in this game is really going to catch your eyes , basically each scene of this game is full of artwork that you will have to pause and enjoy it for a few secs.-Puzzle in this game was sort of too easy and weak , but its pretty much a whole new style of puzzle , no need to spolier you will know as soon as you play it.generally its a must to play game , it was so enjoyable and it leaves you wishing for a Remember Me 2. <-episode 2. i recommend this game in full price or sale price , tottaly worth it either ways. 9.5/10.

												It is rare when I am stunned by a game.  Often games can be entertaining, visually stunning or encompase complex story arcs, but rarely do they acheive all three.Remember Me is a beautiful game.  I lost count how many times I just sat back and looked at the environment, often getting attacked in the process.  The combat is not complex (once you get used to it) and by the end you flow around your enermy, dancing between blows like a ballet of violance.The story is imaginative, thoughtful and well written, with strong voice acting and presence.  In the end you drift past the combat, knowing that your enermy will meet their poetic demise, because all you desire is to understand the next glimpse of your fractured memory.This game is a cross between Deus Ex, Mirrors Edge and a film I used to love called Renaissance (2006 staring Daniel Craig).If I were to critic this game, and I am loathed to do so, it is a little short and I completed it in about 10 hours.

												I've just finished Remember Me and, truth be told, I have mixed feelings. Did I enjoy it? Well... yes. And no. I really can't bring myself to rate the game as a whole, so I'm just going to give it two ratings:Gameplay: 4/10Story: 8/10Let's start with pros: the story is really nice. I don't suppose it'll make you cry manly tears like Life is Strange did, but, eh, whatever - it's pretty damn solid nonetheless. At times it's touching, at times it's disturbing... and above all, it makes you think. the idea behind the game is interesting, though not really science-y. artstyle is really cool. I'm not sure why exactly, but I love the real-life overlay/HUD that Sensen provides. Voice Acting is not terrible. animations are well done. Maggie Said it First I liked the two riddles that appear in the game.And now, cons: controls are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AWFUL at times (K+M, not sure about pad). Climbing is alright, but that telekinesis-thingy absolutely drove me nuts. Memory-mixing sequences can get under your skin, too. Remember Me's combat system heavily relies upon combos - it just seems logical that the game would allow you to continue your combo on a different opponent, no? And yet the game doesn't let you to do that, unless you jump over (not just dodge to the side) another enemy and THEN smack him/it (the same one you just jumped over, which might not be that easy, because controls can be quite wonky and you usually fight multiple opponents). It truly does amaze me. Elite Enforcers. You'll understand once you've played it. sadly, thanks to the three points above, combat felt like a chore to me. music... it is there, but it's like it wasn't. do you know that feeling when you just finished that few-minutes-long bossfight and the game crashed right before your progress saved, and thus you had to beat the boss once again? Yeah, that. I had to feel that TWICE while playing Remember Me - game just bugged and all I could do was to load the last checkpoint, beat the boss again and pray this time will be different. Happened to me on two separate occasions. a game couldn't get any more linear. gameplay gets really repetitive after a while.Do I recommend it? If you like story-driven games - yeah, sure! Remember Me is a game that is worth playing, even if only for its plot. But be warned - if it is a good gameplay you seek, you most likely will be disappointed.Remember you soon!			"

												I heard about this game after I played Mirror's Edge. Also I read that this game has elements known from Assassin's Creed series. Screenshots and videos looked very encouragingly therefore I gave a try and bought this game when Capcom gave discount for their games. Fighting system is pretty simple but good thing is that you can mix effects for your moves and create your own combinations depending on your needs. Like in Enslaved: Odyssey to the West I like also that you earn experience for defeated enemies and you can improve your character fighting style. Unique element of this game is that Nilin can change other person's memories which totally change their point of view and personality. Story is not very original but anyway is pretty interesting and addictive. Atmosphere of this game reminds me a little Half-Life 2 (anti-utopian world based on slaving people) but Remember Me is much more colorful and polished. Overall in my opinion it is very good game and if you like action-adventure games like Batman Arkham City, Tomb Raider 2013 or Enslaved: Odyssey to the West, I highly recommend.			"

												I really, really, really, really wanted to like this game. It's pretty. It has nice music. It has some innovative aspects to it. The story seems interesting, at least up to where I've played it (about halfway through). But the controls - at least with keyboard and mouse - make it infuriating. On top of this, the game's camera always seems to want to look slightly in a wrong direction (up / down). Using the FOV hack helps with this somewhat, but it's still annoying.Still planning on dragging myself through it, but.. it could be so, so much better, with relatively little effort on the controls and the camera.

												I've only played this game because it was made by Dontnod and had to try it after finishing Life is Strange. Ofc I didn't expect anything closer to that in quality but thought it worth a try. And well, yes it did. It's a good game. Not great but not bad either. It's just a good game.I recommend it but only if you like TPS hack and slash games (DMC, God of War, Darksiders etc.) and platformers (like Tomb Raider for example). Because the game is the combination of these two genres. You either playing a platformer going through Neo-Paris and its buildings or fighting the enemy. There isn't too much ""downtime"" in the game.The art and music are gorgeous but not everything is the outside... And here lies the problems. Mostly two big things. 1. The main ""selling point"" of the game, the memory remix, is limited. You will only use it _FOUR_ times in the whole game and only in scripted scenes. And it's a sequence puzzle nothing more. That's a big letdown, I was expecting something like Watch Dogs where you can interact with everyone...2. The game is incredibly linear and the combat is even more repetitive. You basically do the same thing through the whole game from the first minutes until the very last. To make it worse the combat system is broken in the sense that you can chain your abilities together in a way that you will never die... Not that it's bad but makes the whole game really really really easy (final boss fight was like 3 mins long max).The story is pretty good and that's why I kept playing. Once again it's not Life is Strange level but you can see and feel it was made by Dontnod. Can't tell anymore about it because otherwise I'd spoil it...Give it a shot, but only buy it on sale (5€ max)			"

												This combat system has a different approach to others with similar setup like Devil May Cry. In Remember me you don't go for the highest combat combo for an S-Rank score. The combo's are too short to make that even work. Once you complete a combo string then the counter starts anew. How combo's work in this game is too simply combine damage, cool down or health regen to it. And that shows right away how they're supposed to function in combination with the Sensen skills. You don't use the combo's to actually kill hordes of trash mobs like you would in similar games. Sure you can kill some and then overload their brain, but the majority of damage output comes from using the Sensen. So the combo's are there mainly for health regen so you can survive hordes of opponents with ease... combined with coold down reduction till your next Sensen attack is possible. This reduces battles often to tedious tests of patience where I want too attack, but have too wait for the right Sensen to come off cool down to deal with the specific opponent. On top of that the protaganist is nice and mobile as well as reactionairy in controls when dealing with many opponents at once. You can easily jump over them while maintaining the continuation of the combo. All opponents, even those invisible or off screen, have a noticable ""gotham arkham""-ish indicator to show their incoming attack.This change in mindset isn't what people expect from games with this style of combat. Thus they have trouble grasping it and finding it frustrating. That is not too say there aren't frustrating moments in the game. In some boss fights the QTE's aren't always visible enough. This can result in a repeated sequence until it is noticed by the player. I had such a moment that took me almost a dozen times too repeat and had no idea why. Which brings me to the point of communication information to the player. There are moments where the game keeps repeating the fact you need to use a certain attack, but other times no information is given on what to do. Personally I didn't find this bothersome since I enjoy solving situations. On top of that I look at which mechanics are introduced and then can come to the right conclusion on how to proceed.The other part of the game relates to what you see in many action-adventure style games such as the new Tombraider reboots and Uncharted...namely the platforming and scaling walls. This works really smooth. So smooth even that I hardly feel involved most of the time. Only issue I have is that graphically the ledges aren't always clearly visible to indicate what path too take. Therefore the yellow indicators come into play in order to guide the player forward. Personally I find this at times helpfull when stuck, but other times insulting. I'd rather have seen a bit more contrast in which ledges could be used as part of figuring out the route to go.I quite enjoyed many design choices in this game, but some don't really get fleshed out fully it seems.Still it is a very enjoyable game with a cool story and some amazingly beautiful vista's. The story uses elements you'd normally see in time travel related stories. Since it now takes part in the minds of people this same element feels more at home and properly utilized. There are puzzles and lots of different things to do during a lineair progression.Definately a game worth grabbing. It isn't a top of the line game in my opinion, but for a sub-maximal game it is still a lot of fun.			"

												Now, here is my problem with Remember Me, and don't expect me to say story or graphics or anything else that I can just let slide by.The gameplay is terrible. You will expect something easy to pick up like DmC's combat where you can join combos together and create new combos. Except you can't. You're stuck with using X-X-X as a combo, and quite litterally the only attack. Then you unlock X-Y-X. This type of system would work. That is if all options to throw into the combo were available at the start. They aren't, instead you're stuck with hitting the same button three times to kill someone. Or hitting X-Y-X to kill someone. Which sucks because the rest of the game I liked, except for that one combat system.			"

												Remember Me is ambitious in its goal, but does it accomplish it?The setup is the developer wants you to trudge through about 10 hours of terrible story, pathetic game mechanics, and repetitive platforming to reach the ending.And what is the ending, you ask? Why it is a comedic masterpiece where the developer actually thinks someone would want to play or even cares about a sequel to this garbage with a clunky setup for the next installment in this series. Lulz, they thought they were going to make a sequel to this terrible game.It is so funny that it would almost make you not regret having ever played or even heard about this game.But it doesn't. Cuz this game is garbage.Even for free, you are better off spending your time doodling in MS Paint or staring at a blank word document.Story is bad, gameplay is a misleading word because this isn't fun to play, and logic & reason have no place in this game's universe.""Remember Me""? More like ""Nah. Forget I ever existed, please. KTHXBAI.""			"

												At barely 2 hours played I can't say if I've given this game a fair go - but I can't stand it. There's so much going on that it makes me feel mean to say how interminably DULL I think it is. It's a gorgeous world, it's got some interesting ideas, I just can't recommend it unless you're someone who loved and finished oni, mirror's edge AND hydrophobia. Bored me to quitting. The price is right at least.			"

												Way too difficult for me.What a shame. This visually stunning game is too focused on its combat. They overdesigned it. I simply gave up after multiple attempts on a certain step not even far in the game. Sorry folks, if you don't manage to have an easy setting which allows me to enjoy the gorgeous game at my own pace, you lost it.Who came up with the stupid (!) idea that you can only chain combos against a single enemy. Designers, look at Batman or Mad Max and learn from this. Pro: Gorgeous settings, great story.Con: Too difficult, twitchy animation. The combo breaking interruptions by the other enemys killed the game for me at a too early stage. Such a shame.			"

												Hands down the worst character action game on Steam, these people have never played a CAG in their lives.Combat is sluggish and combos break from one enemy to another (which doesn't work since the combat is 100% combo based), gameplay overall is just ""meh"". Which also goes for the feel of the game, it doesn't look good, it doesn't run well and it sure as hell isn't a joy to play.Not to mention QTE's that are only present when fighting 2 enemies in the game, forced analog twitching and unskippable cutscenes (because these devs think that anyone cares about their insanely cliche story that you can predict miles ahead of the game itself).Remember Me should be renamed to Forget This because no one will remember this abomination in a couple of years.

												(PC, no game controler): unless gifted, don't touch. Game for consolepros: nice enviroment, interesting sci-fi story, soundtrackcons: terrible floating camera, one button action, auto aim, low textures, ""don't think, go to orange marker""The graphics in this game seem to consume a lot of resources despite low textures and overall ""medium"" visual quality.The camera work feels pretty vague and sometimes it gets switched to another corner in the area which is very confusing. Menu control is without any cursor and feels odd, too. Combat mainly consists of pressing one or two buttons, sometimes you have to evade. ""Objectives"" are no thinkers, just follow the orange marker we give you.Final conclusion: This game is not fun to play. It's more a game to be watched than a game to be played.			"

												Let me start the review by saying something, I love this games concept. The idea of having memories be more than they are in the world we know around us is a very unique concept. I have always liked the story of the underdog fighting against corrupt corperations. But there is alot of flaws with this game. First off, it's in third person. Why? What is the point? You make a game about living through someone elses perspective and you make it so you feel distanced from the character. Not only that fact of the third person but the camera angles are very wierd. Why add ♥♥♥♥♥♥ parkour elements into this game? This is not the mirrors edge parkour its the godawful uncharted parkour. It feels out of place even in an adventure game, so why put it in a game not even related at all to parkour? It feels out of place and just breaks up the ""action"". The fighting in this game is so dumb you right click and left click to do unsatisfying combos that are bland at most.			"

												The long and short of it is that this game plays like a more linear, less interesting, less fluid Assassin's Creed. Despite picking it up on sale for 6 bucks, I still regret the purchase and the time I invested in the game.Pros:-Potentially interesting world and concept-Soundtrack is good but fairly repetitiveCons:-Every aspect of the game is ridiculously easy. Combat is a piece of cake even on the highest difficulty, and the game completely holds your hand through the parkouring elements (seriously, the whole game feels like a tutorial level).-English voice acting is pretty bad, and if you decide to use French instead with English subs, you miss out on all the side conversations/chatter that for some reason aren't subtitled.-Annoyingly buggy. Hitboxes sometimes feel way off, and on multiple occasions I had to reload the game due to falling through the world or part of the area getting stuck when I should have been able to move it with my Spammer.-Related to above: the game doesn't seem to play nice with controllers. Button prompts would show up with controller buttons half the time and keyboard buttons the other half when I was playing with a controller. Certain moves (targeted S-pressens) I found literally impossible to use with a controller during their tutorial phases and had to switch to keyboard for a short period.-The story just isn't that appealing, and the characters are very one-dimensional and not terribly believable. -The game feels riddled with terrible plot holes. For example, in the first chapter of the game you alter someone's memory to believe that their fiance was killed by the people who are targeting you, in an attempt to keep her from killing you. It works, and then... we never hear from her again. Seriously. She somehow never figures out that her fiance is actually still alive.-Very very linear. It's impossible to even backtrack through levels, with doors immediately and permanently closing behind you as you make your way through corridors. Went the right way but wanted to look for collectibles/powerups? Too bad!-The game raises interesting moral questions and the protagonist herself seemingly struggles with things she's done... and then it's all ignored as she brazenly continues on the same path without any seeming hesitation or regret aside from the interludes between chapters. It feels very unsatisfying and disconnected.-Ugly. For a fairly recent game, the look of the game is honestly abysmal save for the character models and interface. This would be forgiveable if gameplay was good, but... yeah.-The camera is pretty terrible in some parts of the game - strangely, more often in the open than in tight corridors. Not sure what's going on there.In the end I couldn't even bother to finish the game, stopping about 75% of the way through and watching the rest on youtube while I was cooking. And yeah, the ending is pretty unsatisfying too.TL;DR?Buy some of the earlier Assassin's Creed games (the most similar to this title without being bad, imo) or really any other action game out there. Unless you're scraping the bottom of the barrel, I wouldn't bother picking this up even on sale. And, not to disparage anyone's taste, but whoever is saying stuff like ""great story"" or ""this game is like a good book"" must be pulling from a pretty small sample.			"

												Not entirely a negative review. Amazing world, beautifully designed, and lovely soundtrack. I was hyped up about this game for several reasons (female protagonist for one! As a  gamer who happens to be a girl I can't have never enough of female-centered games) and I really, really wanted to like this one, but I just...can't. -The game design is not ideal (ie some camera angles while interesting and ""artsy"" could hide visual clues about the path you have to follow, not to mention they may cause motion sickness esp during fights, there is almost no interaction with the environments and ZERO with NPCs, etc)-The combat system isn't that good eitherThese are just two examples of why the whole experience isn't particularly pleasurable, nor satisfying. And besides, I found it buggy. NGL, I lost count of the number of times I kept kicking or punching and the controls weren't responding for long seconds (funnily enough, dodging worked fine all the time). That said,  I HAAAAATE how the bossfights have been set up. Actually, this is the main reason why i'm rage-quitting Remember me even though it pains me to do so: the bossfights. UGHHHHH. I'm really not interested in playing the same thing over and over just because random glitches were freezing some of my controls or because at the last second I messed up the QTE sequence. And speaking of, QTE sequences. Seriously?!? On the plus side, the memory remixes? Niiice! The combo lab was a good idea, but I wish TPTB had made it more flexible (more combos with no restrictions on the assign-able slots).  I can't tell much about the story or characters' backstory cos I got stuck before I could form a solid opinion. They seemed promising though.  I would have LOVED RM had it been Open World. Seriously, Neo Paris looks so good and interesting. TL;DR. It could have been an amazing game. It's not. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, but it's certainly lacking in some regards. My heart says give it a positive review for the effort (and it does look GOOD) but my brain says nope, solely for the less-than-stellar fight system. Why oh why the combat was so repetitive and vital to move the plot forward?			"

												Looks great, but fighting system is boring, gameplay is mediocre. The opening stages are boring with a pointlessly convoluted design just to pad things out (Have to go to bar? Instead of just walking there, fight through hordes of mutants and manipulate machines in the city. Because you can't just walk down the sidewalk). Memory puzzles are interesting, but the rest of the game isn't worth playing to get to them.			"

												I am around mid-game, so please bear that in mind reading this review.Before purchasing this I read other reviews and thought - good story, but a rather lacklustre gameplay.I like a good plot, at a lowered price this could work for me.Shame, but it's still a big disappointment, even at 10$. I couldn't recommend this to anyone due to gameplay quality. It feels like an obstacle to reveal more elements of the story (which feel ok BTW), and a very unpleasant one. Watching a youtube gameplay will be much more interesting for me (storywise) than ""playing"" this linear,  boring, unrewarding mess. If you like a good  tale - watch this on YT.

And there was some very long and involved explanation of powers and combo points but as far as I can tell, you just mash the left mouse, space and dodge.The view is sometimes very cramped and hard to get visibility in- but if I wasn't so spoiled it might be a good story and world.

Then Powers wich will buff you with more strength or stun all enemies around you but these are not enough to save the combat from feeling boring and repetitive.

												Very linear, combat is annoying, although reminscent of your average arcade fighter with combos, which you can customize, some of which can actually heal you for some unknown reason. - how the heck can you get healing from punching someone?Also, for a game about memory issues, there's way too much combat. Combat should be a sideline, not something you're encountering at every turn. It seems to be there just to slow you down and lengthen gameplay. It really doesn't feel like it adds anything worthwhile.I give it full points on a great, well developped story, but gameplay is barely mediocre.I haven't finished Episode 1 and probably never will. I regret buying it, fooled by the great story I could see into buying a game I don't enjoy.*** Noting that most of my experience on the story comes from the website and less from the actual game.

												I had great expectations on this one, but left it unfinished. The game doesn't know what it wants to be. You could mistake it for Assassin's Creed in a Deus Ex or Mirror's Edge world, but it's more like Mortal Combat with long hauls between the fights and an unnecessarily elaborated combat system. The fine graphic design and cool futuristic environments makes you want to explore, but you can't, except for one pre-determined route from A to B (B for boss fight). This is one of those games where you will encounter invisible walls or having trouble finding a way forward (because there's only one). Thumbs up for much of the design work, but otherwise it's wasted effort.			"

												While the game is pretty and visually enjoyable at times with an interesting back-story the gameplay is greatly lacking. The progress is along a set path that cannot be deviated from and the fight mechanic timing requirement is another disappointment.The interesting backdrop of Neo-Paris begs to be explored as an open world experience and to allow the player to jump, climb and crawl almost anywhere should have been a requirement. The path between objectives is a set path with no deviation except for small side paths to gather items to aid the charater or reveal more history of the events leading to the core plot.I wish they had built the abilty to explore Neo-Paris for this game to expand on the play time and experience. Instead we are forced into a boring linear progress that I find frustrating.			"

												It's unfortunate, but I can't recommend this game UNLESS IT'S ON SALE. The Story is GREAT. You play a woman unsure of her past while battling through the future. Altering memories in her wake. The idea of the game is good, but the world, while beautifully done, is very linear. There is no exploration at all. You will go where the you are supposed to go. No where else. Which brings down the replay value.  The fighting system is fun, in that you pick the values of each part of a combo. HOWEVER, the combo doesn't reach beyond one enemy. So getting a max combo is very hard to accomplish unless there is only one enemy to face. If you get hit or move out of the away to avoid a hit, the combo starts over. Had it carried on in a sort of ""free flow"" then it would have been much better. OVERALL: 5/10			"

												One of the best games I've ever played.The environment although linear was amazing to look at and the world felt alive and was full of motion.The story was great and Nilin is a great character,although the story could use some more depth it's good enough to enjoy it.The combat was an interesting part of the game but not very well implemented,it gets quite repetitive near the end even with the addition of new combos.Here's a list of things that sum up the game:An interesting world with a lot of potential and a unique artistic style.A great soundtrack wich I personaly admire,one of the best I've ever heard.Intersting characters with undeveloped backstories.Challengeing battles and new enemy types wich require different strategies as the game goes on.A bunch of visually stunning boss battles.A great story wich could use some more depth but is good nonetheless.A kind of uncomfortable build-your-own combo system.Great voice acting.If you're a fan of cyberpunk games but don't want to pay full price for the game wait for a sale and buy it.

Its like a video game made by people that have only heard of video games second hand and did an awful job of mimicking what they think video games might be.   The plot is stupid, the soundtrack awful, and is basically an awful mix and match of parts that don't work together.  No amount of memory remixing could make you think this game is good.Oh and the camera is laughably bad.			"

												This is one of the most rage inducing games I have played in so long. It commits nearly every cardinal sin of gaming. It's repetitive, annoying, spammy and every single bossfight is done via quicktime events. There isn't any point in the combat system that i'd say ""Yep, it's fun"". It's just a series of endlessly respawning dudes while you mash the LMB. I say mashing the LMB because at a certain point in the game, it just becomes too much work to actually get a combo out without being interrupted or having the system spazz out and switch your combo halfway through.Anyone who was thinking of buying the game for the story, like I did, think again. The premise is interesting but the game has plenty of plotholes, along with the long despised ""Get the story narrated in the load screen then never speak of it for the rest of the level"" style that so many people seem to go with. Not to mention, Nilin isn't incredibly interesting. For all the hype the game got about ""demanding a female character"" I can't think of a single reason why, other than to make their game completely parallel with Tomb Raider. Nilin has little to no personality. Not once does she stop and ask herself WHY she's doing the things she is. She escapes the people who stole her memories and then just automatically listens to the first guy she meets. For all she knows he's actually the evil one, but not once in my entire playthrough did she even consider it. Mind you, I only got in halfway to the game cos I was so infuriated by the first half. It was not fun, and I have no intention of dragging my way through the muck for an ending that may or may not ever redeem the rest. Buyer, you have been warned.			"

												Played the game from start to finish in just over 14 hours. The graphics are beautiful, the storyline is excellent and the overall atmosphere was great. A few things that lack in this game like a parry system, there is no way to block incoming attacks. The chevrons that tell you where to go next take all the fun out of trying to get to the next area and the lack of exploring (none of the shops, etc) you only have a set path to follow. Also, the mobs are the same and are a little annoying and repetative. This game also has a function where you can rewrite the past and tap into peoples memories. This happens 4 times and is challenging but makes the game feel as if it lacks content as it is limited. Overall, the lack of open world explorability combined with the repetaive mobs and the lack of game content made me sad. Unfortunately, I wish I had known about this before purchasing it (on sale for approx $9.99) as I probably would have passed.			"

												I bought this because I loved Dontnod's second game, ""Life is Strange."" I also bought it because of Steam sale. I just spent 9 hours playing this and beat it. I reget both decisions.I can see how the studio grew from Remember Me's beginnings, including seeds that would blossom into Life is Strange's time travel mechanic. It wasn't worth the time I spent frustratingly playing this game, though. Just watch a Let's Play and support Dontnod by buying your friends copies of Life is Strange. That game is genuinly my 2015 GOTY, and that comes from a Metal Gear Solid fanatic who adored MGSV.To get into more specifics: the gameplay is really plain/frustrating/stupid/immersion-breaking, only punctuated by its most unique aspect of ""remixing memories"" around 3 times total out of my 9 hours of gameplay. The rest is spent holding up and jumping around a lot, along with the most annoying and frustrating combat system and enemy AI routines you can imagine. Its not worth your frustration.Oh, and the writing is god-awful. The voice acting for the guy who talks to you throughout the game couldn't be flatter if it tried. Its very obvious they went and got a French native to try to act in English. Or if they didn't it sure feels like it, much like most flat acting that you might find in some of Quantic Dream's very obvious characters with French actors speaking with an American accent. Thank god they got some great actors for Life is Strange.But really, just go play Life is Strange instead of this.			"

												Where do I go with this review. You have one of the most interesting topics to deal with; manipulation of memory. This screams stealth game with rpg elements. The ability to manipulate the characters around you would be invaluable as a spy, or a thief, maybe not an assassin, but still. The developers could also have added rpg elements, even if they are light elements to deal with. The ability to effect those around you for whatever purpose would be amazing. Yet they wasted such a great opportunity in this nice looking world on a beat em up action game with scripted boss battles, linear environments, and the concept of memory manipulation not only is never explained on how it works, but it is so rarely used, it might as well not even be in the game at all. Your run of a mill beat em up with so much wasted potential down the drain. With it's already bland gameplay come with fairly bland characters, and fairly bland mechanics.			"

												Key feature is investigating others memories and changing them is .. boring. E.g. Mass effect's cinematics (where you right click or left click do act good or bad accordingly) is waaay better idea to influence on what will happens.Pros:- beauteful surroundings;- rich story;- visually appealing combat;- definetely AAA game.Cons:- crappy PC version: camera, UI navigation (menu-submenu-submenu and then all way back to close instead of quick keys for everything, we have 102 keys ALT/CTRL/SHIFT for reason), no intro skip, checkpoint saving without way to go back;- ""corridor-alike"" gameplay, exploring is not rewarding, nor you can go somewhere away;- non-skippable LOUD intros (it ignores in-game sound volume settings, literally BLOWING with that ""NVIDIA"" intro upon launch and I am ATI fan tbh), I know advertisemens are must, but making them this way deserves a sweet hit into balls.. at least;- acrobatic is overrated, really, there is no need to have so much, it's easy, but time-consuming, coupled with crappy camera it makes gameplay more like annoying.P.S.: threat this as a first impression, but it's definetely agains finishing this game of spending at least 5 more minutes with it.

What an annoying piece of crap, it seems not to fit with the rest of the game.I think they should have put more time into making more out of the puzzle solving in the game, there is so much going for the game overall. Its pretty interesting and occaisionally challenging trying not to fall to your death! That is what is unique about this game, and it has such a great interesting main character, and is very original, and has a fantastic style. I am continuing playing it, as the good outweighs the negative slightly, such a shame to add in the generic boss battles when it already has such cool atmosphere and protagonist!  I dont recommend due to the boss battles, which i think sucked.			"

												Remember Me has had a very mixed reception, but it's one of my favorite games of the last generation. Beautiful set pieces, a nice soundtrack, interesting original story, well realized setting, and a main character who is both powerful and vulnerable, and defies a lot of game character norms, really make it something special. The only things that the game is let down by is being extremely linear and not having the best combat system ever devised. Neither of which bothered me tremendously, especially since the combat isn't broken, it just gets repetitive. Oh, and the dialogue outside of cutscenes is a little... awful to the point of being unintentionally funny in places. But these are minor complaints with what is overall a top notch game.			"

												So, this game has a solid dystopian Science Fiction premise, a likeable protagonist, reasonably varied enemies and a solid fighting system. Puzzles and platforming exist but are not extremely arduous.The story is tol from the point of view of Nillin, who has a lot of interesting qualities. I really like that she reacts to situations in a reasonable manner. When she jumps down a flight of stairs she stumbles and cries out, because she just jumped down a flight of 10 stairs.Graphics are beautiful, the game runs great on my machine and is bug free. Controls are gernerally intuitive.The most interesting idea in this game is the memory remixing. Altering people's memories to change the way they feel currently feels exactly like cheating. One of the first times you do it, an enemy becomes a friend. It is awesome.Sometimes the fighting feels clunky, which I think is part of the design. Everytime you mess up her combos the music stops to let you know that you have messed up. This is great but it feels like her combos are more often messed up than not. I just came from playing Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor and the combat there is much smoother.Overall I would reccomend this game to anyone that enjoys Dystopian Science Fiction, or action games in general.7/10			"

												Could have been great, exploring the possibilities of memory alteration and its ramifications, but ended up as one long massively glorified quicktime event.I kept wanting to like this game. I kept going back to it in the hopes it would get better or grow on me.  I really did want to like it.  The graphics, music, story and characters truly are all great and I loved the artistic world that has been created.  The game truly does *look* great.  What lets it down is everything else.The trailer gives you the impression that the game centers around being able to modify peoples memories.  From that I had gotten the feeling that you could ""stealth around"" enemies or convert them rather than rely on direct confrontation every time. Sadly though the memory remix moments are few and far between and they are (like the game in general) far too linear, there being only one ""right"" way to remix the memory.  This seems like a bit of a missed opportunuty in my opinion, there could have been so much more focus on the memory scrambling and altering abilities in the game.What little story there is between chases, telegraphed bosses and too-long quicktime chain cutscenes made me want to carry on to see how it went. The story is actually compelling and interesting and I wanted to see if/how the character could grow.  But time and again the QTE based fighting and QTE based running away along with the stiffling train-track limited ""open"" world the game was just ruined.I liked the main character, her self questioning, her reassessment of what she had become forcing us to question our own motives and morals.But with a combat system that is more an exercise in futile button mashing and enemy avoidance than actual combat I really cant recommend this to any but the most die-hard of QTE fans.

												this is a very poorly designed game which has almost nothing interesting going for it from the start.the game knows only one way to be played and that way is executed in the most uninspired way possible. i purchased this because i was intrigued by the distopian setting. however, right away, i was quickly turned of by the poor gaming mechanics. the story didn't present anything new but stereotypes. ""remember me"" is basically unplayable.i had hoped the game gets better but at episode 3, i have lost all hope.what is the problem? well, first of all it is a long corridor of a game, there is no exploration, the world is dead and cannot be delved into. occasionally, the game throws two choices of directions at you, one will lead to a bonus pick-up, the other continuous the corridor. it is not obvious which is which but if you are unlucky to choose the continuous path first, the game will put a wall behind you which prevents you from getting the bouns from the othe path.some of the vista look interesting with people and shops, but these cannot be interacted with, so there is practically a detachment between what you do and what is going on in the world.This is re-inforced by the way of traversing the environment. climbable areas are marked by flashy graphics or distance indicators. this could be a horizontal ridge in 2 meter height. this you could jump to. but don't expect to travers a small barricade of 1m cardboard boxes. these are insurmountable barriers in the game.occasionally you will reach the end of a corridor, surrounded by high walls. from the konowledge of the world you would know because of lack of indicators that you couldn't possibly ""escape"" that area. yet, the game will bring up a cut scene which makes it somehow possible. this becomes predictable soon. the point is, the game is completele unintuitive, things that should be logically possible are not, impossible things are somehow possible. eventually, you feel mucked by this, because the game forces you onto a path that you couldn't possibly comprehend as a person in the world in advance. you are stumbling through corridors...than, there are fighting scenes. the system is kind of intruiging, but umplayable because of the out-of controll camera. it basically surmounts to panic clicking of buttons while the camera gives no view of what is going on.finally, there are scenes of ""memory manipulation"" while the control mechanism is a joke, this was the only part that was interesting in the game, because you get intrigued about what effect each manipulation had.perhaps the game would have been more interesting if they had cut the traversing in corridors between memory manipulation mini games.i cannot recommend this game.

												Gawd, I really want to recommend this game.  It is just so beautiful!  But it is just so painful to play!  The biggest problem is that the core of the game is the fight mechanics, which are terrible button-mashing gymnastics to get the right combo for the right enemy at the right time.  Meanwhile, the parts of the game that are actually /awesome/ -- editing of memories, and exploring the beautiful world -- is only used a tiny number of times.I really want you to spend your money on this game, because I want some stuffed shirt in an office somewhere to think that building great neo-cyberpunk is a safe bet.  But I just can't in good faith recommend it.You know, there's an art book for this game.  Maybe you should just buy that?			"

												As much as I adored Nilin, whose model and voice actor are top notch stuff, I gotta say Remember Me really does line up to its metacritic score. I might even go a little lower on it: it is lacking critical polish in a lot of areas, and generally does not feel like a game built around either being fun or around telling a compelling story. It is wishy-washy and very samey in parts, with a lot of reptition and re-iteration. The visual design is excellent - seriously, the details put in are far above any other game I've played - but it just isn't a very good game.			"

												SF world which reminds me of Blade Runner's style. This game would be nice if the combat was more user-friendly. Esentially this is a series of boss-fights coonected with some climbing and finding of stuff, with some story elements. Music you hae to love or hate, luckily its loudness can be lowered. Conclusion:  I have had my fill with conami, capcom etc. and should know better than to try such games.			"

												I would have given a positive review but there are a few elements of the game that really bother me. I would however like to see a sequel made where they improve the flaws in this game's design.Don't get me wrong, there are many good things about the game: such as the setting, the graphics, the story and the main character (it is nice to have a brown coloured main character for once and the main character's design is really well done).But the good things aside, it is the flaws of the game that really hold it back for me and ruined the overall experience, for me.The first issue is the combat; it uses preset combos that you can customise, from the moment the game introduced the combat in this way I knew immediately - oh boy this game's combat is going to get very repetitive very fast! The issue when you have combos that are completely fixed with the same identical animation and same identical button combo each time is that it means you just have to keep pressing the same button combinations over, and over, and over the entire game long. Yes, you can change the combos but all it changes is the effects and the animations of the combo; the button presses remain the same. E.g. left click, right click, left click, right click. Sorry but I can only stand repeating this so often.There is a power for Batman style freeflow combat, but it is only temporary and feels a lot less satisfying than doing a combo which actually seems to do more damage than the freeflow power. It would have been cool if the freeflow power allowed unlimited combo as long as you could keep the combo going without a break in the combo (yes, I know, like Batman). This would have helped quite a bit. There are other powers you can use and if you damage some opponents enough you can use finishers, which are cool. But these only go a short way in helping the overall issue that is the combat in this game. It may have been interesting if you simply could customise the combo effects at different stages of the combo and the animations simply cycle through the ones they have made for that effect - this way at least you have more animation variety and this would allow them to give greater customisation to the combos. E.g. you could pick speed over damage and such too, which currently is not the case. Picking the same type of combo attack with a different animation does only that - same damage, same speed, just different animation.In addition, they could have allowed constant freeflow attacks but that do not give you a bonus effect and also reduced damage. These are just a few ideas and I'm not even a game developer.Then there is the platforming, in general it works but it has many issues with the controls and doesn't always work or do what you want. There are times I've made the same identical jump two times, one time she just randomly decides to fall right through the ledge she was supposed to grab, the other time she grabs it no problem. Then often while going around corners or trying to jump across a gap she just refuses to go the direction you want no matter what key press you push. I don't know if this is due to the port or if this was also an issue on the console versions but definitely is something they should have fixed. If not at launch, at least with an update!			"

												A highly underrated and underappreciated game, Remember Me delves into a cleverly written cyber-punk universe, where memories are everything. Traded, sold, erased, reconstructed, memories are no longer private, and as protagonist Nilin, you have the power to not only take memories... but remix them. Thrown into a prison with no recollection of who or what you once were, you are thrust into a dangerous world that teters on the brink of collapse. With only the mysterious Edge to guide you, you will have to fight your way through both humans, and their memory lost muntant Leaper counterparts. Story - Amazingly well written, I was completely immersed in this new cyber punk scenario the developers had bulit up. Gameplay - Combat is okay, but the combo lab is where it shines. Able to create your own combos, you can mix up how you approach battles to your liking. Platforming could've been executed a bit better though.Graphics - The Neo-Paris area is gorgeous to look at, though its too bad most of the time is spent in doors. Even then, the world of Remember Me is a stunning and visually astounding.Sound - The music has scratched up remixed like sounds thrown into a powerful electronic baseline, able to go from tension, to tender caring moments.Overall - An awesome game, and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone. Fantastic story, music, and art style makes Remember Me shine. While the gameplay isn't perfect, it still offers a good experience overall.			"

												It's ironic that the title of this game is Remember Me, because the developers and writers seem to forget the theme of the game within an hour of booting it up. Between an unfocused story line, weak dialogue, a hamfisted approach to making the game cinematic, a repetitive combat system, a poorly thought out exploration system (exploration is downplayed because the game is completely linear but there are little pick ups for those willing to take a few steps off the path, some of them flesh out the lore of the game, which could just be available to the player from the start) and a basically non-existent attempt to blend the story and the game aspects, the only real thing going for Remember Me is the distinct visual style. The game is gorgeous but bland, the only gameplay aspect that really mixes things up is the memory remix mechanic, which is utilized in game 4 times throughout the entire thing, for a total of less than an hour of any kind of unique experience.Just don't bother.

												I wanted to like this game. I bought it a few years ago and my older laptop couldn't get past the first memory glitch. after 10 times of trying I gave up on it. I came back to it on a new laptop. It got past that part.The  game is super repetitive in the combat. actually getting combos strung together is very un-intuitive. there's like a button lag. You think your next move is a kick but it's a punch. sort of like a que for the next attack even though you haven't even ended the current one yet. that lag is frustrating. i played this until the start of episode 5.Boss fights - suck. because you can't beat them unless you do the exact right combo at the end. which is STUPID. i went on youtube and watched all the cutscenes. because the story is so much better than the game itself. that is what this game is. you are literally waiting for the next cut scene. it's very compelling. i youtubed it because it's not worth my time playing this sub par game for cutscenes.would be a better 3 part movie instead of a video game. don't buy it, just watch it online			"

												This is an incredibly beautiful game/story ruined by an absolutely horrific combat system.  Imagine playing Arkham Asylum only without the ability to counter when a bad guy interrupts your combo chain. Instead, you can only dodge about and constantly reset said combo chain.  Which wouldn't be so bad if combos weren't a requirement for a) reloading your actually useful skills b) healing c) dealing specific damage to mini bosses.  It's awful.  I can't understand how anyone got past the demo version of this and said ""Yup, this feels organically frustrating, let's go with it.""  The fact that you can customize the combos doesn't help other than you can change the simple three button one - aka the only  one you'll consistently be able to do -  to whatever you really need at the moment.  Because there's no way you'll ever be able to pull off the five or seven combos with enough regularity to get through the game.  I've had this for months now, and still haven't bothered to beat it because I can't stand the fighting system after only thirty minutes or so of playing.  If you can just watch the story bits on Youtube that's probably better than buying this game, even on sale.			"

												+++ Breathtaking art direction, in-universe setting and concept.+++ Free-flowing, easy-to-learn brawl play.--- Tedious and meaningless platforming sections.--- Everyone but the protagonist is a throwaway character.--- Story pacing issues.--- Completely linear level design, with pseudo-secrets strewn about.--- Pace-breaking QTEs.While initially presenting a very promising concept, Remember Me never quite manages to capitalize on its strengths.  It has a wonderful world to offer, but the player is never really given the opportunity to explore it, and so the levels feel much like walking through a static museum.  For those who don't want to look around too much, this means levels boil down to satisfying although samey battle sequences, in-between platforming/acrobatic sections that are but a formality of button-pushing to get through, with the occasional fork in the road where one path leads to an upgrade some ten meters down - and so, what little exploration can be done ends up feeling shallow.Similarly, characters are introduced only to never be seen again, with the only constants being the protagonist and what best qualifies as her commanding officer.  The player is not given any time to relate to any secondary characters, and the 'major' enemies of the game are little more than items to check off a list.  It is difficult at best to want to beat a foe when the only exposure about them is given in occasional blurbs spread out in the ten minutes before encountering them.Perhaps the strongest point is the fighting, with the way the music changes with the intensity of the battle, and the impact noises are quite satisfying to hear.  The boss fights take it a step further, often serving as a test of the skills the player has learned so far - unfortunately many of those encounters must be finished with a QTE.  Failing those only results in a minor setback, but fact remains that the thrill of victory is heavily diminished once the player's seen the same finisher sequences 3-4 times.Overall, it feels like the 90s way of game design was applied to a 2010s title.  A whole lot could've been accomplished with the idea to create a rich game and mayhaps even a franchise, but the end result is ultimately little more than concept art in 3D.			"

												So... the best parts about this game are often understated: 1.) The storyline is imaginative, compelling and well told through cinematics and voice over - actually decent voice over!2.) The graphics are gorgeous, the music and sound effects are well done and the controls (for the most part) are smooth.3.) The UI is pretty informative. As a bonus, it's even tied into the storyline, which is something a lot of games don't do. 4.) Combat can feel pretty satisfying when you've statted up your customizable fighting combos appropriately. 5.) Speaking of combat, the game does a fair job of trying to spice things up by adding a lot of new abilities, mini games and puzzles to try to keep things interesting. Notice I said ""fair,"" more on this later...6.) The 'leveling' system feels appropriate. You often face monsters you've encountered before and when you meet them again in later levels, wrecking the monsters that wrecked you earlier feels, oh, so cathartic.  Are we done gushing? Ok, onto the terribad:1.) Game is repetative, Repetative, REPETITIVE. Did I mention, redundant? Oh, it's that too. Every episode, EVERY EPISODE follows the same sort of segmented sections: fight, ""explore""/puzzle, story time. Sometimes they come in different combinations, but you can always tell which segment you're about to encounter next. 2.) Despite the variety of activites the game presents, it tend to want to overwhelm you with combat, which normally isn't a bad thing. The combat in this game is primarily a brawler style combat system, so be prepared to mash X and Y. A LOT. This by itself isn't bad. However, the key to fighting is pulling off combos, which would be awesome if you weren't always fighting ABOUT 10 people who ALWAYS interrupt your combos. This greatly limits one's ability to pull off, say, a 6 or 9 string combo, making approximatley half of the features in the Combo Lab practically pointless. This also means a lot of time is devoted to flipping around the battle aimlessly whilst trying to avoid getting slaughtered by a huge mob of minions. And while I think the designers and artists deserve kudos for making the protagonist a lithe and fiesty brunette, I just don't think watching her flip around with her legs in the air is enough to excuse such tedious battles. Call me a feminist, I guess. Or a ""hardcore gamer."" But I digress...""What about bosses?"" you ask. ""Aren't you fighting them one on one?""Yes, but typically there's a lot of dodging and special activities that are required to make them vulnerable first- then when that happens, they typically call for reinforcements. Wash. Rinse. Repeat. 3.) CAMERA. ANGLES. FROM. HELL! Luckily the game never freezes in one of these angles, but it can be frustrating when you're trying to keep an eye on 6 monsters, navigate obstacles in the environment AND fight a boss that's shooting bombs at you from across the screen. 4.) So the ""About this game"" section kinda of lies. A LOT. --- It mentions ""A balanced mix of combat and exploration."" Firstly, I think if I had to log all the time I spent doing either activity it would be something more like 70/30 respectively. Plus, I'm not sure following a discrete path through the environment really counts as ""exploration.""--- It also mentions the ""Memory ReMix"" feature, which I will openly admit is one of the best parts of the game. However, I think you use it a total of 3 times in the whole game. So, returning to that previous note about ""balanced mix"" I think the break down becomes something like 70/27/3. So here I am, about 10 hours into the game, only about 75% of the way through and I'm asking myself, ""is it worth it to keep going?"" As it is, I have to drag myself to play this game over the 50 other games I've stockpiled during flash sale events. And a game that makes you ask yourself, ""Is it worth finishing?"" has problems with its fun factor.--EDIT 12/13/2015--So, less than a week later it seems my decision has been made for me. During a particular boss fight in Episode 7 th e game started to glitch out. ""Combat time"" continued to play even when I'd defeated all the enemies in the area and accomplished my mission goals. I had to burn a focus power to trigger the end of combat (luckily). Not ten seconds later I was unable to interact with a focus powerup. I thought it might be because I had to clear another conditional trigger because the Aug-Eye icon was flashing, indicating that there was something I needed to look at by pushing the down button on the D-Pad. Unfortunately, that wasn't working either. I managed to clear it by completing the next section of the area and unlocking a ladder. I ran back to the focus upgrade and still couldn't interact with it. Defeated I returned to the ladder, only to find that I COULDN'T INTERACT WITH IT EITHER! Effectively trapping me in the level. After having spent at least 5-7 minutes wading through a half dozen minions at a time to defeat the previous boss (not to mention the prior 3 bosses) I did not relish the idea of starting the episode over. So this game experience ends now.			"

												Remember me is a game that i probably will not remember in about a year or two. The game had a very good setting going for them but fell flat when it came to the protagonist story and certain aspects of the gameplay. It is not necessarily a bad game, it just isn't an enjoyable one. The Good part - The setting is amazing, it is 2084 Neo-Paris and they aced in every part of that. From the buildings to the people to the music. They made it very believable. The soundtrack is very unique and all the buildings that you enter does look like something you would see in 2084. They did it better than deus ex human revolution and binary domain in that regard. The memory remixes are extremely fun to play with and does not feel boring. You could mess around with it for 30 minutes each and it is a shame that there are only 4 in the entire campaign. S-Pressens (or Super combos) are a joy to use and each of them are unique. It's always fun to do different combinations of them.The bad part - for most of the story it is basically ""follow to leader"". Some random guy who came out of nowhere named ""Edge"" tells you how to escape a facility and you follow his orders for the entire story. The story gets a little interesting at some parts but never amazed me. The Pressens/ combos (not to be confused with S-Pressens) are really dull. They only give you 3 or 4 different combos and you do that for the entire 9 hours. They are not enjoyable to use at all and the only thing that saved it was S-Pressens. The game is extremely linear, there is no alternate path.. Not even in the Parkour/ climbing sections. The game would have been so much better if it was open world or even semi open world. Recommended if below $10Not recommended if above $10			"

												Besides the wonky controlls and the camara angles that accentuate those, sometimes to a point that gets you killed and you have to start from the last checkpoint. It's not a bad game. The story is a bit bland, but that might be just me, as it touches a bit to close to home. The combat is fun when the controlls work. The music is great. The tutorials are annoying as hell as they keep bothering you even in a second playthrough. But overall it's a good game, better than a lot of nameless others.			"

												Camera controls are terrible, the pathing is laid out for you so there really isn't a reason to put you through obstacle in the first place.Combat is button mashing. You can mistakenly place some combo parts into the 5 slot one, that is not active at all due to missing parts?... causing you to not heal. (Yes, you have to do combos to heal yourself, or find a health station.)The story is rather interesting, but due to what I""ve mentioned above, it's not enough to hold my interest.Pick up on a discount only if you're interested, but beware if you have vertigo or motion sickness, this camera and menu system will trigger you in all sorts of bad.

												I remember playing this game when it first came out, and again just recently. This game hasn't aged well nor did anything change from my initial thoughts about this game. I played this originally because of the soundtrack and the story. The combat got so tedious at times that I legitimately thought about just simply watching a youtube collections of the cinematics. They had a real chance at creating a gem here, and completely flopped on it. The title is ""Remember Me"", the commercials implied that Memory would be a huge part of this game... and then it turned out that you only got to modify peoples memories in this game a few times. This game left me overall disappointed.			"

The setting is unsual, but beautifully designed.The story is okay, but still immersive.The pace of learning new skills and moves is on point. You're never overwhelmed, but also don't have to wait for too long for adding another layer of gameplay.The customizable fighting combos are awesome. After struggling in some fight, I juggled the combos a bit and got into flow with Nilin.It seems that this game is underrated as other reviewers state it.It doesn't deserve it. Give it a try!			"

												An entertaining 10 hour Cyberpunk adventure story that is worth playing through once.  The story itself involves a bleak futuristic Paris where a corporation called Memorize has taken control of the majority of the populace through their memories and allowed them to create a surveillance state.  You play as Nilin, a rebel soldier of the group called ""Errorists"", who is intially captured but escapes and trys to regain the lost memories taken from her.  All the while trying to bring the downfall of Memorize.  The graphics and art style of the game make future Paris a beautiful yet bleak place to explore through.  The orchestrated music score with it's mixture of techno is quite good, it's just ashame they didn't release an OST for it.  The combat gameplay itself is decent yet the Remix segments are by far the best parts of the game.  If you've ever played DONTNOD's other game, Life is Strange, then you can instantly tell that the Remix portions of the game helped influence the Rewind mechanic in that game.  I also found it interesting that the main protaganist, Nilin, seemed to inspire the appearance of the main character, Max, in LIS.  Overall, if you're like me and I decided to give this game a try because you enjoyed LIS then you may be disappointed if you were expecting a similar experience.  It's still a fun game and I give it a 7.5/10.			"

												After playing Life is Strange I thought I would try the studios first game, sadly Remember Me has little redeeming features. The story is very by the numbersl with an ending you can see coming from a few hours before the reveal and the dialogue is terrible throughout which after playing LiS is a real dissapointment. The gameplay fairs no better, from terrible easy platforming and constant fighting with enamies you will see again and again, only with added features like, this one has a shield or (frustratingly) an electric field which damages you with every hit. The one really reedeming features is the memory remixing, where you edit the memories of charcaters by affect objects in the enviroment to change their memories. Sadly there are not many of these throughout the game and some of them are overly long. The games soundtrack is possibly the worst soundtrack I have heard in quite some time, its a mix of violin strings and electronic glitches scattered randomly throughout, which is just an assult on your eardrums everything you hear it. The graphics are pleasent enough with some really terrific looking areas when walking around Paris, sadly a lot of areas seem like carbon copies of other areas. Steer claer of this one, even though some parts of the game are midly interessting, it is not worth the time you will put in to beat it.			"

												Remember Me is a great game with a rare used setting! The female main character was also a good choice. Story: ( 8 / 10 )- The Game is set in the year 2084 in Neo-Paris ( a futuristic version of Paris )You have to Stop the Memorize corporation. They invented a brain implan called "" Sensen"". It allows the population to upload and share their memories. You can also delete unhappy or unpleasent memories. A small group of people are addicted to absorb as many memories as possible. Their Sensen has degraded and they have mutated into a sub-human form called ""Leapers"". Characters: ( 9 / 10 )- many characters with their own special personality.Sound ( 9 / 10 )- Well mixed and composed music and sounds that fits to the Setting of Neo-ParisThey did a great JobExample:

Graphics: ( 7 / 10 )- Unreal Engine 3- The City looks beautiful- nice reflexions- nice lighting- cool effects ( like ""Warning"" when you fight against a robot )- face animations and face textures could be better Gameplay ( 7 / 10 )- Great Combo System ( pretty hard at the beginning )- cool special moves like ""Fury"" , ""D.O.S "" , Camo "" . "" Logic Bomb "" and ""Rest in Pieces ""- The Main Menu has a good overview - Great Boss Fights !- You can remix the memories ( pretty rare :( ) but it´s a awesome featureAt the end it´s a fantastic game with a rare used setting ! You should nominate this game for the "" Sleeper "" award in Steam Autumn Sale.			"

												+++ Breathtaking art direction, in-universe setting and concept.+++ Free-flowing, easy-to-learn brawl play.--- Tedious and meaningless platforming sections.--- Everyone but the protagonist is a throwaway character.--- Story pacing issues.--- Completely linear level design, with pseudo-secrets strewn about.--- Pace-breaking QTEs.While initially presenting a very promising concept, Remember Me never quite manages to capitalize on its strengths.  It has a wonderful world to offer, but the player is never really given the opportunity to explore it, and so the levels feel much like walking through a static museum.  For those who don't want to look around too much, this means levels boil down to satisfying although samey battle sequences, in-between platforming/acrobatic sections that are but a formality of button-pushing to get through, with the occasional fork in the road where one path leads to an upgrade some ten meters down - and so, what little exploration can be done ends up feeling shallow.Similarly, characters are introduced only to never be seen again, with the only constants being the protagonist and what best qualifies as her commanding officer.  The player is not given any time to relate to any secondary characters, and the 'major' enemies of the game are little more than items to check off a list.  It is difficult at best to want to beat a foe when the only exposure about them is given in occasional blurbs spread out in the ten minutes before encountering them.Perhaps the strongest point is the fighting, with the way the music changes with the intensity of the battle, and the impact noises are quite satisfying to hear.  The boss fights take it a step further, often serving as a test of the skills the player has learned so far - unfortunately many of those encounters must be finished with a QTE.  Failing those only results in a minor setback, but fact remains that the thrill of victory is heavily diminished once the player's seen the same finisher sequences 3-4 times.Overall, it feels like the 90s way of game design was applied to a 2010s title.  A whole lot could've been accomplished with the idea to create a rich game and mayhaps even a franchise, but the end result is ultimately little more than concept art in 3D.			"

												If you like the games Aeon Flux, BloodRayne, and Ghost in the Shell for the ps2 for its linear on rails platforming, you'll like this game.The director of this game must be a big fan of the Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex game for the ps2 because its directorial style is very similar to that game. Not in the art style of the locations but in the flow and ebb of the story line.The combat takes getting use to. Challenging in its combat due to the combo system. Some people find it easy but I don't.I find it to be a hard game because of that.The memory remix puzzles are novel and genius.Though I do wish that the act of taking pars of someone's memory and opening some doors were more align with Ghost in the Shell hacking with a holo rings mini puzzle games to add to the fun factor which I wish were added to this game.Thanks for reading my review!

												The game looks nice but that doesn't make up for the terrible controls. Half of the time in the boss fight in episode 3 Nilin was running in a completely different direction than the keys I was pressing or better yet just stand there for a second and not move at all. It made it impossible to doge the attacks and actually survive the fight.			"

												Tentative Recommendation:Overall, a decent cyberpunky game with one excellent game mechanic. First off, most of the gameplay is an incredibly easy version of what you would find in one of the Batman Arkham games. None of the fights are particularly challenging. The one interesting mechanic presented in the game is called ""remixing,"" wherein you watch a memory of a character and then attempt to alter certain aspects of it in order to manipulate their memory. It's a neat idea and pretty fun, but only happens maybe four times total throughout the entire game.The story itself takes place in a cyber-punky version of Paris wherein memories have become the most valuable form of currency. Again, it's a neat sort of idea but is basically left unexplored and as a result does not make a great deal of sense if you stop to think about the world a bit. The story starts off fairly interesting, but begins to peter out and finishes with a total letdown of an ending.If you decide to try it, get it on sale for 5-10 dollars or so.			"

												Bought the game because  Nilin was a strong sexy  protagonist and i like  her  personality as well.  I also  likeed  the concept of the story. But I Got to the end of chapter 6 on  normal level   and  it was not fun any  more so quit.  I just was not mot for me . The Boss fights are too long and drawn out  the mechanics of the game are frustrating ( elite, brain lock , invisable  etc)    im not really a fan of jumping  dodging  games , I  give it  a thumbs up  for  Nilin  and the stroy but a thumbs  down for everything else.

												This game starts out very well, with a intriguing story. However the closer you get to the end, the more repetitive the game quickly become. Also it´s storyline becomes obvious and somewhat quasisentimental- and not in a overly good fasion. Added to this is a fair pc port of controls, but some things (like aiming) is woefully badly done. Incresingly frustrating boss fights, and a respawn system that punish deaths make for a lot of anger being vented. All in all the game was entertaining the first 6 hours and went downhill from there- finishing in a very bad ending. Sadly I have not to recomend this to anyone unless it´s very very cheap-			"

												Imagine all the things that make the Batman series fun and interesting and trow them out, then you'll have Remember me. Its very similar (the fighting system is almost identical) but much more repetitive, uninspired, and boring. Boss fights are borderline depressing and just require you to find the pattern and break it at the apropriate point repeatedly until you reach the next cut scene. and the story line doesn't really grab you or keep you interested. The memory augmentation is an interesting mechanic, but they are too few and far between and border on tedium. You have to constantly rewind and play out the same thing over and over, looking for the perfect combination of very minor changes to make everything work right. I got it on sale for $10 and I wish I had just skipped it. While its not a bad game overall, its no where near a great game. I believe it sits comfortably in the midst of mediocrity.			"

												I was excited for the launch of this game, but didn't get it and I'm so glad that I waited.  I was hoping for another deus ex.  This isn't it.  The best description of this game is tedious.  While visually very pretty, the combat is ridiculous and depends on putting the right combinations in order, which of course you build as the game progresses.  Lackluster mechanics aside, where this game fails miserable is in connecting with the player.  Several hours into the game I find myself not caring about the story, characters, or the missions.  When the protagonist falls off of a building to her death...I don't care.  When she gets beaten in a fight...don't care (other than the inconvenience of having to re do the fight scene which unfortunately drags out the miserable gaming experience).  I really wanted to like this game and because of that gave it way more chance than it deserved.

												It's cyber-punk the way it was meant to be. ( Bladerunner, Neruomancer, The Matrix, Deus EX ). A nice clash between Dystopia and Utopia and an engaging story that makes Nillin a memorable character. Plus she's hot as *&%$ !     But not only the story and my fixation with cyber punk made this game a win for me. The visuals and graphic style of this game kept me coming back for more.       The combo creation feature makes the combat so much more interesting than just button mashing. Boss fights are creative and fun.       But most of all, Neo Paris is alive with ambience and the vistas through out most of the game are stunning and right on par with other great cyber -punk worlds. Overall, a very under rated game but very much worth at least one playthrough.			"

												I wish there was an option for a mixed opinion, because I know others might enjoy the game, I just didn't.The game is essentially just a virtual tour, of an admittedly nice looking world, but with a very on rails experience. There's really not much strategy or decision making to it at all, you simply follow the markers everywhere, or engage in very bland fist fights, that quickly become reptitive, with memory zombies. Also, apparently all it takes to heal yourself is punching or kicking in a combo..In the about an hour I played the game, hardly anything was explained about the world, it stated what things were but, they never actually explained why things were. How does a memory keeping company produce and throw away such a large volume of corpses? And why are some half alive, acting and speaking like Smeagol/Gollum? Why is there an underworld in 'Neo-Paris' with all these beings running freely? Perhaps later on things are better explained, but something about it tells me probably not.To be honest, I really wanted to enjoy the game, I had never heard of it before, saw it on the steam sale and thought it looked pretty awesome. But all these things I've stated just hold me back from enjoying it, I was just forcing myself to play more and more, but just getting more and more bored with it. It's a great looking game, but just doesn't have much for gameplay.. So, for now I'm refunding it.			"

												I remember playing this game when it first came out, and again just recently. This game hasn't aged well nor did anything change from my initial thoughts about this game. I played this originally because of the soundtrack and the story. The combat got so tedious at times that I legitimately thought about just simply watching a youtube collections of the cinematics. They had a real chance at creating a gem here, and completely flopped on it. The title is ""Remember Me"", the commercials implied that Memory would be a huge part of this game... and then it turned out that you only got to modify peoples memories in this game a few times. This game left me overall disappointed.			"

All in all it's a great game that reminds me of syndicate and deus ex hr but suffers greatly for poor camera views and poor keyboard and mouse support. If you play with a controller then the only problem is the camera views ex. when against a wall and with an enemy in front of you you might not be able to see or attack them until you move yourself or the camera.

Posted: September 13, 2016
												I originally started to play Remember Me on PS3 as a PSN freebie. It was okay but nothing I ever went back to. During one of many Steam sales, I decided to give it another go since I felt I didn't give it a real chance on PS3. The first thing I noticed, do NOT play this with a Steam controller. No matter how I tried to configure the touch pad to simulate a right analog stick for camera control, it absolutely would not work correctly. Use a Xbox 1 controller or forget about it. Initially I thought the main character, Nilin was a bit unusual. Mainly because she looked Black and Black women are almost never featured in games not to mention featured as a main character. But I like her design and the motion capture for her walk is sexy so there's that. Later I found out she's biracial and although it felt like a bit of a cop-out (the design world still doesn't have the stones to actual design a Black lead family for a story such as this), I still thought Nilin's design was overall well done if a bit of a let down in a way, considering how the story progresses and the scene in the car. The graphics in general are really good with some great lighting and details. The art direction for Neo Paris is very impressive even by today's standards (3 years later in a GTX 10.x world). Combat is a bit clunky but functional allowing for players to build custom combos through unlockables. These combos can also restore health, deal more damage or reduce cool down times for specials. It works, but does take some getting used to. Anyone familar with games like Devil May Cry or God of War will definitely see the not-so-subtle rip off of the combat style and mechanics. But as I mentioned, combat is functional if not adding anything interesting or new. For my tastes, it simply doesn't flow as well as Devil May Cry or Bayonetta and it doesn't have the impact of God of War.Speaking of borrowing from other games, there is a lot borrowed from the Uncharted series in terms of stage navigation. Constant climbing, shimmying across and scampering through various locales. It's heavy handed to the point that it became a bit annoying 50% through the game because it's such a blantant rip from Uncharted. Even the cut scenes where the environments break apart as Nilin tries to progress are face palm worthy. I was embarrassed for the developers. Liked Uncharted so much that you just had to swing from Naughty Dog's nipple? Ooooookay. This brings one of the biggest problems with the game and I have three. 1) As beautiful as the game is most of the time, it's far too linear with some glaring annoyances as a result. Here we have a heroine that can scale vast landscapes almost like Spiderman but can't jump over a 3 foot crate. She can jump across a 30 foot span 20 stories high but she can't jump over a counter. The game is linear to the extent that it makes the environments less impressive because we can't actually explore anything and the character is hamstrung many times to keep us on the predetermined path. This is made worse because there are times when you will have to travel through an apartment that's lived in but you can't actually explore buildings, streets or other rooms. Only the path the developer dictates. 2) Total lack of bosses. There was a cool boss fight with Kid XMas because he was like a zonked out Vin Diesel broadcasting the battle for TV audiences. But there aren't too many afterward. Madame's boss battle was cool but there simply wasn't enough of it. Johnny Greenteeth's battle sucked and that brings me to my final major grip with the game...3) It's too long. After the first 4 or 5 hours, I was really into the game and the story being told. The concepts about memories are really interesting. The game felt like it could be similar to Heavenly Sword in a way. Heavenly Sword is only 6 hours long but it's a really wild and action packed 6 six hours. But Remember Me drags on after Chapter 5. The way the plot reveals itself I expected to see end credits and a final cut scene after chapter 5 or 6. Going into chapter 7, I got really annoyed with the game because it feels like the developers padded the game instead of keeping it tight and concise letting it reach its conclusion. I think the memory remixing IS excellent though but again...fantastic concept that isn't utilized enough in the game. The same could be said for the supporting cast of characters. You simply don't see them enough. Althought the events of the game are supposed to affect all of Neo Paris, it's suprising how little of an impact the events really seemed to make. I never really felt like my actions made any real difference. One reveal during the car scene is followed by ""oh, yeah...that's important to know but now run off and go do something or other. As important as that info is to solve the riddle of your identity, don't focus on that...just go over here and do something else instead.""I still recommend Remember Me, because it's dirt cheap these days and runs great even on not-so cutting edge rigs. There is some good stuff in it. I just feel the game had the potential to be stellar instead of just ""good"" overall...in a bargin bin kinda way.			"

												Excellent story and the way it reveals itself with its plot twists is awesome. The only cons are the various bugs along the gameplay. At some points the game stopped and I had to repeat a Boss Fight all over again in two different game bosses simply because nothing happened after I beat them. It was necessary for me to beat his thugs before hitting him with the final sequence to finish him, because otherwise the game stops and Nilin stays in combat stance and you have to restart from checkpoint. The climbing system is cool but excessively linear. The game tells you exactly where to climb and you don't have much of a choice, except in getting the collectibles. Excluding these minor problems, i recommend this game because of the excellent plot.Portugues:Excelente enredo e forma como a história se revela aos poucos com suas reviravoltas. Os únicos defeitos são os bugs e a jogabilidade. Em alguns pontos o jogo bugou e eu tive que repetir a Boss Fight em dois chefões diferentes do jogo simplesmente porque não acontecia nada depois que eu os derrotava. Era necessário que eu derrotasse os capangas deles antes de dar a última sequencia de hits para terminar com ele, porque senão o jogo bugava e ficava parado, sem nada acontecer e a personagem em posição de combate. A forma de escalar paredes é legal mas excessivamente linear. O jogo te diz exatamente onde subir ou descer e não dá muita escolha, exceto para conseguir os colecionáveis. Fora esses pequenos defeitos, recomendo por causa do excelente enredo. "

												It's cyber-punk the way it was meant to be. ( Bladerunner, Neruomancer, The Matrix, Deus EX ). A nice clash between Dystopia and Utopia and an engaging story that makes Nillin a memorable character. Plus she's hot as *&%$ !     But not only the story and my fixation with cyber punk made this game a win for me. The visuals and graphic style of this game kept me coming back for more.       The combo creation feature makes the combat so much more interesting than just button mashing. Boss fights are creative and fun.       But most of all, Neo Paris is alive with ambience and the vistas through out most of the game are stunning and right on par with other great cyber -punk worlds. Overall, a very under rated game but very much worth at least one playthrough.			"

												So far this game is pretty good but not quite what I'd hoped for when I imagined what the game would be like. It is very pretty, combat starts off slow and dull but is getting better although be it frustrating at times due to the camera angles and dodging not always working against Beserkers (it could be said that hitting the button sooner works but a dodge should be a dodge as long as it's done before impact exspecially when it's a charging enemy). Other than slight battle frustration and occassionally not being able to see the markers for where to go the game has been fun!It's a mix of Tomb Raider meets Oni but there is a mysterious truth to the story that I hope progression will reveal. So far from what I can tell the 'real life' world is anything but, then again it may just be the cool screen effects the devs wanted in the game but I am hoping it will play into a greater part of the story as the story already seems very cool and having a big reveal that changes everything while having subtle clues throughout the game will only make the story that much cooler!Buy it on sale if you are like me and can't afford a game that cost more than 10 bucks, buying at full price seems a waste although it should be considered worth $20 and 5 years ago I would have paid $50 bucks if the game had been for Xbox 360! One more thing, I feel bad for the Leapers, hopefully there is some sinester reason why they are attcking the hero because if not then I'm going to feel really really bad for beating so many to a pulp.Edit; Same day not even one hour later; The frustration grows, too many leapers and that seems to be all that you fight. I have no desire to fight these things and it's just annoying to constantly be thrown into battle against an enemy who you have know clue why is fighting you. It makes no sense for these depraved and starving humans to attack and some of them dissapear in the dark, and no I don't me they hide in the shadows the literally dissapear and you have no way to hit them since the hero only attacks when she will hit visible enemy. Between the poorly timed dodging the bad camera angles and the not being able to punch air in attemps to locate these dissapearing leapers I may just stop playing the game after one day, I'm so annoyed!The game starts out ok but overall it's just another pretty flop which is all top developing companies seems to be able to make anymore since they have no real ideas left. The immersion in this game is terrible at times, nothing notices you and I mean nothing except for a few bystanders in the very beggining.I could do better a dozen times over but instead I'm an un-employed ner-do-well since noone hands over a job to someone like me, I feel like a leaper IRL maybe that's why I'm so annoyed that I have to fight these things.

												I'm not saying Remember Me is a good game....... literally the only good thing is the story. Gameplay is basic as ♥♥♥♥, no challenge; it literally has arrows telling you how to parkore to your next linear path throughout the entire game. The game is pretty cuz capcom, but it's not something to turn down vajayjay for. But ♥♥♥♥, this story is so good. It's worth it just for that. And that's what I love in a game. There's lots of extra reading bits that give background about the plot that are really intriguing too. Kinda like Lost Odyssey. 11/10 - would bang Nilin.			"

												not far in but first impressions are well enough for me to keep playing this all the way through.  combat system reminds me a little bit of the arkham series and sleeping dogs as far as hand 2 hand combat and fighting a group vs 1 situations.  flows pretty well in the midst of it.  Story seems a little cliche so fart but not so bad that it would put me off from playing it, maybe it gets better later, as it does seem to have some potential to get good at some point, just early game is kinda all over the place.  so basic first impressions with 1.5 ish hrs is, sees like its a good budget title, if  you can get it for cheap on a steam sale or a 3rd party (NON GREY MARKET) sale go for it.

												At the time of writing this, I'm only about 3 hours into the game, but having reached chapter 4 on the middling difficulty, I'm getting an indication that what I have thus far experienced is probably all the game really has to offer. Other reviewers all seem to sum Remember Me up as ""a game that got disappointed it wasn't a movie, and takes its frustrations out on the player."" This is almost immediately apparent by the end of the first two chapters (chapter 0 and chapter 1, with chapter 0 being a tutorial/prologue kind of thing). Ironically, for a game about memory loss, I'm the one finding most of the characters and story forgetful. On top of that, the game seems to forget to introduce characters in any way that makes their sudden and unexplained appearance (ie, the bounty hunter in chapter 1) logical in any way. I can definitely feel that the story is there, but the cutscenes feel somewhat out of place, and leave me feeling like things weren't explained properly. It's like I'm missing some background explaination and plot pieces, and this starts almost immediately as of the end of the first chapter.The story feels rather disjointed from the actual gameplay aspects. The gameplay itself is rather linear. Travel along strict routes to reach your destination. It's simple, and even with all the parkour aspects, the game is still rather narrow. Every now and again, the game will open up to a large open area and you have to combo-chain your way through mobs of enemies. You can ""customize"" your combos with little boons that make each hit do something, like return some health or cut some time off a power cooldown. Overall, it feels a little like a fighting game, where you have to mash key combinations to basically chain damage on enemies, except you only have two keys, LMB and RMB. The only difference is in what order you feel like chaining them in.The game very much wants to be a grand epic like Deus Ex: Human Revolution, with majestic backdrops and grandoise settings, and a rich story. It's very much apparent as you're scrambling around and the game stops to pan the 3rd person camera in a way that showcases the magestic spires of New Paris, or a wide open expanse you have to parkour your way through. But it falls short by then really limiting the camera controls. The camera is particularly aggravating because on more than one occasion, I've been hopelessly running in circles looking for an indication of which ledge I need to jump to in order to progress, only to have it be cut off by the horrific camera angling not an inch off screen.It still very much tries at the least to provide some interesting gameplay mechanics. The finishing moves are interesting, and usually entail scrambling peoples minds and blowing their memories out through their eyes, nose, and mouth. The ""memory remix"" feature used to progress the storyline in some instances (again, going back to that sudden bounty hunter at the very beginning of the game) allow for some very rich, intimate character development that basically allow you to both experience that character's flashback and backstory, and quite literally change the outcome in a way that impacts the game. What's a shame is that thus far it was used once, had me excited for getting to scramble the memories of all of the bosses or other important characters in ways that would be meaningful to the story, only to have that yanked away and replaced with 3-QTE finishers for the bosses.The soundtrack is a little bit orchestral, with some definite electronic and techno underpinnings. The song from the main menu is one of my favorites, though I can't say much else stood out for me.Overall, the game had potential, but overall it missed its mark. I can't really say the game is ""bad"" in any one aspect, it's just maybe not good. ""Playable"" might describe Remember Me in one word, or as an alternative, ""forgettable."" Overall, I'd give it a 2.5/5 for what it delivers on, and wish they had maybe taken things in a slightly different path. It's an interesting game, maybe worth a look at a $10 level, but probably not worth picking up past the first run through.			"

												The controls are terible and un responsive. The game often locks control, something no game should ever do. It feels like it wants to be a movie at times instead of a game. The controls are constantly fighting you, maybe this was an atempt at feeling disoriented? The combat is clunky. The movement is akward. I have bearly played and I cant stand to play any more becuse actually controling my chracter and even the menues in the game is so bad that its frustrating. Its a shame to becuase it feel like some really good story telling so far and might be an intersting store too. Maybe I will try and revisit this game later on.			"

												I have heavily-mixed feelings for this game.I absolutely loved the syntax content of the game - it's story, characters, lore, etc. - as it all fit in well with each other. The world it set up was intriguing to want to learn about but not overwhelming you to the point where there was too much to care about. All of the characters (however few there are) felt memorable and capable of having a connection with the player. By the time the game ended I was blown away by how much the experience of witnessing such a game unfolded.So why do I have mixed feelings? Because everything about ""Remember Me"" was fantastic except actually playing it.With the exception of the few 'memory-altering' sequences, the game is basically a button-mashing single-player fighter game where you fight essentially waves of enemies that you just combo again and again. The game occasionally feels clunky, both with the fighting and the platforming aspects. When I finished the game I wanted to go back through and investigate any secrets or bonuses I forgot or passed, but I did not want to face playing the game once again.This review for ""Remember Me"" is not intended to be positive. It's not intended to be negative. I generally refer to this game to people as ""the greatest mehh game ever""; it falls in the dead-middle between being a good and bad game. If somebody from Steam or Valve is reading this, please consider creating a 'neutral' review option for games that are neither good or bad, but just ARE.			"

												Remember Me is an odd game.  There are quite a few aspects that are quite enjoyable, such as the visuals and sound.  The voice acting in the game is superb as well.  The style of the game is interesting, if a bit repetitive.  You can see that work was put into character animations and clothing styles which is not without merit, but does not a fun game make.Unfortunately, the games issues far outnumber the positives.  The writing is dreadful.  I found myself laughing out loud and rolling my eyes at just about every plot point.  The memory remixes are interesting, but there's not many of them and they make the story ridiculous.  The main character is supposed to be strong and different, but is just another way too thin waif who walks like a runway model and has daddy issues.The combat is repetitive and boring.  There is an interesting combo system, but usually you'll find youself in large mob fights where you'll never land a combo of more than a few hits because there are just too many enemies coming from all sides for you to land 6 blows in a row.  I found myself going into the combo lab and changing the three punch combo to whatever suited my needs and just landing that.The game is also WAY too short.  It could easily be finished in a weekend and for the dedicated gamer, a day.  There is simply no replay value.  You'll only unlock art for things you've already seen, character models that simply stand there, or combat moves that you'll never use.			"

												A great Concept, Great Combat System and what could of been a reat story. Sadly all poorly done.Don't let me wrong a good game but nothing to brag about. I scored it a 6.5 reaso are below.The concept which I found to be the best part of the game is remixing memories, what is a very morally wrong thing to do but what everyone would want to do. and is donr ery well, the only problem being that this all important part happens only 4 times in the entire game. possible spoiler  one of which ends up as a redo of a previous memory . Otherwise they nail it almost perfectly. And could carry the game with all the padding.The combat system is good very good, but seems to me like it is only half done. In the game ya can customise 4 combo strings which have specail effects on each button and can be altered freely. What leaves me feeling it half undone is the enemies. i can class 3 types. light, heavy and mech. Now 3 is a fine number, but I feel that none gratify the system. Light ya done every hit or two, heavy ya just pounding combos, and mechs just annoyed me to hell cause ya have to use the slegde hammer gun thing. And the only answer seen in game to make it progressively harder is 1) more enimes or 2) speaical abilities, such as invisility or ya own start to get hurt by ya own combos when ya hit them. Ya will find a type of enemy either increaible easy or really hard. No middle ground for good fight which is challenging and not iratating. The story had so much potenial at the start. Morally, Direction and Choice. Easy for twist, complex intriues and well lots. but ope it becomes a story book, i almost felt it would be better if they made a movie. They skip over everything that would make the story good like it needs to be rushed out and then forgot about. It story could be bullet pointed and still have the same impact.As for the soundtrack, ambience changes a little every now and then. othin impressive but dose it's job. But where the prolem lies is the complete flat dialogue, most the game the voice actors feel like they are doing it in monotoes, even the supposedly emotional parts. Now this is the only part that would make me say this game is truely bad. LEVEL DESIGN. It is visually beautifull ut that all. Going through a level is like being on a train. One route tightly scripted ( at least ya will neer et lost ), there is almost zero aility to explore, and it ya try well death awaits. Aother show to how little free done is give is ya get ya to be honest cool little un and then ya can only use it when it needed. so ya can see that ya have to use it to continue at a press of a button.  Anyhow the level feels like they made a winding corridor and ya have to walk it, with a odd random pointless battle thrown in to keep it form bein really booooring.Overall a great game badly done. if ya got some spare time give it a play but do't bother with  putting it on ya wish list.Gameplay                 5     (mainly for bad level desgin)Mechanics                10Story                        5Music and Voice       4Graphics                   9overall, a sad 6.5 for a game that really should have more, but i would look forward to a squeal if they can sort there majour problems out.

												This game first goes through the trouble of teaching you about 50 different types of attacks with about a zillion combinations and then shamelessly copy-pastes boss battles!? And if that was not depressing enough, there is a type of enemy which makes you lose health if you attack it, sometimes unavoidably. An awkward mix between action, puzzle / riddle and a bunch of other genres. The controls are highly innovative and rather than having a meaning in the space of the character, they have a meaning in the space of the current view so sometimes pressing the right key just means going left. Yeah, sometimes it is hard to walk straight in this game. Just try to escape from something.I wouldn't recommend getting this one, unless you want to teach your kid to stop playing computer games.The amount of time I spent on it is due to forgetting it alt+tab-ed for a few days.

There is an optional puzzle element of visual recognition (""where is this?"") and path-finding (""how do I get there?"") that increases in difficulty as the game goes on.The game-defining memory-editing segments are not as puzzle-oriented, but they move the story along well and it is viscerally fun to find new ways to mess someone's memory to the point of mental breakdown. If you like to explore to every dead-end, this part of the game is engaging but far too short.Two thirds of the way through, however, the combat becomes an exericse in player stamina. The combats lag on until I found them far too much of a grind to complete the game. I ended up watching a play-through of the game, and the story's conclusion is fitting for the rest of the story, but the pacing of combat simply broke me out of any flow and then out of any desire to continue.Sorry, Don't Nod. Maybe if you made a Telltale-like game featuring a similar roundabout-change-things mechanic as Remember Me's memory-edits. Maybe a young and innocent time-traveller? I would play it!			"

												Not worth $30, 4/10.Annoying controls, FPS issues mid game and cutscenes only run 30 FPS with that annoying 'grainy' effect on the screen. the 'Combos' system, did NOT work for me at all, trying to execute the right combo was near to impossible, it sounded and appeared easy; left kick to punch, right click to kick. But it just doesn't work, you can string together any combinations of ""Pressens"" that are either a kick or a punch, some might give health, reduce cooldowns for 'S-pressens' (power moves) but I can never get them to execute. For one, I had to kick, kick, punch, kick, punch, kick. Every time I tried it just did another only two hit combo and I never got past 5 hits in a combo. If this isn't how it worked, then I can bring another point into view; the tutorials are crap, and UNSKIPPABLE. They make you read them with a 'wait' mechanic and even if you have just repsawned and have to go back to the boss fight again with the same cutsence playing again and again. At one point I could receit a set of tutorial popups that told you how to you use an incredibly annoying gun that if you moved the mouse slightly, it would jerk to another enemy. It's also NOT clear in its tutorials as I got so angry at one point I had to just stop playing. No one pay anymore than $10 for this horribly executed interactive looping, incredibly hard movie.			"

												not far in but first impressions are well enough for me to keep playing this all the way through.  combat system reminds me a little bit of the arkham series and sleeping dogs as far as hand 2 hand combat and fighting a group vs 1 situations.  flows pretty well in the midst of it.  Story seems a little cliche so fart but not so bad that it would put me off from playing it, maybe it gets better later, as it does seem to have some potential to get good at some point, just early game is kinda all over the place.  so basic first impressions with 1.5 ish hrs is, sees like its a good budget title, if  you can get it for cheap on a steam sale or a 3rd party (NON GREY MARKET) sale go for it.

												I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised by the storyline of Remember Me.  I am a fan of cyberpunk and distopia and the story grabbed me immediately.  I was caught up in intrique and mystery and surprised as the story unfolded with twists and turns.So what did I like?  The story, yes! The graphics  and setting wasn't too bad either. I even screengrabbed some spots to use as wallpaper!  the designers and artists did a fantastic job of creating a Neo Paris that was believable and fun to adventure in.  The music was superb. Olivier, you are a true maestro!What didn't I like?  The combat was fun to develop, and should be added to the 'like' bit, but it did get somewhat repetitive after a while.  I felt that althought the balance of platforming, combat and story was welldone, the yet-another-open-area-here-comes-the-same-gang-as-before-just-more-of-them got tedious.  That said, overloading baddies as so much fun and never got old!I wished more people took notice of this game, I would have loved a sequel!			"

												I wasn't confident about buying this game when it came out and Steam summer sales gave me the opportunity to see what a big mistake it would have been.The game is short, the interaction with your surroundings is poor and the combats are in fact repetitive. As I'm french I was very desapointed with neo paris. I think it's a very generic SF city after all. The story is good but the scenario isn't that good. I don't even know if I will bother to play this game again. The only fun thing was remixing memories but there are not so many.Sorry but go look for fun somewhere else...			"

												I tried to like this game and in some parts I did, but it was spoilt by being unreasonably difficult in certain areas e.g some boss fights.  It was as if the developers thought the player would enjoy certain areas just because they are very difficult - as if making some areas unnecessarily difficult made the game better/more attractive.  In the end I got fed up trying to figure out the 'magic formula' to beat certain areas and uninstalled the game.  Games are supposed to be fun and not a chore !			"

												This game first goes through the trouble of teaching you about 50 different types of attacks with about a zillion combinations and then shamelessly copy-pastes boss battles!? And if that was not depressing enough, there is a type of enemy which makes you lose health if you attack it, sometimes unavoidably. An awkward mix between action, puzzle / riddle and a bunch of other genres. The controls are highly innovative and rather than having a meaning in the space of the character, they have a meaning in the space of the current view so sometimes pressing the right key just means going left. Yeah, sometimes it is hard to walk straight in this game. Just try to escape from something.I wouldn't recommend getting this one, unless you want to teach your kid to stop playing computer games.The amount of time I spent on it is due to forgetting it alt+tab-ed for a few days.

												Since the beggining I saw I made a mistake buying this game. Its linear, full of easy and lazy ""solutions"". Never felt the protagonist would be in danger. You don't explore any f.ea..ing thing. In a detailed scenario you're  always guided to next and visible way to start a series of parkour tour that not only is so easy but too defies physical laws..no way an human got those long jumps to the top!!Excessive and boring dialogues..I never felt any close sensation of immersion. In any moment I dont give a sh..t for the protagonist. Shes boring like the voice that guided her. Her suffer irritates me unlike Lara Croft revival awesome game or even Violet Assassin (underrated great game). This game evolves in an automatic, mechanic, boring way with awful gameplay. The so praised storytell means nothing to me..I didnt see in any moment a progression of obstacles, character evolution, change of feelings. Things are predictable like you see in a bad movie. You' never face a real puzzle..the levels are so short you feel nothing when step into a new scenario. Even the fights are so frea..ing easy despite level of difficult. Defeat the boss is quick and subhumans are laughable.Its a game that dont bring challenge, dont defie your skills. Even in sale  its not worth. I'll try to forget Remember Me quickly...ups, already did.			"

												This game attributes to great aesthetics  and almost blinding scenery, the game itself is set in Neo-Paris after a great war has struck the developed nations of europe leading for a revolution of technology and mega businesses. one business that is very large that started in Paris was Memorize which allowed users to access memories from past times or discard ones who brought them pain. this revolutionary technology has lead the world suffering from it due to it's over use. You playing as Nilian (A memory hunter who has had a clean slate from her memory) must shut this organization down. The only problem in the game is it's combat becoming to repititive if you are easily bored. other than that the LORE will amaze you.			"

												I liked pretty much everything in the game expect when I lose control of my character because of the clunky segue to cutscenes and panoramic shots. Every time I get ready for some action, ""let's cutaway to show this"" or ""before you do this, let me show you how to do this"". How about a tutorial instead of interrupting the gameplay? It really puts you off when you're trying to enjoy an immersive experience. I hope someone can chime in to say it that continues throughout the game or just at the beginning when you need to learn the ropes. "

However, I can't recommend it as the gameplay is simply boring and awful. The character is not great. There is not much for me to like in her, she's not very attractive, charismatic or badass. The game features one of the worst brawling systems I have encountered. Climbing is not natural at all, it also feels like a tutorial since the exact way is always shown. In fact, the entire game feels like a tutorial.Go ahead and try it, but this studio is a lot better at making art and stories, rather than action.			"

												The story, the protagonist, and the approach to exploring how memory defines a person is a very well done, and worth a run. The visuals and environments are  aboslutely gorgeous when they're not too dark. However, the combat needed some help as the controls get a little clunky sometimes.			"

												I would like to recommend 'Remember me' not so much as a game but more as an interactive story.'Remember me"" has as central concept the idea that one can extract memories, insert them  and even alter them. Being fan of Philip K♥♥♥♥♥♥duh, his surname gets hidden),it made me think of his story 'We can remember it for you wholesale' that has inspired the movie Total Recall. In this story a man wants to have the memories of a trip to Mars as a secret agent... of course the memories turn out to be true( or do they)?. Manipulating memories is the special skill of Nilin, the protagonist.  She is part of a resistance movement that fights against the organisation Memorize that has turned manipulating memories into  a way to control people(portrayed as helping them), ignoring the suffering this causes. For too much of anything is harmful and so is too much of manipulating memories. The victims turn eventually into leapers who are, of course, hostile and linger, of course again, in the sewers of the dystopian Neo-Paris contemplating  nastiness.  As Nilin you escape the Bastille into the sewers fighting your way through leapers and then work you way up for a final confrontation at the top of a building in Neo-Paris. During the game you have various opportunities to alter people's memories. Some of these alterations (one of which involves the death of a child) are pretty cold hearted, making me wonder about the morality of Nilin. The game feels like Nilin's personal journey as almost every aspect of the story bears on her own past. This Nilin centered story gives the game a special emotional feel on the one hand, but also makes if feel limited on the other. It is as if we see Neo-Paris through the eyes of Nilin and hardly anything else. It made me feel emotionally attached to her, but also distanced me from the world around her. I want to touch on some of the more negative aspects of the game/story..I think if you like fighting games that this game is probably boring for you. With the exception of a two battles, one against a super robot and another against two teleporting super leapers aided by a lot of normal leapers, can be special hard if you don't know how to handle them, but the other battles were mostly easy for me, so I suspect that veteran fighters will not break a sweat over them..The fighting is done with combo's that you have to earn or find before you can use them. My experience is that with the harder fights you never get beyond a few combos because they have to be chained against the same target to count and since you have to jump around a lot to not get overwhelmed, targeting one and the same enemy for fair amount of time is not very likely.The only other thing you can do is stealing memories, but these are story like elements that are only triggered when the story wants you to and which you can not use as an alternative to fighting for instance. It would have been great if you could make a guard forget about you instead of having to kill him..One of the problems I have with the story is that the most important issue is never dealt with, which is  that while you might change a memory, this will not change reality. An example.At one point Nilin manipulates the memory of a bounty hunter so she will aid  Nilin instead of trying to capture her. It would be obvious that once this bounty hunter gets confronted with reality she must realize that her memories have been tampered with and thus turn her into an enemy again. This difference between manipulating memories and the fact that reality will not be altered as well(let alone the memories of other people or simple: movies or other pieces of evidence) is never worked out in the game. Also, as mentioned above, some of the memory altering that Nilin does causes people grief and this doesn't seem to affect Nilin much. Yes, Nilin ponders a lot about altering memories and what that causes, but she doesn't seem to connect this to her own actions. Or at least that is how I experienced it. She lacks a certain empathy for her victims.In the end I would recommend this game for anyone who likes an involving story set in a dystopian world with some pretty visuals and good atmosphere. I read they are planning a sequel; there is enough  story to make one.			"

Remember Me: 8/10 - Cautious RECOMMENDATIONRemember Me Impressions:Wow... this game has some serious ups and downs... almost no middle grounds... it either hits the target spot on... or misses it completly... so yeah... intense mixed feelings... but in the end the positives outweight the negatives.Setting/Story/Characters is all great on paper and in design but I think they all are rather flat and simple constructed. The ideas in this game are worthy of someone of Kojimas format, but they are not truly explored... neither the infuence of memory mixing on human beeings (besides the obvious mutation crap needed for gameplay purposes) nor the actual technological side. Gameplay: It reminds most of all of God of War, but less flashy... when you do not fight you jump around or shimmy on ledges, and when you fight it is full Arkham Asylum mode. Interesting is, that you can construct (kinda) your own Combos, but once they are done, there is no insentive to realy change them up later in the game. What breakes this combat system from time to time are certain enemy types you can only attack with special attacks, which have atrocious cooldown times... so running in circles while dodging is the only thing left to do...Memory Mixing: A simple gimmick that is great in theory and in trailer but fades once you try it... it is kinda like playing one scene from HEAVY RAIN multiple times, while changing details... and there is not even a full handfull of them in this game.Audio-visual Style:Now this is why you play this game... this one has some effin' great music, I would recommand anyone to play it for this alone.

												This game has a pretty interesting story. You control Nilin a memory hunter who has ""surprise"" lost her memory. You get into some serious stuff and i'm not going to spoil it for you. The design work by the art team is fantastic. The setting and story are easily the games strongest point. There is a very cool memory puzzle minigame but its only explored a few times and boss encounters that are far from spectaculari It' a real shame considering the game is published by Capcom and  they should have at least had the Devil May Cry guy gives some insight to the battle system and boss fights.If your looking for a indepth battle system this is not your game. But if you looking for a good story and some decent gameplay this game is simple enough to play and relax too. If its on sale pick it up. But I would not pay over $10usd.			"

												Brilliant story, awesome graphics, great landscape, and very very  cool fashion sense in the in-game world, and to top it up, a relatively good looking, smart and in some angles, sexy as hell female protagonist. Conceptually, its a very nice mix of Inception, Matrix, Blade Runner, and Total Recall.Here are the cons though:- Gameplay wise is very linear, with the places you can explore limited, and the things you can interact with pre-determined for you (i.e. you can't walk back to places that you've explored before). - Combat is interesting, in that you can chain combos, but that's where the lackluster bits come in. The type of combos you have is pre-determined for you (i.e. you can't create your own, but have to live with the ones built into the game), and you have to ""unlock"" them based on how many enemies you kill so far- Most of the game has you climbing and jumping all over the place, with a few nice interesting puzzles to add to the mixSummary:This game is definitely worth getting when it's on offer. Replay value is limited. I'm not likely to play this again unless its to see how the various memory mixes play out, or to get the rest of the achievements/extras. For those of you who are into fashion design, the game does have some very very nice looks that you may want to have a look at.			"

												I have just finished the game and I can say, I am ashamed to have waited until the game was on sale to buy it. I feel as if I have stolen an impressive and visionary game. It's the Mirrors Edge of 2013 - heavily underrated and undeservedly ignored by the masses. The art design is gorgeous and really looks new - even if they only let us play through linear tube levels. The sound and music perfectly fits the mood and the story is interesting (especially the ending), let alone the memory fiddling and Nilin's special abilities which are really cool.Most negative reviews focus on the ""hand-holding"" during the climbing sequences. Well, it should be an optional assistance feature. But it's not as bad as most reviews might want you to believe. After all, every Tomb Raider and even the Assassin's Creeds have obvious climbing path visualisations that are just as easily deciphered as street signs smeared in your face.Another point in negative reviews is the supposedly bad fighting system. I don't understand this criticism. DONTNOD has simply stolen Batman's free-flow fighting system - which earned heavy praise when it first appeared in Arkham Asylum and is still pretty cool - and spiced it up with a flexible combo system that you can modify as you wish. Might not be a new manifestation of game design genius but its fun to play and no flaw at all.I can only say that Remember Me is one of my favourite games of the last 10 years, right next to Batman (AA and AC), Assassin's Creed, Half-Life, Mirrors Edge, The Saboteur and Max Payne 3. On a more objective game score scale I would give it something in the low eighties.			"

												-No spoilers-A great idea albeit poorly executedA quick copy-paste of the overall story so that you can follow on the review (Don’t worry there are no spoilers):The game is set in the year 2084, in a futuristic version of Paris called Neo-Paris. The Memorize corporation has invented a new brain implant called the Sensation Engine (Sensen), which enables roughly 99% of the population to upload and share their memories on the net, as well as remove unhappy or unpleasant memories. This gives Memorize an immense degree of control over the population and enables them to establish a surveillance state. This, in turn, leads to a small group of rebels forming under the name ""Errorists"": their mission is to bring down Memorize. The invention of the Sensen has also resulted in the creation of Leapers; memory-addicted humans who have absorbed so many memories that their Sensen has degraded and they have mutated into a subhuman form, now living in the sewers of Neo-Paris. The game's plot focuses on Nilin, a memory hunter working for the Errorists. When the game starts, she has been stripped of nearly all her memories by mega-corporation Memorize. With the help of a mysterious man named Edge, she goes on a quest to bring down Memorize and recover her lost memories.On to the reviewPros:-Interesting dystopian world you’re bound to enjoy especially if you’re a sucker for screwed up versions of our future.-Builds an interesting climax and keeps you on the edge because the game is not afraid to yell at your face from the very beginning THERE’S A HUDGE TWIST SOMEWERE IN THIS GAME!!!-A couple of interesting characters and collectables that give more information about Neo-Paris which help to essentially flesh out a very beautiful city full of contrasts.-Nice, fluid combat with an interesting mechanic to create your own combos. It’s not ground-breaking but I had tons of fun punching people in this game.-One or two nice puzzles in the game. They felt off and I really didn’t like that if you stood a while the game just gave you the answer but they were smart and short - just enough to break the tension I guess.-This game does boss fights right! When you meet a boss it’s time to use whatever you’ve learnt so far against it and not mash the X button or play the game of “Find the exploit”.-The very concept of the game, although not original (what is original anyways?) is hard to swallow and should make you question a few things.Is it a good idea to let the general public get a hold of a technology that lets them digitize their memories?Is it a good idea to let the public change their memories?If we are what we remember, can we really change from one moment to the next providing that someone changed our memories?Isn’t that a threat to free will? Imagine if a terrorist group could erase the memory of 9/11 from the minds of a population.-The game also provides a few very difficult moments where you have to twist someone’s memories and eventually change their character. Even the fact that Nilin (the protagonist) is actually an (T)Errorist and goes about doing things what (T)Errorists do while balancing in that grey area of “The reason Justifies the Means” is a bit unsettling. It’s food for thought which is always very welcome in a game.-I suppose the first twist is easy to read. The second one never crossed my mind. It didn’t blow it – but it was a cool twist non the less.-Changing someone’s memories is by far the best mechanic of the game.Cons:-God awful story-telling. The worse thing is that you only become aware of how bad the story-telling is after you’ve spent a good three hours in the game.-There are a few plot holes that really degrade the experience.-Some minor camera glitches (didn’t really bother me. I’ve also heard that the game suffers from a few bugs but I didn’t encounter any).-It’s quite short and somewhat easy. I would recommend upping your difficulty a bit to enjoy it.-A very poor protagonist. I would call Nilin boring but that could be misinterpreted as if she had a boring character. Well Nilin has NO character. I get that she’s confused and that she can’t decide what to do and who to trust because of her memory wipe. But what we get in the game is a woman who has no sense of purpose other than follow the path laid for her from Edge. She does question his motives and his decisions a couple of times through the game but the answers she gets are poor and she doesn’t press harder. It’s as if she doesn’t care for whatever is happening around her – so long as she gets her memories back - and those moments of gallant clarity and distrust towards Edge are coming out more fake than they should.Nilin doesn’t even question some of the most controversial things that she herself does in the game which is… bad… We spend a minute or two in the beginning of every level listening to her inner battles and those never include some of the dirtiest things a person has to do directly. Let alone the things that Edge did with her assistance.-The very best mechanic of the game – the thing that it does best – the most innovative thing it had to show is changing someone’s memories. Well, you’ll only get to do it three times. ConclusionAll in all I would recommend that you try out the game first and if you really dig in the dystopian Paris or if you get an itch to see what the hell is the game all about THEN buy it.I personally (if anyone gives a flying tard about my opinion) enjoyed the game. But I fill the profile of a person who’s a sucker for dystopias and an intriguing story. Even if it’s presented in a lukewarm, sporadic rain of brilliance amongst ♥♥♥♥♥♥ plot holes and poorly written characters.			"

												Had extremely high hopes for a game that promised to break the norm in so many ways.More than a little disappointed.  Combat is repetitive and tiresome and ""difficulty"" largely involves pouring more and more enemies with more and more health on top of you.  Plot is weak and predictable, English vocals are more than a little unpleasant (made in France, I believe?  Not that I can tell good French voice acting from bad) and the puzzle sequences which was a strong selling point for me are limited in number and scope.Music is nice and aesthetic of the environments is good, but again the clash of utopian architecture with the ramshackle slums is the visual equivalent of the Wilhelm Scream			"

												Really fun an original game. The storyline is great, the gameplay is fun but can get repetitive. The memory remix sequences are fantastic, too bad there's only four of them. I'd play an entire game made up of those. Don't know if I'd buy it full price as it's quite short at 7 hours, but definitely worth it if you get a good deal.			"

												I would like to recommend 'Remember me' not so much as a game but more as an interactive story.'Remember me"" has as central concept the idea that one can extract memories, insert them  and even alter them. Being fan of Philip K♥♥♥♥♥♥duh, his surname gets hidden),it made me think of his story 'We can remember it for you wholesale' that has inspired the movie Total Recall. In this story a man wants to have the memories of a trip to Mars as a secret agent... of course the memories turn out to be true( or do they)?. Manipulating memories is the special skill of Nilin, the protagonist.  She is part of a resistance movement that fights against the organisation Memorize that has turned manipulating memories into  a way to control people(portrayed as helping them), ignoring the suffering this causes. For too much of anything is harmful and so is too much of manipulating memories. The victims turn eventually into leapers who are, of course, hostile and linger, of course again, in the sewers of the dystopian Neo-Paris contemplating  nastiness.  As Nilin you escape the Bastille into the sewers fighting your way through leapers and then work you way up for a final confrontation at the top of a building in Neo-Paris. During the game you have various opportunities to alter people's memories. Some of these alterations (one of which involves the death of a child) are pretty cold hearted, making me wonder about the morality of Nilin. The game feels like Nilin's personal journey as almost every aspect of the story bears on her own past. This Nilin centered story gives the game a special emotional feel on the one hand, but also makes if feel limited on the other. It is as if we see Neo-Paris through the eyes of Nilin and hardly anything else. It made me feel emotionally attached to her, but also distanced me from the world around her. I want to touch on some of the more negative aspects of the game/story..I think if you like fighting games that this game is probably boring for you. With the exception of a two battles, one against a super robot and another against two teleporting super leapers aided by a lot of normal leapers, can be special hard if you don't know how to handle them, but the other battles were mostly easy for me, so I suspect that veteran fighters will not break a sweat over them..The fighting is done with combo's that you have to earn or find before you can use them. My experience is that with the harder fights you never get beyond a few combos because they have to be chained against the same target to count and since you have to jump around a lot to not get overwhelmed, targeting one and the same enemy for fair amount of time is not very likely.The only other thing you can do is stealing memories, but these are story like elements that are only triggered when the story wants you to and which you can not use as an alternative to fighting for instance. It would have been great if you could make a guard forget about you instead of having to kill him..One of the problems I have with the story is that the most important issue is never dealt with, which is  that while you might change a memory, this will not change reality. An example.At one point Nilin manipulates the memory of a bounty hunter so she will aid  Nilin instead of trying to capture her. It would be obvious that once this bounty hunter gets confronted with reality she must realize that her memories have been tampered with and thus turn her into an enemy again. This difference between manipulating memories and the fact that reality will not be altered as well(let alone the memories of other people or simple: movies or other pieces of evidence) is never worked out in the game. Also, as mentioned above, some of the memory altering that Nilin does causes people grief and this doesn't seem to affect Nilin much. Yes, Nilin ponders a lot about altering memories and what that causes, but she doesn't seem to connect this to her own actions. Or at least that is how I experienced it. She lacks a certain empathy for her victims.In the end I would recommend this game for anyone who likes an involving story set in a dystopian world with some pretty visuals and good atmosphere. I read they are planning a sequel; there is enough  story to make one.			"

												While the mechanics contain nothing new, perhaps apart from the create-your-own-combos system, this game has perhaps the most compelling story I have played in a long time. The combat gets slightly repetitive, the quicktime event-ridden (mini)boss fights are bland, and the puzzles are easy.With that said, however, I absolutely adored the setting in all its grim, dark glory. The visuals are astonishing, the score is brilliant, and the story appealed to me in every way.TL;DR: if all you care about is innovative gameplay, skip this one. But if you enjoy a good story and some beautiful design, do give this a spin.			"

												Real gem of a story and a brilliant level design result in complete immerse into dystopic future. Too bad there won't be any sequel - if it'd get open-worlded sequel like The Witcher does right now, it would definitely blow competitors off the scene. The only downside is a bit too arcade controls' system - it's playable with PC Master Race's default tools aka mouse and keyboard, but for full immerse it also requires gamepad, which is a modern PC games' plague nowadays. Thankfully, this doesn't extend to graphics - not only they look fitting and have that ""hand-made"" feeling, but the technical parts of the game like 3D skyboxes and texture stretching are nearly invisible to end-player, which is an advantage. Most modern pop-games like Skyrim feature blurry (or, as I call them, soapy) textures, or unrealistic ""outer world"", or like-a-sponge-physics. Be sure - this one piece of art DELIVERS pleasure from looking upon. 10 out of 10.And memorize that soap only belongs to the bathroom, not your livingroom. GJ, Dontnod.			"

												Suffering from a crawl over the whole spectrum, from voice acting to combat, this game is only recommendable if you get it cheap. Some nice scenery, but a bland story riddled with familiar tropes, unresposive combat and an uninteresting main character, it feels rushed and underdeveloped. The famous memory remix-scenes are interesting and the only thing that makes this worth a low price tag.			"

												Great game over all, the only negative thing for me was the combat system which they try too hard to make it different from other games and in the end it feels clumsy and impractical, but don't let this turn you off, it's not that bad and also combat is not used too often. The visuals are some of the best I've seen in a video game, the art direction is beautiful. And the music, wow, the music. This game has the best soundtrack I've ever heard. Really, is that good. If you don't want to try the game at least get the soundtrack, if you liked Tron Legacy's music by Daft Punk, then you will like this one too.			"

												Score: 7/10This is the kind of game you play for the story and if you enjoy the combat, upgrades, and bosses along the way its a bonus. The atmosphere in the game is top notch with the exception of not being able to explore since this is a very linear game. Certain fights will be a complete chore because they require specific powers which have cooldowns. You can lower the cooldowns, amplify damage, and regen health by using combos. You can change these affects in the combos with the combo mixer tool. Honestly I didn't use this until the end of the game because I was set to easy difficulty... which I suggest unless you actually want to play it for the combat. You do gain upgrades both via collectables and through the story itself. The story upgrades play into puzzles in the game which honestly can hardly be considered puzzles.The feature to mess with people memories is gravely not used often enough. Honestly I think this should have been a stealth game with combat elements where you temporarily take over someone for fighting or puzzles. This game has no guns but does have a gimped similar item you use later.Over all though I loved the game purely because the remixing of people memories, the story, and the atmosphere.Fun Factor: 7/10Controls: 8/10Graphics: 9/10Replay: 4/10Story: 10/10Sound: 9/10			"

												Metacritic score be damned.  This is an original game that should be considered by anyone who enjoys an engaging story.  Capcom did a nice job with this and I was surprised.  Here is a quick list of pros/cons:Pros:-Story that a lot of people can relate to in the endrun-Breathtaking scenery that you wish was real-Strong protaganist that makes you wish you for a sequel (though sadly I doubt we will ever get one due to all the COD nuts out there and the history of what sells the most)-Memory remixing (mini game where you rewind and fast forward like a movie but you adjust objects that affect the outcome)-Simple combatCons-Humanoid robots do not react to you-No interaction with NPCSI got this during the summer sale and I played it on normal and beat the game in two days of playing (about 12 hours).  Please DO NOT believe the metacritic score of 65, its  a bit preposterous.  I've played many a game since the original Mario on the NES and this is a good action game with a good story.  The combat is OK, nothing amazing, and being able to adjust your 4 pressens to different combos can make it fluid.  You have 4 different combos to build and if you play with the pressens enough; you will be able to have fluid combat.Simple summary - engaging story that is a playable work of art.			"

												Had extremely high hopes for a game that promised to break the norm in so many ways.More than a little disappointed.  Combat is repetitive and tiresome and ""difficulty"" largely involves pouring more and more enemies with more and more health on top of you.  Plot is weak and predictable, English vocals are more than a little unpleasant (made in France, I believe?  Not that I can tell good French voice acting from bad) and the puzzle sequences which was a strong selling point for me are limited in number and scope.Music is nice and aesthetic of the environments is good, but again the clash of utopian architecture with the ramshackle slums is the visual equivalent of the Wilhelm Scream			"

												A story derived from some of the best science fiction of all time. With nods to the Sixth Day, Asimov, and a plethora of other mind-bending steps outside ourself. I highly recommend you play this game with the best video settings on a high-performance pc. It's visual story-telling. It's a cyberpunk novel set in a dystopian future where memories are bought, sold, and traded as a commodity. You play an errorist who has the rare ability to remix memories. In mission one, you parkour you way Tomb Raider-style across neo-Paris in an effort to make it to Headache Tommy's Bar. There, you will begin to unravel your future journey, as well as your own mind.			"

												The game stays incredibly bland and sometimes just bad most of the time; the memory remix scenes of which there are surprisingly few make up all of the high points of the game and that's about it. The writing is incredibly shoddy and the game particularly handles a futuristic technology and world in the most lazy, uncreative, and uninspired way I could have imagined. It is missing millions of small things that could make it all more enjoyable while at the same time remaining rife with incontinuities, laughable voice acting, and poor audio mixing that really took me out of the game more than a few times. I can't begin to describe every little thing wrong with it, but frankly after several hours of an almost funny number of things being wrong with the game, it soon just becomes boring; I played up until the final boss when, in the middle of the fight I realized I wasn't even having a little fun anymore, and put the game to rest. I'm glad it was on sale, but I'd be more glad if I could just forget Remember Me. Damn I'm clever ...			"

												Not a bad game.I just wish two things had happened:Firstly, that it was open world, and there was more stuff to do, and it had a better parkour system. Frankly, it could have done without a Tomb Raider type climbing minigame every now and then for no good reason, but hey, I think this game would have been extremely interesting to walk around in.Neo-Paris or whatever fascinates me. I think the best part of the game is where you come to a normal little corner of the city, and it's just... all normal. People and their robots and such. It gives one the impression that there's so much more game to see. But it's just a showpiece.This place, this little diversion from the fighting and all that in an effort to rush through the game, was the reason I played Remember Me. I saw a screenshot, and it was beautiful, stunning even. The game was so pretty. And the concept was just awesome.So, when I installed the game and got ready to play, I was not expecting what I got. But I was happy. The combat system was a bit boring, since it basically boils down to spam your big damage combo to kill things, then spam your hp combo to heal back up, and maybe abuse some cooldown combot to get your abilities back faster.It's not bad combat. It's just that the real, BIG highlight of this game was the memory rewriting. You've no idea until you've done it how fun it is. It's just so novel.Worth buying if it goes on sale.			"

IntroductionWhats up with ironic names in video games these days? Does developers have a challenge between themselves who can think of most ironic title for a game? Do they then have little award ceremony where the most creative dev gets awarded with a box of Jack Daniels tells acceptance speach and drink himself to the sleep? But I digress, Remember Me is a classic beat 'em up game that is set in not so distant future where everybody is sharing the memories through new technology called SenSen. I can't imagine myself sharing any of my awkward memories with anyone, but in this game it feels like memories are being shared like unflaterring pictres of you on facebook. Game starts with a commercial of different people telling about their experiences with the memory sharing technology and how it has improved their lifes to some extent. After that you see the protagonist somewhere in hospital with her memories being erased. From there you progress regaining her memories and special abilities.The PlotThe protagonist is a memory hunter, a person, that steals and sells certain memories of certain individuals. But Nilin is special, she can also remix memories as she pleases. In the very beggining of the game, Nilin's memory is wiped and someone called ""Edge"" helps her to escape medical facility she's in. As Nilin progress she enters a sever where she encounters her first enemies. Mindless and deformed, these things is an example what happens when you overdose on the memories and overload your SenSen technology. You will meet many variations of so called ""leapers"" with specific way to dispose of each them. There's plenty of characters you encounter in the journey, but unfortunately, all of them are boring, stale and you can't relate with them on any level. The new task is given to a player: to regain all memories. And so the quest begins.GameplayFrom the first look the gameplay resembles what would we get if we frankenstein Deus Ex: Human Revolution visuals with Assassin's Creed (1) clunky controlls, but with fists. I wouldn't call it good since it gets boring real fast due to linear corridors and repetitive nature of the game.The only redeaming feature I really liked is assembling your own combination when you want. There's different types of hits you can add to your combination: healing, to slightly reduce cooldown of a special skill, hit that deals more damage and a hit that doubles the effect of previous hit. You then can add them in particular slots which are marked with 'fist' and 'foot'. I found myself using short combos that you get at the very beginning because they are easy to pull off and with good timing you can land them easily, dealing great amount of damage. I expected better scaled difficulty as my first play through I was Memory Hunter difficulty (hardest possible), but all I got was artificial difficulty when enemies deal more damage, you do less damage and it takes a lot more effort to kill bosses. Unfortunately, the unique parts of the game were so short that they were over in a blink of an eye. Thats right, Memory remixing. Another thing I didn't like was quick time events in boss battles. It's especially irritating when you see a strange icon on the screen and you can't tell which button to press and the only way to know is by trial and error. And lastly, the cutscenes are unskippable and it ruins fun for those who already completed the game once. Overall gameplay is pretty poor, but bearable enough to finish it at least once.ConclusionThe reality is that the game is bad. You can't skip cutscenes, combat quickly becomes a chore, quick time events, lack of customization, poorly written, uninteresting characters and dialogue, boring boss battles. This game won't be temembered, as title suggest.			"

												I picked this up hoping for gameplay similar to DE:HR with a female Adam Jensen. Instead I got gameplay from the 6th gen and graphics similar to that found early 7th. Clunky platforming, boring and non-responsive combat combines to make this a solid ""Ignore this Title"" winner.The memory section that I played was entertaining, but not enough to salvage my this title in my eyes. I only wish that I had the games technology to erase memories so that I could forget this experience.			"

												Man, the graphics are so pretty... but the controls are super hard on a PC.  ""Get a game pad.""  You might say.  Meh is my rebuttle. This game is pretty, but not worth that sort of effort.  2/5 based on controls, voice acting, and combat system.  I felt like it was trying to cross the Batman series (with the combat) and Mirrors Edge (with the style).  Might have turned out good if the developer hadn't drank during its deveoplment.			"

												Pros: -Great Graphics-Fluid Controls-Good Music-Good Ambiance-Interesting storylineCons:-bad camera (too close to help explore)-can't explore **-no attention to the real world**Paris does not allow tall buildings in the old district*Fance has universal healthcare so Olga would not have to take the bounty**This is the big one that did it for me. You have all this open concept but you arn't allowed to explore it. at least open it up a bit like ""Uncharted"" to let you think you have more options. You can only jump where it says you can jump which is only to progress the story yet there are so many places that look like you should be able to jump to. Very frustrating.  "

												Poorly designed combat system, and combat is a large portion of the game. There are enemy’s that can be attacked unless the lights are on or they are stunned, for some reason you cant attack at all until you can see them. If one of the stealth creatures attacks and 4 normal things, You have to wait until you can see the stealthed one before any punches or kicks can be dealt out. The camera got stuck in the wall more than, making it unplayable until fixed or I quit.Sometimes when trying to turn she will keep walking a short distance, got me killed a few times.the game play is compelling, but for 30$. feels unpolished, and it could have been a classic one of a kind game.

												Gameplay is basically composed by two different parts: exploration and combat. While combat is fun (at least at the beginning) and fluid, the exploration part is uninteresting: the game shows you where to go and where to jump with a yellow arrow; it's so straightforward the I wonder why they created these sections at all.Setting is great, scenery is beautiful, characters are interesting (given the standard in this kind of games) and the story is decent. So why thumb down? Well because even if the combat is fun, it becomes very repetitive after a while and, given the subpar exploration phase, the whole experience becomes dull pretty quickly.The game becomes quickly a chore and setting, scenery and story aren't enough to continue playing. It's still worth trying if you can find it at less than 5 pounds (like I did), otherwise, there are better games out there.			"

												Can't skip cut scenes. If you've started a chapter and decided to stop at the very beginning, you'll have to watch quite long scene again. If you want to hunt for collectibles, again, watch it all. Can pause, can not skip.Can't go back to previous checkpoint when you realize that you've missed a collectible. This is incredibly annoying. Also game has a habit of locking doors behind you. So when you just want to take a quick look through the right door and then get back to the left one, prepare for your options to be cut without mercy. Damn infuriating.Combos are useless. You only need one or two. Combo creating mechanic is also useless. You can put one hit into exactly one combo. And there's barely enough of them for two long ones so you'll have to edit combos in the middle of the fight. This means that having one long combo which you modify is enough. But modifying mid fight ruins the action.Also among all the hits only 4 chains are really good, and you can only acquire 2 or 3 without special effort. So I did not even bother buying most of the rest. Had about 5 unused keys in the end.Camera is ok, views are great, levels are mostly linear, characters are meh. Car crash part of the story was nice, rest about revolution and struggle is not realy inspiring.Sometimes the game makes an effort to help you and sometimes it punishes you for nothing. For example in some jumping puzzles there's a convenient ledge you can grab on in case of a wrong move. So you don't have to start all over. But if you fail during a fight, all your focus on restart will be gone. So you will be in a worse position than before.Also quick time events. Argh.P.S. Why the hell people rot and mutate because their memories have been messed with! What's up with that? And how is that evolution if it happens in one life span of a single specie.			"

												Mind games done right""Remember me"" is a well crafted game in a beautiful setting. Neo Paris is simply stunning. The presentation and artwork ""Remember me"" offers isn't seen very often and I can't praise the level of detail enough.When you start the game your character Nillin had forgotten nearly everything. She has to escape from a dystopian prison in which the prisoners are robbed of their memory. In the grand scheme the story is nothing really new, but I really liked the character development Nillin undergoes and the the fact that all the characters in the game have a real motivation for their actions which you can understand. The twists in the story aren't as obvious as in other ganes but at some point you'll know in which direction the writing will go. And while the story may be not original, it is told really well while it doesn't start to get boring. Overall I needed about 10 hours to beat the game and I enjoyed every second of it.You acquire a variety of skills and abilities which you can use while fighting or while solving little puzzles. All of the abilities are enjoyable and useful. You will need every combat skill from time to time which is assured through the variety of enemies you face. While the combo system could have been a little bit more thought out, it still was fun to switch around the different kicks and punches.The boss fights were memorable, at least three of them were really great. The amount of enemy waves you have to face sometimes can get a bit tedious but most of the time I didn't thought that I was just fighting for the sake of it. I'm not really a big fan of platforming so Remember me did it exactly right for my taste which means, it is easy as hell. It's really hard to miss jumps and even in situations where you're under pressure you can always count on the auto save system of the game which is never far behind in case you die.The most fun I had in the game was when I mixed my first memory. With the help of a mind controlling glove you can go into the mind of certain NPC where you're able to play with the memory of a certain event. I really felt like I was playing ""Final Destination - The Game"". You try out different scenarios in which you try to kill certain characters. While all only happens in the memory of the person you're mixing at the moment it still has big consequences in the end. Mixing plays a huge part in the story and is really well implemented.Overall I had a great experience, the game may not be perfect in every aspect but it did a lot of things really well. I was satisfied with the ending and the experience I had. In the second half of the game I became emotionally invest in the characters and how their story might turn out which doesn't happen very often in those type of games. If you're remotely into brawler games with a good portion of platforming and a great story, you should try it out.			"

												I have a love/hate relationship with this game. I just wish it wasn't a game. If it were a movie it would be a perfectly serviceable, boilerplate action flick, it would be worth paying to see. As a properly fleshed-out TV show with depth and backstory building as we go you would have me as a fan from Day 1... as a game however, I'm glad I got it on sale.Graphics, lighting, sound design etc. Games don't get points for these things anymore. Remember Me looks good, and sounds nice, I'm not going to give it points for that when even small-name and indie titles can manage to look superlative these days.The story for Remember Me drags you in from the very first frame, which is TRULY impressive, and it is well presented and delivered even if the plot and premise feel as though they stepped out of the 80s. Nevertheless it's well worth it for the story. The memory rewriting mechanic is actually SUPER fun, and despite the clunky console port controlls really requires an element of thought that calls to mind an adventure or puzzle game in a really good way. It is engaging and drags you into the gameplay and game world in a way that... well everything else, can'tThe combat tries to be innovative, and it would succeed if not for the fact that it is klunky and barely two-dimensional. Facing more than two enemies at a time is problematic, and chaining combos together is exceptionally difficult even when you manage to execute the game's 'dodge and continue' manoeuvre. At the same time, I do not feel as though I am in control of the protagonist in the way I would in any similar hand to hand combat game (i.e Arkham City or Assassin's Creed). I am not fighting, I am reacting to ambulatory quick-time events. There is no sense of flow here, more a cut-down form of fighting game button mashing with beautiful choreography to go along with.This problem could be easily fixed with some form of blocking manoeuvre, if there was one this would completely negate the need for the different kinds of moves or 'pressens' (a word I will not use again, ever), power, heal, cooldown, etc. The ability to simply block attacks as well as dodge them would open up the combat and give a greater sense of flow and connection to go with.The second major issue I have with this game is the movement and camera, which are also hindering the combat. Fixing the camera at angles that are non-orthogonal to movement directions is a MAJOR flaw in third-person games. If you don't know which direction you're going to jump away from a wall, how can you know how to position yourself for the jump except through repeated failure? Secondly the camera never behaves in a consistent fashion, often changing distance and orientation between areas which also affects its movement rate and available orientations. How can I go from one open area to another and from being high above the protagonist's shoulder to practically breathing down her neck. These camera changes also appear to 'zero' any keypresses, so say you're walking along and hit a small 'focus stealer' event like an interactive billboard, once you get the camera back you start running. Or say you transition between camera positions by walking from one area to another and suddenly your orientation changes from straight ahead to the right hand side These constant perspective changes are jarring and frustrating in the extreme, quintuply so when movement direction is dependent on camera angle as is the case with so many third person games. I just cannot let this slide when third person games have been handling movement and camera a dozen times better than Remember Me for more than a decade. If you are going to fix the camera in an area, FIX THE DAMN CAMERA. Don't change the position and range of motion every 5 minutes depending on what you want to show off. The cinematography ACTIVELY ruins what should be an enjoyable cyberpunk dystopia clas- war story and serviceable close quarters fighting game.			"

												Let me start by saying that Remember Me has a very rich and detailed world and setting, unlike anything I've seen before. However, the game fails to capitalize and build up on its world. The characters are forgettable. You'd expect such a game to have memorable characters and set pieces. Nope. What was supposed to be an engaging sci fi thriller/mystery turns into some generice plot. Simply said, the game has squandered its unique potential. Oh, and the gameplay is utterly repetitive. Although you can ""design your combos"", it is largely usesless as nothing is more efficient than simply mashing ""X"" (on the 360 controller) to take down enemies. There are a variety of skills you can use and also a gun mechanic, but the base combat is really boring. So, I'm sad to say that Remember Me has the concept nailed right but the execution is severly lacking.			"

												Let's start with the psoitives:The art style is very unique and very well done it really gives you that future feeling the game goes for combine that with a completely out of the box story and this game had me interested in the first 20 minutes.Now the bad stuffThe combat has no impact what so ever they don't use any slow-motion effects or ''oomph'' to make you feel like your hits actually have power behind them.The anymation throughout the game so far has been floaty to say it lightly againt in combat this matters the character models actually clipp through eachoter instead of bouncing off and even in cutscenes everything moves so weird and non-human it is very hard to look at.The game railroads you really hard to the point in platforming sections it litterakky shows you where to jump to with a brigh orange arrow it's all linear with 1 or 2 side paths to get a collectable and beck on the rails you go.The information during combat is minimal there is no way to see wich enemy you're targetting wichs lead me target an enemy i couldn't take out before i beat the smaller ones but the auto-target kept locking onto that big guy wich i can't hurt.All things considered great concept really poorly executed i would say get it on 70% off and have a few hours of WTF moments but don't pay full price "

												This game has a somewhat interesting story. Particularly the back drop of the society it is set in. However; over time it begins to get strange and even ridiculous. My biggest problem with this game though is how completey linear it is. Aside from the small freedom and flexiblity in combat, everyone will play the game exactly the same. There is only one way for everything and everywhere is basically a narrow walkway that you can't leave. Even the ""free running"" or ""parkour"" is incredible boring and restricted here. Remember Me certianly is not the worst game around and I suppose if you've no other game available it could be used to kill some time, but there is no way I could recommend it. Pass on it, but if you insist on trying it then I suggest you wait until it goes on sale like when I got it.			"

												Remember Me is a nice looking game with a competently done story that completely falls down on gameplay. Visually, it's amazing. There's a heavy influence of the Fifth Element or the comics of Jean Giraud with a lot of references to classical art and modern graphic design that looks great. The plot is fine, even though it's really just the same ""person wiht a unique ability overthrows a sci fi dystopia"" story that's been done a million times. I'm not going to bother saying much more about those elements.The problem with this game is that at some point you have to stop looking at the pretty pictures and actually start playing. There are three parts to the game: platforming, combat, and memory remixing. I'll cover each of those separately.The platforming consists of selecting the correct direction to jump and then pushing the jump button. I know that technically you can describe any platforming game in that way, but in Remember Me that is really all it is. For most of the game you have a single path you can select. If you try to go the wrong direction or do anything at all other than pushing in the proper direction and then pushing the jump button, the game will usually just ignore you. At least that's true for the actual platforming sections, the floaty controls will sometimes send you flying off of a ledge for no apparent reason when you're not actively trying to jump anywhere. A couple of times, in the earlier levels, there are timing-based sections, where you have to figure out the proper timing for jumping, but there are really just a handful of them in the game as a whole.The platforming sections do have one benefit, I have to admit. They are often used to show off the great visual design of the game to good effect.The combat is third person brawling built around doing combos that you modify by plugging moves, which can either damage enemies, heal you, or speed up the cooldown timer on your special moves, into a preset series of button presses. So, for example, on a 360 controller the first combo is X X X. Each X can do something different depending on what moves you designate on the opitions menu, but ultimately you're just hitting x x x over and over again. By the end of the game you unlock a total of four combos to plug the moves into, and those are the only ones you will ever get. This results in most of the combat being very repetitive, as you use the same combos over and over and over again. Later on, other abilties are added to the combat. These include special moves and a very simplistic shooting mechanic that just involves locking onto a target. These help break up the monotony of doing the same combos, but aren't themselves interesting enough to save the combat.The memory remixing sections should be the centerpiece of the game, since the entire plot is built around Nilin's, the protaginist, ability to do this, but iit sn't done much in the game, and isn't especially engaging when it is done. The short version of the story explanation is that Nilin can alter people's memory to make them do what she wants. This is done via a mingame in which you rewind through a video of a person's memory and then alter things by locating ""glitches' that appear as orangish spots during the video of the memory and hitting the ""alter"" button until they remember events the way you want them to. So, if you wanted someone to remember that they hat coffee you would go back through their memory of drinking coffee, pause it at a glitch on the coffee, and then hit the ""alter"" button to make the coffee taste terrible. There is some attempt to make these sections into puzzles by giving you different choices on what to alter and occassionally providing choices that will do the opposite of what you want, but I really never found myself putting any though into what needed to be altered. The choices are usually so obvious, when you're given a choice at all, that the only difficulty you might have is jmissing the orangish glitches. So the memory remix sections are really just glorified QTE sections that you can rewind at will.That covers most of the meat of this game. There are a handful of puzzles scattered around the game, but they are so brief that their effect on playing the game is negligible and none are clever enough to warrant mention.If you still want to play this based on the visual style alone, I'd suggest you consider Enslaved: Odyssey to the West. It is a similar game with equally gorgeous graphics, but has more varied gameplay and better polish overall. If you've already play Enslaved, then all I can say is this is a lot like that but not as good. "

												●▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬●Developer: DONTNOD Entertainment×°×★Summary Review★×°×Overall Rating: ★★☆☆☆ [2/5]Story: ★☆☆☆☆Gameplay: ★★☆☆☆Sound: ★★☆☆☆●▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬●★OVERALL★I was severely disappointed by this game. The trailers make it look like an action packed thrill ride supported by a story rich environment; something like Batman meets Assassin's Creed in a Blade Runner universe, but sadly it fails at what should be a sure win formula. I'm only giving 2 stars for effort, but you've definitely flunked the class DONTNOD.★STORY★This is one of the biggest drawbacks for me. It feels like they decided to make an action game based off the success of Batman and Assassin's creed set against a cyberpunk backdrop, but they forgot all about the story and just shoe-horned in something to justify why you're doing any of the crazy things they ask you to do. For instance, the first chapter of the game is all about you escaping from prison, because you'll surely die if you stay there. Fast-forward to chapter 4 and suddenly you're being asked to break back into the prison again. Because, you know, that makes sense. It's not like you could have just done whatever you needed to do in the prison while you were there in the first place.The character interaction is just... awkward. Dialog feels like it was written by a twelve year old boy that just saw Blade Runner for the first time and wanted to make a fanfic with boobies.★GAMEPLAY★Supposedly you're able to customize your combos and chain interesting moves together to ""make your own"" playstyle, but all the moves are basically the same and there's no real customization to be had. Not to mention you have to buy a $4 DLC just to get some extra moves.You can heal yourself by hitting people in the face, because, you know, that makes sense too.Zombies can cloak themselves like ghost in the shell meets Left 4 Dead, because, you know, that makes sense. And to make them visible, you have to turn on a conveniently placed light switch that only works for about three seconds, then you gotta hit it again with your virtual bullets (which doesn't break the light switch at all! even tho you just destroyed a crane with it early) because... that makes sense.You have these powerful combo chains that involve about five or six combos that you'll never get to the end of because you'll have to hop around the place like a rabbit on cocaine trying to avoid getting hit by your enemies. Say it with me now, ""because that makes sense!""★SOUND & MUSIC★I never thought a game could have bad music, but I've been proven wrong here. The music is terrible. It's bland electro-house music mixed together on some free app on someone's phone, I think. Cutscenes are WAAAAY too loud and the rest of the game is far too quiet, so enjoy turning your volume up and down for the entire game, because that makes sense.★BUGS & BOTHERS★I'm not even gonna bother with the ""Bugs & Bothers"" section because this entire review is already filled with them.

												Really just boring. I read the reviews and despite this still purchased it. I knew it was the kind of game I would be bored with, but I wanted to support a big budget game with a female lead character for once. Unfortunately it borrows strong elements from games like Batman and Uncharted, but doesn't reach the highs of any of these games. Ultimately I'm glad I didn't pay more than $12 for it, because I am pretty sure I will not finish it.			"

												I wish Steam had a neutral option. I would recommend this game. However it'll have a big list of ifs and buts, and I can only say get it when it's heavily discounted.Now to explain my experience:I was initially intrigued by the game's setting and the concept of stealing memories. It's a fresh concept and started off on a good foot. However, as the game went on, the story started to get less and less interesting, filled with a large number of tropes and cliches, and the worst of all, feeling padded with levels that were way longer than they should've been. The game can be summarized as a collection of cutscenes connected together by tonnes of climbing, combat, and stealth sections, which often repeated in every single stage.I enjoyed the combat. It was fun stringing together combos and making each hit in a combo do something, like heal self or reduce the cooldown on skills. Getting a chance to dodge whenever I want, and we've got a very dynamic combat, enhanced even further by fun S-Pressen skills, which act like special abilities, such as a short fury burst, or slowing the enemy reactions, or even making machines turn on their allies and self-destruct.The boss fights were either love or hate experience for me. I enjoyed some of them, like the Zorn robots, but the ones against some important characters were irritating, because most times they were completely invulnerable to everything but one skill, and unfortunately the skill you needed to use would go on a long cooldown after you use it. Even with the help of cooldown reducing skills, this still dragged out the boss fights way longer than they should've been. To make boss fights even worse, you had to finish each boss off with a series of QTE button presses. If you make a mistake, the boss heals some health and you have to keep fighting them.Another common gameplay mechanic is the climbing. It's very similar to Assassin's Creed style of climbing around buildings and rooftops, except it's pretty much 100% linear. There are no big cities to explore. You pretty much make your way from one ledge to the next the entire time. At times you'd be forced to do stealth sections, where you must avoid getting seen by drones. These drones could insta-kill you if you got in their field of view, so making one tiny mistake meant an instant game over, and not being able to save whenever you want, you'd often be taken back to the last checkpoint.Lastly, the game also had rather cool memory remix sections, where you had to alter someone's memory and make them think that what really happened was different. It's an awesome idea and I thought it was great, but there were only 4 such sections in the entire game. Moreover, despite how cool they were, I don't see them being fun the second time round, when you already know what to do.Overall I was a bit disappointed. The game had a nice premise, a cool setting, and both the visuals and music were nice too, but its gameplay suffered for the most part and got very repetitive very fast, and the story got less interesting in the second half. Because of this, I can't recommend it to most players, but I think some players will enjoy it very much.			"

												TL;DR: Unless it's under $5, save your money and buy MIrror's Edge and Assassin's Creed II instead.  In fact, even if it is under $5, only buy it if you have already played those other two.Full Disclosure: At the time of this review, I have only finished about half of the game. I will likely come back to it some day, but I have too many good games in my inventory to bother with this right now.I had high hopes for this game, and really wanted to like it.  It has a lot of the stylistic appeal of Mirror's Edge, with some added super-cool Minority Report-style interfaces.  Unfortunately, it seems to have taken all their effort to get this far, and the combat and environment suffer for it.One of the biggest complaints I have might be poo-poohed by folks, so I'll get it out of the way.  After 5 Assassin's Creed games, 3 Batman games and Shadows of Mordor, gamers have been trained to respond to an attacking enemy in this style of game by pressing ""Y"".  To have this game copy everything else control-wise in the other games except that is a bit of a hurdle.Ok, now to the main points: Environment: this is the worst part to me.  There was so much promise in this city--slums and ledges and boxes and rooftops. To find yourself unable to even climb on a box in the street is insulting. To then have these hidden items in places that are not easy to locate is just trolling.  Such a rich world, but it quickly becomes apparent that it's just a hallway with fancy wallpaper.  On the few occasions when a puzzle needs you to interact with the environment, it is often so poorly indicated that I couldn't even tell there was a puzzle there.Combat: So, first there's the whole ""can't block"" issue that killed me plenty of times.  I'm willing to write that off to poor playing on my part.  Unfortunately, that's not all that's bad about the combat. The next thing is the ""combos"".  you get a series of combos, but they are all variations of X and Y, so there can only be a few.  On top of that, the shortest combo is 3 strikes.  The next one is 4, and then 5.  This sounds fine, but since dodging breaks the combo and getting hit breaks the combo, I was rarely able to string more than 3 attacks together when fighting more than 2-3 enemies. So, effectively, I had one combo.  The last issue leads into the next one...Memory scrambling: You learn to remix memories pretty early, and then....don't use it for a long time.  As a central core of the entire world they have built, you'd think they would do more with it.  Really, it is used for the very rare remix, and for exchanging information via high-tech implanted electronics that in centuries past would have been passed via a map scribbled on a napkin.So the point of all this is that really, they had a great idea for this game but didn't have the money, time or talent to pull it off.  Which is really a shame.  You can see true greatness peeking out from behind the bars of Remember Me, but sadly it will never see the light of day.  I will instead believe that the game was so great that it threatened to destroy the world, and so the government and dontnod conspired to create this game and erased the original from everyone's memory.EDIT: Oh!  I can't believe I forgot this.  The developers speak French, and I don't.  And even I was offended by the pronounciation of the French words in the game (Saint Michel, La Bastille, etc).EDIT on 07/24/2015:I finished the game the other day, and have a few things to add. You do a lot more remixing later in the game, so that is something. In fact, it gets a little tedious, which is kind of funny considering the huuuuuuge gap at the beginning.  The combat is still highly repetitive and still sucks, though I was able to pull off longer combos. It was still difficult to know when an area was open and when it wasn't, although later in the game you spend more time inside, so it's more clear.The story is amazing. The world they made is amazing. But the gameplay is just not up to it. If you can get it for <$10, do it. Beyond that...go play Mirror's Edge again.			"

												Well, I didn't expect much from this game but bought it on sale.As you may have seen, it is linear... extremely linear actually, and quite short (8 to 10 hours). The story is great and different from what we're used to. The combat system was ok but not amazingly good, it is pretty hard to finish a full 6 or 7 hit combo just because the weak enemies die before you can finish it. But overall I was really satisfied of the $5 I spent. The story could have been incredibly good in my opinion. If only they went deeper. I may go for a sequel.			"

												I got this game after I saw a video describing some cool technical features of its rendering engine... I like that kind of stuff :)The game looks really great and has nice setting/locations. Music fits perfectly and the main theme is epic. Story and characters are also somehow interesting. Gameplay is mixed bag though - combat and climbing are not so fun because of bad camera and controls. I played with mouse+keyboad and it is far from perfect. Also tried a gamepad but it was no good (cumbersome controlling of the camera during fights). Yeah, I really didn't like the combat - it felt like I was fighting against bad controls and camera even though the combo system itself was nice :)Nevertheless I rather enjoyed my trip to the city of Neo Paris. While the gameplay could be better, I recommend this game because where else can you play as a memory hunter who can steal and remix memories? :)			"

												I was very disappointed in the game. I could not even get past the first episode due to constantly jumping over enemies instead of attacking them, and when i did end up attacking them it took maybe 50 or more hits to kill one enemy (Literally)my first issue was optimization, but of coarse i fixed it.Me personally i do not like this game, i do not find it fun to take forever to kill one single enemy (Leapers) and be stuck in episode one. i know i didnt even play the game for a whole hour, but for a good 15 miniutes i was stuck fighting a group of enemies non stop. and non of them would die no matter how many times i hit them.I requested my refund.

												First off, the camera controls.  Take a 3rd person camera, turn mouse sensitivity to the lowest possible setting.  Then hook up a second mouse and hand it to an epileptic.  Sprinkle in a generous handfull of randomly forced camera angles (muh cinematic views) and you've got yourself the camera in Remember Me.Gameplay is boring, repetetive, just terrible overall.  Combat is... just undescribably bad.  Kick, Punch, Dodge, Pew pew with your little memory gun thing, get swarmed by 15 enemies and be unable to pull off a combo of any length.The late-game enemies that damage you when you attack them in any way, shape, or form are absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  ""Electro-static armor"" is NOT an acceptable justification, ♥♥♥♥.Boss fights are boring and riddled with QTEs and text-adventure tier lunatic logic that the game has to explain to you with little pity hints when you fail to make progress.The story is forced, cliched beyond the grasp of mortals, and just plain bad.  Characters are pancake flat.Additionally, when the game plays a cutscene, quality bottoms out and framerate drops to 30.  Now, normally, cutscenes are higher quality than normal gameplay.  Somehow, Remember Me managed to take pre-rendered cutscenes and completely♥♥♥♥♥♥it up.  There are, thankfully, not many pre-rendered cutscenes.Story:  2/10, you tried, barelyGameplay:  0/10 what gameplayGraphics:  8/10 environments, what little I could see of them, were pretty.Engine:  It's the Unreal Engine, it's pretty hard to ♥♥♥♥ up Unreal Engine.  Goodness knows Remember Me tried.If you find yourself wanting to play this game, go find some dubstep and a few youtube videos of female MMA fights.  For the toying with memories aspect, of which there is VERY LITTLE AT ALL, go watch Dollhouse instead.  You'll have more fun, trust me.			"

Posted: September 5, 2016
												The first thing I noticed was that the combat system is very similar to modern Batman games or Shadow Of Mordor. However, it seems more simplified, and timing attacks is not as important. What sets it apart from the other ""Batman"" games is that combos can be customized with different combinations of punches and kicks. I think there should have been more variety in the combo options, since they only come in 4 types: extra damage, reduce cooldown, health regen, and moves that multiply the effect of the previous move. Just when I think the game is about to get a little challenging, it throws me a bone and makes it too easy again. The player will sometimes be granted special abilities that can do anything from stunning all enemies, to controlling one robotic enemy at a time.This game always boxes the player into an arena before starting a fight. Each boss fight ends with a quick-time-event where the correct sequence of buttons to press is always the same. I played on medium mode, and the combat was so easy for me, that I almost always ended each arena segment with full health. Sometimes, I'd take fall damage just before an arena, and end the arena with more health than I started it with.Another similar feature to Batman games is the way climbing works in this game. It lends itself well to big, open, vertical world maps. Unfortunately, this game is extremely linear, and it's always very obvious which ledge to jump to next. There are a few secret items scattered around, but they're always just around a corner, and never extremely out-of-the-way. The game even notifies the player that there's a hidden item nearby by showing a picture of what the area around it looks like. There are a few obstacles, but they're pretty easy to avoid. Just check my achievements, there's one for being spotted by a drone 5 times, and I still don't have it after completing the entire game.Most of the developer's focus was clearly put into the writing, setting, character design, and music. The premise of the story seems heavily inspired by Total Recall and other sci-fi films that focus on memory. The aesthetics look like they're somewhat inspired by Ghost In The Shell with some homages to it scattered around. My own hardware has some problems, and games tend to have graphical artifacts for me. It was difficult to tell in this game what was intentional artifacts and what was my bad GPU. The plot is very contrived and full of cliches, but I won't spoil it here. The idle boss chatter during fights can be a little dumb and repetitive.Where this game really shines is the sound design and soundtrack. Again, my hardware is bad, so it was difficult to tell when the audio was glitching on purpose and when my hardware was acting up again. It has lots of glitchy aspects to it, like repeating and looping errors. The music definitely saved the game for me. The music made me want to get to the next easy arena fight just to listen.I got this game from the Capcom Humble Bundle, and if you can get this game for practically free like I did, it's definitely worth playing for the ""experience"". Otherwise, there's no challenge or replay value, so I can't recommend paying the full price.			"

												Honestly one of the worst games I've ever played. Maybe it has to do with the fact I went in with somewhat high expectations since LiS is possibly my favorite game, ever, and I was disappointed. Regardless, the game falls flat in basically every way. Cringeworthy dialogue and characters. Predictable, boring story. Dull combat in which you fight the exact same enemies over and over and over, using the exact same 'strategies'. Not to mention the visuals are mediocre. Oh, and the voice acting made me wanna shoot myself. The music is alright, I guess. If for some reason you really want to play the game, just play on the easiest setting and spam the first combo to get through the game as fast as possible. Really though, you'll want to stay away from this game at all costs.			"

												First off, the camera controls.  Take a 3rd person camera, turn mouse sensitivity to the lowest possible setting.  Then hook up a second mouse and hand it to an epileptic.  Sprinkle in a generous handfull of randomly forced camera angles (muh cinematic views) and you've got yourself the camera in Remember Me.Gameplay is boring, repetetive, just terrible overall.  Combat is... just undescribably bad.  Kick, Punch, Dodge, Pew pew with your little memory gun thing, get swarmed by 15 enemies and be unable to pull off a combo of any length.The late-game enemies that damage you when you attack them in any way, shape, or form are absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  ""Electro-static armor"" is NOT an acceptable justification, ♥♥♥♥.Boss fights are boring and riddled with QTEs and text-adventure tier lunatic logic that the game has to explain to you with little pity hints when you fail to make progress.The story is forced, cliched beyond the grasp of mortals, and just plain bad.  Characters are pancake flat.Additionally, when the game plays a cutscene, quality bottoms out and framerate drops to 30.  Now, normally, cutscenes are higher quality than normal gameplay.  Somehow, Remember Me managed to take pre-rendered cutscenes and completely♥♥♥♥♥♥it up.  There are, thankfully, not many pre-rendered cutscenes.Story:  2/10, you tried, barelyGameplay:  0/10 what gameplayGraphics:  8/10 environments, what little I could see of them, were pretty.Engine:  It's the Unreal Engine, it's pretty hard to ♥♥♥♥ up Unreal Engine.  Goodness knows Remember Me tried.If you find yourself wanting to play this game, go find some dubstep and a few youtube videos of female MMA fights.  For the toying with memories aspect, of which there is VERY LITTLE AT ALL, go watch Dollhouse instead.  You'll have more fun, trust me.			"

												Just when you think that there can't possibly be a game with better graphics, original game play, a more unique story line, and excellent music scores, you get a game like this.  This game was a total surprise and excitement for me!  It totally submersed me into the game and constantly intrigued me as every turn with unpredictability throughout the whole game.  This game is just one of a few games of 2013 that really grabbed me.  And I would definitely recommend this game to others.  I would say that it reminds me of the Tomb Raider franchise but with a Aeon Flux storyline... However, with all of this good news mentioned, I would suggest that this franchise going forward should gear towards a more""Open World"" feel and not be so limiting.  You do feel cattle herded at times to arenas, down narrow hallways, and easily find the walls and boundaries of your movements as a box.  But despite the limitations this game opens up a bright and exciting new era.			"

												Remember Me takes place in Neo-Paris in the year 2084, where mankind has developed the technology to digitalize people's memories to the point that we can remove and insert memories into people's heads and store them in a literal memory bank. Apparently (I'm not entirely sure why) this technology leads to the situation where the rich become richer and everyone else turns in to Roswell-style alien people. You play a woman called Nilin who was in the revolution against this technology, but gets caught and sent to jail, where her memories are stripped from her. She is broken out and you have to try and get your memories back and continue your revolutionary ways.There is a focus on the prisons of the future as that is involved in the story, but I was rather intreaged about how the prisons work in this world. Basically your memories are removed from you and you're left in a situation where the prison is your whole world and so there is no desire to break out as you do not observe a world outside the prison. Then at the end of your sentence, your memories are given back to you and you don't remember your time in prison. This last part confused me as I would have thought that you would want to remember your time in prison so you have something to not want you to go back there, but that's my opinion. It would have been nice to see how other things are different in this world, like the education system, just for curiosity.My favourite gaming mechanic in this game is the ability to change memories. Nilin seems to be the only person to have the ability to change people's memory, which is used rather sparingly. This mechanic involves seeing the original memory, and then going throught the memory and make small changes, like knocking over a bottle or retracting a coffee holder, in order to completely change the outcome, occuring in an apparent change in personality at times, which is a bit wierd.This mechanic is very fun to do, but there are only four throughout the whole game. To be fair, there is discussion about the morality of changing people's memory for your own personal gain, which may explain why it isn't used often, but I would really like it to have done it more.The fighting mechanic annoyed me immensely at points. The general fighting scenarios is just punching and kicking a lot with a few special abilities. There is the option to stylize some combos so that some punches are more powerful or heal you and such, but I never really finished a seven attack long combo due to avoiding enemies so I didn't find much use in them. One of the most annoying bit about fighting is the length of them. I didn't really like it that in some fights I had to fight five waves of bad guys, spend about ten seconds of not fighting and then put into another fight scenario. There was also some rather harsh parts of fighting as well. There was one section where a big mech was performing a large AoE attack in a small area which I found hard to attack, and then show his weak point only at that point. The fighting section in all didn't really wow me, but it might suit someone who prefers fighting in games.All in all, the three things that would get the player to play until the end is the memory changing gameplay, the well made sceneries and possibly the story if you're really into it. Otherwise you are left with a almost generic runny, jumpy, punchy game where the punchy happens a bit too much.			"

												The visuals and the sounds are extremely impressive, the augmented reality stuff is really well made. For example the memory rewriting is impressive. It has a lot of cool idea's which will hopefully be used in other games. It's unfortunate that the game itself is not an open world game or anything close to a game where you can do something else but follow the story. The game is on rails heavy and very linear with a certain boost pack here and there for variation. You cannot do anything else, which is unfortunate. It also tells you all the time what to do next.I do like the combat system, it's quite refreshing. However it also restricts you by not allowing you to do something else. It also seems to not work quite that well combating groups, since you’re dodging all the time and lose your combo. As fun as the combat system is, pressing 2 buttons all the time and using your sensen power now and then is on the other hand not be that fun... The story is very nice as the game is story driven, but the storytelling and the game itself are a bit linear. The cut scenes take up a lot of time and while playing allow you to not do anything else. They are however at various points visually spectacular. Using a different protagonist as most other games was nice.The biggest downside of the game are the camera and the controls. The camera is utter♥♥♥♥♥♥when playing with keyboard and mouse.For a first game, it's quite ok. But it should have been more...			"

												Remember Me is not a good game. Set in a future Neo-Paris, a technology called Sensen allows people to store and share memories. You play Nilin, a memory hunter who can remix memories. The concept would have been cooler and would have been more interesting if this wasn't such a warn path in film and television. I can personally recommend Joss Whedon's Dollhouse as it also has a strong female protagonist, but also a much better story and pushes the concept of altering memories much further than anything that Remember Me even eludes to. And I think this is a big sticking point with the game as it just isn't very interesting.Graphically Remember Me is very nice, but as a third person adventure game it is very linear, the combat is boring on the side of being way too long and repetitive, the platforming is easy as all the jump spots have floating arrows next to them to tell you where to jump to. The reason why the floating arrows are there is probably because because the environments are so nice, it is almost impossible to navigate all of the invisible walls and climbing dead ends without them, especially since there is no Assassins Creed type procedural climbing engine at play.A few reviewers have mentioned that the four brief remix sequences where you get to edit someone's memory is cool, but these are just trial and error puzzles that require very little skill and aren't particularly interesting. But if you like the idea then I can recommend the film Inception, as it is very similar in concept, but pushes the idea much further than Remember Me. If Remember Me had of taken the whole memory storing, sharing and remixing further than you playing a character who can't remember anything and needing to steal the memory of a keypad door code from some guy, I would have enjoyed this more, but it didn't.For other memory altering films I can recommend, The Final Cut with Robin Williams, Dark City, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Total Recall, 50 First Dates and Paycheck as they all take the concept much further than Remember Me or does it in a much more interesting way.Remember Me is a missed opportunity. 2/5			"

Remember Me has to be one of the biggest disappointments in recent gaming. The strong premise and setting was entirely under played. Couple this with a failure of a combat system and you have a missed oppurtunity of epic proportions. The idea of a world where bad memories are discarded for better ones filled with 'Hunters' that go around stealing them like some Inception-like spies is enthralling. I look around the beautiful enviroments with glee and awe, yet every turn is a locked gate or some  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t  excuse for a turn around. This chokes the player, suffocating them, and forcing a single path that in my own experience caused an overwhelming feel leaving too much to look at in such a small straight area. As the game progressed this never got better, eventually I stopped being impressed by the game's beauty and only cared about finishing it. Even the core mechanic that had so much promise fell straight flat on its' face. Seeing that you are one of the best Memory Hunters 2084's Paris has to offer you have the gift of changing people's memories for your own gain. These far and few between sequences , a whopping four times in an eight plus hour story,  only serve as tedious exposition. Now I'll admit that exposition in a plot driven game is crucial, but the way the developers handled it could have been the worse way they could. Instead of manipulating the character's mind in some intriguing way, the sequences devolve into an endless series of repetitive trial and error rewinds. This brings up another one of my major problems with the game... The protagonist is willfully altering these people's memories and in turn personalities. How is this moral, or even just. The comments our protagonist make in the level gap cutscenes blatantly says that only the evil naughty do-dooers justify the means to an end, so is she saying what she does is wrong? ...No, Because there is no punishment or radifications for her actions except one which initiated the game and could be argued has no weight in the true scheme. Lastly, The failed combat. The concept, like everything in this game, falls short. The way that it was structured had me feeling like I was inside of an eight hour tutorial, and because of that no satisfaction ever came. The combat on a whole felt more like padding.. Follow the designated path, fight, path, follow, cutscene, fight, path, fight, path... This game was destroyed by its' high ambitions and lack of follow up. 2/5			"

												Pretty disappointing game: while the world is set in a visually stunning and interesting environment, you have absolutely no way to explore it.This game is a long, dumbed-down hallway, and it holds your hand all the time. You can't interact with anything, everything is scripted, you can't even jump unless the game wants you to jump. On top of that, the fighting gameplay is frustrating and awfully ripetitive: the customizable combo system promises creativity, but you end up pressing the same buttons over and over again, without ever being actually challenged by the enemies.It was such a let down!

												Feeling the need to write a review and I have only started the first couple chapters....stunning, beautiful, very very well designed levels, neo paris is amazing, cyberpunkesque  landscape.  Music is very well done.  While I havent gotten the hang of the combat system yet, it seems annoying to have it based on combos yet if u have more than 2-3  guys to fight at once youll almost never complete it because of their interupts and your need to dodge. So I will say I need some more practice before I figure that out I may be doing something wrong. Needless to say, most of the time it feels like a big budget movie you get to play and interact with.UPDATE: Story = inteteresting, art design =amazing, gameplay= AWFUL it really is a janky unsmooth unthought out combat system. The whole point of it is combos and the computer ai doing its best to stop them. That's an ok start but simplly almost EVERY major fight stops being about the combos and becomes about using the extra abiliiesl, so it basically removes about 90% of your combat effectiveness(ie the bosses block EVERYTHING aside from these cooldown type moves.  I am not super far in but i am playing on the easy difficulty and starting to get frustrated,  I want to like this game more but its a great idea not done well.			"

												This is a hard one.The premises sounded amazing. The first time I saw the graphics on this game I was stunned with detail. The combat looked flashy and complex.... And then it went all ""meh"". The best feature of this game by far is the memory remixing, something we only get to do a few times and on a limited scale. Other than that, it's a rather boring action game. The combat is repetitive as hell and the jumping sequences suck. The biggest letdown however is that all we get to see of Neo-Paris are just a few cramped up streets. The plot itself isn't half but, but delivers a few bad WFT moments, and goes nowhere at times. This game could have been great, but is just good/average. I would recommend buying it at a sale, but I can't tell anyone to get it at full price. Unless you really really really crave for some cyberpunk.			"

The visuals are really pretty good, but it is stunted by the fact that you can’t go and explore what is really a pretty interesting looking game world.You probably won’t hate it if you buy it, but your money is better spent elsewhere as you are likely to just stop playing it from lack of interest.

												The short: Awesome setting, graphics, and sound.  Interesting memory remixing mechanic, but it was underused.  Too much linear running around and too many click-fest fight scenes.  Ultimately, I feel that this game lives in that annoying limbo where it should either have less gameplay and just be an awesome movie or have more gameplay and actually be a game.The gameplay consists of climbing sequences, fist fights, puzzles, and memory remixing.  The climbing sequences are all completely linear with an arrow always telling you where to jump next, requiring no thought or skill.  The fights required some skill, but were mostly quite repetitive and not particularly interesting - and tend to end with a sequence of quick-time events.    On the other hand, the few puzzles in the game were well done, but there is not much more to say about them.  The memory remixing was really the star of all of the gameplay, and it is a shame that there were only 4 or 5 remixing levels.The game wasn't a big deal, and I'm glad that it only took about 10 hours to finish.  However, the presentation of the game was sooooo good, that I found those 10 hours to be reasonably enjoyable, despite the mediocre gameplay.			"

												I bought this game because of the story concept, sans consideration for reviews from metacritic or others.  The Good: Intriguing elements throughout the story.  Reminiscent of Ghost in the Shell.  Simple combat structure. Decent visuals.  Excellent at providing puzzles for the player to solve before advancement.  Musical score adds to the futuristic feel.The Bad: Glitchy with targeting abilities.  Graphics feel dated.  Environment feels like it is on rails, despite containing depth. Most cutscenes aren't skippable.The Ugly: Combat system isn't implemented well for the trusty old mouse & keyboard combo.   Same with camera angle; allows some control (too zoomed in, IMHO), but not enough to be useful.  Found myself cursing at the sudden shift of view angle during combat entirely too many times.			"

												A game that isn't bad, but isn't amazing. I was left with wanting more from Remember Me. It didn't make use of the interesting ideas enough (you only do like 4 remixes), and the entire time I was waiting for it to really get good. Parkour is all laid out for you (there are arrows on what ledges you can grab), and there is no open world or free roaming in the game. I would've liked to explore futuristic Paris more, and it would've added a lot to the game.Remember Me isn't 'bad', but it's disappointing in the fact it didn't make use of all the ideas and game elements it had. If more breadth was added to them, and it were fleshed out more, it could've been a great game. However, we got a game with the same fights over and over, the same 8 enemies, and really linear gameplay that shouldn't be in a title like this.			"

												This game is a falure. Extremely linear and unbelievably repetitive, it tries to take elements from popular games: fight mechanics from Batman Arkham series, wall climbing from Assassin's Creed and QTE from practically every bad game out there. Combining it with horribly linear environments and repetitive fights, combo system that forces you to repeat the same combo over and over again instead of being creative about how to use them and you get the picture.But it is sad. Because if you remove the gameplay, what's left is a very beautiful and captivating movie for some reason stained by gameplay that should not have been there to begin with. Visually stunning environments with augmented reality elements look brilliant and the main character is very interesting and well-designed. For that, and only for that, this game is worthy of getting at the maximum discount. Otherwise, don't bother, watch it on youtube.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. It had a lot of promise, took a lot of risks, and seemed like it was headed in the right direction during the first hour or so of gameplay. Unfortunately, Remember Me started out strong but ended poorly, causing me to try and push as quickly as possible just to end it. The primary thing that drew me to this game was the story. The story seems to make sense at the beginning of the game, but becomes riddled with plot holes and ambiguity later on. The game play was very reminiscent of the Arkham Asylum/City games, and even threw in a twist of letting you build your own combos. Unfortunately, this too gets a bit stale as you only have about 4 combos to choose from by the end of the game. The memory remix segments were genuinely interesting and a welcome change of pace, but they were few and far between. The dialog was probably the weakest part of the game, varying from tolerable to laughable. There were several moments where I literally rolled my eyes at how bad it was. The game itself has an interesting style, and it seems like it could have been something great. Sadly, it falls short of this on several levels. I am hesitant to recommend it unless it is massively on discounted.			"

												Anyone who claims to actually like this game is a shill. A lot of hard work went into developing the game's concept, but the gameplay is tedious, the story is weak, and opportunities to alter NPC's m,emories were too few and less interesting than they should have been. Redbox it for a console if you feel compelled to play it and then write me a thank you message for saving your precious gaming time and money. Even at the discount I bought it for I feel betrayed.

												Ever played a game where they just throw random enemies at you to slow your story progression? That's what you'll get with this game. The story seems good, but I think I'm almost to the end of the game and so far and there has only been 2 memory remixes, which was the thing that made this game seem amazing.Combat is very repetative: punch, punch, punch, dodge, punch, kick, dodge			"

												This game is just very... Meh. It isn't BAD, but it isn't very good either. It really isn't engaging in any way. Combat is ok at best and gets rather repetitive, even for this kind of game. The parkour stuff looks nice, but isn’t that much fun. The visuals are really pretty good, but it is stunted by the fact that you can’t go and explore what is really a pretty interesting looking game world.You probably won’t hate it if you buy it, but your money is better spent elsewhere as you are likely to just stop playing it from lack of interest.

												Remember me is a new action steampunk game  from Capcom. If you miix batman combat system, assassins creed exploration and deus ex world you will get Remember me. The playable character is Nilin, the pro memory hunter, the memories of whom has been wiped out by Sensen corporation. All peoples memory  is stored on a server called H3O, and Nilin has the job to destroy it. Sensen corp. is carrying out memory remix experiments on humans turning them into Leapers. There are 8 episodes in the game. As you go through the story you will unlock combos and pressens, the latter improve your combat efficiency. Special abilities can be unlocked as well such as Logic bomb, Sensen dos etc, which give you advantages when fighting against enemies (enforcers, leapers, robots and their varieties). there are boss fights, too, but they are not so hard even on memory hunter difficulty. As a memory hunter yoiu can remix key targets memories to achieve your final goal. In memory remixes you can alter the memory, for example you can make a former fatal car crash not happen. The basic idea of the game is excellent, its implement could be better. It is a good game though 7/10 from me.			"

												I would recommend getting this game while it's on sale. I definitely do not think it is worth buying at full price. The dialogue is incredibly cheesy and their themes on society are pretty heavy handed. The memory remixes are fun at first, but turn out to be simple trial and error ""puzzles"" as the game goes on and are fairly infrequent. The combat system is pretty rough and unrefined. The scripted fight scenes don't do much for the fun factor and end up being pretty monotonous. Just button mash your way to the next cut scene.  You can see moments of potential in the game sprinkled throughout, but none of those parts are ever capitalized on. It ended up becoming a chore to finish.			"

												Beautiful and atmospherically dense, it's like a mix of Batman: ArkhamCity's fights, with some Mirror's Edge thrown in, but it doesn't play to its strengths -- too much fighting, not enough platforming, not enough memory fu (remixing happens like 4 times in the game). Would have preferred fewer levels in an open world to endless game on rails (especially given how much of it is repetitive fights). Combo lab is nice, but ultimately doesn't save the fighting. Easy mode isn't. Don't buy until it gets into the $5 range. Could've been excellent had it capitalized on what sets it apart.			"

												This game is a typical console twitch platformer, built from what looks like a template of Oni. The graphics are far beyond last-gen, almost Half-Life 2 even, and the attempts at breathtaking vistas when Nilin is climbing buildings are admirable, but unsuccessful - everything feels cartoony and fake. The architecture of the cities, while pretty, doesn't make any sense, and Nilin's superhuman climbing abilities are just silly. There is absolutely no freedom of choice, the player is practically on rails the entire time going from one checkpoint to another faithfully guided by an orange arrow so the console people don't get too confused (OMG CHOICE! WHAT NOW?!), and from one boss fight to the next, all of which are, again, typical console boss fights - run around in circles and exploit a single weakness for 10 minutes.While the combo system is interesting, the pressens (punches and kicks) are kind of futile because they're all the same, stats-wise - combining combos comes down to just the order of move TYPE instead of trying to chain moves in a group as fluid as possible and achieving some sort of singularity with the kickass nature of the protagonist. The back story is fantastic, and if you're into narrative gaming definitely look into it, but I'd rather follow along a rewindable ""let's play"" than waste money on the game for that purpose, especially because the story of the actual game sucks when compared to the background (see: http://journal.remembermegame.com/en). Any game that can be completed by a strict set of instructions like ""Hold right arrow 3 seconds. Press Space. Hold left arrow 3 seconds and press Space. Hold left shift and tap E. Turn 90°. Hold up arrow. Hold left arrow."" is not worth anyone's money. It bascially comes down to one huge set of quick-time events, and that's no fun for anyone.			"

												I bought it with 75-80% or something discount and for money earned from cards - that's only justification for buying game.- The graphics is nice, the idea isnt too bad - it feels like it was halfway finished, then guy got kicked out and they did some random finishing moves.  I mean for the atmosphere and nice headstart from the beginning each next chapter much more disappointing than another.- game is damn too short and linear. - It's future - and there are doors that you cannot open to return from where you came. Oh yeah, for the whole Neo-Paris only 1 person has a gun - police chief.- Some story lines aren`t explained at all.- I would be able to close eyes even for this - but damned bugs. Game was published 2 years ago and those still exist?! screw that. First boss - I accidentally died and woops - LMB/RMB arent working. Very inspiring. You need to get on the pipe but woops - it didnt get path marking thus inaccessible- restart checkpoint. You need to interact with object - but it didnt get necessary property on this load - reload checkpoint again. You and your enemy stand near wall - and you will not be able to jump over him- only roll somewhere and break combo. Oh yeah - get wall to your back - and consider yourself stunlocked till death.- oh yeah, on death you lose all focus and regain hp. It's 2015 and someone still don`t now how to save values for focus into savegame on reaching checkpoint?- Combat: LMB+RMB for attacking and Space for jumping over enemies. Sometimes you roll somewhere else instead of jumping - even without WASD pressed. And yes, each combat area is too obvious. You will get tired for whole damn repeating.- ""Angel Wings"" on the back each time you remember past skills - c`mon, that sh_t looks bad even in anime.- Ending: it feels like damn anime ending - crappy and facepalming.- so much only funny part - rewinding someone's memory.If you have money for this game - better find something else. And don`t you dare to buy it for it's full price - damned Capcom can turn any idea in average YOBA-trash. Feels like people, which gave positive review, in majority never played Deus Ex series.			"

Other issues are the combat not only being boring and repetitive but also somewhat unresponsive on keyboard and mouse (changed over to a controller and it was much more fluid).The leveling system is there just for the sake of it which is also a little frustrating.Pros:Story is enjoyable, albeit simplistic and predictable.Art direction is quite nice.Way they did collectibles was cool. If you can handle the amount of cutscenes and the average combat the games enjoyable. Personally  I found them overbearing.  "

All those exposed break any kind of immersion with the game world ( art direction ) and the story which is too pretentious and melodramatic ( progression  thru dialogues conveyed in cliches mostly ) - recommended only on sale !

												I didnt play ths game for very long as you can see but i can tell you that the controls are horrid on both game pad(xbox 360 pad) or even while using the keyboard, you just never seem to have control of the camera looking at the character even though it seem like it is trying to move! on the game pad i tried changing the settings to try and get it to work but again it seemed as if it was trying to move but just wasnt working, but after about an hour playing i gave up as it was just so bad. This game has so much potential but is let down by the controls i mean the story seems pretty intresting and had me very intrigued and the soundtrack sounded really good but with the controls being that bad i just had to give up and i am now pretty gutted im not going to get to give this a playthrough becauce Capcom just cant make a game with decent controls. rant over hope you find this helpful			"

												This is also a yes, but no because of many reasons...first, the plus side.Graphics are nice, everything is lively.Negative side is...Gameplay is soooooooo repetative, and the fighting is just terrible... if it had a batman arkham series fighting mechanism, then i would be happy, but this is just stupid....honest rating? 5/10.

												Would be a good game if the combat system was a bit more freindly. Regaining health seems glitchy with key combos and as thats the main way to survive large attacks, you dont have time to complete the required moves. Play it on easiest level or not at all as youll be replaying fight scenes over and over. Memory scenes are good but as they are vary rare in the game its not worth the agrovation.			"

 Shame...ding,ding Shame...ding,ding Shame...ding,dingIt really is. I  somewhat dig this game and on sale for less than £5 it is REALLY good offer. Art is awesome story is intriguing and combat is somehow interesting (thou it take second to get in to theirs combo mixing thing). Then why on EARTH you give this game thumb down??? You may ask.Well long story short thou controls of character are not bad camera in this game is just demented beyond anything. I know this may sound silly but because of this problem I really could not enjoy this game at all :( I mean even with all positives this one stupid problem left me frustrated 90% of time. It's just made worst by the fact that EVERYTHING else (story,combat,graphics,art) are very appealing to me. But this one stupid thing just spoils it ALL. I am very sad about this but I will unfortunately never finish this game as I don't believe there is chance that this problem will be sorted (it's 2013 game). I would like personally meet guy responsible for camera movement and tie him to chair, then introduce him to my brand new little torturer set. Yes its that bad. I have no idea how this passed beta testing phase. You will play and suddenly every joy is sucked out by fact in that moment you cannot manipulate camera correctly or it just went ""weird"". As this situation occures in about every 3-5 minutes you can imagine all immersion just goes to hell. So yes this game is shame not because it's bad game way from it but because it's brilliant game ruined by one little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ problem that can spoil all the fun in second.SO what is my final verdict this time???In current state with utterly broken camera :  4/10 If someone god bless fix this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing (mean camera)  9/10 PS: Troll comments will be eradicated.

												Remember Me is a tragic example of a game that has a tremendous amount of promise but is completely underdeveloped.First, the positives.  The graphics are absolutely beautiful, and the setting (a future version of Paris) is wholly original, with lots of bright clean colors, and the neat use of a HUD showing you where to go.  The aesthetics are very pleasing and pretty!Unfortunately, everything else is an absolute mess.  The controls are solid, but the platforming is shamelessly ripped off of Prince of Persia, only there's just one path for every location.  The combat is about the most tedious that I've ever seen in an action game.  You make your own combos based off a single kick and punch button, and each type of attack can either heal you, increase your super bar, or do extra damage - and this sounds way more interesting than it actually is.  It boils down to you making 3 combos out of all the ones that you could do, and repeating them endlessly for the game's entire runtime - and the fight layouts are sometimes done in the most frustrating way possible.  Because some combos can heal you, you're forced to deal with bad guys that literally hurt you every time you hit them, and it as void of fun as it sounds like it is.The story starts out interesting but quickly takes a downturn.  It acts like it's going to be about the loss of identity, and what identity means to a person, but it quickly sidelines into yet another sci-fi conspiracy theory story, with bad guys SO depraved that they're practically like Looney Tunes villains.  When it finally came to the utterly predictable plot twist at the end, I found myself having any sort of trouble caring.  Which is bad, because not every game needs to be about the story, but when everything besides the visuals is either bad or so-so, your story needs to be AWESOME.It's worth checking out on a sale (like I did), but overall this game is not worth the money you'd spend to play it.  If you want to play a neat sci-fi setting, go play any of the Mass Effect's.  If you want to play a game with great combat, go play the Batman Arkham games.  There are other games that do anything this game tried to do better.			"

												Trying to edit it agian so I hope it looks more reasonable this time. + Good background setting, the concept about future environment is outstanding. - Player get ZERO interaction with the featured environment. ""Lifting a broken door, turn on a light"", oh we could do it in 20th Century. + Epic music. No argue with it. - The use of background music could be much more better that what this game currently have. -Lack of consistency.This game is like a combination of serveral flash games, the thing is, they pretty bad on those 'flash game' they made. Apart from those, the memory changing part interested me, which only existed 4 times in the whole procedure. -Combat system. IT IS BORED AS FK? Story line. So far the story has not yet suprise me.  + This game came out on 2013, so they could have some excuseS for the failure. *I used XBOX controller to play it, much better than key board and mouse, but it does not make this game better. If you do have LOTS OF spare time, this game could be a time killer, but not a good one. Get it when on sale. I dont recommand this game.			"

												Remember Me is one of the most interesting game I had play.It is a 3rd person parkour and a action packed game. The  story of this game is really good which is what keeps me going for this game.Besides that,there is 5 unlockable power and  it's one of those games that u must use all powers u unlock in some fights so there is no powers u dont use as u need all!Plus there is a unique part of this game that is u can alter memory of people like the doctor is actually curing the person but u altered  the memory of the doctor which cause him to kill the person,etc.For people who like story and action games then this is one of the must play games!

												Quite nice game.Interesting story and cool mechanics. Quite reminiscient of Assasin's Creed with the parkour and fighting.

												A game with good music, story, visuals, characters, world design, and basically all around pretty to observe.It is however, incredibly mind-numbingly dull to actually PLAY the damn thing.Rembmer Me is a game that should have been a movie or series, rather than any kind of interactive medium. The core gameplay can easily be summed up in two parts:1) EXTREMELY linear parkour, the same kind featured in many games like Assasins Creed or Tomb Raider. There's no puzzle to these jumpings, or at least no puzzle that can't be completely by a two year old, and it tells you exactly where you need to go next, not even allowing the player to have any kind of challenge. It might as well play for you.2) Repetative combo based combat. It presents some neat ideas, where you choose what effects your combos have but in the end all you do is punch people in the same way, again and again. Very little strategy or skill is asked for, and every fight you have will be the same as the last.The ONE redeeming aspect of the gameplay is Memory Remixing, in which you alter the memory of characters in order to bend them to your will. This is fun and presents something unique to call it's own. However these come up very infrequently and once again present little challenge. "

												There is so much to recommend this game, but in the end there's just too much wrong. The setting and main theme is farily excellent, the basics building blocks of combat are on the absolute edge of being innovative, and there are a few great plot points, but on the whole, the development and implementation of the game just fails. Also, the whole idea of ""remixing memories"" in the gameplay is really A+, but again, tremendous ideas, just no followthrough.Cutscenes are unskippable so when you fail, or you want to replay something, you're stuck watching the whole 30 second to 2 minute bit. The combat ""combos"" try to riff off of Batman, but in the end, while you can build your own benefits into each strike of the combo dynamically to fit your needs, you are just mashing the same (at max) 4 combinations of X and Y. Many of the smaller plot points are poorly explained or contain not-quite plot holes: they are ""not-quite"" holes, because while they don't contradict what you've heard before, they to now allow for you to follow easily with the plot without going ""Well, maybe she did that because...."" And not in a thought provoking way... in a lazy writing way.I'm not sure whether to recommend this game or not, because there are so many great things about the game and then so much that just lets you down, unfortunately. I feel like if the right talent had this IP, it would be tremendous; as it is, it's just mediocre. Which is why I feel compelled to write more than ""It just was awful.""			"

												Dull, linear, not worth much time. Although, it has excellent controller support. I figured this out because I hated the KB+M controls so much I just hooked up my controller, which makes the game MUCH more playable. The graphics are good, as they don't take away from the gameplay. My main concern is the combat system. I just hated it. But take that lightly as I hate most 3rd person games and how the controls/combat are set up. I can see why someone would like the game, but personally I don't find it too enjoyable. I'm glad I got it for free so I could fully test it without worries and get some trading cards.			"

												An utterly superb visual feast. The visual design, aestetic, characters and scenes are superb. Unfortuntly that's it. It's one good thing. Otherwise the gameplay is distinctly below par, starting with jarring slow dialogs, overly verbose tutorials to forced input scenes which slow down the flow of the game.The combat system is confusing and will take time. It's a departure from things like Devil May Cry, button-mash-fest, to a more rythmic setup where maintaing combos means being able to press buttons with good timing in the right order, whilst excessivly using the dodge button at the same time.The boss fights are long drawn out affairs which take a good 5 minutes or so to work out before you are even given any pointers. They all revolve around special abilities which must be recharged using combat, so be prepared to have to fight, dodge and generally run around wasting time waiting for your special abilities to recharge. After all that running around, you're finally greeted with a QTE, as if things weren't bad enough already! If you happen to fail the QTE you face another 2-3 minutes of running around waiting for the your special ability to recharge again to get another shot at the QTE.The story is okay and the setting good, but the visuals are the real winner here. I wouldn't spend any more than £5 on it as you'll be disapointed with the gameplay. If you can stand it for the visuals perhaps you'd stretch to £10, but it's just simply not worth more than that.

												Cleared the game in less than 10 hours in medium difficulty.I would call it a visual novel more than a game. If you enjoy a good short story, you might enjoy this game but I'd definetely NOT get it full price.There truly is hardly any challenge - you just have to find the right way by jumping around. Battles ARE fun but quite infrequent to my taste and the xp system is just bad.No fast forward through cut-scenes during 2nd playthrough made me quit attempting to get more than 56% of the achievements. If this wasn't an issue I wouldn't mind trying the hard mode... But cut-scenes are too long to bother to go through.They can do better than this.			"

												So, Remember Me, the most underrated game of 2013, what should I say, this game is AMAZING, i’m gonna point out all the features this game has below (I will but a TL:DR at the end of the review if you dont have enough time to read it):Pros: 1. Story: This game’s story is really well done unlike other games, it excells at bringing the         feeling that you are in the future. Without going too much into the story to spoil it, i’m gonna say that you are woman that forgets everything.      2. Combat: The Combat is well executed with an ability to customize your combos, this is maybe my least favourite part of this game, cause at the end I thought I wouldn’t even finish the story cause I didn’t wan’t to fight another bosses.      3. Presentation and Graphics: This game looks really great for a 2013 game, the optimization is really good.TL:DR This game is a really underrated title with great elements for every type of gamer. I think everyone who likes games should buy this.My rating 9/10.			"

												Neo-Paris. 2084. Personal memories can now be digitised, bought, sold and traded. The last remnants of privacy and intimacy have been swept away in what appears to be a logical progression of the explosive growth of social networks at the beginning of the 21st century. The citizens themselves have accepted this surveillance society in exchange for the comfort only smart technology can provide. This memory economy gives immense power over society to just a handful of people. Remember Me™ is a 3rd person action adventure where players take on the role of Nilin, a former elite memory hunter with the ability to break into people’s minds and steal or even alter their memories. The authorities, fearful of her knowledge and capabilities arrested Nilin and wiped her memory clean. After her escape from prison, Nilin sets out on a mission to recover her identity, helped by her last and only friend. This search for her past leads to her being hunted by the very people that created this surveillance society.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Remember Me is a game developed by DONTNOD Entertainment and published by Capcom. Remember Me was developed by the same people that created Life Is Strange and this game was the company's first game before venturing to Life Is StrangeThe story takes place in Neo-Paris and you play Nilin, a memory hunter who has her memory erased in the prison of La Bastille and becomes a new person altogether, however, a person known as Edge manages to move her through escaping La Bastille and into the slums of Paris. Throughout the nine episodes (named Episode 0 through Episode 8), Nilin will discover what happened to her before she entered La Bastille, her past and the big corporations taking care of Neo-ParisThe story is well written for the most part and some of the characters are likeable, however, the characters are not really well fleshed out as opposed to other DONTNOD games such as Life Is Strange. Most of the characters just appear and are never mentioned againThe graphics are stunning and makes Paris look believable as a futuristic city, together with drones, robots and artificial intelligence. However I did notice some poor texture work here and there and at some moments the game's framerate did dip around here and thereThe sound effects were okay however the music was really well done. It was almost as a mixture of both a blockbuster movie soundtrack and a glitchy futuristic world. The game managed to blend in these two types of genres together to make some enjoyable background musicThe game mixes both platforming with action. The platforming was okay but nothing to write home about. You jump around Parisian buildings and scaffoldings and try to solve some platform bits to carry on. The big emphasis was the combat and this was the weakest segment of the gameThe combat was really poor, clunky and awkward. The game emphasizes you using combos, each you do you can either perform an action strike, a health regeneration, and so on, however, with the brain dead A.I. and annoying, clunky, awkward combat system and the huge repition of enemies, it made the game's combat pretty boringAnother issues was the annoying camera. The camera was way too close to Nilin, so much so that whenever you wanted to see what was next to you or move the camera around especially in combat, it is extremely awkward and fixed too close to Nilin, also sometimes the game's camera would just freak out and go all over the placeOverall, Remember Me is a mixed bag. It has some interesting aspects such as the story, the graphics and the music but also has some flaws such as the awful combat mechanic and camera and the usage of poor texture work and dips in framerateHowever, if you like futuristic stories/settings or like Sci-Fi, then Remember Me is worth a shot! RECOMMENDED :)  "

												Had high expectations when I originally heard about this game, but it really does not live up to them at all. After a little over an hour of gameplay, the game hasn't shown any fun or intelligent design. It tends to be a pattern of:1) Wander around an area where there's not a lot to do other than progress forward. Sometimes you can find hidden stuff.2) Traverse obstacles (such as walls and things) by climbing in a very slow and boring manner by picking a direction and hitting ""A""3) Fight a small skirmish of bland enemies in a very obvious arena environment by using a couple buttons and pre-configured combo moves, eventually taking them down. The core combat loop feels awful to execute, and really ""dumb."" It's not really worth going into much detail about the ""pressen"" combo system. Managing the combos is very clunky and limiting.4) Repeat. Expect cut-scenes to be peppered in anywhere between these sections. There seems to be quite a lot of useless little snippets from time to time.I got to a spot where I could see the main feature of the game, memory remixing. It was essentially like a video I could rewind/forward through, and look for hot-spots. I could activate these spots, then allow the sequence to play out in a different way, based on what I altered. Altering the wrong things, or not enough things will cause an undesired outcome, causing you to fail and have to rewind and make changes again until you get it right. Seems like a good idea, but a bit tedious as you have to watch the same sequence over and over again. It's supposed to make you feel like a detective or something like that, but in reality it just ends up being trial and error.The game is visually not that great... the screenshots seem to make it look better than it does in motion. Texture quality leaves a bit to be desired, but is probably due to it being a console port. Animations are jerky and awkward. There doesn't seem to be much atmosphere in the environments that livens things up, but the environments seem moderately detailed--although nothing memorable or impressive (at least in the early stages of the game.) It seems to not run as smoothly as I'd expect, either... it runs fine, just seemed hitchy or laggy.Interesting premise, but poorly executed. It's pretty much ""on-rails"", and should have probably been a movie instead rather than a sloppy in-and-out of gameplay experience. If you were interested in the combat, you'd be better off with a game like DmC: Devil May Cry. The other elements of this game are done better in pretty much any other game. I don't really have the desire to play any more of this. Tons of great reviews on meta-critic, but they must have been paid-off or something... unless the story is simply that great or the gameplay changes half-way through the game.			"

												A game with an interesting story and cool setting massively let down by subpar combat, in particular atrocious bossfight with QTE (cancer on gaming).This game could have been awesome if the combat was actually well implemented as it stands it's just a button mash affair with standard enemies.

												This is NOT a game.  It is an interactive movie written for a console controller.  As such, it has extremely linear gameplay, and a very immersive story coupled with dramatic visuals.  This game has absolutely ZERO replay value, and as such its worth about $7.50.  If you detest consolitus the irritation this causes you (lack of: mouse cursor, accurate pointing, control of the camera, accurate movement) then it would be worth even less.			"

The hacking, it is the only bright spot in this game; it's actually quite inspired... the rest does so much wrong though, that it is REALLY not worth your time or money.Pass, pass ♥♥♥♥ing hard man.

												Another game that is almost amazing, and then falls flat on its face.The good:Graphics, sound, visual quality, voice acting, solid environmentCombat system is a good mix, feel original, plays well in theoryNice mix of combat, platformer, puzzler, without feeling too arbitraryThe bad:Absolutely horrible controls and camera issue.  It's from this vintage of game that seems to think that changing direction of controls constantly as the camera randomly snaps around to various static angles is a good idea.  Suddenly right is backwards, forward is right, back is left, and you're all what is going on.  That happens during the platformer parts.  Then during combat, the controls spin unevenly with the camera spin so you're randomly dodging in the wrong direction, which could be right into the thing you wanted to avoid.  It's all very frustrating and not just a little nauseating. Then there is navigating the menus.  You have no mouse pointer.  At all.  EVER.  So imagine mousing around a complex interface to pick powers to slot into combos as the selector jumps around and you move the mouse in vague directions hoping you get what you want highlighted.  I can't figure out what kind of sadist thought that was groundbreaking.And then you get to a point where you're clearly being prompted to do something entirely new, and there is no indication what you do to start doing it.  The game is just pretty much paused waiting for you to hit an unknown key that is in no way documented in the controls let alone prompted on screen (like everything else before and after this point).  I was about to force quit having hit every key used thus far in the game and a few others when I just mashed keyboard and randomly hit whatever it wanted to continue.  Next thing I know I'm swirling the mouse in little circles to rewind mental video.  Again, cool concept, but terrible controls.The concept desigers and artists get an A.  The person who designed the controls should never work in gaming again.			"

												This game is all about memories, and people who can buy and sell memories, the main character has lost most of their memories, hence the name remember me.  The games fighting is junk for a fighting game.  The game opens with a creepy old woman staring at you babbling about something like a crazy homeless person.  Let that crap imagry sink in because that is every cut scene,  what is worse is you cant skip any of the cutscenes.  Almost everytime you walk anywhere your greeted with an impossible to skip cutscene showing you the area you just walked into, just to torture the player even more the Devs decided to put many of these cut scenes in super slowmo.  I literally left the room went to the store and came back and one cut scene was still going on.  The colors in the game are very nice, many areas feel alive, however that mood is killed by having to sit through slow motion camera pans showing you all the things you would have enjoyed looking at on your own.  This game literally often made me want to vomit.  The camera is shaky, as in earthquake like Pompeii shaky, there is blinking lights, and its FOV is kinda close.  Avoid this if you have any motion sickness issues in games because this game takes the whole list of things people hates and combines them into one barf bag of a gaming experience.  That isnt just during cut scenes while playing when you punch the camera will shift and move all over the place, maybe the camera is scared at how horrible the game is.  There is screen tearing literally built into the game, as you get damaged or during combat this effect occurs.  This game does have platforming done right, while playing the jumps are similar to Assassins Creed.  The difference is in this game the jump mechanics of platforming are done very well, to the point where you wonder why this one game does right what the AC series has never gotten right, jumping.  The character design is awful, the main character looks like a chocolate bar with Cruella De'villes hair, she doesnt look human.  The other characters such as guards are just as bad, only their chin and mouth show, but EVERY guard in this world is the same race with the same goatee.  Since its only showing their chin and mouth, would it have been that much trouble to design some other mouths or people without goatees?  The game takes place in Neo-Paris, yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.... Put Neo in front of anything to give it that cyberpunk feel that is nowhere in this game. The story just makes no sense, at one point you defeat this boss guy to free peopls memories or something, then the next scene your making some guy kill his wife then he kills himself.  No reason is given for this random guy being tortured except maybe the main character is a jerk. The game is enjoyable to a degree but too easily forgettable, probably leaving most players wishing they could remove this memory from their head.      Rating:   4/10  Value:  $4.99			"

												Certainly one of those games that have been underrated for which reason whatsoever. In my opinion, it has an unique design, paired with great graphics, a strong atmosphere that comes from it's own future sci-fi setting mixed with a classical elements of a future Paris. The story, which is definitely a very strong point, starts slowly, but becomes then more and more mind-confusing and addictive. The main character, ""Niliin"" has just an awesome♥♥♥♥♥which makes this game the first one I would always prefer to play in third-person perspective. ;) The fighting in the game is much fun and very demanding on more difficult levels, but never unfair as you have to find the right strategy. Only negative point could be its length with around 10 to 11 hours the first playthrough. But personnally, I don't see this as so problematic, if the overall performance keeps me up on the game. For the reason that it also has an excellent 3D vision support for an even more immersive feeling throughout the game, I give it 7,5/10 and can definitely recommend it to everyone who likes classical Capcom action adventure with a strong story.

												I had hopes for this game based on the setting & story shown in the trailers, but it really failed to deliver for me.The combat is pretty boring (like a worse implementation of Assassin's Creed or Arkham Asylum) with a combo-editing system that I guess might be of interest to some - I just found it took me out of the game world and wasted my time without adding anything. The platforming mechanics are similarly dull, and aggravated by the awful camera and clunky controls. The lazy collectible-hunting aspect adds nothing and doesn't even really make sense (standard fare for collectibles).The game tries to make you empathise (I think?) with the first enemies you encounter, and then expects you to enjoy beating the hell out of them when you could probably choose to run away instead (if the game let you). There is no freedom in this game - it chooses when you run and when you fight. It constantly takes control of your camera, or your whole character. You either follow orange markers, button-mash enemies to death, or watch the game do things for you.The graphics are average, the level design is frustrating, the voice acting is bad and the writing is unconvincing. The setting and premise are interesting, but not enough to save a generally sucky game.			"

												Well, you had me for a while, there, Remember Me... until you turned into a game about mind♥♥♥♥♥♥(every time you see the censoring, just think ""Forcible, non-concentual violation of the mind or body""; if you're still oblivious the word starts with the letter R) .Look, I get that a lot of people won't get why this bothers me so much - or, indeed, why I even say it's about mind♥♥♥♥♥♥ but... here goes.It suffers a bit from obviously being designed for consoles and not weathering the shift to PC so well, but that's a thing I usually have no difficulty getting over - either I use a gamepad, or I adjust. No harm, not foul. The setting is interesting, the setup is cool, and the first ten minutes feel like you're in for a fantastic game... which you probably are, if you don't have the same hangups I do. I'm not apologizing for these hangups, mind you - just establishing that my take may not be yours, and very slight early game spoilers are coming.The game, as I said, starts out well. The controls are clearly optimized for a... well, controller, which is fine. I love my mouse and keyboard, but I do recognize that some games are just plain better with a gamepad, and this really is one of them. The combat is a bit strange - putting together your own combos is a really cool idea, but takes getting used to. The world you're in is beautiful, in a modern cyber-punky kind of way. The main character has amnesia (TRITE), but seems interesting, and the NPCs look... well, mostly like cardboard cutouts, to be honest (let's make this dude William Gibson Archetype A, and this chick can be William Gibson Archetype B...), but they're perfectly servicable for the story being told and the world you're in, so whatever.Then, after you reach a certain point, you come to what is the main special power of the protaginist: mind♥♥♥♥♥♥In order to defeat a foe, you go back and edit her memory so that her motives change. You literally (and I literally mean the literal definition of literal, here) dig into her memories of the most painful event of her life, and then re-write them to suit your own motives.No. No, just no. This one act drove the protagonist - and all her allies, who are working, aparently, for the freedom to do this to people - over the Moral Event Horizon so far that it's not even in the rearview mirror anymore. Basically, you have the power to hack a person's soul, and bend them completely to your will. You alter them by altering their memories of the past in what might be the most vile violation I've ever seen. I know it's a story, I know it's fiction - but the actions of the protagonist made me feel like I was a party to♥♥♥♥♥♥ mind-control, brainwashing, and slavery. Making this all the more unspeakable is that the main character's amnesia was caused by this exact same violation, and she's aware of it. So, basically, it reads like this:Hey, I got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I guess that makes it okay to♥♥♥♥♥♥other people!Screw off, Remember Me. Just because your protagonist is female doesn't mean you aren't contributing to♥♥♥♥♥♥culture and woman-hating. Your main character is a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Get out of my face.Now, you might be tempted to think ""Oh, geat, another SJW... it's just a GAME"". Fine, you can have that opinion, but in my mind this game isn't all that far removed from those white supremacist games that glorified the holocost - it just has prettier graphics.End of rant.ADDENDUMTo everyone who finds this review unhelpful/different from their experience, I appreciate you reading it and providing that small amount of feedback. It helps me hone my reviewing skills, which is awesome and incredibly helpful.Begin second rantTo everyone who thinks this review is funny? ♥♥♥♥ OFF.

												This has got to be some of the worst games I've played recently.The story may or may not be good, haven't really gotten far into the game, because they gameplay is HORRIBLE.Outside of combat it's boring corridor-levels with some climbing alongside marked paths (not kidding) and the combat, well, let me put it like this: I find it unbelievable that anyone could copy the Arkham style combat and screw it up SO badly.First of all, no counter function. Combos get interrupted by dodging and apparently can't be continued on another enemy either. So if you wanna do a combo, better hope you get it done on ONE enemy, before any of his friends attack you and you have to dodge or attack them. Also, they're hitting you pretty much instantaneously, while your character feels kinda slow compared to them.This is not fun. Also the memory-change minigame is a neat idea, but the execution feels very poor and more of a chore than fun.Again, this game might have a decent story, though as far as I've played it's pretty much a very generic dystopia without anything really interesting going for it, but the fact that the gameplay is this bad, just makes me not care, because it doesn't interest me enough to work through this chore (that's what it feels like, not a game, a chore), to discover more of it.I literally can't believe how you can basically copy Arkham's freeflow combo-system and remove everything that made it so fluid and ""freeflow"". Very poor game design. Shadow of Mordor has shown how you copy Arkham's style right, while still bringing your own flavour into it. This game fails hard at it.			"

												The atmosphere is brilliant, the dialogue is reasaonably well acted. I'd really like to be able to play this game.Sadly the game is indecently linear and the controls are woeful. Character progression is fundamentally linear aswell.What gives the final 0/10 from me is that I got as far as the Second Episode on the easiest play level and frankly it was too hard - too many people attacking me, and the frustration of not being able to perform any kind of reasoned combat strategy other than mashing the keys meant I started hating the game and its programmers.It was a real disappointment.

												So much frustration from poor UI and very poor controls (I am using keyboard and mouse). The game is very pretty. There is no doubt that this game is a very graphically beautiful game and the storey/concept are good but thats about where the good finishes. Playing the game is like stabbing yourself in the knee over and over again, it’s painful. The hitboxes in the game are shamelessly implemented. Hitting a bad guy feels like your hits have weight behind them so thats good but the enemy can hit you when you are 1.5 - 3 meters away (5 - 10 foot). This does not happen all the time but when it does take place it sends me into a rage! I dodge out of the way only to be hit while I am safely out of harms way. Then there is the camera. 3rd person but there is no way to change how far away the over the shoulder camera is and I felt like I was fighting with the camera 50% of the time. To be honest I felt ill/sick and had eye strain the first time I played the game due to this poor camera implementation. I play a lot of games and I play 1st and 3rd person games and only one other game has caused me to feel ill like this in the past. So lets talk about the tutorials… I hear you say “no!”, Oh I say but we must. One part of the game (to be honest a few parts of the game) gives you a tutorial just before you have to battle against many bad guys, so if you die… you get the tutorial again. But what makes these tutorials so mind bendingly annoying is that you wait 2 - 3 seconds to press the spacebar and read another list of instructions and for no good reason wait another 2 -3 seconds to press spacebar to read more instructions to the wait again another 2 -3 seconds to read the final list of instructions only to end up dying to the bad guys… Then you get feed a list of instructions and you have to wait for no good reason 2 - 3 seconds to press spacebar and this nightmare goes on until you kill the bad guys. Moving on. There have been many times while “climbing around” that the controls take on a life of their very own, where up is back, up is behind you then up is down? WT!R? And it’s not a one off, this happens almost all the time. WHY? So basically play the game if you don’t find frustration is something that happens to you easily. It’s mostly a good game but I would not recommend getting it because when it comes to it, the game should be fun but in the end it’s just a bucket of frustration that been cast into a bin of poor implementation thats been coated with some pretty colours.3/5			"

												This is a neat game with a cool female protagonistuntil you try to play it, and discover that it is a heap of garbage that I hate.I played it in offline mode and steam apparently doesn't track those hours.In this game, the nefarious Unskippable Cutscenes has teamed up with its devious ally, Terrible Checkpoint Timing, in a plot to make any challenging part of the game completely infuriating, and make re-playing any section as boring as is imaginable.Players will follow protagonist Nilin as she tries to act kind of like the Major from Ghost in the Shell, while also listening to voice clips from a Character Portrait Guy (named after one of the members of U2) that seems to know instantaneously about everything you do or see. With his expository guidance, you fight back against the Evil Corporation that can control memories but inexplicably still has PR problems.You'll also encounter interesting characters like Unrefined Combat System, Uninteresting Customization, and It's Hard To Tell Which Enemy You Are Targeting... but can you really trust them?!?Embark on a narrow, unbranching journey through a relatively typical dystopian future, from slums and sewers full of mutated people shouting angry nonsense to indicate that they are insane, to rooftops and verandas populated by horizontal bars for you to climb across, and into apartments and offices of people who monologue about themselves a lot to indicate that they are corrupt.The plot might have some more unique twists later on... I don't know, I didn't finish it because there is too much terrible game between the beginning and the end of the story.			"

												Remember Me is actually quite a good game and a prime example of why you shouldn't listen to critics or pretty much other people - including me. The graphics are quite impressive, on PC, even though if you examine each thing in the game individually the textures don't appear to detailed or high resolution, and there are plenty of beautiful scenes and vistas in the game. Combat is accomplished with a ""customizable"" combo system in which you can replace certain pre-determined buttons with various different types of attacks which increase your power, restore  your health, decrease your ""Special"" cooldown time, and others. Ultimately the combat is not too complex and usually consists of very simplistic patterns like X Y Y X Y Y, or X X X, but it proves fun regardless when combined with later abilities gained and new enemy types to which you must adapt.The story isn't exactly ""new"", as it builds upon concepts floating around the science fiction world and even Hollywood for decades. You are tasked with correcting the ""wrongs"" of a Paris, neo-Paris, in which Dumbledores pensieve has become commercial technology for every citizen to use - leading to memory junkies, and all sorts of weird ""digital"" modifications as well as multiple oddly labelled ""memoriel"" concepts which Capcom seems to have made up. Remember Me's platforming isn't remotely as challengng as some harder platformers, but really it's a lie to say that any 3D platforming game is difficult. That's one of the only things I remember people complaining about, that the platforming was pretty much on rails and the camera always told you where to go (during platforming) with it's focus. Regardless, the game is some good fun without putting forth much effort. On top of that, the graphics in many parts of the game are surprisingly brilliant for a low-key console game - and, it gives me hope that if Capcom actually got their act together, they could use many of the lighting effects and creepy environments in Remember Me as a good example of how to fix some of the atmospheric problems of Resident Evil.Really the only thing I do not like in this game is the memory remix system. The controls are just unintuitive for PC because they were meant for a controller. Even playing with a controller, they are still bad. If not for that, the memory remix sections would be quite cool and they actually give some depth to Nilin and the Errorists overall, making you see that even though they are the protagonists, they are kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥- getting people killed indirectly or bending people to their will. The themes in this game are very old school scifi and oddly enough, they have not been explored much at all by modern media. It's all very Phillip K.♥♥♥♥♥♥""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sleep?""-esque and the only things I can think of that have given this any exposure have been Inception and Total Recall, and a fantastic Stargate SG-1 episode titled ""Collateral Damage.""Overall, Remember Me is a pretty decent game, though it is often held back by infuriatingly inept movement controls and hand-held platforming, and quite possibly one of the worst combat cameras in the history of video games.

												I was waiting to try this game for a long time and for me I am glad I bought it cheap and am enjoying it quite a bit. I love games where you can follow a story like a movie. The combat takes getting use to but it should be doable by most. Playing with a keyboard is awkward since the menus seem to be designed for a controller. I don't care for boss fights in any game so I don't have much to say except I wish they were not there. The game overall for me is entertaining therefore it meets my gaming needs. I am not critical or overly picky outside the genres I like. Sci-fi futuristic is my thing as well as RPGs and some FPS games with a story. My personal rating is either play it or not. I would say it is worth buying and playing. Enjoy the adventure.			"

												Remember me is a very interesting and clever idea in the Sci-fi genre. The basic concept is that in the future people can exchange and share memories easily and the developers have clearly given a lot of thought as to what side effects that may entail. The protagonist Nilin follows the tired trope of amnesia, however considering the subject matter it fits well and allows her to better show her grey morality. The combat is quite in-depth and there are a lot of customisation options.The aesthetics of the game are the biggest selling point for me though, the combination of old-style Parisian architecture and futuristic technology is perfect.The memory remixing sections are clever and better show off that Nilin is hardly the flawless hero, as well as how much memories can affect your entire personality.The combat though, despite it's depth, can drag on for a while with even regular enemies taking quite a while to defeat. The memory remixing sections are also difficult to control using mouse and keyboard and can get frustrating. They are important parts of the story but can derail the story pace.It's worth buying. Probably not at full price but not by much less. It'll probably be better with a controller too8.5/10			"

												This game is a Sci-Fi/Cyber Punk fan's dream coupled with a brilliant soundtrack. The combat features a Pressen system which transforms standard button mashing into something more tactically sound and results in useful effects on Nilin. The world of Neo-Paris is fascinating and the lore is rich but not overwhelming. This is one of the few times a game I enjoy can be action-packed, mature, but not gory and over-the-top. You won't regret this one.			"

												A great mix of beat'em'up and jump'n'run. The story is good, the fighting is fun and it is really cool to manipulate memories.The game kinda felt a bit like good ol' ""ONI"" which I played on my PS2. They are still very different from each other, but similar.Remember Me is very linear. There is not much to explore. I am ok with it to play a game where you don't always choose your own path but play the story like an interactive grafic novel. Why shouldn't games tell stories as linear as books do?			"

												This game plays good. The combat is solid, and while the moves are limited, I never got tired of scrambling the opponent's brains when they were stunned. Basically, positioning matters nothing in combat, as with a single press of the spacebar/a button (depending on keyboard vs controller) you dodge all incoming attacks and get a brief invulnerability to new ones (long enough to dodge again, if needed. Repeat. Boss fights are so far, hit or miss. I enjoyed the first two, while the third has an irritating quick time event that you must beat, in order to kill the boss. Fail? Boss gets some HP back, and you try again. After over an hour of tries, I have failed consistently on the ""Mash the A button quickly"" portion of this quick time event, and normally have no other problems with ""button mashing contests"". So, overall, a decent game, but don't come into it expecting to use the cool 'rewind through people's memories and then alter them' mechanic that is so flauted in the reviews. I have two days of play into it, and have seen that admittedly fun mechanic once, and that was within the first hour of play. TL;DR? Repetetive, dodge-based combat still manages to feel fun. Enemies are moderately varied, and robots provide nice breaks from 'Memory scramble kills everything' fights. Quick time events out the wazoo (Read: Every Boss Fight Ending) and the best part of the game seems to happen when you tinker with memories and try things out, but the game never actually LETS YOU DO THAT.7/10. I don't regret the purchase, but it's also nowhere near what I was expecting.			"

												The main thing Remember Me excels at is the universe and background it creates. I found the futuristic world and the entire concept of remixing memories to be the highlight of the game. The backdrops are gorgeous and the character models are designed and animated extremely well. I actually walked through the various environments so I could take in the details instead of just running through.The game itself, unfortunately, is too short, in my opinion. In addition, it’s extremely linear, with arrows pointing out the pathways and an “Aug-Eye” mechanic that points the camera to the next goal. With the level of detail placed into the world, I would’ve like to explore and interact with it much more. NPCs not part of the storyline are two-dimensional having only a few lines of text that are repeated over and over, every time whenever the player gets close to them.The fighting engine is somewhat fluid, but I felt it could have been polished much more. The customizable combos are a good idea, but very limited in their execution. They’re already predetermined with the number of hits and each slot already has a certain type of attack installed. You can’t fully customize a combo to consist of nothing but kicks or just punches, just the different animation of the preselected attack. I also felt the longer combos weren’t very effective as the large amounts of dodging done during fights causes them to be interrupted. Also, dodging is something you’ll find yourself doing a lot during battle as enemies gang up on you. You can continue combos after a dodge by pressing the next button in the sequence, but the amount of dodging and the number of enemies makes it difficult. Also, the battles are definitely designed for open areas. The few fights in close quarters are made even more difficult with the camera zooming in too close when you get close to a wall.The memory remixes, while an interesting concept, turned out to be pretty tedious. I found myself rewinding and fast forwarding quite a bit to get to the various triggers, and then adjusting the memory back and forward the small bit required to land on those triggers.I also felt the collectibles that gave more background to the environment were unnecessary as they didn’t attribute to the growth of your stats. I’d have liked it better if the developers just added an “Encyclopedia” entry into the menu for those who wanted to learn more about the world.Even with the downsides, Remember Me is definitely something I recommend, if only to walk through a very detailed environment. It’s a decent entry into Capcom’s library and something I’d love to see expanded upon with a sequel or two and the return of Nilin. It’s short and linear, but there’s definitely a lot of material that can be built upon.			"

												This is a great example of an incredible game that came out a year too soon. A brilliant concept coupled with an ambitious story and unique gameplay mechanics can only go so far once you realize it's bogged down by a terrible PC port, repetetive combat and QTEs with obscure icons. It's really too bad that such a great game hobbled itself, and something that could have been something truly special is rushed out, making it just a bit better than mediocre.It's a good game, but it could have been much, much better.

												This game is awesome!The combat style is great, you can build several combos all by yourself and use them in fights. The music is absolutely amazing! Love the soundtrack. The music in combat differs based on your style, so the better you fight, the better music you get. It really drives you in the game.The story itself is great (but sad). The main character (Nilin) is perfect, I loved her the whole story.The only bad thing about this game is it's linearity, you have very little possibility to explore the locations...But it's really a great game which I would recommend to play. For me it's 9/10 (-1 point for the linearity).			"

												Good story, interesting game mechanics and decent combat. But frustrating collectables and use of quick-time events.The storyline is involved and while the supporting cast is a bit 2 dimensional, the main character is well developed. The amesiac rediscovering their past is a bit cliched in terms of story telling, but works well in a game that all about memories and the manipulation of them. Delving in to people's memories and messing with them is handled by an innovative game mechanic that's well suited to the task (but will detract from the experience if I explain it here). Combat only involves 2 buttons, but the customisable combo system keeps it from getting stale.The main frustration-inducing element in this game is the collectables. Frequently going down the wrong path when hunting for collectable locks the player out of the previous zone and prevents them from going back to collect. Quick-time events are also used in the boss fights, which is disappointing, but thankfully they're restricted to these times and don't pop up during any cinematics.Remember Me is a game well worth playing. Its story more than makes up for its few flaws.			"

												This title is a simple bash 'em up with some interesting tricks to keep the player involved. The artistic use of graphical and audible distortion and glitches throughout the music and graphics is excellent, and one of the biggest strong points of the game. The combat system includes many different enemies, customisable move combos and strategies; however the repetitiveness of each encounter wears down its charm over the course of the game. An interesting mechanic that appears periodically throughout the story line is the ability to alter memories in a cinematic problem solving scenario; these present the games most impactful narrative events, contrasting to the rest of the games slightly ridiculous story line. The unique art style and ideas in Remember Me are worth checking out.			"

												Remember Me is a solid game with some good ideas hidden behind a bunch of minor flaws and technical issues that add up to some fairly big nuisances. There's enough good - and enough room for more story - that I'd like a sequel. I'd love to see its ideas more fully explored, as well as to unlock the potential of the interesting but flawed combo system. Also, it's pretty nice to see a game with a mixed race female protagonist who is intelligent, uniquely and highly skilled, non-sexualized, and very well written. More Nilin please.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2014/06/remember-me.html "

Graphics are very good; design is excellent; above all, the story, the writing and the setting are awesome and fascinating. It definitely would have deserved better critics at launch. The negative points I've read back then are absolutely valid: it's rather short and linear. That's true, but so what? Not every game has to be open-world, nor to be about competitive multiplayer. If you can enjoy a game that has a story to tell above all, go with it. (that said, if you're a completionist, there definitely is some replayability, with gorgeous unlockables and collectibles throughout the levels) "

												I enjoyed this game a lot, though a few things did bother me. The controls seemed more made for gamepads than kb+m, like having to spin the mouse around to fast forward and rewind, and the qte prompts could have either the actual key to press rather than an icon or different colors for the different icons; I failed most of the qte events several times just because i couldn't tell what key I  was supposed to press in time. Also I feel like the memory remixes could have been done a few more times throughout the game, it's made out to be an extremely rare talent but you only use it four times.  That being said, the story was excellent, the art perfectly captures a cyberpunk Paris, and the gameplay is a good mix of platforming and fighting.			"

												The concept of this game is excellent, I can't argue with it and that's what moved me to buy it in the first place. The execution does leave a little to be desired however.As the blurb says this game is all about memories - taking them, remixing them and generally causing havoc. It is (to the best of  my knowledge) a very unique and entertaining.I'm going to be a lot more verbose about the things I didn't like, but keep in mind that these did not stop me from playing the game right through to the end.There are aspects to the game which are not made very clear to the user, particularly regarding the combat system, frequently I had to look things up on the web in order to do certian things, defeat the first boss, activate different combo chains, and so on. Once you understand how things work then it's not too difficult, but they jump right in quickly with symbols for dodge, use, punch and kick, and it isn't obvious what they want you to do if you don't recognise the symbols.They say the game is a lot about exploration, and that is partly true - there are things hidden throughout the game world that you should try to find, but quite frequently you may find you missed a particular instance and can't go back to have another crack at finding it.The game world feels very linear, you only generally have one path to follow, and if you arrive in a large open area you can bet that a fight is about to start. Where there IS more than one path to follow, you will quite quickly find that you can't go back and check the alternate route if you just happened to guess the one that advances you forward.There are times when you get into a fight with enemies where the objective is simply to wipe them out, there are other times where minor enemies will continue to spawn indefinitely until you take out the big fish. The distinction between these instances is made only by the fact that after 5 or 10 minutes you haven't actually made much progress in wiping your opponents out.In spite of the issues I've enumerated above, I still recommend this game, just keep these points in mind as you play through.

												There have been much better on-rails action games (e.g. the Uncharted series), but the world, story, graphics, and atmosphere all make this worth recommending if it's on sale. Score: 7/10.Positives:+ The graphics are great and the world of Neo-Paris is beautifully realized.+ An interesting storyline that kept me engaged for the 12 hour runtime.+ Good sound design and music. The way the music reacts to your fights is a nice feature.+ Combat is imperfect but largely satisfying and the boss battles are all really cool and well-staged.+ Memory remixing (Inception-like changing of people’s memories) is an original and well-implemented gameplay mechanic, but a little underused.+ Frequent save points and a dynamic and immersive HUD that only shows when useful.Negatives:- Extremely linear and on rails, to the extent that there are glowing markers telling you which ledge to grab or pipe to climb; this is a very closed-off world with nothing to explore or interact with.- Although the story is good, the dialogue and voice acting are both underwhelming.- The controls during climbing/platforming are a little fidgety.- The camera is passable, but I’ve seen much better in other games.- Some unnecessary shortcuts were made, such as having the TV screens showing still images instead of videos.

												First and foremost. DO NOT PLAY WITH K+M! This game has one of the worst PC controls  I've ever seen. There is a significant difference between gameplay with k+m and gamepad. I wish I had one on my first PT...Yet, even horrible PC controls and my lack of loving for melee combats and brawlers did not stop me from beating and enjoying it.It has so many good things you never expect to see in this genre. Astonishing detailed  world, good story, interesting characters, quotes from French classics, stylish art, fashion and fitting music. Things that are more fitting  some 'big' TPS\action\rpg.Combat itself is decent, but combo timing is not really intuitive (especially if one plays with keyboard+mouse). Bosses require tactics, couple of them are really tiresome, especially, if you don't know the proper QTE order. PC icons are much less clear and readable than their console siblings, they are harder to notice in many cases.  Still, with all its flaws, I think it's a good game worth playing. It's unlike many other games.			"

												Swear I've played this game for longer than an hour O.o. Anyway this was the last game I brought in the 2013 christmas sale, and I was a tad skeptical at first after seeing mixed reviews. I didn't start playing it however until last month. It takes a little while to get your head round the controls and storyline, but it gives a hint of freshness in an industry which seems to be becoming more and more repetitive. 3/5			"

												There are very few games with storylines that really capture the imagination - for me this was one of them.To start with the review's which state the combat system is hard to understand are baseless - it is fairly easy to get a grasp of how the unusual combo system works. I was a bit disappointed at the linear way the levels run - you spend a great deal of time climbing around but with only one direction to take HOWEVER in the end the story compensated for all of this by making me want to come back and play it more. The puzzles were interesting though if you actually take time - just a few seconds to think about them, they are pretty easy to figure out - I didn't need a guide to work out the pass codes they were fairly easy as long as you think just as literally as you think laterally. As everyone else has already stated time and time again, the soundtrack was great and a strenght when setting the mood for the story. On top of that it is coloured by unique characters and plots twists and because of this the game for its length does a very good job and getting you invested in the main character and her journey. For me, I enjoyed Remember Me and if a sequel ever does appear (doubtful) I would be happy to play that too. "

												I loved remember me's art cyberpunk artstyle and the puzzle element in the remixes and the remembranes. I just wish that they made the game longer and made the game less linear and more choice based. Basically, if you took this game and mixed it with deus ex human revolution, it would be amazing. I legit felt like a genius after some of the riddles in it. The only problem with this game was that I didn't feel much satisfaction from beating the game since it was extremely linear and I thought it needed more remixes.			"

												A game with very well done aesthetics and atmosphere, decent storytelling, and a pretty solid soundtrack. On sale, it's worth the investment. My only gripes with this game are that it holds your hand way too much and that the combat is a little stale. You will often get hints on how to fight properly. I don't take off too much credit because of that, because it's still a good game. Hacking memories and changing them is actually a really cool feature even though most of it is scripted. Some cool ideas lay within the game, and it's worth looking into.			"

												A beautiful game. The concept is unique and the story telling makes you want to continue playing. The combat system is implemented well and does have unique elements to it. There are different types of attacks that do different  actions. For instance, you have attacks, when connceted, heal you. You have attacks that will decrease your cooldown for special attacks and so on. The combat is very smooth. A good parallel would be the combat from the Batman Arkham games but with more customization. The graphics are beautiful and really rich in atmosphere. I really had no complaints with them. Speaking of atmosphere, there are little things, such as retractng shop signs when you get close to them and little packs you can collect to learn more about the history that really enhance the game.Audio is amazing. Voice acting is done well and you can really feel the emotions in the characters.I read people had issues with the controls. I played with the XBOX 360 controller and had no issues. I don't know how the controls are on the keyboard, but I've heard that people have played it with mouse and keyboard without issues. Try both options if you can.The storyline is what kept me playing through this game. There were just so many questions that needed to be answered and the game does wrap it up nicely in the end. The whole concept of memory management is amazing and implemented nicely in memory remixes, where you alter the memory of an individual. I don't want to ruin anything by saying more but the whole concept is flat out amazing and different.Buy this game. It borrows elements from other games but also implements its own to provide an amazing package. We need more unique games like this and it all begins when you support them. Truly worth playing from every angle.P.S: It took me ~11 hours to complete the game but there is reason to go back, such as finding all the 'culture' packs and other collectibles.			"

												Amazing game. The music, art, animation, story, combat, just everything was spot on. If you like dystopian cyberpunk settings than this is right up your ally. Only complaint I actually hace is the camera tweaking out every once in a gret while, but nothing game breaking. I don't think it is worth its original price ($60), but I'm happy catching it  for $25. Hell, I would have been fine paying $40. Remember Me is very story driven, which makes its levels fairly linear. Its not meant to be an open world type game. Between combat there is a bit of climbing around and collectible hunting. Just enough to give you a breather before you get thrown back to the dogs. Using the combo system is dceptivly simple. Setting up the combos is a matter of matching up a punch to a punch slot and a kick in a kick slot. Thats all good and well, but now you need to consider what types you want for each combo. Do you want your longer combo string to be for heavy damage, healing, cdr, or some mix? Each attack also has an animation that matters in terms of simple jabs ranging up to sweep kicks and slow but strong uppercuts. Planning your combos does matter and even need to be adapated on the fly based on the enemy. At the end of the day, its an amazing game with a story that swings from dark revelations, to regretable resolution, back into the pits of dispair on a moment's notice. All while hinting at a brighter future and giving the player/character hope. If you want a fun fighter with a story to go with it, this is the game.			"

												Remember Me features a very intelligent sci-fi / cyberpunk storyline that is far above average. The game takes place in a amazingly good looking and immersive future mega city environment and is designed in a very linear way that is tightly integrated into its style of storytelling.The combat system, which is quite similar to the Batman Arkham titles, sadly suffers from a bad automatic camera control which sometimes just fails to show you what is relevant. As I played the game with an Xbox 360 gamepad connected to my PC it wasn't so hard to readjust the camera and after a bit of training, the combat system felt not as bad as my first impression had been. Combat still is the weak point of the game and I guess controlling it with keyboard and mouse could not be a good idea.The memory remixing scenes were a quite interesting feature which I never saw before in a game. I also heared some people complain about the game being too short or too easy. In my oppinion this is at least not true for the hard mode and if you don't just ignore the nice environments.All in all this game is a real hidden gem. It is surely not perfect, but I recommend it to everyone who is able to play with a gamepad. The game is especially interesting for fans of the rare cyberpunk genre.			"

												A narritive-driven, cyberpunk, action-adventure game with some of 2013's stongest fiction, writing, art design and music.4/5.The combat in Remember Me is reminiscent of Rocksteady's Arhkam series, but with a heavy focus on customising the output of combos (damage vs. healing vs. cooldown vs. chaining) depending on your playstyle and the attacking enemy-types (of which there are many). The other main gameplay element is Uncharted/Tomb Raider-esque platforming. For the most part, this is quite linear, but enjoyable; however Nilin's rigid movements may lead to one or two mis-jumps during some of the high-intensity sequences.While many people have criticised the controls, I personally found playing the game with a 360 Gamepad enjoyable 95% of the time; with my main issues being the 'lock-on' feature in some of the busier combat situations not behavining in a predictable manner, the very small margin for error when it comes to evading attacks mid-combo, and the aforementioned rigid nature of Nilin's movement - she lacks the momentum often found in well-polished AAA third-person titles.One of my favourite aspects of Remember Me are the Remix sequences in which you are required to alter the way a character remembers a pivotal event in their life; think 'Inception', but achived by manipulating the way they recall something happening, thus altering their perspective on the world, other people, or themselves. These sequences aren't frequent (there are four in total), but definitely a highlight.Smaller gameplay elements incorporated‎ into the exploration sections of the title include simplistic puzzling sequences, security drone evasion, and finding collectibles that provide either permanent power-ups to Nilin, or fleshed-out backstory on various characters, locations, technologies and history.Remember Me is my 'Sleeper-Hit' of 2013, no thanks to the critics who convinced me to push it towards the bottom of my gaming priorities. I eagerly await Dontnod's next title.First-time, Hard difficulty, semi-thorough playthrough: 13 hours.			"

												I had fun overall with this game. Definitely needed more remixing. I bought this game after the trailer highlighted the remixing and it was the best part about the game. I loved doing it and it should have been a bigger part of the game. The story was good as well as the parkour, remixing, puzzle solving, and graphics. It was hard to memorize the combos, I would have bought a fighting game if I wanted to do that. Also, the finishing moves showed icons sometimes that you had no clue what they were as far as jump or the action key, you had to then redo a minute or two of the fight to get to that point. I would recommend this game but would love to see a game like this with more remixing.			"

												Remember Me is a beautiful, unique and intriguing game. I had been very excited ever since it was announced, and even more excited when I got it. The game is simple, straightforward and entertaining. The graphics are beautiful and the setting is breathtaking and unique. The story is quite good as well, I'd say above average and quite interesting. The character's are well written and captivating. The only thing that I'd say isn't too good is the combat - it's a bit iffy, it's about percision and timing and some battles can feel a little long/tedious. Perhaps the combat is better suited for a controller. Another thing I didn't like was the save system - it works with checkpoints/savepoints and I feel like they sometimes aren't in the right place. However, I feel that everything else makes up for those two cons. Best part of the game - Memory Remixes. The single most original gameplay idea I have ever seen. I was absolutely blown away and think that it's an amazing addition to the game. Shame though that you only get to do it a handful of times.Highly recommened!			"

												Decent game let down by awkward dialogue and repetitive gameplay.The basic story is you're a woman named Nilin. You've lost your memory in a world that can alter memory. So you go and kick♥♥♥♥♥without really knowing why.The gameplay is actually quite solid. Think a less polished batman fighting system. The combo idea is good, but the fights get a bit dull towards the end, with the constant kickkickkickpunchpunchpunchpunchkick. This is what most of the game ends up being.It's unfortunate, because one of the best parts of Remember Me are these bits called memory remixes. They are where you watch a memory, then go back and alter it. Sounds simple, but it's executed very well. Thoroughly enjoyed every remix. Shame there's only about 4...The story is interesting, but I felt it wasn't executed as well as it could have been. Some conversations with your bro Edge either feel awkward, or unfinished. For example, Edge will say something that warrants an answer, but Nilin will just ignore him...this resulted in a lack of interest in the characters and I didn't feel anything for them.Graphics and artistic design are really good. The french vibe, the little electronic tags that hover over things, these are nice little touches.The music was pretty cool, especially the whole glitchy sound that occurs when your health gets low enough. Nice orchestral, nuff said.So overall, I reckon its definitely worth a look at, but it falters here and there.			"

												This game is absolutely, incredibly beautiful. It is therefore a crying shame that the design is complete garbage. THe story is passable, with its typical beaten to death fight-the-power plot, and its stupid parkour climbing that everybody has seen a thousand times, but the voice acting is great. The environments are STUNNING. The models, the color, everything art is just superb and inmersive and is like a sci-fi movie at every unique, colorful moment. It will do an amazing job of conterbalancing the horrible tedium of the gameplay. In the french tradition of studios like Ubisoft, this game holds your hand from the beginning and doesn't let go EVER. You are like a child being led through places that you just want to explore and interact with, but the game strictly forces you to follow its linear, obvious path, pointing out every little move that you have to make with little indicators. You are not trusted to draw even the most trivial of conclusions on your own, and the fluid and exciting (although also obvious, throwaway easy and repetitive) combat is interrupted most inconveniently by the game forcing you to pause, and go to a menu to equip and try this new move or another that it just gave you, even though the strategy for every attack and every enemy is pretty much the same. To sum up, the game has breathtaking visuals and an engrossing story, and has absolutely nothing to offer in the gameplay department. It just guides you through like a tourist excursion, never letting you or asking you to think or try anything, but only executing its commands in a timely fasihon. Still worth going through, even if only for the cinematic experience, the merits of which are hard to overstate.			"

There are only 4 or 5 different combos. While combat is not the only part of the game, the lack of variation makes getting through the combat sequences quite tiresome. The boss encounters were, if anything, less difficult than the trash mobs.Verdict: 6/10Certainly not the most fun game I've played, ""Remember Me"" is still worth taking a look at for its beautiful environments and interesting story. The combat becomes stale, but the game had enough charm to keep me interested and play to the end. If you see it on sale, pick it up! I saw a few things about Capcom working on a sequel, I will definitely pick that up if it gets made.			"

												Surprisingly good game.I don't know what I expected...  I'd heard of the title, but not really looked into it much.  But it was on sale, and the video looked good, so I gave it a try.  And I was amazed.The gameplay consists primarily of well-paced platforming.  Lots of scrambling across ledges and jumping across gaps...  But it's not normally so hurried that you can't stop to take a look around.  And exploration is rewarded.The exploration and platforming is punctuated by some terrific combat.  Lots of one-versus-many battles.  The ability to customize your own combos leads to some interesting experimentation.  And some of the enemies require unique approaches.What really makes this game, however, is the storytelling.Nilin, Edge, Scylla, Charles, and the city of Neo-Paris are all vibrantly alive.  Living, breathing, feeling creations easily on-par with anything Hollywood has turned out in the last couple of years.  Imperfect characters with believable motivations occupying a world that's being torn-apart by its addiction to voluntary amnesia.I was genuinely surprised by this game.  One of the better titles I've played in the last few years. "

												7/10Ok, let's face it. Remember me is another corridor game with a not very challenging combat system, and little exploration. But there's something special in it.The lore is so rich they could have done more than just 1 game. The story is quite good, sometimes predictible, and long enough. This is a story-driven game so there are no side quests. Personally I didn't missed them too much, maybe because occasionally its good to focus on the main thing and forget about ""please go buy me some bread while you save the world"" quests, if you know what I mean. The main character is not another voluptuous girl, she have a strong personality and her thoughts directs you well throughout the story. In my opinion she is one of the best female characters ever made in videogames.Music and sound effects are really good. Tandem of music, graphics and combats forms an enjoyable and fun experience, even if fights are way too easy. The possibility of playing a NewGame+ (which is a must in this kind of games) is another point on its favor. Combat is somewhat like Batman's Arkham series, mixed with a combo system that adds some extra fun to fights.			"

												This game is a pleasant adventure through a distopian future.There are some original concepts in gameplay, an interesting story and the combo system is really cool.The camera angles are a slightly awkward at times - but this does not hinder gameplay. I would have also like the game to allow a little more freedom in climbing and adventuring. As it is story-driven it is linear.A definite recommended buy.			"

												Remember Me was not very well received and the reviews were mediocre. To each their own, but I thought the game was very enjoyable. It looks great – it’s really cool to see the familiar Paris landmarks in a futuristic setting. It reminded me a little bit of how Earth is portrayed in The Fifth Element. I appreciated the story because it was something different from the norm. The specifics were kept a mystery for much of the game and you didn’t always know if you were working for the right side, so it kept me intrigued.The combat is fun, and quite similar to the Arkham series with basic melee attacks, combos, dodging (instead of countering) and a couple ranged abilities to take advantage of. However, unlike the Arkham games, I never felt like the fights were excessively long and hand cramping. Every so often you get access to a new special ability which kept a sense of progression throughout the game. You can also create your own combos which gave combat a surprising amount of depth. You can add attacks that regenerated health or reduced the cooldowns on special abilities, allowing you to tailor combat to your enemies or your personal preferences. Aside from combat there is also a lot of fun, though not particularly challenging, platforming. All of the action is very fluid and slick-looking.The one part of the game I have the most issues with is the memory remixes. Though this was a very innovative idea, I don’t think they are executed all that well. It is interesting to watch them, and see how a small alteration could result in a vastly different outcome, but they aren’t that fun to play. The controls are irritating and the solutions were pretty much a guessing game. However, there were only four of these sequences in the game so they didn’t detract too much.Overall I’d definitely recommend the game. Nilin is a great main character with lovely voice acting, and the story will keep you entertained. Some of the dialogue occasionally veers into melodrama, but I found those instances rather fun and campy. I really recommend playing with a controller rather than mouse & keyboard, the controls are 100x better. "

												Don't get to caught up into seeing this as ""the game where you get to HACK people's brains! To death"". As fun as memory remixing is it doesn't make a majority or even a decent chunk of gameplay. Typical game combat ranges from a beat-em-up where you customize the best combos to cheeze your way through to brick wall boss fights where you'll die a dozen times until you figure out the one routine that the game will let you use to pass them. Though as rare as the memory remixing sections, the puzzles the game gives (of both visual and linguistiv nature) are admittedly fun asides - if too easy (unless you're completely culturally ignorant).If I'll be honest the game really shines in the audio and art design. Cyberpunk avec une touche française, I've never seen a cyberpunk themed game look so beautiful (sorry Deux Ex HR). And this is demonstrated everywhere, from the architecture and environments, to the fashion and character design. As cheesy and cliched as the countless baddies are, their visuals are well assembled. Setting this all against a magically ambient score only heightens the beauty of the game.The plot can get a little too meandering. I'll admit I loved the dynamic between Nilin and her parent(s) as well as the ending twist, but you better bet I'd have liked it a lot more if I hadn't wanted the game to end four 'episodes' beforehand. As an aside the game is beautifully cinematic if played with French as the preferred language (given the Parisian development team) as the French voice actors give some emotion lacking in the default version.Overall an underrated classic that's beautifully rendered but definitely may not be everyone's cup of tea given the gameplay.

												If you are like me and prefer story-oriented games over complex gameplay, this game is for you. The story is interesting and the graphics are pretty good. If you combine those elements with a cyberpunk theme and a linear progression, you will enjoy your time while you explore Neo-Paris and steal memories from people.			"

												While certainly not the most technically impressive game, Remember Me has a pretty aesthetic to offer along with a story that gives you something ot think about. The controls are a little janky and the tutorial for maneuvering the combo lab could be better, but the combat is satisfying and no more deep than it needs to be to serve the story. Some side characters are woefully underused and the their voice acting is hit or miss at times. The score is fantastic and suits the game very well. Give it a shot.			"

												Duration: ~9 hoursReplay value: I'm not going to, anywayVerdict: pick it up on sale if you want a simple, story-driven gameA nice little game that integrates its cental story conceits into gameplay. Fighting is incredibly simple, with a linear, highly directed story.Where this game shines is in the world-building, a nice distopian future, with a french theme. The characters are relatively dynamic, despite most villains being introduced in the same episode they're defeated, and some characters with potential for interesting interaction are very lightly represented overall.Where this game fails is in its story. The presentation of the story is ambitious, with focus on characters and a few key reveals. The problem is, in a game where a central conceit is the ability to rewrite, delete, and alter memories, the main character is never deceived, and reality is never in question. Story-wise this idea is used in a way any form of powerful science or magic could be used; creates monsters, has an exploit one bad guy can use to rule the world. It also gives an explanation for the tired trope of an amnesiac main character (which is doubly unnecessary in a video game, as the same sense can be accomplished with a silent protagonist ala zelda or half-life) but the revealed past, as these things come, is incredibly low-impact.Overall the game leads you to an overwhelming question: where did all the guns go, and why has nobody shot me yet?

												I'm really glad I played Remember Me.  The game has some flaws, mainly with the combat which never quite manages to be as fun as it should.  However, the presentation is top notch.  Incrediable aesthetics throughout and one of the most amazing sound tracks I've ever heard, games or otherwise.  The story, while a bit messy at times to be properly engaging, is original and interesting and keeps you guessing about the direction they're going with it.Despite the flaws, I would take a Remember Me any day of the week over a better playing but more mundane game.  I'm glad this title made it to market, and I'm hoping that it eventually does well enough for the developer to live on and get even better.			"

												""Remember me"" is a great game. The fighting is solid and I enjoyed the Sensen system after I took the time to understand it. Do not expect ""open"" levels or alternative routes/approaches, progressing through the levels is linear and a straight-forward experience but I don't consider this as a problem. Gameplay variety is not to be found here, but better focusing on action than lukewarm and mandatory stealth elements. Where the game really shines - and is kind of outstanding -  is the art and level design (the look) and how the game presents its story - the cool  setting Neo-Paris is a plus also. The memory manipulation is a nice and fresh addition, even when the implementation is very simple.The playtime is reasonable (according to steam my playthrough took 17hours).The game has some similarities to the Batman series (game type) and Deus Ex (only in terms of the techno setting). There are only two smaller issues I had while playing: The extreme screen distortion effects (here the ""art factor"" got a bit out of hand), the first time I saw them I assumed my graphic card is damaged. Secondly, the game would benefit if ""fighting"" is not the only available option to progress.			"

												Overall a very abitious game that doesn't quite reach the goal that it set for itself. The story balances out to be okayish, with some interesting ideas presented, but some more important and glaring ones left out. Gameplay is what you would expect from an action game (Batman AA/AC), but tries to change things up with the promising combo lab to allow custom combos to be made. Sadly, this didn't change up a whole lot, as I just button mashed through most encounters. Platforming just requires pressing the jump button. However, the real star of the game is the setting of Neo Paris, which looks stunning if you have a graphics card good enough. Music is also excellent. Although the game is a bit short (about 10 hours for me), I would say that Remember Me deserves at least a quick look at, but don't pay more than $30.			"

												Great art both in fidelity and style help set this games grim dystopian cyberpunk mood for this good platform jumper, puzzle solving brawler. Platform jumping is more akin to the Prince of Persia and Tomb Raider games than it is to Assassin's Creed, meaning things are more fickle, less forgiving and not at all open-world. Comber is pretty much completely melee and flows much like the recent Batman games, but with a rather nice combo customization system to give it some spice. The games memory hacking elements end up being used only in a rather small number of cases, with the game focusing more on the stealing of memories to aid in security by-passing intrusion. Most of the character's special powers end up being much more like uber-hacking of things like doors and other machinery to add puzzles for the platform jumping aspects and as special combat powers that become nearly necessary to be victorious in various battles along the way.Mouse support is not very good, so access to a gamepad controller is advised, and since there is no gunplay to worry about, no loss of aiming will be noticed.As I had read that the English voice actors were not as good as the French, I played through with French audio and English subtitles and felt the experience to have been rather good.

												I have no idea how Metacritic gave this game a 66. It is absolutely incredible. Mix one part bioware intense storyline, with one part mirror's edge parkour, stir in some intense combat scenes and you have Remember me. From the moment the game begins you're immersed into a world of incredible 3D models and beautifully detailed environments. The storyline is fascinating, along with the core concept of the game - Memory HuntingIn this futuristic world everything is controlled by a person's memories; which have been digitized through something called a Sensen chip. One company, Memorize, has the monopoly on digital memories. You play as Nilin, a former ""Memory Hunter"" who has the special ability to ""remix memories"" - you can rewind through a person's memories and utilize ""glitches"" to change the memory and manipulate the person (How they think about you, how they feel, their alliances etc.etc). Somehow you've lost your memories and all you have is a mysterious voice named Edge and a few friends/fans willing to help you.The gameplay is fairly simple, if you've played games like Mirror's Edge you'll catch on quickly on how to move throughout the environment. The gameplay is very linear, however, leaving you little room/time to explore the environments -which is disappointing for those who want to experience the art as well as those who like treasure hunting. The biggest downside to the game is that combat controls, while interesting, are not well explained. There will be a period of trial and error while you figure out how to win fights, all the while they'll be throwing new abilities at you. This game is a ton of fun and definitely worth picking up.

												Remember Me is not a game without flaws. There's no doubt about that, but it really shines in some areas as well. The setting is spectacular, the game looks beautiful, and the story is very intriguing, but the game will not let you skip the cutscenes. This really kills the replay value of the game esle I would probably have a lot more hours dedicated to completing this game 100%.Another big bump in the road is just how simple and linear the platforming is. I don't know if I can even call it platforming. It is more or less 'Point the analog stick in this direction then press A' x amount of times until you come across the next cutscene or fight.This is where I fell in love with the game though. I cannot get enough of this combat system. I love the way you can edit your combos to do what you want them to do, you can have a damage combo, a health regen combo, or a special ability colldown combo, or even a mixture of them all. What I enjoy most about it though is how rewarding the dodge mechanic is. If you manage to dodge correctly and time it right you can consistently keep up your combo. This gives a very nice flow to the combat, and when you mess up, it feels like it is your fault and there is nothing else to blame but yourself. The music even picks up when you get into a rythm, and dies down when you get hit, messing everything up.Overall Remember Me is definitely a game worth playing. It provides a good story, enjoyable setting, and fantastic combat.			"

												this game is actually pretty short, about 8 hours in total. the game unfortunentally starts off really slow, and combat feels like a bad take on the batman archam series games combat. however as you progress you gain additional abilities and different types of attacks, as well as different combos which makes the combat much more defined and interesting. the story again starts off really slow, but keeps getting better to the point where ill actually say that i liked the story. this game made such a turnaround  that i can almost forgive its slow start. still im going to say this game is definentally worth playing despite everyone saying it was a metiocre game. I enjoyed this game, the story ended up pretty good, they distanced themselves from the batman esc combat eventually, and some of the puzzles were actually kinda nifty. i would give this game an 8 out of 10, subtracting points for its slow start, and occasional hard to target things issues.

												It's not often I fall in love with a game. Sure there are great games out there that are fun and a joy to play. But I mean, really fall in love with a game, that's a rare thing. Everything in this game I absolutely love!! The environment, the characters, the music, the combat, the story, the graphics, the detail. Anything you could find to nit-pick about a game, I love in Remember Me! That being said, it's really hard for me to nit-pick at anything. Sure, the linearity of the game can be scrutinized but that's only because this world is so gorgeous and inviting that I want to explore more! Or perhaps the repetitive combat? The combo lab can add so much more! Everything about this game screams that it needs a sequel. The chance to give you everything missing from this game. And that's what the reviews of this game gripe on, everything that's missing, instead of enjoying everything that's already in it and what it offers.That's the sad part. The mass of gamers will probably glance over this game based on it's review ratings. I encourage you to look past the ratings and to buy this game. It will introduce you to a world that you want to see more of and that you want to explore more in. Hopefully the success will warrant a sequel and we all can continue to enjoy this creative, original game.Remember you soon.			"

												Gameplay rating: 9/10Graphics rating: 9/10Soundtrack rating: 10/10Story rating: 9/10Overall rating: 9/10Length: The game provided me with just over 9 hours of fun which i think is reasonable considering that I have completed many games in less time and that i definately intend on replaying this game in a few of months or so.Gameplay:The gameplay is really fun, it has a standard adventure feel to it wit lots of free running & some awesome fight scenarios in each zone. You can adjust the combos that you use and change the effects they have so for example you could make it so that one hit reduces the cooldown of your abilities, heals you, deals a lot of damage or even amplifies the previous presen. Unfortunately the game doesn't have a counter system as such, you can dodge enemy strikes however by jumping in any direction including over your enemy. New enemies are introduced as you progress through the game some requiring you to actually think and use tactics such as employing abilities to deal with them. Graphics:The graphics are pretty amazing in my opinion, and they portray future paris perfectly. If your like me you will actually spend quite a while just enjoying the scenery around you and some of the incredible views of the city. Soundtrack:The soundtrack is incredible. Story rating: The story is very gripping so you will constantly want to know what happens next. Overall rating: There is not much at all that I can negatively say about this game. Although I will say that during the memory rewrite scenes it is very unclear if you are using a mouse and keyboard as it shows a picture of a mouse and an arrow going anticlockwise, however I know that me and many other people actually sat there for around 10 minutes trying to rotate my mouse due to this unclear picture when actually what it is supposed to mean is that you have to make circles anticlockwise with your mouse. Felt like a bit of an idiot after this lol  (at least you wont make the same mistake now). Anyways that pretty much sums up my review, cheers for reading :P "

												It is astounding that this game has been reviewed so poorly. Simply put, this game is fantastic. Neo-Paris as a location is excellently crafted and includes some fantastic looking scifi landscapes and locations. Story is great and action mostly satisfying. And even when the actual game takes place on Neo-Paris where most citizens live in a life of luxury and wellfare, most of the world is in complete chaos. Hunreds of millions people live in destituon and are suffering greatly, when few lucky ones are living in a nation that has survived the last war that ravaged the Earth. There are nice tidbits of information here and there if the player finds a time to look for them. Still, this game has it's issues: sometimes when you are climbing it feels like player interaction is at its minimum. On the other hand at least you are not getting any frustrating mis-jumps because the game failed to interped where the player wanted to jump. Also playable areas are very restricted and the game is VERY linear. I have no issues with linear games, in fact many of the best games ever are linear, but I cannot shake the feeling how awesome it would have been to be able to freely explore Neo-Paris. It just is so fantastic looking place that explorable open world would have been even better. Also, English voice acting is not very good. It is not bad either, but if you compare it to the French voice acting, the French one is far superior. That is why I wholeheartedly recommend that you play this game with the French voice overs and use subtitles.Rarely I get to see such an excellent scifi game that also has very unigue twist to it, memory manipulation. I cannot recommend this game enough. If you still wonder if the game is worth its asking price, then wait for a sale and grab it. You won't be dissappointed if you do not mind linear games. Also, play this on the hardest difficulty setting if you want to have challenging combat.			"

												When I play a game I want to like it, and there is plenty to like in Remember me. There are of wonderful elements to appreciate in this game from the amazing soundtrack, to the incredible visuals, to the fun and intriguing cyber punk story, and a unique take on a free flow melee combat system.The game is far from perfect of course. A few mechanics don't quite always work and it seemed like there were a few hit detection issues, sometimes enemies seemed to have an unfair reach, and at times they seemed to have a near precognitive ability to know right where I would dodge so that they were waiting to get another cheap hit in as soon as I landed. Some of the cheap shots and other issues seemed to be alleviated as you found the best rhythm in each fight. Quick combos to regain health then dodge dodge, quick cooldown combo and etc. The combo system, combined with your various special abilities, do give combat a very strategic feel and there is a nice array of enemy types to always test you. Overall it can be very rewarding when you manage to pull out a win against all odds, or bring your health back up from the brink of death, but on the flip side it can be terribly frustrating. Not often but in some of the bigger battles certainly.However, I would still highly recommend this game. I was surprised how much I liked the story and it certainly went certain places and explored certain themes I had not expected. This is a game and setting with so much potential. Sadly, I feel they didn't get to explore the full potential in this game. But then that's all the more reason to support original IPs like this. Its entertaining and it felt incredibly unique, which is often hard to do these days. So pick this one up and give it a try.			"

												I was pleasantly surprised. Good story, realistic voice acting and fun to play. For bugs, there're some, but nothing rly game breaking (sometimes there are issues with cam if you're turning the view around while standing near wall (""console port issues""), but othervise it's all right). Also the option to turn off the film grain would be nice, but it's a soft grain, so it's not so disruptive. The biggest issue i had was that i had to turn all my AA off (nvidia, via control panel) - with AA on any text in menu was invisible - this is the engine issue). But the game looks good even without it. Finished the game on medium in 9-10 hours (it's a bit linear, but i still missed some optional stuff), so the game length is average for this gender. So... 8/10 story (few surprises), 7/10 visual (AA and cam issue), voiceacting 7/10, game length 6/10, 9/10 sw (nice stability - 0 force closes, 0 errors, can be alt-tabbed without issues, etc; one sound bug where all sounds were muted, but simple alt-tab fixed that). So in overall it's for 7,5/10. Really nice game, recommending to anyone who likes games like assassin creed or mirrors edge.			"

												A fairly amazingly well polished game with some of the best combo-based combat I've ever seen. The unresponsiveness of the interface rather killed the platforming aspect but the key ""Memory remix"" sections are fabulous fun. The writing is excellent too, so good in fact that it's only after the game is finished and the thrill of engagement comes to a halt that you'll realise just how ridiculous the core plot point was. An excellent game perfectly executed.			"

												First of all - I must say this loud and clear, this game deserves to be played! You really should play it! Summary is below if you don't wish to read it all!I have to admit that I read so many bad reviews about this game that I was afraid I wasted my money on it (it was on a sale and I've always put my eyes on this one). When I heard the rumors about DONTNOD (this game's developer) being shut, I thought the game probably sucks.When I first played it, I was shocked by the negative reception of the game (60\100 on metascore? not that good) and later on I figured out what was wrong about this game.You can summarize what's wrong like this - this game could be, and promised to be, something big, different, innovative, even revolutionary- in terms of gameplay. It seems as if it even intended to do so, but didn't fully succeed.What makes this game look so interesting is the fact that you're being a memory hunter. Messing with people's memories is not a concept often explored in common video games. The one extraordinary feature which raise this game above many others is the memory remixing - you'll have to remix people's memories in order to change their views, thoughts and actions. Sounds amazing, isn't it? And indeed, the few times you'll be doing this in the game are rather cool and exciting, even though it felt like the mechanics of the remixes was a bit too simple, it still felt really good. But as I said, you'll only be doing this a couple of times. Four actually, throughout the entire game, which isn't totally satisfying and makes you want more of it.What else will you do that's related to memories? Well, you're gonna steal some, replay some, and kill some, but it's all done with a few buttons' clicks and not in a very interesting way. And what else will you do? Well, you'll kick your enemies' butts. And climb. And climb. And climb. You'll also jump a bit, but you're gonna climb a lot.Don't get me wrong, fighting and climbing in games can be rather satisfying. That's why many platform games gained so much respect within gaming community. But in Remember Me... it just isn't enough.The game is not very long, yet it might feel like you're playing forever, as the game gets more and more tedious in time when you feel like you fight horde after horde of enemies with cutscenes in between. The fighting isn't that interesting, and is generally easy, except for some parts in the game where it's not. But that's only because of the controls, which at first seemed fine to me, but somehow from the middle of the game and on I just felt like it all became too clunky and Nilin's movements didn't always have much to do with the buttons I pressed on the keyboard.The platforming is not that interesting as well. It only gets long and repetitive in time. The only thing that makes it good is the gorgeous graphics and surroundings which I'll speak of later, and the somewhat-artistic camera angles which change and flow smoothly. But still, as I said, it gets long and repetitive, especially when you don't have much freedom of choice about where to go, and not even the illusion of it. There's almost always only one single path to follow, you can never wander too much, and many times when you do the game would quickly suggest you the 'correct' path or action that has to be done. That makes the game even easier, and makes you feel like you just follow a trail of cutscenes\hordes of enemies at times.So, yeah, gameplay-wise, the game is not necessarily brilliant. But now let's talk about the good stuff, which far outweigh the somewhat primitive and at times disappointing gameplay.Remember Me is very much story-driven, its story happens in a futuristic Paris in 2084 if I'm not mistaken. It's purely a science fiction kind of story and yet it revolves around humanity and its mind, their memories and their urge to change or guard them. It isn't the deepest tale to be told but it has its insightful moments, and its a very personal and at times heart-touching.The cutscenes and dialogues which transfer the story are very well done, never too long and never too short, usually very interesting, and with very good and professional voice acting (Note: the game is fully dubbed in English, French, Italian, German, which is very cool, I've tried to watch some cutscenes in languages different than English and the acting sound good to me as well!).The graphics looked absolutely amazing, and without requiring a super-high-tech-machine (The game is rather new, from 2013, and my computer is from 2010, and even back then it didn't have the best specs possible. The game still worked very nicely on my machine on High graphic settings). The world of Neo-Paris seemed very wide and detailed, colorful and alive, with my only complaint about it is that the game won't let you explore the environment much - as I said earlier, it's very linear and many obstacles would make you walk in a specific one way instead of exploring the world around you which seems so interesting and eye-catching.The soundtrack of the game is beautiful, combining symphonic and electronic tracks together (trust me, it's good!) which integrate brilliantly with the game and battle sequences.The collectibles are nice, not too hard to find usually, but gives you some interesting information to read about the people\surroundings around you.There's also some extra content - 3d models of the characters, achievements and concept arts which are a very nice addition to the game!So here's a summary--Seems like every problem in this story is solved with violence-Not too long-Gets tedious-Somewhat banal platforming\fighting, and gameplay in general-Memory-related stuff in gameplay aren't fully developed-Controls are somewhat clunky+Amazing storyline, personal and heart-touching towards the end!+Gorgeous graphics, surrounding, details and environment!+Memory remixes!+Brilliant soundtrack!+Good voice acting, in multiple languages!+Cool collectibles and extra contentAll in all, the game was a great experience for me, which I'd definitely come back one day to replay again			"

												Remember Me is a game that has a really nice story, but is sadly plagued with poor combat gameplay that doesn't compliment it's storyline well.What I like:1)The story progresses well and concludes very nicely.2)The graphics are really nice and doesn't need an all powerful computer to get 60 fps (not constantly though).What I hated (about the gameplay):The beat-em-up combat gameplay the game tries to achieve is done poorly and half the time you might wish you didn't have to put up with it. In beat-em-up or hack-n-slash games, the game tends to try to make you feel good about destroying your enemies. However Remember Me fails to achieve that and can sometimes (if not most of the time) feel repetitive and uninspired to play . Boss fights in the game are tedious. Having long boss fights isn't bad but when it's hindered with the game's repetitive gameplay it's really annoying.The game also offers very limited combos. Sure, those 5 ""specials"" may make up for it, but when they're in cooldown mode you're going to be stuck spamming the X and Y buttons with 3 combos. I'm not even sure what the Combo Lab DLC added to the game :|*Not sure if it's my computer or not, but even though I can get 60 fps on the high settings, the fps drops every now and then. Optimization may not be too well with Radeon cards.Conclusion:I wish I could recommend this, but there was just too many times I wish I didn't had to play it for it's story. Does the story outweigh it's gameplay? I can't say for certain. The story developed nicely but as I've said over and over it's gameplay just feels too dull. The developers were probably trying to aim for something unique but sadly didn't get that part right (I even put the game on the easiest difficult to get it over with, and that's a rarity for me).If you want to get the game, you can get it on discount and see how you like it but if you have something else to spend your money on then go with your second option.Rating: 5.5/10			"

												I really really wish I could like this game. I was stoked about it when I first heard about it. The story is great. Unfortunately, the gameplay is absolutely god awful bordering on the verge of utterly demented. Not only the fights are extremely annoying and badly designed, you will constantly struggle with unresponsive controls and be reminded that you are in a videogame. It's completely anti-immersive. I could accept the highly linear gameplay in exchange for a good story, but I simply can't accept a gameplay with completely unresponsive controls that makes fights absolutely unbearable. I give it a 10/10 for story and a 1/10 for the gameplay.			"

												after finishing this game,  personally I really loved this game... ""Remember Me"" is kinda under rated by most reviewers... the game is unique and the story is what make this game special.. don't let the first impression fool you... some gamers even comparing this game is kinda like a rip off of batman arkham series, while its not the same genre at all... there are few features from ""Remember Me"" that make this game special... first, there are parts when you need to alter the memory of certain character, there are many fun ways on how you alter their memories... second, there are no health potion on this game, the only way you gain your health back is by using health combo on your attack... third, the strategy to beat your enemy is depend on how you prepare the balance of ""health, time, damage"" combination, wrong combination will lead you struggle to beat off some enemy.. forth, there are a lot of puzzle to be solved in this game, even on the boss mode!

												Lots of cool ideas in this game. Interesting story and good intertwinement between cut scenes and gameplay. The combat gameplay started out like it might be something different that would constantly build throughout the game but it felt short in that category. Still slightly fun to roll through the game beating up on enemies with combos, but it's the story and other elements that keeps it interested.			"

												A fairly simple example of it genre, yes, but Remember Me is a rarity on the PC, as most adventure games of its type are console-only.  It may have its flaws; some hackneyed dialog, plot holes, linear level designs, but as a whole Remember Me offers a competant play experience. The environments are gorgeous. Neo-Paris is incredibly detailed to the point of being cluttered. There's just so much to look at -- even someplace as sterile as a prison.  Sadly, the linear nature of the levels makes exploring limited. Character designs are just as beautiful though. 3D models unlock with achievements for you oogling pleasure. This high detail makes cutscene trasitions near seamless. Combat is easy to grasp; one button to dodge and a variation of two other buttons to combo attacks.  A simple leveling mechanic allows to later customize and extend combos, adding a little strategy and depth.The most unique feature of Remember Me is the memory remixes -- changing a person's (victim's?) memory of a specific event to manipulate them. Remixes themselves are basically cutscenes which can be edited to change little details in the person's memory which compound into completely changing the outcome of the event.  This leads to the person's outlook or personality to completly change. Remixes also add some experimentation and replayability to the game, as there can be multiple outcomes in these manipulations. (only the 'right' way will progress the story though)Overall I recommend Remember Me. Its short length (about 8 hours) benefits the pacing of the game, as no chapter (level) feels slow or trodding, nor do the linear levels and combat feel too shallow.			"

Engaging story and setting (I'd love for them to keep expanding this world), fun and great-looking combat, and some innovative gameplay especially around the underused memory remixing challenges. My only complaint is that the world is very constrained, with only very minimal rewards or even opportunities to stray off the main path, but as long as you go into it aware that the level design is very linear, it's fine.

												Remember Me is set in a visually stunning, dystopian future.  You are Nillin and you seem to have forgotten a few things. Together you will go on a journey to find what you have lost, figure out where it is you belong and who you are. I loved this game, despite it's flaws. The premise is fun and exciting, the characters are well cast and expertly designed, and the world itself is a joy to play in. I like the movement system, outside of combat.  I had fun jumping and climbing about, it had a quasi-parkour feel. As much as I liked the game, there is one huge, glaring problem, the combat system. At first, it's not bad, it has prompts to teach you how to fight, but those prompts get really annoying after just a couple combats.  The combat system was creative, but I just didn't like it. You earn different attack types as you progress, which you can mix and match between different combo moves, but you can only use each attack once, so for the first 1/3 of the game, you have 2 combos.  Combat consists of *alot* of dodging, which admittedly, actually works in this game unless you run into the scenary, you can flip over around almost any opponent and attack.  The end of boss fights gets a little dull, press kick here, press punch there, now press 'e'; bam, cutaway scene.  This game was probably meant for a console, or at least a controller, so perhaps that had something to do with my experience with the combat system. The single most frustrating part of the game was this tendency to glitch out at the end of boss battles; you kill everyone, but nothing happens and you have to reload the check point and do the whole combat over again.Now, to the important part, the story.  I loved the whole story, start to finish, it was captivating, exciting, confusing and a little heartbreaking at times, but they managed to bring most of the loose ends together and answer most of the questions you have throughout the game.  The world setting was exactly the sort of dystopian future I like and they make it easy to throw yourself into. Nillin is a great main character, I loved playing her and had an amazing time discovering her past right along with her.  She is a capable, kick-butt female protagonist, who does all the rescuing herself.  It was like a good book, I couldn't put it down.Even though I hate the combat system, and am not sure I will replay the game, because of the combat system, I still highly recommend buying it. If they put out another game in this world setting, I would definitely buy it, but hopefully they'll fix the combat system if they do.			"

												Great game for $30. One of those games that took a risk and did pretty well. The combat is fluid and responsive. The cusomizable combos are nice, although you do need to use certain combos to break enemies' guard stance, which kind of takes away from the customization a bit. This game is very much a linear experience, with very few options to go off the beaten path other than looking for a few secret areas here and there. The ""parkour"" is minimal and should not be thought of as a main reason to play this game. This same sentiment is duplicated in regards to the ""memory mixing"" as its not as previlant as an ability that the discription makes it out to be. Overall it's a solid 6.5/10.			"

But this sen-sen device also can turn people into leapers, which are memory-addicted people who have absorbed too much memories which makes their sen-sen degrade and makes them mutate into a subhuman form.

												Remember Me is a mixed bag. Great concept, beautiful visual style, but with mechanics that feel clumsy and hard to use. The gameplay leaves a lot to be desired, but the story is compelling and fun. All in all, not worth $50 but totally worth grabbing on a sale.			"

												Got this game from GreenManGaming for like $10 bucks. I love the style and art of the game. THe gameplay seems pretty solid overall. I play with a controller, so not sure how it will be with a keyboard but it works well with the xbox pad. Worth the price for sure.			"

												Just got the game and its amazing. The combat is similar to the batman games, but with a twist. You build your own combos and once you get the hang of timing its really fun. the only complaint I have is that the wall climbing needs a huge remake/adjustment. Other than than I really love the game.			"

												Game: Remember MePlatform: Windows, Playstation 3, Xbox 360Relese Date: 3 Jun 2013 Reviwe Date: 24 March 2014Overview 2/2Remember Me is set in Neo-Paris in the year 2084 and is centered around a product called Memorize which alows users to manage there memories Deleteing, Trading and fabrcating as they please. This level of messing with memories has twisted some people to the point they are bearly human any more. This has caused a civil war to break out between Sensen the creators of Memorize and the Errorists led by Edge. The Main character is Nilin an ex-memory hunter imprisoned and striped of her memories. The first moments of the game are of Nilin having her memories torn from her. The emotional rollercoster you go on after the pivotal first scene is fantastic, it will have you questioning if Nilin is on the right side or even if there is a right side. As the game progresses you will feel more attached to Nilin and will really care about what happens to her and what effect the actions she takes will have on her and the world around her. There is no leveling to speak of, you can find packs to increase Nilins health and her power meter but other than that you are just Nilin.The replay value is small once you have finished the game, you will fell quite satisfiyed with the story and the are no alternatives that will change the story in  any way. The only reason to go back through the game is if you are a collector and wish to find all of the collectables thus unlocking all of the 3D models. The game is fairly simple to navigate and the scuffels you get in along the way are just challenging enough that you feel a small sense of accomplishment once they are done. The Boss battels get increasingly difficult and as you would expect the final boss battle borders on the insane however it is doable.Interaction 1/2Interacting with the world aroud Nilin can be quite clumsy and often annoying, it has the same problem as a lot of older games in not knowing which way to jump and trouble locking on to the target you want. However, the tools in which you interact with the would are pretty awesome. There are four tools you gain most from Boss fights, the first is a small data blast that is used to open doors it also can stun some enemys for a bit. The second is just a larger version of the first, it is used to blast structrual weaknesses and can knock some enemys back. The third acts a bit like telekinesis in that it allows you to manipulate some objects and move them granted this is mainly used to move doors that have lost power but in essence its a cool power. The fourth and final tool Nilin gains is called a bit pick, it allows Nilin to take data from an open door and transfer it to a closed door thus chaning the states of both doors.Combat 1/2Nilin has five powers she can gain and they are well spaced out through the game, the first power she gets is not too long from the start in the first chapter and the last power you get is in the second to last chapter. The powers all have to do with messing with peoples Memoize implants and have a uniqe flair about them also two of the interation tools can be used as weapons, one fires a small data cluster at an enemy to stun them for a bit and the other is much the same but a larger version that can knock an enemy back.The hand to hand combat is very stiff and slow, this became annoying especially in boss fights as some times Nilin just couldn't move fast enough to dodge a blow otherwise the ability to customise my combos was pretty awesome.Graphics 1/2The graphics are pretty good how ever they did feel a little old, older than its relese date every thing feelt as if DONTNOD ran out of time or money and couldn't polish it up and put those last finishing touches on to make it look great and moden however it did not detract much from the over all experience. The world is beautiful from the dank sewers to the uper class area of Neo-Paris and it all fits together nicely and makes sense. Music 2/2The music is great, it fosters that technological futuristic vibe they are going for whilst not being overwelming. The music also assits in telling the story and portrays how Nilin feels and the journey she is going through.Total 7/10			"

												You thought ""Inception"" was a good movie?You found the story and fiction of ""Half Life 2"" thrilling as you fought against a totalitarian state in a futuristic setting?You loved the gorgeous looks of buildings and other historical architectures in the ""Assassines Creed"" game series?You like a challenge, but you don't want to torture yourself either because of tricky game controls or overly unfair fights?If you answered these 4 question with yes, then this game is totally for you, and it's very worth buying it.Let's give you my impressions in short:- Stunning scenes- extreme details everywhere; I couldn't find a single ""clinical dead"" or boring room, instead every area you visit show objects and little details that make the place, even in that futuristic setting, ""believable""!- very cool effects with water/rain, and light- totally enjoyable combat and effects-  great looking models and their animations realistically. Lol, even shoes of walking characters match properly with the ground, no ""smearing"", hovering..- intelligent storyline that can keep up its tension from the start to the very end- never any slacking in story or map design where one would assume the budget reached the limitAnd last but not least: An incredibly sexy looking character. ""Sweet Jesus!"", her hips swing most delectable!I for my part am a damn screenshot fanatic, and in all the games I played so far, I took quite a bunch, but this game broke my record and my frigging print button as well!Oh and I would like to mention one more thing about ""love to details"":I think I havent seen a game yet where your player character takes the single steps of any stairs properly!

												I'm not going to pretend it's the best game in the world. It has it share of flaws. But if I look at it as a whole, the experience is very much unforgettable. Got the game as a gift and I'm happy that I did. The graphics are powered by Unreal Engine 3 so no surprises there. They've utilized it with excellence as they made the Neo Paris an architectural treat. They also made Nilin very well. She looks cute and sexy and I especially loved how they made her hair and dress dynamic during movement. It feels so natural and realistic. Loved that. Movement is very fluid and when you start jumping around the city, it all feels natural and smooth. Combat system, while it might not be the most sophisticated, I found it interesting and the way how they utilized it within the game turned the game into a very different experience than we are used to most of the time (3rd person shooters everywhere). And Combo lab, while initially very confusing to understand, once I got the hang of it, it was actually a refreshing element in the game. You can design your own fight combos, combining damage, healing, power-up cooldown speedup and chaining of hits. They can be offensive, defensive, passive or a mix of them. Which brings me to many bosses throughout the game. They weren't particularly hard to beat, but they were enough of a challenge and apart from very first ones, they all required a bit of thinking as they don't go down just by hitting them hard. I also love it how they give you chance to re-start the boss takedown sequence if you missed the right keys. It's not an instant fail and repeating of the whole boss fight, you just have to restart a segment of it. It's challenging, but also forgiving at the same time, making it a boss fight that isn't a frustrating one, like in so many other games. Loved that and thumbs up to the dev team for doing it. And just like boss fights, entire game is filled with tiny puzzles and riddles to flex your brain a bit. And last, a story, while it might not win the Oscar, it was in a way quite emotional experience with the memory remixing segments in place and backed up with fantastic music that almost brought a tears in my eyes in certain moments...Remember Me, I will remember you. Forever.			"

												Warning: A few storyline spoilers are below.I just want to start out by saying, I think this games story was written by a 16 year old. This is not meant to be a knock on anyone, but that's just how I feel. A lot of the plot feels like some angsty teenager came up with this. It has a lot of bizarre elements that don't seem to mesh very well, and just smacks of someone trying out different things to a really weird result.And, okay, maybe it reminds me of the really weird s**t I came up with when I was 16.The main character; all of her dialouge seems to have been checked with a fine tooth comb. It is 'proper' and seems deep, like a main character should appear to some. It seems a bit forced, and she seems to be the only one that is really acting serious about whats going on.Whereas the side characters are all just... a bit light hearted. Or silly. And it just seems the writer(s) wanted to make them a drastic change from Nilin, but they ALL seem to be the same character to varying degrees. Silly, little less silly, silly with a hard edge... at least, the dialouge shows them in that light. ""Remember you soon!"" is a cringe worthy line thrown around often by a decent amount of the supporting characters and it's augggh NO. STOP IT.One later encounter has you being chased by a bumbling idiot flying a police chopper, and while he's gunning you down he is ""dramatically"" repurposing a fairy tale story to be about you. It's worse than it sounds, and I'm not sure why the writer thought that was a good idea.Is it different? Yes, but different isn't always good. It was just awkward to listen to.Remember Me feels like a squirrely version of Arkham Asylum. It's not a bad thing the game tried to ape AA's combat system, but they didn't flawlessly pull it off. It gets repetitive and seems to rely more on having you activate a ""Berserker"" mode to finally stop the game from spawning in more enemies in arena duels. And if you get boxed in a corner and try to move the camera, be prepared for it to freak out and spin you around and make you lose focus.When in combat, left mouse punches and right mouse will kick. Both of these start different combos, and you must switch between them depending on how you set up a combo. Yes, one neat twist is that you can unlock combo bars (3 hits is your default one, but you can unlock a 5-hit combo bar and a 7 hit one later) and then apply different attacks in to it.Do you want your long combo to heal you and cool down your special abilities while your short combo does the heavy damage? Just select from the Healing/Cooldown attack menus and slap all of them in your combo. Or mix 'em up, first two hits can damage, the second two can heal.It's a nice addition, and it makes sense with the 'amnesia' plotline that you would re-learn advanced fighting moves. Yeah.. it's one of those. But don't worry.. the main character isn't completely lost. She very quickly comes to her senses and finds out who she is, for the most part, and then the adventure is on to figure out WHY her memory was wiped.Now.. some of the plotline is bizarre. Nilin can remix memories; twisting the events of something to the point where it ends differently. This is an interesting concept, but it is used in baffling ways in-game. One character you come across, a bounty hunter, is out to capture you to help pay for her husbands treatments.You can remix her memories and play it out so that her husband dies in her memory. However, this makes no sense. In the game, it shows she only started tracking you down an hour or so before she appeared. This was also JUST as her original memory was coming to an end.So she now believes her husband is dead. But that's the ONLY thing that was changed; her memory of approaching the doctor was not. Nothing was changed except for him dying, which makes it such a baffling decision. The plot barely holds up, and for the most part you need to go in to it without thinking very hard about it.The whole design looks a bit silly. It's 2084-- but a lot sure has happened in the 70 years from here to then.Paris has become a slum, to the point where it looks like Future Detroit instead of a locale in France. In fact, the entire French culture is gone. The main characters-- all of the characters, really-- speak with what seems to be a very slight British accent, or French-Canadian accent.The culture sure has eroded, and fast. The only thing that makes you even think of Paris is that the Eiffel Tower shows up in the backdrop in a level or two. That's it. I'm not sure why they wanted to set this in Paris when NOTHING about Paris is relevant here. They would have been better off just creating an entirely new fictional city/country.I also recommend checking out the music. I REALLY like the track ""Still Human,"" while the fight track, ""Fragments"", is really energized and suited for combat in this weird neon-bathed ghetto world.This is also a linear game; it holds your hand pretty much through the whole thing, and the only time you really have to flex any sort of mental muscle in figuring out what to do is in a few weird moments where you must decipher a password from a police chiefs rambling.Ultimately, Remember Me is exactly what I hoped it would be: Weird. I hoped it would be different from the typical linear AAA game, and I'm glad it didn't disappoint. Even if, again, weird in this case isn't always good.The story is weird and oddly touching in certain moments, so long as you don't think too hard on some of the events; particularly on those involving memory remixing.The dialouge is weird, the enemy designs are weird, everything about this game is just WEIRD. I'm surprised it got made, but I'm so glad it did.It's memorable, but probably not for the reasons it wants to be.End Result: I honestly would say I wouldn't be mad if I bought this at full price. I liked it a lot, flaws and all.			"

												I was really hoping you were going to be amazing, like a secret little Beyond Good and Evil, Remember Me. But unlike BG&E you were unfortunately riddled with irritating and repetitive combat (ok, BG&E wasn't exactly a sea of variety), completely inane puzzles, a wonky camera, and the unfortunate fact that I felt like my character was either an idiot or a secret ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for the majority of the game. Which is too bad, because the very reason I compare you to BG&E is because you were a unique concept in a familiar scenario. A central female character fighting against a corrupt world.What makes it worse is the fact that despite all the irritation I still played it through. Because the story wasn't -that- bad. And the aggravating parts weren't -that- offputting. And it set a lot of good groundwork to capitalize on in a sequel if it ever happens. The promise of what you could have been, and the possible whiff of what you may become in a future entry, kept me around all the way through.But then again if no sequel comes along then I guess that makes me the secret ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for holding out hope. Which is another similarity with Beyond Good and Evil.			"

												This was much more than I expected. The controls with a gamepad are very solid and the game played well. The story was very interesting and the Visuals were awsesome. Cons: This is a combo system fighting game, which was well done, but later with so many enemies you cant finish a long combo. The game had no real glitches except the sound cut out once in a while. (i just minimized and reaopened and it worked again)I give this one a thumbs up for originality and stunning visuals.			"

												Thi game isn't my stlye/genre at all, I usually aim for FPS. Bu enjoying this game was no problem at all for me. Mostly is the genously writen storyline and the emotion behind it that gabbed me and held tight. owever, almost all of the rest of the game was very well developed; from the intricate and ever-changing combat, to the gorgeous artistic environments and characters. The only issue I had with the game as a whole were the moments where the camera felt extremely awkward and clunky during climbing sessions, sometimes leading to my death. The game is also very, very, linear, but that is to be expected with a beat 'em up style fighting game. Though, the beauty of the rest of the game easily overlooks the small errors. I recommend it to anyone who wants a challenge, and enjoys a good story. 8/10			"

												An interesting story in the futuristic setting of Neo-Paris. You are Nilin who has lost her memory and tries to regain it while fighting against Memorize Corporation, a company virtually in control of the whole society due to their brain implantats.Why I recommend this game:- The graphics are quite innovative: An interesting mix of a ""conventional"" Paris upgraded with high-tech appliances.- CYBERPUNK setting!- A classical single player game. I love that.- The story takes unexpected twists.- Innovative combo-system: You must adapt your tactics to win your combats.- The boss-fights are quite challenging.- There are (too few) situations where you must manipulate the memories of other persons. Quite interesting approach.It took me about 18 hours to finish the game. A fair value at its price!So, if you are into cyberpunk, futuristic settings and single player games, gives this game a chance!			"

												This game oozes style and is confident in its lore and environmental design. The story is very Philip K.♥♥♥♥♥♥ The technologies in the game explore the ramifications of artificial reality, memory modification, and how our memories shape our reality.The majority of the gameplay isn't bad, nor is it anything memorable nor annoying, but just a mechanic for engaging the player in the story and environment. Hacking someone's memory is the coolest thing to do in the game, I'll just say that.I love how it portrays memories, which I think it does a wonderful job visualizing.I think the success of this game suffers from the same thing games with premises hard to describe in one sentence. Psychonauts suffered from the same problem; it and this game are too non-mainstream to be massively profitable. Therefore, we probably won't see a sequel because this is, afterall, a game made by a large publisher who only measures sucess by the millions. I'm just glad a game like this actually got made.			"

												A short, straight-forward, and enjoyable game. Not worth $30 I'd say, but a must-grab for scifi fans (or anyone interested in the story), and people who enjoy strong female protags when it's on sale.What makes this game enjoyable is the story, and the thoughts of Nilin as you try to take down Memorize. This game tells a great story with interesting characters and twists, all the way to the end. Memory Remixes are a great addition to Remember Me, and it's real defining feature. There is really no choice of control in this game. It's very straight forward, with no real question of where to jump, climb, or run to. The only other downside of this game are a few of the boss battles, some of which becoming very tedious and drawn-out. Don't play this game for the challenge of taking down the bosses or fighting the leapers. Preferrably, you'll take the easiest setting, get through the maybe 30 battles in Remember Me, but most of all, just enjoy the story it tells you.			"

												'Remember Me' - Up-DownUP:- Fantastic Artwork & Style - Top Notch !!- Brilliant directing, felt like I was playing a movie.- Engrossing Story - You want to keep playing- Great Voice Acting - Some Familiar Voices can be Heard- Unreal Engine - Known 'Feel' and Gameplay- Stable (Only had one freeze through the whole game and that was Windows being... Windows)DOWN:- Very Linear - They try to hide it but it is quite linear.- Checkpoint Only Saves- Limited Replayability- Bad Camera Tracking During Fights- Unreal Engine - Some innovation and new 'ways' of doing things but not a lot, it can get repetitive.Verdict - It's a good game but could be a little better. If you like story driven single player games like I do then look into it.  There's not a lot of replay in it but it's one I'll play again I'm sure.  I can't say enough about the artwork and style, I bought the game during the Capcom weekend sale and the art alone was worth what I paid for it.  I recommend the game to buy when on sale.7/10			"

												You're looking at my recommendation and you're trying hard to square it with the metascore you see for the game. In all honesty, I have no idea why the score is so low. The cutscenes can't be skipped (and get annoying when you die right after one because the save is always right before it...), the combat can be unforgiving and yet somehow tedious at the same time, and I never fell in love with the camera. The jumping is enough like Mirror's Edge that I missed being able to play it like Mirror's Edge and never really comes into its own. And maybe every other amazing part of this game is taken from some other amazing game that I have never played.None of that matters.What matters is that this game is amazing. Breathtaking. I can't remember the last time a game grabbed hold of me like this and *made me play it.* Considering I just spent a paragraph complaining about most of the gameplay elements, I think that's saying something.I rate this game an unqualified ""Must Play,"" regardless of your preferred genre.

I put it off for so long that I forgot about it. Then I finally decided to make use of my PC and get a Steam account to buy games. Never in my wildest dreams would I think that I'd be able to get the 80% off deal this weekend! Just in time! So I thought 'What the hell!' and bought it. And let me just say that: IT'S AMAZING. Being able to play a game recommended by one of my fav YouTuber's is great :) I loved watching Cry play it and I enjoy playing it myself now. The game is amazing, the storyline is amazing, the gameplay is amazing, the character's are amazing, etc. I basically had to force myself to stop playing it after 3 hours so that I wouldn't finish it too early! :D Overall: It was an awesome buy :)			"

												Usually for games that have as many flaws as this game dones, I would NOT recommend it...however, this is a game that shows a group of developers likely to make a future banger. The game is slightly mis-guided and tries to become a game that it just isn't (really bad action/fighting), when it should have become more of a mixed adventure game (Heavy Rain with some platform for good measure). The atmosphere is superb. The art direction is tasty & there are some really refreshing elements throughout the game.

Took 13 hours too finish and that's without all the collectables, the game is very short which is disappointing but I loved the story. The fighting was a little tricky for me, with combos that just didn't feel right on a mouse. I think I'd have an easier time using a controller.

												I really enjoyed this game. It was visually stunning, had an amazing story/plot, and a great female protagonist. That being said the actual gameplay wasent great it could have been but it wasent. Besides altering peoples memmories which was mind blowing and extremely detailed the rest of the game was quite tedious. Long often cutscenes, repetitive annoying leaper encounters of constant button mashing, drawn out boss battles that became a quicktime nightmare, a confusing combo menu, and a hard to traverse world were all things that made me want to stop playing out of fustration. If this game had stuck to what it was great at instead of trying to do everything it could easily be a favorite of mine and have alot more replayability.			"

												Glad I've played it.Pros:* Beautiful Graphics.* Get to Modify Peoples Memories (sub-game).* Interesting Take on a Combat System.* Nice Story. Bit cliché, but still better than most games.* Lots of production value.Cons:* Purely Linear Gameplay (total rail).* No Mouse Control in UI (console experience; cheap port). "

												Tomb Raider + Cyber Punk + Total Recall + FF Spirits within = Remember MeStory : 9/10 :I felt the story was good and enjoyable perhaps a bit linear as they didnt intend for this to be an aventure but more of an action game. It's a one , play once time story; but none the less a good story. Protagonist: 9/10:I personally Liked Nilin's personality she is a strong, confident woman and sometimes shows fear but unfortunatly keeps it quickly bottled up though...  It's hard to know more considering that her memory is wiped in the begining. I expected her to have a differnt reaction meeing her father though. He had a more expected reaction than she did. One thing I liked, is she knows she can fight and isn't afraid to show it.Voice Acting: 10/10I felt this was well done and engaging. Cost : 10/10 I feel that this was worth the experience and time put in.Music: 7.5/10 Music is good but it seems to get cool the dive off . I tend to hit hard here and be very critical. It wasn't til almost the end that I felt it became epic.Combat System : 7/10 : I felt they had something here but I realized that there is technically only 5 ways to activate a combo and I only used 4 of them as the 5th one was too hard to get off as enimies would swamp you in that time. When I realized that I probably wouldnt use the strongest and last combo, I just kept to the same patterns that worked .  Also I felt croud control to be the most challenging thing about the fights. they're a few guys that you have to think about how you kill but over all its more about crowd control more than anything and sometimes that feels like all enemies move together like a flock of geese.Boss Fights: 9.5/10Boss fights are awesome! I mean I enjoyed them a lot! I didn't like the quick time events to finish them off but I really liked the fight.Other thoughts:Memory remixing was probably one of the coolest things in this game! I enjoyed it a lot. others complained that there wern't enough . I felt it was just right.  I in the end didnt want to remix any memories cause it meant screwing with people and the last one you do ,  I really wanted to talk things through, rather than screw somebody over.you can beat this game on skill alone, which is cool.Puzzles were pretty neat too . Creative.Cons:Some times I felt like I wanted to explore as the world is very pretty but this isn't that type of game.I wish they had a bit more epic of music, like it was in the end; Still good though.The last fight I expected it to be awesome (It was ok) like the fight in the prison.. MAN that prison fight was EPIC!!!!!I expected to see enemies with guns and it seems like they out lawed guns or something. Felt weird, to be honest.Over all I would give this an 8/10. It's a good experience and worth ones time. "

												Great setting. Great story. Terrific art direction. Good acting. Stunning scenery.Game mechanics are a bit boring. Too bad bucause the combat system and the memory-mixing have so much potential. The climbing puzzles and riddles are nothing compared to Tomb Raider. The rest is just pressing buttons for no reason. Luckily it is not bad or annoying and -as you can see- there is a lot of variation to keep you busy.In the end you should play this game for the story and artwork. You won't be disappointed.			"

												Recommended, IF the game is on super duper Steam Sale.I liked the story.  I liked most of the combat mechanics.  I liked the memory remixing mechanics.  But, somehow, it feels like I would have liked the prequel to the game better than the game.  That is, I would have liked to play as a memory hunter (and done a lot more memory remixing/theft) than as a fugitive (drowning in quicktime events).If you like a good story, you'll love this.  If you like interesting new concepts, wait for an unlikely prequel.			"

												Remember Me is a game set in the near future, where memories can be bought and sold. You play as Nilin, a memory hunter who's lost her own memory and is fighting to get it back. The game is a mix of platforming and puzzle solving, martial arts fighting and remixing memories. Platforming is straightforward and the puzzle solving is fun and engaging. The fights are great fun, especially the boss fights. Aside from the part it plays in the main plot, Nilin also slowly regains her memory by re-learning martial arts moves and special abilities called Pressens. Nilin can chain martial arts moves up in a combo to create mega damage. The best part of Remember Me is Nilin's ability to remix memories. Crucial characters must be persuaded to think in certain ways, and often their paradigm is based on a defining moment in their life. The player can go into that memory and change certain aspects of it (dropping a bottle, opening a bag) such that it pans out in a different way, causing the victim to change their line of thinking. This is beautifully implemented and incredibly thought provoking.The art style of the game is imaginative, with elegant historical architecture vying with slum-style industrial environments. The music is atmospheric and suitable. I also think the plot is excellent, with some very impressive characters. The graphics are UT3 and hence definitely not leading the pack, but they have some great textures in some parts and run on the PC the game plays smoothly. There are some problems with the camera angle though (a bit like the earlier Assassin's Creed games) where if Nilin is backed up against a corner, it's difficult to see any of the opponents.All in all, Remember Me is an innovative game with some very enjoyable fights and impressive game mechanics. Highly recommended.			"

												So far, so good.Some framerate issues, but im sure it would iron itself out if i installed on my SSD.Lots of Environment climbing, ala Assassins Creed; but not free form. There are only sections that can be climbed, but for some reason this game focuses on the traversal almost as much as the fighting. Fights are pretty predictable, at least in placement. New open area after climbing around buildings? Fight some dudes.Combos can be made by YOU, as you unlock different strikes. there are 4 types of attacks, with around 8 different options of each, as you play and unlock through pummeling many many foes.The story is a bit odd, but then again i started the game, then put it down for a few months; so i was a bit confused as where i was going and what the hell all these sewer dwellers were doing wrecking Paris...overall, it was worth waiting to buy this on PC instead of console.

												Remember Me brings to the table an absolutely sublime world known as Neo Paris. The designers have gone all out to craft a world that feels believable but is nevertheless, bursting, with novelty and creativity. Life has been brought to this world by a first rate graphics engine and texture art that produce stunning lighting and sharp detail. The score also merits special mention. Holding everything together is a fairly engaging story with a few surprises up its sleeve. Gameplay includes some novel elements (memory `remixing' and the combo lab, for example) that keep things feeling fresh and made the experience enjoyable--even for someone not usually fond of the `brawler' genre.The main shortcoming of the game is that it holds your hand too much. Everywhere you go, the next move you need to make is pointed out by an obnoxious orange arrow. Hesitate for just a moment during a boss fight, and a window pops up telling you exactly how to exploit the enemy's weakness. This excessive mollycoddling ultimately detracts from the player's sense of agency, making those gorgeous environments feel even more linear than they actually are.My advice: buy the game and enjoy the scenery. Just don't expect Skyrim.My playtime for a leisurely playthrough of this game: 13 hours.			"

												A cyberpunk vision of Paris, France. Remember me is breathtakingly beautiful, from the neon-lit labyrinth of the ghettos to the beautiful Saint-Michel district, almost every location feels like it should have been part of some big-budget animation somewhere. You will find no shortage of dramatic camera panning here. As soon as you walk into a new location and you can be certain you will be presented the eye-candy architecture of this world.Though as beautiful as it is, it is just as dramatically short. With about 7-8 hours of gameplay, you will find yourself on a very direct set of rails, with little to no ability to explore this world. But this shortcomming is made up with a well constructed storyline, an amazing soundtrack, and supringingly unique game mechanics. Bottom line: I'd recommend it, but its probably because I god damn love me some cyberpunk.			"

												Involving science fiction storyline about a world where memories are a commodity and you are a rebel against those that deal in such. The most interesting part of the game is the ability to rewind other people's memories and change parts of them. You have to change certain parts of the memory in order to get the desired outsome. Not a difficult game, definately for those that are more interested in a good story. Very linear with climbing elements and occasional fights.			"

												Remember Me is a game that has a really nice story, but is sadly plagued with poor combat gameplay that doesn't compliment it's storyline well.What I like:1)The story progresses well and concludes very nicely.2)The graphics are really nice and doesn't need an all powerful computer to get 60 fps (not constantly though).What I hated (about the gameplay):The beat-em-up combat gameplay the game tries to achieve is done poorly and half the time you might wish you didn't have to put up with it. In beat-em-up or hack-n-slash games, the game tends to try to make you feel good about destroying your enemies. However Remember Me fails to achieve that and can sometimes (if not most of the time) feel repetitive and uninspired to play . Boss fights in the game are tedious. Having long boss fights isn't bad but when it's hindered with the game's repetitive gameplay it's really annoying.The game also offers very limited combos. Sure, those 5 ""specials"" may make up for it, but when they're in cooldown mode you're going to be stuck spamming the X and Y buttons with 3 combos. I'm not even sure what the Combo Lab DLC added to the game :|*Not sure if it's my computer or not, but even though I can get 60 fps on the high settings, the fps drops every now and then. Optimization may not be too well with Radeon cards.Conclusion:I wish I could recommend this, but there was just too many times I wish I didn't had to play it for it's story. Does the story outweigh it's gameplay? I can't say for certain. The story developed nicely but as I've said over and over it's gameplay just feels too dull. The developers were probably trying to aim for something unique but sadly didn't get that part right (I even put the game on the easiest difficult to get it over with, and that's a rarity for me).If you want to get the game, you can get it on discount and see how you like it but if you have something else to spend your money on then go with your second option.Rating: 5.5/10			"

												A fairly simple example of it genre, yes, but Remember Me is a rarity on the PC, as most adventure games of its type are console-only.  It may have its flaws; some hackneyed dialog, plot holes, linear level designs, but as a whole Remember Me offers a competant play experience. The environments are gorgeous. Neo-Paris is incredibly detailed to the point of being cluttered. There's just so much to look at -- even someplace as sterile as a prison.  Sadly, the linear nature of the levels makes exploring limited. Character designs are just as beautiful though. 3D models unlock with achievements for you oogling pleasure. This high detail makes cutscene trasitions near seamless. Combat is easy to grasp; one button to dodge and a variation of two other buttons to combo attacks.  A simple leveling mechanic allows to later customize and extend combos, adding a little strategy and depth.The most unique feature of Remember Me is the memory remixes -- changing a person's (victim's?) memory of a specific event to manipulate them. Remixes themselves are basically cutscenes which can be edited to change little details in the person's memory which compound into completely changing the outcome of the event.  This leads to the person's outlook or personality to completly change. Remixes also add some experimentation and replayability to the game, as there can be multiple outcomes in these manipulations. (only the 'right' way will progress the story though)Overall I recommend Remember Me. Its short length (about 8 hours) benefits the pacing of the game, as no chapter (level) feels slow or trodding, nor do the linear levels and combat feel too shallow.			"

												I'm a big cyberpunk fan and that's why I started playing this game and was not disappointed. The artstyle is amazing and adds a lot upon the great atmosphere this game has. The melee combat is based on combos. it's kinda good and enjoyable but can get repetitive, because although you can change your combos. it's pretty much a matter of different animations. The main character is a black woman. which is very rare this days in video games. The concept of Remember Me is excellent and the story is interesting as well. I recommend this game. I think it's underrated and you should give it a shot.			"

												Remember Me does a lot of things right: Killer art style, cyberpunk setting in Neo-Paris, surprisingly good story and an interesting brawl system where you can fully customise the effects of your combos e.g. if you are reliant on powers during combat, you can choose to set all your 3-hit combos to quickly build up mana and leave longer chains for a mix of healing and damage dealing. Fighting is pure button-mash and different enemies will often require you to change combos on the fly. Memory remixing is a huge let-down however, amounting to nothing more than an interactive movie few and far between. It’s a concept that could’ve been explored much more and incorporated into core gameplay. Other than that, it’s a pretty fun linear brawler.			"

												Remember me is a gripping story that dabbles in originality and all the best story clichés. The story seems to be an activists view on taking social sharing to the extreme. What happens when the only thing that is truly yours, memories, are changed and deleted like Positives:The story, it is well written if a little predictable at times. The concept is well executed with the ability to alter, wipe and steal memories.The cinematics and action is fairly well balanced and used effectively. The combat, this is neither good nor bad. It's pretty repetitive but making somebodies memories explode through their face never gets old.Negatives:Combos, there is a list of 4 combos a 3 hit, 5 hit, 6 hit and 8 hit combo, that is all. These are made slightly more interesting by the pressen system; the pressen system allows you to edit combos even during battle to make particular combos heal you, do more damage or regenerate special moves faster.walking, most of the controls are great and easy to use but damn it Capcom learn that people can turn round without having to run in a little spiral.Other than the minor niggles this game is well worth it for the story and concept.

												Thi game isn't my stlye/genre at all, I usually aim for FPS. Bu enjoying this game was no problem at all for me. Mostly is the genously writen storyline and the emotion behind it that gabbed me and held tight. owever, almost all of the rest of the game was very well developed; from the intricate and ever-changing combat, to the gorgeous artistic environments and characters. The only issue I had with the game as a whole were the moments where the camera felt extremely awkward and clunky during climbing sessions, sometimes leading to my death. The game is also very, very, linear, but that is to be expected with a beat 'em up style fighting game. Though, the beauty of the rest of the game easily overlooks the small errors. I recommend it to anyone who wants a challenge, and enjoys a good story. 8/10			"

												Remember Me feels like a breath of fresh air in this day and age of videogaming. It might not be a masterpiece, but it certainly is a unique title, blending combat a-la-God Hand with a classic cyberpunk setting (evil megacorps ruling, class warfare, hacking!).The plot begins as your standard cyberpunk story: evil corporation running the place and doing evil stuff, main character is a talented hacker working for the revolutionaries, ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER! Or is it? Nillin, the main protagonist, often questions herself between missions about the morality of her actions, while trying to forge a new identity for herself having lost her memories before the game starts. And in the end even some of the villains end up being somewhat sympathetic, normal people having to deal constantly with the heavy burdens of their past.The game world manages to fascinate thanks to the stunning art design of Neo-Paris and a soundtrack that fits the cyberpunk overall theme of the game. Even when moving through the linear structure of the levels, one can admire the cure and dedication put into the world. Sadly, as written above, the game is set on a sequence of linear paths, with little to none exploration to be had.Gameplay-wise, the combat unfortunately becomes quite repetitive quite fast due to the lack of variety in both combos and enemies, with certain encounters entirely based on a ""use special move, wait for CD, repeat"" pattern (some boss battles, while entertaining and varied, fall into this category). The really juicy and unique mechanic is the remixing of memories: by witnessing some key moments in the lives of the target, Nillin can change subtle but important details in order to change those memories completely, therefore manipulating the actions of the ""remixed"". While finding the correct solution is an easy task overall, it leaves open the possibility to mess around  for a while and explore all the possible outcomes. Sadly, this mechanic is only used 4 times in the game. A pity, really.Overall, I would recommend this game for the world building, the memory-related mechanics and the story (an advice: play it in French with English subtitles, the voice acting is really on point), though the fairly monotone combat could prove too boring for someone.

												An interesting story in the futuristic setting of Neo-Paris. You are Nilin who has lost her memory and tries to regain it while fighting against Memorize Corporation, a company virtually in control of the whole society due to their brain implantats.Why I recommend this game:- The graphics are quite innovative: An interesting mix of a ""conventional"" Paris upgraded with high-tech appliances.- CYBERPUNK setting!- A classical single player game. I love that.- The story takes unexpected twists.- Innovative combo-system: You must adapt your tactics to win your combats.- The boss-fights are quite challenging.- There are (too few) situations where you must manipulate the memories of other persons. Quite interesting approach.It took me about 18 hours to finish the game. A fair value at its price!So, if you are into cyberpunk, futuristic settings and single player games, gives this game a chance!			"

												This game oozes style and is confident in its lore and environmental design. The story is very Philip K.♥♥♥♥♥♥ The technologies in the game explore the ramifications of artificial reality, memory modification, and how our memories shape our reality.The majority of the gameplay isn't bad, nor is it anything memorable nor annoying, but just a mechanic for engaging the player in the story and environment. Hacking someone's memory is the coolest thing to do in the game, I'll just say that.I love how it portrays memories, which I think it does a wonderful job visualizing.I think the success of this game suffers from the same thing games with premises hard to describe in one sentence. Psychonauts suffered from the same problem; it and this game are too non-mainstream to be massively profitable. Therefore, we probably won't see a sequel because this is, afterall, a game made by a large publisher who only measures sucess by the millions. I'm just glad a game like this actually got made.			"

												A short, straight-forward, and enjoyable game. Not worth $30 I'd say, but a must-grab for scifi fans (or anyone interested in the story), and people who enjoy strong female protags when it's on sale.What makes this game enjoyable is the story, and the thoughts of Nilin as you try to take down Memorize. This game tells a great story with interesting characters and twists, all the way to the end. Memory Remixes are a great addition to Remember Me, and it's real defining feature. There is really no choice of control in this game. It's very straight forward, with no real question of where to jump, climb, or run to. The only other downside of this game are a few of the boss battles, some of which becoming very tedious and drawn-out. Don't play this game for the challenge of taking down the bosses or fighting the leapers. Preferrably, you'll take the easiest setting, get through the maybe 30 battles in Remember Me, but most of all, just enjoy the story it tells you.			"

												'Remember Me' - Up-DownUP:- Fantastic Artwork & Style - Top Notch !!- Brilliant directing, felt like I was playing a movie.- Engrossing Story - You want to keep playing- Great Voice Acting - Some Familiar Voices can be Heard- Unreal Engine - Known 'Feel' and Gameplay- Stable (Only had one freeze through the whole game and that was Windows being... Windows)DOWN:- Very Linear - They try to hide it but it is quite linear.- Checkpoint Only Saves- Limited Replayability- Bad Camera Tracking During Fights- Unreal Engine - Some innovation and new 'ways' of doing things but not a lot, it can get repetitive.Verdict - It's a good game but could be a little better. If you like story driven single player games like I do then look into it.  There's not a lot of replay in it but it's one I'll play again I'm sure.  I can't say enough about the artwork and style, I bought the game during the Capcom weekend sale and the art alone was worth what I paid for it.  I recommend the game to buy when on sale.7/10			"

												Overall, I really enjoyed this game. It's a great concept with a wonderfully rich world built up around it. Combat could get a little repetitive, but no worse than something like Assassin's Creed. But that wasn't enough to make me dislike the game.My only real gripe is that the big memory editing mechanic that sold me on the game is little more than a handful of mini-game-ish puzzles. They crop up a few times, and are interesting, but I wish they were less linear and more core to the gameplay.But even knowing that, I'd still buy it again.			"

												Remember Me features a very intelligent sci-fi / cyberpunk storyline that is far above average. The game takes place in a amazingly good looking and immersive future mega city environment and is designed in a very linear way that is tightly integrated into its style of storytelling.The combat system, which is quite similar to the Batman Arkham titles, sadly suffers from a bad automatic camera control which sometimes just fails to show you what is relevant. As I played the game with an Xbox 360 gamepad connected to my PC it wasn't so hard to readjust the camera and after a bit of training, the combat system felt not as bad as my first impression had been. Combat still is the weak point of the game and I guess controlling it with keyboard and mouse could not be a good idea.The memory remixing scenes were a quite interesting feature which I never saw before in a game. I also heared some people complain about the game being too short or too easy. In my oppinion this is at least not true for the hard mode and if you don't just ignore the nice environments.All in all this game is a real hidden gem. It is surely not perfect, but I recommend it to everyone who is able to play with a gamepad. The game is especially interesting for fans of the rare cyberpunk genre.			"

												I think this is a great game, and if you are considering buying it I would highly recommend it.  It has a strong and touching story which ends beautifully, rewarding you for sticking through to the end.  The gameplay was alot of fun, it had great combat mechanics, allowing you to play perfectly if you can dodge and combo, it reminded of the fun and flowy combat in the great classic ""Oni!"", or even just mechanically on par with Assasins Creed.  The customisation they provide is just right in my opinion too, it has enough depth and impact to be really personalised and useful for the length of the campaign.  I had all my combos just the way I wanted 1-2 hours before finishing the game so I really enjoyed the combat in that last stretch.My only gripe would be it was only 8 hours, and I was so thoroughly enjoying it! It's like when you finish a book and you REALLY want to the story to keep going, though I must admit it wrapped everything up really well.   Seriously, if you enjoy a great innovative single player campaign, with a compelling story and good gameplay (I mean who doesn't), just pick this up and enjoy yourself!			"

												Let's get the negatives out of the way. It's Short.Im told this is a port. If you don't like ports. ♥♥♥♥ off.The game play was linear,  the combat pretty good for a beat em up.Customizable combos and lots of jumping and climbing. Some great quick time events.This game really shines in story and a plot that sucks you in. A gorgeous gritty world that had elements of Total Recall, Dredd and JJverse star trek all in one. A character who makes you wonder, and enigmatic leader who you want to know more about and a plot with some rather well done twists.I loved every minute of this game. Do I think it's worth the price? Hell yeah!			"

												Wicked art style, amazing story/concept. Like the idea of customizing the combos even though the combat is a little bland.Climbing sections have that ""on rails"" feeling so there is no risk when jumping between gaps.Remix sections can be a little time consuming but really appreciate the level of detail in the animation of those sections.9/10			"

												Remember me was a gripping title from start to finish. I got 13 hours out of the experience and I was not at all dissapointing. The story takes you on a journey of the dangers of forgeting our past and our mistakes. Remembering and learning from our mistakes is key to growing as individuals, businesses, and societies. Remember Me really put some key thoughts in my mind and gave me a lot to think about. On top of that, the graphics were beautiful, and the game had amazing combat and combos. The system allows you to create your own combos that give combinations of healing, damage, multipliers, ect.  I highly recomend this game. ~PR0XIDIAN			"

												In all the time I was waiting for the price to drop on this game I had read both good and bad reviews, but have personally found it to be quite enjoyable so far.The female protagonist is certianly refreshing, though despite being a complete badass Nilin has about as much depth and complexity as the recently re-imagined Lara Croft (if not less); the reason for this being that she primarily interacts with herself and the brief moments she does have conversing with others are done via commlink and thus end up being rather impersonal.The gameplay is mostly balanced between vertical platforming and combo-based 'beat-em-up' style combat. While the platforming doesn't really offer anything unique (missed opportunity if you ask me) it is handled quite well all the same. The combat, however, is part of what makes this game shine. Sure, on the surface it may not seem so different but the Combo Lab is quite a nifty innovation that allows you build your combos - and thus your play style - as you see fit. For each combo you unlock, you can mix and match moves (the actual button combinations are static) from various categories to build new and powerful attack strings; from power attacks to regen attacks and more.The Memory Remix mechanic is also unique and quite interesting, though sadly doesn't see much use. What it does is let you view a person's memory and alter it by scrubbing it for memory leaks which can then be manipulated in various ways. For example: your first encounter with this power has you erasing the memory of an ill loved-one from the mind of a bounty hunter and therefor eliminating her motivation for wanting you dead.The graphics are pretty solid and Neo-Paris is simply stunning - from it's towering heights to the murky bowels of the undercity below. Voice acting was really well done, even if the actual writing behind it often left something to be desired; Kezia Burrows (voice of Nilin) does a particularly awesome job. Music is halfway decent, too.			"

												A deeply flawed, but incredibly beautiful game. The memory remixes that they used to sell the advertising only show up a handfull of times, which is regrettable. The combat moves, though visually interesting, are almost all designed to attack a single target, which is problematic when the majority of fights involved you getting mobbed by large groups. You spend just as much time dodging attacks as you do fighting at certain points. Thankfully, some of the Sensen abilities help greatly for crowd control, but the combat system is still troublesome. The parkour is actually quite limited as the game holds your hand and labels every ledge you can jump to, and thus others that look like they should work do not. In many cases the game gives the look of a sandbox but only allows you to travel a single path. All that being said, there are an number of positives. The graphics are beautiful. The character models (for named characters) are extremely well designed, and the visual aesthetic of Neo Paris really shines through in the level design and the architecture. They actually included a lot of little character animations that help add to the realism. Nilin rubs her arms for warmth in a cold server room, holds her arm in front of her mouth to avoid breathing in smoke, and even glances to the side occasionally as she is running, all little things that help you feel like she's a person rather than a puppet. The voice acting is extremely well done, and the dialogue is engaging. The world they have created is immersive, and it's the kind of setting that would make for a great movie.The biggest positive for me, though, is the story. This is one of the few games I've played in recent years where I've actually felt something for the character. As you play through the game, you can actually empathise with Nilin as she struggles to regain her memories and thus her identity, as she struggles with whether the ends justify her actions, etc. She is a uniquely strong and yet broken individual, and that to me makes her more likeable. Much like this game, she has her flaws, her broken and missing pieces, but she also has a strong presence about her that cannot be denied. Ultimately, I guess that's why I like this game. It's not perfect, just as she is not. But that makes it more, in a sense, human.			"

												Really an excellent game, the storyline is a twisting, but intriguing line with a very dark patch in it.  9/10 for story, as for combat 7/10 due to the repetative nature but still an interesting concept and the design of your own combinations is always interesting and allows for much versatility.  For that, the customizable system it gets a 5/10 because regardless of that it is still limited to only a set type of moves, and combos can only be initiated with a certian type of move.  All in all a 7/10 game, fun to play if you like stories, not if you want fighting.			"

												Picked this game up for $10 on sale - I absolutely urge anyone who is an avid gamer to buy it.I have seen a lot of griping about a number of things, and I hope to put some of them to rest.  One example is that someone mentioned a seeming lack of imagination when it comes to enemies.  To that, all I have to point out is that great games like Bioshock, for example, literally had like two types of enemies - Splicers and Big Daddies.  That game is still widely regarded as a great title and this one is no different.  Enemy archetypes are low in number, but the variance in enemies is by no means small.  I found myself constantly enthralled by the evolution of enemies over time.  It definitely felt like they were ramping up the the difficulty as time went on (when playing on the hardest difficulty) and therefore I think they did fine in this department.Another thing people have mentioned is that they felt as though the combat system was strange or too simple - what have you.  The combat system is exactly like what you would see in Batman: Arkham Asylum.  It has that sort-of fluid momentum to it that I, personally, praise in video games.  So, if you liked Arkham Asylum's combat system, you will like Remember Me's.Things like the plot (I am about 50% of the way done) and the world seem to be wonderfully crafted.  The world especially is breathtaking.  In every chapter so far, there seems to be a subtle moment handed to the player to let them know that the environment is expansive and enveloping.  It really does well, with the majorly-accredited musical score that accompanies it, in making the player feel immersed.  The plot is interesting and holds up well to what I originally anticipated from the game.Another major gripe seemed to be the interaction with memories and the player's ability to alter them.  This was a minor pitfall in the sense that I felt like there needed to be more examples of this throughout the game.  Still, in the examples that have occurred up to where I am currently at in the game, I have had plenty of fun trying to solve the puzzles.  Sometimes you screw yourself, sometimes you accidentally alter it the wrong way - it /has/ to be limited to some extent but it is still really fun.I gave the game a 10/10 simply because I think it is a fantastic game overall, an wonderfully immersive experience for players, and a great addition to any gamer's collection.  If you can pick it up at $10, I would say it is entirely worth the cash if you have it on hand.As an afterthought, here are some games that it contains elements of as a means of comparison to your tastes: The Bioshock Series, Batman: Arkham Asylum, elements of horror similar to those in parts of Dead Space and Dead Space 2, Mirror's Edge, Assassin's Creed, and even some relation to Dishonored.  Super fun game, check it out in the very least and, if you get it, I definitely recommend tackling it with a controller.			"

												This game is awesome!The combat style is great, you can build several combos all by yourself and use them in fights. The music is absolutely amazing! Love the soundtrack. The music in combat differs based on your style, so the better you fight, the better music you get. It really drives you in the game.The story itself is great (but sad). The main character (Nilin) is perfect, I loved her the whole story.The only bad thing about this game is it's linearity, you have very little possibility to explore the locations...But it's really a great game which I would recommend to play. For me it's 9/10 (-1 point for the linearity).			"

												I recieved Remember Me as a gift not knowing what to expect. I've been pleasently surprised with the visuals, storyline, characterisation and combat customisation. Remember Me follows a linear storyline without offering much exploration of maps, but it made up for it by offering fast paced gameplay. Origionally created with a controller in mind I found some of the keyboard controls tricky at times but this only had a small impact on gameplay. A feature that I believe defines Remember Me is the ability to remix memories. This is something that has never been attempted before in a video game, allowing the player completely control the outcomes of memories. I hope to see a similar feature implimented in future games along with a focus on female protagonists.			"

Overall, I wouldnt have spent full price for this game but its definetly a game worth experiencing. If you can pick it up for $20 or cheaper than I would recommend picking it up.			"

												Remember Me is a game full of beauty and intrigue. It’s clear a lot of thought and hard work was built not only to craft an interesting world to inhabit, but also explore. It’s really too bad the mechanics and story weren’t up to par for the task.Remember Me is a action-adventure-brawler that takes place in the year 2084 in a heavily cyberpunk inspired city of Neo Paris. In this world a new technology exists that allows memories to be exchanged, modified and removed, allowing citizens to remove unpleasant memories and replacing them with good ones. Nearly everyone in society has taken up that opportunity.The player plays as Nilin, a member of the “Errorist” movement fighting to get rid of said technology that they believe has enslaved much of society. The game starts up with the player tuning in just as Nilin seems to be having her memory removed rather painfully. As far as amnesia as a narrative framing goes, this one is at least somewhat interesting. From here the player is guided mostly linearly throughout the rest of the game, which consists of alternating between competent melee combat and samey exploration.Basic combat is handled by using different combinations of the X and Y button on the XBox controller. While fighting Nilin automatically locks on to a nearby opponent, though the game never really explicitly tells the player which opponent you’re locked on to. Switching between enemies is simple, as moving the left analogue stick in the general direction of an opponent causes the player wants to start attacking them. In my experience though switching to a new opponent ended any combo I was in the middle of, which can be a pretty big problem. More on that a bit later.Besides combos the player also has special attacks that are used once they have enough energy that is gained through attacks on the enemy or when Nilin is attacked. The first special attack unlocked is pretty standard and makes Nilin faster and more powerful allowing the player to jam on whatever buttons they want for a few seconds and generally do a lot of damage. This is useful for clearing out enemies, but little else. Another stuns enemies for a while allowing the player to get in a few good combos. My favorite ability allows the player to turn invisible for a brief period and take out any one enemy before becoming visible again, a power I used as frequently as allowed later in the game.The special attacks are critically important to the game later on as enemies become stronger and more plentiful, or have some sort of effect that makes attacking them less effective. This would be neat, if they allowed the player to use special attacks more frequently. After the activation of a special attack the player cannot use it again until a cooldown has ended. This in itself isn’t a bad idea, except in a lot of cases the cooldown was so high that it made combat pretty frustrating, especially when the special attacks is the most fun part of the combat.As the player progresses through the game they unlock combos and “Presence” through gaining “Presence Points.” The combo systems is unlike anything I’ve seen before. Each presence corresponds to a specific button press that is used in combat, which is then equipped to a button press in any of the combos. For example, if I unlocked a presence labeled as “X” I could equip it to any part of a combo where the button “X” would be pressed. What this does is vastly change the effect of any of the combos. In total there are only four combos throughout the entire game ranging from three button presses to eight. When the player earns enough PP they can unlock one of four kinds of Presence. The first Presence unlocked gives each hit a bit extra damage, allowing the player to disorient enemies and finish them off for some extra PP. The second gives the player a small health boost with every hit. The third reduces the cooldown time for any special attack currently in a cooldown phase. The final is a sort of enhancement presence that enhances the presence for the previous button press in the combo.The different kinds of presence can be stacked in a row for greater effect allowing the player to define exactly what each combo is really good for, or allow them to make a specific combo a sort of catch all for everything they could hope to want. Though, because of the ability to gain health during combat, I only ever died once through the entire experience while I played on the medium (recommended) difficulty setting.The problem with this system arises when the player actually gets into combat. Typically while in combat the player has several opponents, and they tend to gather near the player. This causes the scenario to occur where the player is attacking an opponent when another opponent starts to attack them. Thankfully when an enemy is about to attack there is a clear indication over their head, and a simple press of the A button causes the player to dodge out of the way and keep the lock on their current enemy. However, I’ve found dodging out of the way inconsistently ends the combo I was in the middle of. Most of the time I only ever completed one of the larger combos when I was fighting a single enemy on their own. Every other time I had to deal with using a smaller combo I knew I could finish off before being attacked.Overall, the combat felt entirely too stiff and mechanical. It gave me very few chances to feel like I was pulling off cool moves since I was being interrupted so frequently. It often seemed that enemies were designed to only start attacking while I was in the middle of an active combo. The special moves helped with getting some enemies off my back, but the most useful ones took so long to recharge and the combos that I had set to reduce the cooldown were so constantly interrupted combat felt drawn out and frustrating.There are a handful of boss battles, but a good majority of them involve the player fighting hordes of enemies while the boss takes pot shots at them from afar. The boss battles are painfully extended, mostly because there are only key moments where damage can be dealt or require a special attack to end it’s cooldown time. At the end of each boss battle there is a quick time sequence with timed button presses and occasionally some button mashing. The best thing I have to say about the QTE in this game is that it isn’t offensive and I only ever failed one once.Between combat the player spends a lot of time navigating the environment. This includes a lot of climbing over ledges, jumping over pits and shuffling along building edges. This wasn’t bad per se, but I never felt like this was particularly interesting. These sequences are almost entirely linear in nature and rarely have any sense of urgency. There are a small amount of collectibles scattered around like health and special power boosts, as well as small amounts of information on the world. The former is often given away with hints that show the location of the boost from a different angle. Though frequently the location of the boosts are so obvious that the need for a hint can feel almost insulting.There is a lot more to this review, but I couldn't fit it all here. If you want to see it all, check it out at the following link:http://axelaodh.tumblr.com/post/85092390521/game-review-remember-me "

												A fast paced game with lots of action and a nice story to bring it all together. The game picks up modern topics of a digital world and its problems and yarns a neat story thread out of them. It has potential to be more than just a strong linear jump and fight game with some puzzles but that is all this game is about. Do not get me wrong: you need accuracy, timing and reactions to pass the action aspect of the game and some power of deduction to solve the puzzles, but do not be afraid as you are able to get help if needed. Nevertheless, the story is interesting, I always wanted to know how things evolve finally; the story has its turnarounds and its surprises and in the end I felt it was all too short, but -- the advantage is that the story has no slumps and gets to the point quickly.If you like a good story and action coupled with it, then the game is worth a try.One word to the handling of the camera and character: it was overall ok and playable, at some points it has its flaws and can be an obstacle, although not too frustrating; the frequent auto-saves were also able to remedy this and be a last resort if one were unlucky.

												Kinda like a mix between Deus Ex Human Rev and Batman Arkham Asylum, solid but not as good as either of those in gameplay terms. Interesting story, strong visuals and imaginativeness but a real lack of interaction with both the environments and many of it's hinted inhabitants. As for the core dynamics, the core idea is great (remix memories) but happens few and far and when it does is far too linear to hold you (imagine if you were able to remix / change memories of any inhabitants you found the street to help you progress, now that would have been awesome).Even in terms of the many climbing sections in the game your very much restricted and spoon feed the way (this is the free-flowing climbing you may be use to or expect due to the likes of Assassins Creed series.Giving it a 6.5 / 10 overall due to bugs (had to replay a boss due to not being able to progress without all the minions out the way first, nearly got uninstalled there and then), the heavy linear nature and lack of interaction / exploration when such great art is on display. The strenghs come in the solid Batman-like free-flow combat (although not as good), wonderous visuals and strong story, worth it on a discount for sure.			"

They try to shroud them in mystery but at the end I ended up not caring about either after each and every 'reveal'.

The Buffs collectable they give hints but if you go look around and accentently go to the next room, too bad for you. The last one has the most of them and doesn't do much of anything once got.

												Remember me is a significant artistic achievement. The atmosphere is of a moden paris backdrop in a cybernetic world.It makes interesting mention of Camus and other underpinning existentialism. The music is cool cyberpunk style, some of the best artwork I have seen in a videogame, and defenitely amongst the most unique. It is a beautiful cinematic accomplishment that is a cleverly artistic and intelligent story with solid gameplay to back it up. An intriguing storyline kept me interested and motivated throughout.Many areas involve jumping, fighting, and light puzzles. The controls are decent, and the Graphics, textures, voice acting, and music are all top notch. Overall this game players similiar to Devil May Cry, but this is significantly better, in my opinion, with a more gripping story.The ending is well done and pulls everything together in a thoughtful and interesting perspective on human memories.It makes us think about painful memories, and how they shape our existense, and without them, what are we really? Very well done, thank you devs! Finished it in 10 hours on easy.  "

												Overall, I can't believe this game isn't more highly-acclaimed.I won't say it has no flaws -- the controls are a little fluky at times, and the dialog from some characters is a little over the top (I'm looking at you, Edge), but those are the only standout flaws in an otherwise amazing game. It's Arkham Aslyum, Mirror's Edge and Deus Ex all mixed together, and it works BEAUTIFULLY.The environment that surrounds you, the gameplay that the game gives you, the little mechanics that are constantly added to make the world more interactive and alive -- all of these come across seamlessly to create a fantastic, unique experience. I know that sounds like the most shlocky review ever, but seriously. This game ♥♥♥♥ing rules.9/10, needs a sequel, pls draw porn of the main character.			"

												I quite liked it. Since pretty much every aspect of the game has been detailed already in countless reviews I'll provide a quick rundown of my experiences.What I liked:+ Interesting story (if you like dystopian sci-fi, which I do)+ Pretty visuals+ Very good soundtrack (one of the few aspects most reviewers, including professional ones, seem to agree on)+ Good voice acting (contrary to what I read in reviews. The English version is definitely good)+ Doesn't require UPlay, Games for Windows Live or any other annoying 3rd party DRM nonsense.What I didn't like:- It's too linear. It's not an open world and you can't enter all those pretty-looking cafés, stores, etc. Also, you don't need to work out tactics to win battles; you don't need to know much more than hitting and evading to finish the game and if you do need to do something special and you don't figure it out it just tells you.- Some of the combo elements as a seperate DLC. I understand they need to make money but if they have to sell DLCs they should provide an actual added value to the game.- It crashed on me the first time I started it because it needs PhysX drivers installed system-wide and doesn't ship them, so you have to download them from Nvidia first.- Minor quirks. E.g. sometimes during the game it loads textures for the area you're about to enter and during that time my frame rate dropped massively for a few seconds. I'd have preferred a freeze for 5 seconds with a pop-up saying ""loading"" but it's not a big deal really, and possibly if you have a more powerful computer you won't notice it at all.+- I should add I played it with a controller and had no negative experiences with the interface. Others who played with mouse and kb seem to dislike the controls. SummaryIf you think of the game as an interactive sci-fi film it's really quite enjoyable. It doesn't contain any revolutionary new ideas. Beating up baddies, combos, Tomb-Raider-style climbing and grabbing ledges, quick time events, run-of-the-mill stuff. But it implements all those concepts quite decently. An interesting element is the ability to remix memories: you change how people remember certain events so their personalities change and they make different decisions. Ultimately whether you like the game or not depends on how much you like the good bits and how much you hate the bad ones (which is of course true for every game/film/book/...). I suggest looking up one or two let's play videos about Remember Me on youtube and deciding then if it's something for you. It may not be the best game ever but with a Metascore of 65 it's clearly underrated in my opinion.			"

												This straddles the line of love hate so well - At the start I wanted to hate it but couldn't, and at the end I wanted to love it.. but couldn't. I guess that leaves me with a middling like!Weighing in at 12h on normal it's good value for money... the combat is good when you get used to it - the combo selection adds some depth and there are plenty of enemy variants. It reminds us of Oni (if you're old enough) and of course the more modern Batman but it's possibly the poor cousin to the fluidity of the bat. The rest is on rails - tomb raider 'lite' sections have you jumping around but telling you where every move is. Odd choice? Then puzzle sections to tax you a little - mostly simple, but a few are really good riddlesque pieces - how puzzles should be.The reason I bought this game was actually to see the memory remixing which looked interesting and different. Thankfully it was both... though possibly a little simplistic and maybe a little underused. Without saying too much, developers missed a trick with the final remix - they should have gone where I suspect most people would hope, but settled for keeping it simple - shame! What is great is the art direction and wow.. the music is out of this world - patch that into pretty good story and it's worth a shot if you don't mind it being a little consoley... especially the checkpointing. So if you see it cheap... give it a go.			"

												This was a great game.  Made great by the music and the storyline: thoughtful, provoking, nihilistic yet full of hope, faith, and courage.  It had a slightly different feel in terms of playstyle: entertaining, interesting, not unenjoyable.  Playing ""Remember Me"", I felt as though my enjoyment of simply playing was only half of what was driving me to play.  I wanted - no, needed - to know what happened next.  So, I played on.  I felt the music, felt the rhythm of Nilin fighting through her existence as she pieced together her memories... her life.  I needed to know - even though I didn't agree with altering memories, the reality, of those Nilin cared for as well as striking out against other victims of her reality, of her existence - that Nilin's actions justified the end:  stopping the atrocities done to those around her - to the world as she knew it.  With that in mind, I recommend this game.  How could I not.  I mean, if you had the ability to never experience pain, would you make it so?... I wonder.Well, that's my time on the soapbox, back to playing a second time through.  Cheers, and Remember Me soon.			"

												The near-perfect love-child of several great games. Story and setting remind me of Deus Ex: HR as well as Mirror's Edge, combo combat system has something of Sleeping Dogs in it, and the third-person parkour navigation feels a bit like Assassin's Creed. Combine that with a bunch of interesting characters, gorgious environments, and an excellent soundtrack and you've got an excellent mix going. I fell in love with it right from the start.The only point where I felt the game falls a little short is that the camera sometimes works against you, making you miss the chance to dodge an incoming blow. Combat system might be slightly easier for some with a controller, but configuring your pressens according to the situation has a much bigger impact than that.			"

RememberMe has a lot going for it. Interesting concept, beautiful setting, and an involving story. Unfortunately it also has some potent negative factors. Control. As a console port, the game handles like a garbage truck sometimes, causing even the simplest movements to become a trying task. Jumping over obstacles is out of the question as invisible walls and even debris blocks Nilin from moving forward. I found myself more often than not getting caught on a droid arm lying on the ground and not being able to get out of its elbow nook. Taking from the popularity of Assassin's Creed, wall climbing and building scaling are the most used method of getting around, but its not FUN! The games sometimes hurtfully linear design means Nilin -must- take one route to her destination, which is a pity during the early game where the slums of future Paris sprawl out in all directions. With all the effort the designers put into building such an amazing area it was a shame to not get to explore it.Cutscenes. Too many cutscenes. Too many too short cutscenes. Too many short in-game cutscenes. There has never been a need for a cutscene in-game every 20ft. It breaks the player out of the story when you take control away from them to walk two steps and then give it back. I could have walked those two steps. Combat. Here is something I really tried to find fun, but was mostly tedious. Build your own combo. Take traits from four different catagories and build a combo that can do huge burst damage, lower cooldown timers, or even heal yourself. Sounds good, right? By the end of the game I had two combo's. A healing combo, and a damage combo that lowered my cooldowns, but it gives you FOUR combo's to build! Each longer and more complicated to remember. If you're the kind of person who can remember which order you placed your kicks and punches in to attain maximum combo awesomeness, then maybe you'll appreciate the combat system a little more than I did. I am apparently dumb and prefer three/five hit combo's to seven/nine hit combo's.Now what I -DID- like about the combat system was the special abilities. After building enough focus by smashing enemies with your fists you can level the field by using one of Nilin's randomly acquired abilities that you acquired for no reason other than plot and the current enemy demanded it. Not that I wasnt grateful for the cool moves. I had a massive hard-on for the data bomb you could strap to an oppenent in the middle of combat and have him blow up and take out half of the enemies around him. Or the stealth upgrade which came in handy for one shot disabling the guards with shields that zapped you, a-la Arkham stun baton's. As per usual with almost every game now there was the obligatory ""push now for things to happen"", but I've come to accept that this is now a thing and it will keep happening. I am indifferent. The boss fights are almost like mid-terms where you take everything you've learned so far and beat someone up who has a name. The final boss culminates -everything- you've learned over the game and makes you use it. Something I personally liked. I'm looking at you TOMB RADIER. Hunt for food and then never hunt for food again. StoryNow the part of the game that I really liked. I hope to turn you on with this section. I know I haven't sounded like I enjoyed the game, but I did. You are Nilin: Memory Hunter. You've had your mind wiped and take up arms against the corporation Memorize to not only take back who you are, but to free future Paris from its downward spiral of social media addiction and misery. Armed with nothing but your memory hacking glove and a mysterious guiding figure who refers to himself as ""Edge"", Nilin must push through a hostile world where she has lived her whole life, but is only seeing for the first time.Ooooh, sexy right? Yes! I wrote that for -you-. For all its faults, the story and plot are SEXY! It gives you the things a game should give you. A quest of discovery and redemption! Forces trying to stop the discovery and redemption which you then PUNCH IN THE FACE and push onward toward discovery and redemption! What can possibly give the hero an advantage over her enemies?!Enter Memory Remixing.This right here? This. Is. The. Bomb. It only happens a few times through the game, which is so sad, BUT, every time it happens you are going to be fully involved in the game. Nilin enters the mind of a character and watches a memory. It is now up to you to rewind the memory and edit small details to acheive a new outcome. This is by far the best part of the game. This is the part of the game that you wait for. Even when done wrong and you have to rewind the memory and start all over again three, four, five times, its still interesting.I recommend this game for those with controllers. I think it will handle MUCH better than a keyboard/mouse combo.And for those looking for a rating, I give it a 7/10. "

												Like all games that take place in the future, Remember Me is set in a dystopian-esq world where the rich are richer, the poor are poorer, zombies exist, and memories are a form of currency.  You can remove bad memories and relive good ones over and over again, perhaps even other peoples.  Nilin is a freedom fighter in Neo-Paris in 2084.  She's fought against the destructive nature of memory monopoly company Memorize and the way they've allowed their technology to be used as punishment, to remove the memories of a negative event even though it had a major inpact on that person's life, and to turn normal human beings into zombies who've lost their mind and can only destroy for as long as she can remember...or so she's told.  All of her memories have been erased and she's in the most secure prison in Neo-Paris, the Bastille.  Then, a man named Edge, who is able to communicate via the memory plug located on nearly every human's neck, instructs Nilin how to get free and return to her old self.  For the rest of the game, you uncover Nilin's lost past and attempt to free everyone from their fake self’s.Combat is similar to a 3D fighting game.  You press buttons to do combos, called pressons, that either allow you to steal health from enemies, reduce cooldowns on special skills, or straight-up do more damage.  You also, eventually, get what is essentially a gun, Spammer, to shoot switches that open doors, turn on/off lights, or just to do a little damage from a far and break shields of certain enemies.  She also has access to skills, S-Pressons, which can effect battle by giving you more power, blowing-up enemies, and several other effects.  It's somewhat of a clunky system as you can only continue combos on one enemy at a time but, since you're constantly getting hit and having to dodge around without a target lock, it's easy to lose said combo.  It can turn simple battles into a bit of a grind if you're only allowed to hit someone once or twice doing barely any damage.  This is easier to overcome late game when you realize you gain more presson options to make a short, powerful three attack but mid-game it can be frustrating.  If you're against one to three guys, though, it can be pretty fun, assuming you're getting most of the frames per second and not lagging like I was.  Character depth is, for the main characters, amazing.  Nilin is a strong female lead who, after the prologue, isn't a damsel in distress and is legitmate♥♥♥♥♥kicker.  She shows her emotions but when the world around you is, literally, falling apart, most people would show some concern for the brain annihilated zombies or innocent people being pillaged.  You also feel for all the bosses in the game.  They all have some pretty heavy baggage which you get to see via the Memory Remix sections of the game where you manipulate the memories of certain characters for the reasons Nilin needs.  The only issue with the Memory Remix sections is they're not very open ended.  There were plenty of options for several endings to them but there's only one and it can take a while to reach.  There's so much stuff to do in the mixes, and most are interesting, but sitting and twirling the joysticks for 30 minutes trying not to miss the two frames you need to catch to continue gets boring.Remember me tries to keep things fresh by changing levels up a bit.  Sometimes you're fighting but often you're Assassin Creed style parkouring, albeit in a linear fashion, from ledge to ledge.  One level has you running from a maniac in an attack helicopter.  Other times, you're reliving memories to avoid bombs or open doors.  There’s also a fair bit of walking around that allows you take in the amazing backgrounds and appreciate how much time and effort was spent into developing the art work.  The music fits the futuristic tone but isn't drum and bass techno.  The dystopian nature of the game doesn't allow for much ""dropping of the bass"" but it works and works well.  Most of the tracks were recorded by an orchestra and written by the same guy who wrote the music for Assassins Creed IV - Freedom Cry DLC, Olivier Deriviere, so if you liked Assassins Creed music, give this a listen.  The soundtrack is mostly ambient but enhances tense and depressing moments.  iTunes[itunes.apple.com]Amazon[www.amazon.com]During the game, you're able to collect 40 Mnemist Memories to find out more about the back story and see concept art that reminds you how amazing graphics of the game are.  Some people are mixed on this game but if you're patient then you can enjoy digging into a revolution and political upheaval and you turn Paris upside down while exploring an idea that I haven't seen much of - memories.  I'm so glad DontNod Entertainment didn't go with the climate change idea.  Word of warming though, the game has unskippable cutscenes.  I totally understand if that is a deal breaker.			"

												Finished this around 9-10 hours and I enjoyed it even though I felt it got a little long winded towards the end. I loved the setting/atmosphere and the soundtrack was great. The combat was fun, similar to the Batman games except you can customize each combo to your liking. The platforming was done well, no stupid deaths and no fighting the camera. No crashes, ran and looked great, fully customizable controls, no FOV slider but there is an easy fix for it. If you can make it through the game then ending is worth it. I definitely recommend this game and I’m sure it’s gonna go on sale soon so GRAB IT.			"

												Not stellar but solid, kinda like a decent conspiracy thriller film. Sets up an interesting world and premise (memory-editing technology is created and society addicts itself to it) but doesn't do a great deal with it, telling a fairly standard plot and not really showing the effects on society (since the protagonist never interacts with ordinary people). Mixes Tomb Raider-esque platforming with a decent, Arkham Asylum-inspired battle system which is solid if a bit repetitive at times. Visuals are nice though and several boss battles are memorable. Worth your time but not a must-play, call it a B overall.			"

												I found Remember Me to be a good action/adventure game. Set in a futuristic scenario it has good visuals alongside a decent story with decent voice acting.The combat system is interesting although sometimes it feels a bit unresponsive, it relies mostly in customizable melee combos and some special abilities. There’s also some puzzle settings along the way, and although relatively easy to solve they manage to be interesting and well fitted in the story.Overall Remember Me is more entertaining than challenging, but the varying change of pace and sceneries alongside the constant evolving of the character prevent it of becoming too repetitive making it an enjoyable game.

												Well, that… certainly was a game! I’ve read that a number of people didn’t like the story or dialogue, and I completely disagree; those were easily the strongest points of the game and were done really well! … but that’s just it; there’s no real game to support it or any kind of increasing difficulty paced throughout the game, and the memory remixing is incredibly underutilized for what was advertised as one of the most interesting gameplay features… then there’s the two number/letter combination puzzles towards the end of the game that I had to actually look up the answers for because they were stumping me.Man, the combat in particular… it makes you feel like you’re going to get a whole ton of combos to perform with all kinds of neat attack variations and types to use that will really liven up the combat, but then it really is just as little as you’re actually shown when you first go that menu. Not to mention the parkour given in an incredibly restrictive and linear world where you’re mostly just trapped in a bunch of corridors and narrow alleys.I guess I’d rather that Remember Me was a film instead…? It had such an emphasis on story to the point you’re not given any means to skip cutscenes even when you replay the game that it just reeks of the guys really wanting to do a film then deciding to just have it as a game at the last minute of the group meeting to get the idea off the ground.Shame I can’t say the gameplay’s even as fun as Ace Attorney, which says quite a ton.

												I find Remember Me has quite a unique plot, with plot twists that you won't really see coming, definately set apart from the others in the market currently. Nilin, the main character, is quite interesting and her monolouges inbetween chapters do give you an insight into her personality.Graphics wise and visually speaking, it can be quite beautiful at times and alot of detail has been put in. I especially love how your Sensen displays certain things, such as a shop's opening time or a cafe's menu when you go near it, yes not a core part of the gameplay but well executed and thought out and adds to the futuristic feel.Combat wise, you really have to plan your combos for fight and on occasion pause and rearrange them to suit the situation, for example add more healing Pressens, since you're about to die. It also pays to learn the combos and not click the mouse buttons like a madman, I realised this after my first death early on. The downside is that the combat can be somwhat... floaty I suppose as sometimes I dodge the wrong way or attack an unintended target, which makes me think perhaps a controller was intended for this game, which is annoying for PC and keyboard users as the WASD keys do not do diagonal. The camera can also be annoying at times if you are moving around a lot during a fight.The enemies have a good variety, in that as you move along, new enemies are introduced. For example Nilin's stun move won't work on certain enemies. Some will hold a shield that you must destroy first, or you have to defeat it's supporters so they become vulnerable. It does pay to check their codex to see what works as trial and error can be somewhat tedious and means you die alot.It's also a shame that there are not more memory remix events as they are quite intriguing and it is interesting to see how moving one little thing can create an entirely different memory. Overall it's really the combat that let's this game down due it's issues with the keyboard.I'd recommed playing it but perhaps get it during a sale at a good reduced price			"

The graphics are amazing (if your rig can handle it), the combat smooth but challenging (think The Witcher 1), the level designs reminiscent of Mirror's Edge, the story line charged with lots of fun ethical and moral debate, the voice acting is excellent, and there's a well developed world style and backgroud.  Generally it's a great ride for about 10-15 hours of play.However, the downsides are also many.  The world is a railroad platformer where the only side-tracks are for hidden items.  These (and achievement hunting) are an exercise in frustration; there is no capability to skip cutscenes and/or jump ahead in a level you've already completed.  The play can also be rather sketchy on a keyboard and I really recommend using a gamepad.  The late game story also takes some ""twists"" that are really kinda forced or unnecessary.  I also ran into several targeting and other bugs that required restarting the game.I suspect that many of these issues are because this is DONTNOD's first production.  There's a lot of talent there that just needs a bit more polish.  I look forward to seeing future works from this group.			"

												It's more like ""remember parts of me"" than ""remember me"" really since Remember Me is a pretty decent game as a whole but certain parts stand out while others fade into the background which to me either showed a lack of consistency within the game and maybe a lack of communication between the design team. BUT anyway Remember Me is one of those titles that comes along once and a while and wows you with it's ideas and mainly it's ideas -  the game's main concept memory storage and distribution is a great concept and weaves the story together well making you question both your character (Nilin) and the other character's own memory as you try and get to the end buuuuuut it does kind of fall apart near the end and the amount of lore the game expects you to take in first time around is obnoxious to say the least. Yet like I stated before this is a game of inconsistency, even if the concepts are great the characters aren't as well done, yeah you may question them but it's not like their memorable. In contrast to this the world and environment design is top-notch and refreshingly makes the future an actual okay place to live in as it's littered with cafes and clothing shops making it feel like that the human race has actually progressed into this state. Another great visual aspect is the effects design as some of them are superb and fit into this sci-fi world so neatly that they are a joy to watch, blasting the memories out of a guy's head has never looked better :D. The most stand-out concept of the game is the fact that you can fiddle with people's memories, change them and therefore changing their life experiences forming them into a different person, it's a great story narrative device and probably could have had a whole game for itself from how enjoyable it was but I wish it was used more...The combat system is a refreshing take on the usual beat em up, gone are the heavy  attack, light attack, dodge ceremonial dance that is worshipped by previous games and instead you create your own comboes with their own benefits, mixing up kicks and punches as you go - roundhouse kicking foes to give me health is just so sweet plus someone decided that you can dodge and carry on your combo which is a awesome touch yet the combat can get really clustered when fighting multiple foes and you can never seem to pull off your best comboes because you get blind sided by a dude lightly stroking your hair. On that note the humanoid enemy designs (the robots are pretty cool) and character designs (excluding a few characters) are really bland and take the life out of the world as the humoids all look like splicers that didn't make the cut to be in Bioshock. The boss battles excluding the last one felt really tedious to me, or in fact pointless, same goes for the stealth sections. There is a hell of a lot of climbing to do but Nilin moves so slowly that it makes it more of a chore to do it. The game time isn't that long with no replayablility at all and is pretty linear however the linear parts don't make it exactly bad as it does allow you to focus on the story.Even though it does have it's faults and can be annoying at times Remember Me was pretty enjoyable for most of it, if your looking for a ""different"" type of beat em up I'd reccomend this.+ Combat is refreshing and new+ World, Special Effect and Environment design are superb+ Memory remixing is a great gameplay mechanic+ Story has it's moments- Drab enemy and character designs- Climbing and stealth are pretty boring- Boss battles are annoying- Short (but compact)7/10 "

												Simply an amazing game. If you are a fan of Blade Runner, Inception, or the like, you will love this game. The story is simply astounding - and the idea of remixing memories is novel, as is an economy built on the commoditization of them. The plot twist I was expecting (but didn't happen) is that you in fact aren't the main character, just another person who had her memories transplanted in you.The game is satisfying, if linear. The only criticism I would have is that the places where the bonuses are hidden aren't very well indicated many times, and if you make a wrong turn and continue the story, you can't go back.Outside of that, time and money extraordinarily well spent.

												I absolutely loved this game. I understood Nilin's sad childhood and it's an overall very depressing game, so the emotional appeal worked for me. There wasn't really any chance to explore Neo-Paris and if they did this like Gravity Rush, I think it would've worked better (missions with a set path but time to explore the city for as long as you want between missions). Spoiler: I didn't actually expect for Nilin to be the daughter of Sylla because I figured that it was just another remix like she did with Olga. I really liked how they did that because it wasn't super obvious until she's calling the little girl in the backseat by the protagonist's name. Another thing that could've been done for Remember me would be to have more chances to remix because it's so interesting, but maybe have slighlty less depressing remixes because I always felt sad after them (especially because you make a husband die, a man kill his wife which led to his suicide, blaming the mother instead of the child for a car accident, and having a father kill his daughter). Overall though, this is honestly one of my favorite games now because it drew me in with an interesting story, awesome character designs (espeically the holographs), and a heck of a lot of emotion. I am definitely going to look for more games made by DONTNOD. (Btw Jax and Nilin were precious together.)			"

												This game is just 'okay.' The plot is a little bit dry, the battles are repetetive, and completing the game didn't feel very satisfying. I give this a 5/10; a solid middle game to kill some time. I kept playing hoping something would change to make it more apealing to me, but it never really happened due to the fact I am stuck fighting the same enemies over and over with very little variance in combat methods.Essentially, as soon as I beat the game, I uninstalled it. There is no real replay value in the game so I would only recommend a purchase if this game is on sale. I could see some people enjoying this game, but this just isn't for me. "

												A bad case of Alzheimers.Anywho lets get into this review of Remember Me.In Remember Me you play as a character named Nilin, who has lost her memory and must retain them and bring down the Memorize Corporation with the help of a mysterious asset named Edge.To be quite frankly honest, Nilin herself isn't really an interesting character, she seems quite bland and boring for my personal taste. Some characters you meet along the way are far more interesting such as Olga Sedova (Interesting Fact: Olga's Character model was tweaked to become Victoria from ""Life is Strange"") anywho she just like Tommy, Bad Request, are Interesting characters whom you don't get much background from, and sadly they only make very few appearances, although they are your allies, only Edge whom you don't see phsically is in constant contact with you.The story itself is interesting, I liked the idea of a world where Memories were bought and sold, even stolen or wiped. It was an interesting concept that I enjoyed, and It made me wonder how it became to be and what would happen when we brought down the Memorize Corporation, will everyone be restored to Normal? or will we all have lost memories. The Story is interesting enough to keep you going from Chapter to Chapter, making you discover whats happening next. It was also nice to see throughout the game the restoration of Nillin's memory, slowly getting to know yourself again, before your memory was wiped, there was one major plot twist that I enjoyed but ill let you discover that on your own.The setting was perfect, the ""Neo Paris"" fit perfect to the theme at hand. From the  slums to the high class Neo Paris was an interesting place to explore.Gameplay, well to be quite frankly honest the combat got a bit repetative and at time it was annoying remember combos which you must land perfectly or you won't get your combo buffs. The enemy were pretty simple to kill, only the invisible lurkers were completely obnoxious (I hate invisible enemies). One other annoying factor is when your combo breaks (which will happen alot), when you fight a large group of enemies and your doing your combo, they hit you once and your combo breaks and you must start again, really irritating. The parkour is pretty fun though, jumping around and grabbing onto ledges and items.In the end I would say this game is ""Mediocre"" its not Good but its not bad either its average. I enjoyed playing it but did get to a point where I just wanted to finish and get it over and done with, but overall its a decent game.I would highly recommend buying this on sale, and not at the full retail price.

Proper Cyberpunk storyline that could have been written by William Gibson or Neal Stephenson, it's well voice acted which really fleshes out the story nicely. The game has some really nice features that make it stand out such as the ability to edit memories or load different modules in and out of your combat abilities mid-fight.			"

												Well, that… certainly was a game! I’ve read that a number of people didn’t like the story or dialogue, and I completely disagree; those were easily the strongest points of the game and were done really well! … but that’s just it; there’s no real game to support it or any kind of increasing difficulty paced throughout the game, and the memory remixing is incredibly underutilized for what was advertised as one of the most interesting gameplay features… then there’s the two number/letter combination puzzles towards the end of the game that I had to actually look up the answers for because they were stumping me.Man, the combat in particular… it makes you feel like you’re going to get a whole ton of combos to perform with all kinds of neat attack variations and types to use that will really liven up the combat, but then it really is just as little as you’re actually shown when you first go that menu. Not to mention the parkour given in an incredibly restrictive and linear world where you’re mostly just trapped in a bunch of corridors and narrow alleys.I guess I’d rather that Remember Me was a film instead…? It had such an emphasis on story to the point you’re not given any means to skip cutscenes even when you replay the game that it just reeks of the guys really wanting to do a film then deciding to just have it as a game at the last minute of the group meeting to get the idea off the ground.Shame I can’t say the gameplay’s even as fun as Ace Attorney, which says quite a ton.

												I find Remember Me has quite a unique plot, with plot twists that you won't really see coming, definately set apart from the others in the market currently. Nilin, the main character, is quite interesting and her monolouges inbetween chapters do give you an insight into her personality.Graphics wise and visually speaking, it can be quite beautiful at times and alot of detail has been put in. I especially love how your Sensen displays certain things, such as a shop's opening time or a cafe's menu when you go near it, yes not a core part of the gameplay but well executed and thought out and adds to the futuristic feel.Combat wise, you really have to plan your combos for fight and on occasion pause and rearrange them to suit the situation, for example add more healing Pressens, since you're about to die. It also pays to learn the combos and not click the mouse buttons like a madman, I realised this after my first death early on. The downside is that the combat can be somwhat... floaty I suppose as sometimes I dodge the wrong way or attack an unintended target, which makes me think perhaps a controller was intended for this game, which is annoying for PC and keyboard users as the WASD keys do not do diagonal. The camera can also be annoying at times if you are moving around a lot during a fight.The enemies have a good variety, in that as you move along, new enemies are introduced. For example Nilin's stun move won't work on certain enemies. Some will hold a shield that you must destroy first, or you have to defeat it's supporters so they become vulnerable. It does pay to check their codex to see what works as trial and error can be somewhat tedious and means you die alot.It's also a shame that there are not more memory remix events as they are quite intriguing and it is interesting to see how moving one little thing can create an entirely different memory. Overall it's really the combat that let's this game down due it's issues with the keyboard.I'd recommed playing it but perhaps get it during a sale at a good reduced price			"

												Good game. The art direction is phenomenal. The voice acting and presenation are great, and the story and characters were pretty good. I had a good time playing through it, and a single playthrough on normal was about 8 hours. It's not a difficult game, but still fun. If you're looking for a game with an interesting story and setting, and not something particularily challenging, I'd definitely check this out.The gameplay itself is probably the weakest point, although not necessarily bad. The game has a unique (albeit a bit underutilized) combo system, and the memory 'remixing' is also neat (but again-- underutilized). The controls are all responsive, and the combat is fluid and functional.Not a whole lot of replay value unless you're an achievement hunter, or if you want to play through the campaign again on a harder difficulty.

Still has a game-breaking bug though, in whatever's causing it to freeze in the middle of cutscenes and the ♥♥♥♥ing final boss (the fix is to play in windowed mode and watch the final boss in youtube 9_9).Most of the non-gameplay elements are solid, though.

												A beautiful game. The concept is unique and the story telling makes you want to continue playing. The combat system is implemented well and does have unique elements to it. There are different types of attacks that do different  actions. For instance, you have attacks, when connceted, heal you. You have attacks that will decrease your cooldown for special attacks and so on. The combat is very smooth. A good parallel would be the combat from the Batman Arkham games but with more customization. The graphics are beautiful and really rich in atmosphere. I really had no complaints with them. Speaking of atmosphere, there are little things, such as retractng shop signs when you get close to them and little packs you can collect to learn more about the history that really enhance the game.Audio is amazing. Voice acting is done well and you can really feel the emotions in the characters.I read people had issues with the controls. I played with the XBOX 360 controller and had no issues. I don't know how the controls are on the keyboard, but I've heard that people have played it with mouse and keyboard without issues. Try both options if you can.The storyline is what kept me playing through this game. There were just so many questions that needed to be answered and the game does wrap it up nicely in the end. The whole concept of memory management is amazing and implemented nicely in memory remixes, where you alter the memory of an individual. I don't want to ruin anything by saying more but the whole concept is flat out amazing and different.Buy this game. It borrows elements from other games but also implements its own to provide an amazing package. We need more unique games like this and it all begins when you support them. Truly worth playing from every angle.P.S: It took me ~11 hours to complete the game but there is reason to go back, such as finding all the 'culture' packs and other collectibles.			"

												This game tries really hard to bring new ideas and an interesting world to a somewhat played-out plot concept, but it gets a little ahead of itself in doing so... The combat tries to emulate that of the Batman: Arkham series, but doesn't feel anywhere as fluid or dynamic, and ends up being a bit clonky and stiff. On top of that, it tries to introduce a ""combo-construction"" system so you can engineer your own fighting style, but it's more like a ""matching shape"" puzzle, because it doesn't give you as much freedom as it should. However, while the combat is unrefined, there is a feature of the game that is truly breath-taking and original, and that's the ""Memory Alteration"". Your character has the ability to alter another's memory by going in their head, finding a certain memory, and altering certain elements to change the overall outcome. This was a really interesting mechanic that I'd not seen before, and was legitimately surprised by how original this was. To be honest, I would play this game, and give it a much better review if the game focused more on this! Unfortunately this whole mechanic is shoved to the side to make way for the flawed combat. If they rereleased this game and made it more like Heavy Rain, or Beyond: Two Souls, I'd be more inclined to continue the story. Unfortunately I'm kinda dissuaded by the other gaming elements borrowed from other games that did it way better, and I can't bring myself to push through what feels like chore-work just to get to the Memory Alteration fleshy meat that the game should've stuck closer to.

This is a really fun 3rd person fighter/adventure game.  The story, world/environment, and the combo system are what keep this game going.  The graphics are beautiful and the story is original.ProsExcellent graphics.  The game looks very nice.  Additionally, the game supports 144hz.  The world is vibrant and beautiful, despite being a dystopian future.  Many of us are tired of ugly dark games.  Just because the world is in trouble doesn’t mean it has to be ugly.The story is really original and interesting.  Once I started playing I would be hooked for the rest of the day.At first, the combo system was a little confusing to me.  After a couple hours I figured out what was going on and really loved it.The game works well with a controller or a mouse.  Steam controller works well if you switch the left trackpad to a fast trackball, or use my public controller config.The game is very stable, no bugs or glitches.QTE aren’t as fast as BF3’s story mode.  They seemed to be well placed IMO>The memory editing is a really cool idea.The game has mixed different mechanics together to create a great final product that is completely unique.No loading screens; though the game may stutter a little while it loads the next area.ConsThe camera is really annoying!  One of the problems is that camera speed is dependent on how large your environment is.  In a narrow hallway the camera will move at the pace of a snail, if you are out in the open it turns into a whirlwind.  There are a lot of little details in the story that don’t make 100% sense or perhaps just isn’t very genuine.  But overall, the story is very enjoyable and fun to play through.My biggest complaint with the story is the setting in Paris France.  It seems like the least likely place in the world to leave sick people in a sub-human slum while the rich get richer.The final boss battle and the ending of the game was a big let down for me.The pre-rendered cinematic scenes look much worse than what my computer can produce.

												For all you who are reading before playing the game, I will keep this short and simple.  I may just be a sucker for these kinds of games, but I realy enjoyed almost everything about the game.   Sure, it graphics may not be the best when you compair them to newer games, but the compelling story makes up for this minor loss.  Also, the combat system is outstandingly fluid, which caught me off gaurd initially.  Istead of just slugging it out mashing buttons, the game requires you to use combos to win and dodging to survive. One minor nagitive I can see it that the story jumps in time a bit, some times skipping a month in between chapters.  If this doesn't bother you then yes, defenintly get the game.			"

												Lets be real - I'd buy this game even if it was crap because it was a woman of color protag. But it wasn't crap! It was actually a lot of fun, with a story that (while not flawless) was quite good. The combat can be simplistic if you want to play it that way, but taking full advantage of the combo builder system keeps things interesting. I really only have two major complaints. First off, certain key battles end in quick-time events that, if you don't manage to pull them off, will kick you back into the fight with the boss having regened that bit of their health so you have to beat them down again. After the second or third time you fail a QTE this gets REALLY annoying. Second, I thought the plot had more potential than where it actually went. Aside from that it was a solid and fun game with cool action and did not overstay its welcome.			"

												What a great gem. The combat system is nice because it lets you customize your combos. Using different ""nodes"" you chain together effects to make combos that will heal you more or maybe have an extra amount hitting force with each punch/kick. It's a shame that the memory mini-games did not happen as often as I would have hoped, but when they so up it's cool to see all the diffent possibilities.What makes this game for me though is the story and the setting it takes place in. Visually, Remember Me is amazing. The future Paris landscape looks beautiful and believable. The story shows a tragic result of what might happen when our memories are not really our own anymore. I saw what was happening to people, and wanted to stop that. Pick this game up!			"

												This game is awesome!The combat style is great, you can build several combos all by yourself and use them in fights. The music is absolutely amazing! Love the soundtrack. The music in combat differs based on your style, so the better you fight, the better music you get. It really drives you in the game.The story itself is great (but sad). The main character (Nilin) is perfect, I loved her the whole story.The only bad thing about this game is it's linearity, you have very little possibility to explore the locations...But it's really a great game which I would recommend to play. For me it's 9/10 (-1 point for the linearity).			"

												Remember Me is a strange mixture of Batman Arkham (the fighting), Tomb Rider (the jumping), Portal (the puzzles and sometimes environments) and Bioshock (the distinct world and atmosphere) with a touch of Chris Nolan's Inception.You play as Nilin, a memory hunter - able to enter the head of any person and remix their memories, changing this very person forever. The setting is NeoParis, year 2084. The design and detalis are amazing - from claustrophobic, futuristic corridors to beautiful vistas that blend classical architecture with neo skyscrapers, you will discover every flavor of NeoParis, even though the path is always straightforward and linear. The story is gripping and mature. The feel of the game and the concept alone are the reasons to play this title. Remember Me has its flaws - the pontential of the game is not really realized and the borrowed elements from the abovementioned games are sometimes poorly executed, but not to the point where it ruins the experience.Unfortunately, the price tag feels a bit inadequate - the game was a pleasure to play, interrupted by several nuisances here and there, nevertheless, worth half the current price. I recommend Remember Me, but grab it while it's on sale.PS.Oh, I just noticed the game is 28€, not 50€ as it used to be. Well, I guess it's worth it.			"

												After playing Tomb Raider, I was looking for another game sort of like it. Found this one. Good game.  As I am not really good at combos, etc, I had a bit of trouble at first, but after playing it thru a couple of times, I've gotten used to the controls. (I use a Windows X-BOX 360 myself as I'm right handed but control the mouse with my left hand and that causes some problems with KB use.) Camera is a bit of a mess at times, especially if your next to a wall in a fight. Also for me I had to adjust to the timing a bit on my combos as I'm not very good at timing my button pushes. Graphics are great and game play really sucks you in which to me determines how much replay a game has. I noted what seems to be a minor item on the two mourners fight on Ep. 7. It has on two occassions on my system, as it kicked me out of the fight before I finished. I didn't ""die"" just got credit for finishing it. (There's nothing like walking all around guys trying to kill you as you leave the room unhurt.....interesting. Not knocking it as I has getting my rear kicked the first time it happpened anyway....) If you like third person games with a female lead, then you should like this game.			"

												Kinda like a mix between Deus Ex Human Rev and Batman Arkham Asylum, solid but not as good as either of those in gameplay terms. Interesting story, strong visuals and imaginativeness but a real lack of interaction with both the environments and many of it's hinted inhabitants. As for the core dynamics, the core idea is great (remix memories) but happens few and far and when it does is far too linear to hold you (imagine if you were able to remix / change memories of any inhabitants you found the street to help you progress, now that would have been awesome).Even in terms of the many climbing sections in the game your very much restricted and spoon feed the way (this is the free-flowing climbing you may be use to or expect due to the likes of Assassins Creed series.Giving it a 6.5 / 10 overall due to bugs (had to replay a boss due to not being able to progress without all the minions out the way first, nearly got uninstalled there and then), the heavy linear nature and lack of interaction / exploration when such great art is on display. The strenghs come in the solid Batman-like free-flow combat (although not as good), wonderous visuals and strong story, worth it on a discount for sure.			"

												I really enjoyed this game. It is a little unpolished, but the combat is not nearly as bad as some reviews led me to believe going in. It is a little awkward at first, but once you get the hang of it it's pretty fun, and the strategizing can be satisfying. The platforming is pretty simple but benefits from its simplicity by not being infuriating. The game isn't overly difficult on normal, which is good because it prevents disruption of the story, but it does provide a challenge in some of the battles. My only real complaint was that the camera is a bit clunky. If you're into cyberpunk, or even just future noir/dystopian stories, this is a good one.			"

												I cautiously recommend this game.  The story is interesting, but unremarkable, in contrast to the graphics which are impressive, but underservered by the very linear levels.  The game has a nice variety of enemies, of varying [imposed] difficulties, that seem to exist more to draw out the limited gameplay, rather than as a real challenge (I'm looking at you Elite Enforcer!).  But it is the controls that will be your greatest foe in this game.  They are, at best, dodgy, and at worst (particularily when trying to target a particular enemy with ranged attacks), unresponsive.  Boss fights will require a peek at a walkthrough to understand what you are supposed to be doing, but it's the mass fights in increasingly confined spaces that will cause you to walk away from the game, thanks to the inaccuracy of the controls.  The idea of remixing memories is interesting, but only occurs a few times in the game, and is as logical as a '90s Sierra game, and will probably come down to trying random combinations, or just looking at a walkthough.It's not a bad game, but has too many problems to be more than a decent game.   Buy it on a sale if the graphics appeal to you.			"

												Hey, if you are looking for a game with amazing graphics without  a great graphics card. Here it is. Amazing story, amazing concept, amazing concept and way too much more. Make your own combos. You know what, you look on a trailer, you see the graphics and decide for yourself. I can't say much without spoiling it because it is story and combat based. Here it goes.You are in ""Neo-Paris"" A new paris. A device has been made by a company. This allows you to transfer memories from bad to good to others (You cant do this without the story). You can remix memories to make people do certain things to manipulate them to your advantage. This is an amazing game and something to show I like it so much is that I am writing this on new years day 2:40 in the morning.Happy gaming, I recommend this to the highest :D			"

												This game is really, really good fun. The fluid, graceful chaining of moves and dodging feels very tight. I'm not having any difficulty playing this with mouse and keys, but some may prefer the controller. First boss battle was not overly difficult, but challenging enough to feel a sense of triumph when succeeding.The environment is stunning. Rich, full of detail and ambiance. The pace of the story is good, I'm only a few hours in as of this writing and I feel drawn in. The first ""re-write"" of a persons memory...what a great way to handle it. From the mouse input feeling so natural to ""scrub"" through the memory timeline, to the great visuals...very well done.Traversing the environment is not anything super-amazing, but it's well done enough and handled decently. Your moves are executed confidently and appear natural and smooth. This is not ""Mirror's Edge"" so don't expect over-the-top parkour. Your acrobatic moves during combat will make up for it.Combat may at first appear shallow, but there is some depth to be found for the patient seeker. Finding your pace and timing in combat feels really good when you get into the groove. Evading, flipping over an opponent to continue a chain, rapidly switching targets to maintain control all feel rewarding. Winning a fight against multiple opponents feels like an accomplishment, not just the result of random button mashing.I always reccomend watching gameplay videos and watching/reading plenty of reviews before making a decision to purchase. Chances are, if you like the dystopian/cyberpunk genre, this game will appeal to you.It goes without saying, people are different, they like different things. Some will hate this game, some will love it and others will be ambivalent. I can only say that I'm having a lot of fun playing it, and I think it's an experience worth your time and money. Some may disagree, but in my opinion this game is an underrated gem and I'm glad I picked it up.Thanks for reading, and Good Gaming.			"

												its a very good concept for a game, however the implimentation leaves something to be desired, particularly in respect of the gameplay of the main character.  I've found the combat to be clunky, unresponsive and, frankly, a total pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ not sure how this game was tested, but I hope it wasn't on, ""the best gaming keyboard money can buy"", cause that should be an advantage, not a pre-requisit.  some of the fight AI is so poorly conceived its frustrating as hell.  if they could patch this game to make it more responsive.  The problem lies in how the enemies attack, in that some of them can just appear in front of you, and they do, and you pretty much have to constantly dodge to avoid them, while trying to get the hang of the key combos for the stupid ""pressen"" ( fight combo) system. keeping an eye on so many things, I'm not sure I've ever completed one of my pressens more than three times, and those will have been flukes. please do something to make this game work smoothly, its a bit like kite flying on crocodile island.

Admittedly sometimes hunting for those little upgrades to your abilities feels more tedious for how easy it is than helpful, but in the end thats my only gripe about the game. Ultimately the game has one minor Con but many amazing and wonderful Pros.If you love a game for its story, Remember Me is a story worth remembering, and one I'm sure I'll never forget.However if you prefer a game for its gameplay itself and lack a desire for any story, then the game may not wow you as it has me. With combat similar to the Arkham series with splashes of Spiderman-esque combo's thrown in, the combat is not revolutionary but will in fact be great to try on your way through this adventure.I give this game my rating of: Finish It			"

Imperfect and UnderratedFrench studio Dontnod's first game is full of wonderful design, fun combat, strong themes, a decent but spotty plot, and a handful of minor annoyances. Apparently those minor annoyances were enough to drop its Metacritic rating all the way to 65, and unfortunately that fact will keep a lot of people who should be playing this game from giving it a shot.The game looks beautiful. While it's clearly influenced by other visions of the future, everything from Minority Report to Deus Ex, the futuristic version of Paris has enough touches here and there to make it memorable. The combat also wears its influences, the Arkham games mostly, proudly on its sleeve, but the rhythym of them is a little bit different. It's not a game-changer, certainly, but it's enough to carry a 10-hour action game. At times, you will stumble into some frustrations. For example, the screen gets so busy during most boss battles it becomes difficult to tell what's happening. But I tend to be forgiving of these decisions for a first time developer.The plot left me with a lot of questions at the end. Mostly not the good kind. There are more than a few character motivations that still don't make much sense to me. But the overarching theme, that making peace with painful memories makes us better people in the end, is a powerful one. It's just a pity that the game never gets the chance to get into the moral problems with your character ""remixing"" people's memories, but it is an action game and we've got to keep things moving.Between this and Life Is Strange, Dontnod has quickly moved up high on my list of studios to watch. If nothing else, I have to admire the bravery of developers that genre hop and try to put out clever and original ideas with each new release.			"

												Remember Me would have made a better movie than a game.Honestly, it's a well-crafted game. There's really almost no aspect of the game that was done poorly. Except... every aspect of the game is independent of each other. The story, the combat, the art, the level design, the world. It felt like a AAA title, not an immersive experience in Neo-Paris. Rather than thinking about the themes presented by the game, I felt myself thinking about the corporate atmosphere the game was made in. It's a shame, because the story is really good, the combat is interesting(it needs work to become more fluid, but the concept of building your own combos is super cool), the visuals are exactly what they need to be, the level design...is actually pretty mediocre, but there's nothing terrible about it, and the world is, well, it was obviously a passion project, and it shows. But none of it fits together like it should. I got the sense of being handed off from one department of design to the next during gameplay; you navigate the parkour-based level, then suddenly it would stop and you're in a combat sequence, and the combat wouldn't utilize the level design at all, you're just in a mechanically boring arena. Then you finish beating everyone up and you go up a ladder, and the camera angle changes to show off a stunning vista. Then there's a cutscene or bit of dialog and you get some story. Rinse, wash, repeat, and repeat, and repeat.Also, the controls really need work.			"

												Story: 9/10 It has a very interesting feel to it and very unique. only problem the linear feel for a game that could of been wonderful with a muiltiple choice in paths, being that altering memories is what this games main focus is. Gameplay: 5/10got stuck a couple times, and after playing on the hardest mode, i felt like the whole game was a tutorial with pop ups that i had to wait or couldnt find a way to disable. paths only have 1 route and when you want to explore for the collectibles, they are not even 20 feet from where the hint is. very hand holding. Sound: 9.8/10I love the theme of the music as it gets glitchy and matches the fights very nicely, Only issue is the sudden drop of ALL audio 2% of the time. which does start back up. Visuals: 11/10DAMN. I spend more time walking in the game then running. Not because the game forces, but because i want to take in all of that detail. Only problem was Most of the game blocks off some exploration so looking at every bit of distances and detail was limited because i had to get on with the story.Overall: 8/10I wouldnt buy it at base price, but the game has alot of love in it, the only problem is the handhold got out of hand it felt more like make or break. would reccommend, just watch out for the non spoiler detail i listed above.

												While this could be longer and less linear, it exceeds in having one of the best stories ever told in a video game. The memory remixing is mind-blowing and so are the graphics. Combat is fun and not repetitive because of combos with different effects that can be customized to one's own preferences. The soundtrack is also really good, but the story is the best part about the game.I would have preferred it to be longer and have more interactivity. You can't interact with much in the city, which is sad because the world is very rich in detail. Also, more memory remixing would be good.			"

												Shall we call this Dontnod's forgotten adventure? :DRemember Me has a lot going for it. and not much against.A slick, 3rd person beat'em up combined with a good voice cast and a story that wishes to be something new.let me give you the break down.Pros: - Graphics, smooth, good looking. crafted with love.  - Environments. same as above. good level structure, entertaining to traverse. - characters. the ones' that actually talk to you are well voiced, memorable and well done visually - combat. build your own combo, something I have always enjoyed, with free flowing combat a'la Prince of Persia: The Warrior Within (sorry, Arkham series, but we all know who really came up with that) - memory alteration. fun little minigame.Cons: - lack of diverse enemies - story is not all that original - lack of interaction ... the game feels 'on rails' most of the time.Verdict: Remember Me is the equivalence of a really well done Sci-Fi TV miniseries. it won't blow your mind, but it will keep you hooked and entertained, despite its little flaws.The grand scenario is served with a cast of good characters and above par voice acting and world design. If you enjoy your Sci-Fi with a bit of a fist to the face, this is a title that will deliver.Sale or no sale, this game delivers on its price			"

												TL,DR: While Remember Me is definitely a bit rough around the edges, it delivers on an interesting story, and generally enjoyable gameplay.First, the rough patches: the controls are sluggish and unreliable (though usually not to a game breaking extent), every five minutes you'll have to drop everything you're doing to listen to someone force feed you another chunk of exposition, there are times when the audio just cuts out for no reason (on my machine Alt-Tabbing out and then back in fixed this), the camera occasionally points in entirely the wrong direction for you to see what you're doing, and parts of the level/game design can be fairly unintuitive.Next, the redeeming qualities: level design as far as the general atmosphere is fantastic at communicating the feel of the city of Neo-Paris and the fictional times in which the game is set, memory remixing is a blast (it's like a choose your own adventure version of a cutscene), the overall plot is compelling and definitely takes a few exciting turns.Last, what this game is not: if you're really into TPS combat games like Devil May Cry (or even just Legend of Kora) Remember Me's combat system will leave you sorely disappointed at it's repetitive and surprisingly inflexible nature, if you really enjoyed free climbing as found in Assassin's Creed (or even Splinter Cell) you should remember that no matter how it looks Remember Me only doesn't have a free climbing system, it has one that only let's you travel on very specific routes that aren't necessarily obvious to the casual observer.So, do I recommend this game? It's definitely worth a look for the story and the developers deserve to be supported for the thought and innovation they put into the remixing mechanic. Is this a particularly good game? If you aren't bothered by it's flaws and limitations, it's a pretty enjoyable experience, otherwise I recommend waiting to pick it up when it's on sale.			"

												Well the game was good, wish it was longer than a 10 hour game to beat. Good plot and in game styling that kept me interested throughout. Wish it was a little more evolved with movement from area to area and combat variety. Some of the game play was too much of a tomb raider style that really didn’t fit with the plot (note it did work well in parts, just too much jump to that ledge climb up that wall type). Combat in game was enjoyable but lacked variations in adversaries; you see one more than likely you’ll see it again later in greater numbers.  (These comments are notable but didn’t detract from game play enjoyment.)Over all I would recommend this game to others for an action and story based game. "

												Surprisingly good game.I don't know what I expected...  I'd heard of the title, but not really looked into it much.  But it was on sale, and the video looked good, so I gave it a try.  And I was amazed.The gameplay consists primarily of well-paced platforming.  Lots of scrambling across ledges and jumping across gaps...  But it's not normally so hurried that you can't stop to take a look around.  And exploration is rewarded.The exploration and platforming is punctuated by some terrific combat.  Lots of one-versus-many battles.  The ability to customize your own combos leads to some interesting experimentation.  And some of the enemies require unique approaches.What really makes this game, however, is the storytelling.Nilin, Edge, Scylla, Charles, and the city of Neo-Paris are all vibrantly alive.  Living, breathing, feeling creations easily on-par with anything Hollywood has turned out in the last couple of years.  Imperfect characters with believable motivations occupying a world that's being torn-apart by its addiction to voluntary amnesia.I was genuinely surprised by this game.  One of the better titles I've played in the last few years. "

												Story 3.5/5 - Good but not in love with.Universe 2/5 - You have to read the some of the collectable to really understand this and that about the world. Concepts you could not get from just playing the game.Characters 2/5 - They play the part, all two of them. They try to shroud them in mystery but at the end I ended up not caring about either after each and every 'reveal'. Though the first reveal/twist was spot on, but downhill from there.Combat 4/5 -  Can be Glitchy at times, definity when aiming with your gun but has a nice flow and progessively harder.Puzzels 3/5 - Decent enough, but don't over think them.Controls 4/5 - Their were a few rough patches but over all good.Map design 3/5 - Their are four groups of Collectionable in the game, two of them they give hints but the last you need to pay attention. The Buffs collectable they give hints but if you go look around and accentently go to the next room, too bad for you. The last one has the most of them and doesn't do much of anything once got. The Parcore is nice but it is always one pathway and it tries to help you with little notifcations with those singlier path.			"

												TL; DR: Buy it on sale. I would recommend any price ~$15 or lower (I got it for $12.50) if you like good stories or beat-em-ups.For those inclined to actually read into the details, I enjoyed this game, but let me get into why:This game is in fact a beat-em-up. Not so much in the vein of the recent Batman games, but the combat is at least a little less vanilla than batman.During combat, Nilin (the protagonist) has combos that she uses to take down enemies. The lower level enemies can be simply taken down with basic combos, but different levels of commanders normally accompany these grunts. Most of the commanders cannot be taken down directly and most of the time require a little bit of ingenuity to dispatch using Nilin's Sensen abilities. In short, when she fights or gets hit she gains focus meter (very similar to meter found in most fighting games) that allows her to do very strong abilities to help eliminate enemies. Most of the first playthrough you'll be using these on a *need* basis moreso than out of convience. However, you can upgrade the amount of meter you can hold and thus allows you to speed up progress. On this subject, you'll be fighting one of about 5-6 kinds of bosses, most of which can be eliminated using the same tactics. Two pairs of bosses you'll fight will be identical--they can be eliminated exactly the same. It is a little stale, but there's about 8 boss battles, so you're not missing out on too much.Most of the bosses do require a certain combonation of abilities and moves. Don't be worried if you cannot figure out the formula as the game will happily point out an exploit, and you can go on your merry way.The story is nice: it's not going to be the next Hollywood film or anything but there were a couple of twists in there that were appreciated. The story did seem to drag on towards mission 7 (out of 8) but quickly picked up for the final mission.Hidden items: There are a few. One of them increases health and is quite common while the other increases the meter mentioned earlier. The last is nonbenificial and is a hidden item for the sake of being a hidden item.Overall: It's an RPG meant for the modern crowd. I would sort of compare it to the latest Deus Ex in that it is dumbed down quite a bit but unlike Deus Ex this game is stupidly linear. This game was a fun experience: since I just completed my first playthrough I plan on gettng the hidden items and then leaving the game alone. I would expect ~15 hours after all unlockables and that should be that. TL; DR #2: Buy it for cheap. Good, but not exceptional. "

I really enjoyed this game from start to finish. also although the graphical fidelity was a little lackluster the art around it was nothing short of spectaular.

												I really wanted to like this game. The environments look beautiful, and beg to be explored. I particularly liked the ""memories that were left behind"" that pointed to pickups. However, all the work that was put into creating a really captivating world is not enough to overshadow how stale moving across it feels. I've never had a problem with non-open (linear) worlds, but this game felt like a corridor. There is only ever one path to get from point A to B, and the parkour / wall scaling movement is very stiff and chunky. The best way I can describe moving towards the next objective is ""tedious"", and I was always looking forward to when I would be interrupted by a cut-scene. That being said, even the story felt like it was on rails, with multiple opportunities being presented where you were led to believe you might get to make a meaningful choice, but ultimately the game will always steer you towards, and wait for you to push the right buttons to keep you on track. I would have loved to be able to decide to not remix some characters, or to have a few possible results, however insignificant, but no such luck.Combat felt promising, but ultimately didn't deliver. The pressen combo system seemed interesting, but I didn't seem to have enough pressen to actually use all (4) combos? This led to me filling up two (and later 3) combos, a short combo that refreshed cooldowns that I would basically spam due to a lack of alternatives, and a longer 8-hitter (to get dat sweet combo bonus XP) that I never used since any hit taken will interrupt the chain, and fights are mostly comprised of swarms of weak enemies that surround you. The focused based abilities were cool but not always super useful (with even the lower tier enemies becoming immune to some of them later on).The most interesting part of the game to me were the remixes. Although mechanically very simple, it was fun to explore all the different paths you could take through someone's memory by altering subtle things. The first remix you complete really gives you a feeling of ""wow, this is some pretty crazy stuff"", as the result leads to a completely different interaction with the remixed character. I think the game missed the boat by not making these sequences, and the associated moral questions (""Is it right to re-write someone?"") the main focus of the game.Overall, I feel Remember Me is a game that got caught up in trying to be to many things at once. The resulting gameplay is sub-par to mediocre at best, with an accompanying story that feels cliché and is filled with characters that you'll be left wondering if you should have remembered (haha get it?). If you stripped away the bland combat, the tedious ""parkour"" map traversal and focused on the story, it could have been a solid adventure game.			"

Or they can end up doing a ""mirrors edge"" where we dont get a sequal instead get an origins story of how nilin got into being a memory hunter.

It's a bit a shame to have such talented art people and then put everything in such a bad game play.+ Story: It is interesting. Later on it is a bit questionable, the whole reason for the story is on a shaky ground (changing humanity because mami lost a limb).+ Mixing Thoughts: While an interesting idea it get's also tedious to solve this kind of riddles. Mixing thoughts would lead to ambiguities in real world, E.g. the story with Olga doesn't IMO make sense (she should get money for killing someone, I assume her principal would have asked her why she failed). Imagine a game were all the possibilities would lead to a another ending. I fail to understand why game designers almost never incorporate some choice which have consequences which are only seen later. Normally you see the consequence immediately and if you're not happy you just reload (which could be so easily avoided with the idea mentioned). But in this game you have no choices. So no worries to miss anything.- Extremely Linear. There are no options in almost any aspect of this game (just how to choose your combos). Level design is very linear and it is basically: now press this, now press that. Fights are only at predefined locations. If you see a ledge which you could use at your advantage, forget it. You can only climb things foreseen by the designer. Sometime you can jump on a simple container, most often you cannot.- Keyboard Support: The first boss is trivial, but I had to go through the finishing scene 4 times until I realized what the icons to finally finish him means. I'm not sure if this is a console port, but it definitely looks like one.- Simplistic Characters: Most protagonist, beside Nilin, are uninteresting.- Climbing: At first interesting, but get's very tedious and just: follow the yellow markers... and only the markers. Every wrong jump ends in death (thanks to zillions of save points it doesn't matter).			"

												Remember Me... oh... the potential is so totally there, and just barely misses it. The graphics are fairly well done, the story is multidimensional and rich, the combat and advancement system is pretty good. The mood, the music and the scenery all works of art in a noir-thriller kinda way. But the repitition in the short time that I played this game made me stop playing. The going from engagement to engagement and having to hit the same sequence again and again, and not messing up or losing my combo which was the only way to get something more exciting that kick kick punch going on, killed my enthusiasm. This is one of those hate to hate it games... because it is really a good work of art over all... and if you have more patience than I do, and don't mind a bit of repition in your game, then please do go for it. This is a good buy, but just in case you're on the fence, wait til its on sale. :) then you can still recommend it to others if you get a little short in the collar.			"

												I liiiike this game. I didnt trust it so much, but now that I own it and I've been playing itI find it stunning. It has Nice graphics a good optimization, You get to see a really good visual style with no mounstrous processor nor graphic card. I also found that the soundtrack really suits this game, and the voice acting is nice to hear. Well, the story is actually intesesting, or thats at least what i think. The gameplay, it's balanced, you run then you fight, run and fight and then you sneak into someone's mind, that's what I found interesting, I like finding every piece of mind, every object I can see to see the result of changing one simple thing, finding the bug is satisfying.I would give it a 8 out of 10, cuz even tho it's a good game, it's not perfect, plus some parts... just some parts are kind of boring or repetive (it's something that every game has tho so it's not a major problem)			"

												Fews games have a distinct sense of style, Remember Me is one of them.  The environments and charater design both serve to strengthen the story rather than distract from it.  The story itself is incredibly enganging, a sci-fy or tech noir tale that leads to a satisfying conclussion.The game play works well, even though if it is not my prefered style of games.  It feels and performs like a console game and I was glad that I had a controller to enjoy it.  I would guess that keyboard and mouse would be less enjoyable.  At times the battles in the game tended toward lasting too long and I would say that, at times, they felt a bit tedious.  Boss battles also suffered from the same problem.  It took work to figure what was the correct strategy for some of the big fights.  Then it took practice to be able to execute the strategy successfully.These negative points however, were not enough to detract from what was a memorable gaming experience.  Take the time to discover this game and emerse yourself in this dark future Paris.			"

												Remember Me feels like the sort of game Luc Besson would make where he to move into the industry. It's stylish, moves at a brisk pace (7 hours to complete unless your trophy hunting) and is well designed. Neo Paris is beautifully realized and combat, which sits somewhere just south of the Batman games is balletic, frenetic and fluid with a heavy dash of Future tech for good measure. New mechanics are introduced each level to keep things interesting. It has it faults as well though. It is very linear and but for the main character everyone else is very roughly sketched out. It's not really that hard even on it's highest setting and the climbing sections of the game are ok, very reminiscent of Prince of Persia but nothing to write home about.It won't be the best game you will ever play but it has a strong story, a great female protagonist at the helm, Fantastic motion captured movement, fun boss fights and the memory sections are original. I would recommend this game.			"

												I fell in love with this game from the very beginning. I entered Remember Me knowing next to nothing about it, which was intentional because the game begins with the protagonist losing all of her memory. I love the amount of detail poured into the world, and the prologue immediately demonstrates what I mean. The story is unique and highly thought-provoking, and leads to unique gameplay and pretty fun combat. The soundtrack is among the greatest I've heard, with a superb blend of orchestral and electronically altered score.The game has minor flaws, but nothing noteworthy, as otherwise I'd actually be able to think of them. I'm sure people whined about the linearity, but I honestly enjoy linear games, especially if they're intended to tell a specific story.I got my money's worth. Some people probably wouldn't care for this game, but I loved it.			"

												A beautiful, highly under-rated cyber game that has one of the best video game storylines I've ever played. For anyone to lazy to read: BUY THIS GAMERemember Me takes place in the cyberpunk city of Neo-Paris and shows a wonderful disparity between the rich upper class with their robot servants, and tall shiny towers and the citizens of the slums leaving with the constant threat of mutant attacks. The world is fleshed out by journal entries one may find while exploring the game's mostly linear world, and these entries are fun to read and collect if you're into lore. If not, the game is pretty and has a simplistic but fun combat system.While the game came out in 2013 the graphics were bleeding edge back then, and despite a few low-res textures, Neo Paris is still beautiful to this day. There are some wonderful lighting effects, reflective water, cool rain effects, and just general eye candy.The protagonist is a young woman named Nilin who was imprisoned and has had her memories stolen. she manages to escape from the prison with the aid of a resistance fighter. She then joins the resistance, desperate to get her memories back, and begins fighting mutants and robots and big burly guards. The combat itself has a brawler type feel to it, similar to the Batman Arkham games, but with a greater focus on stringing together effective combos and a neat little touch that allows you to build your own combos. This combo system allows you to add different abilities to each button in a combo ranging from cooldowns to self heals to extra damage and more. This allows for a surprising amount of depth and strategy in an otherwise linear game with straight forward, sometimes repetitive combat. Later in the game the combat gets some extra little mix-ins and some more chaotic elements, which are all for the best. During my first playthrough i found myself constantly pausing and changing out different combo powers and experimenting to see what setup worked best in different situations.Going back to the story, though I can't say much without spoiling anything, Nilin's amnesia truly helps the player step into her shoes, as you are both learning about Neo-Paris at the same time. In addition to this and her general badass-ness, Nilin is a very well written female character (we have too few of those in gaming) who is not only strong and willing to fight for what she blieves in, but also has vulnerabilities, guilt, and doubts as to whether or not she is doing the right thing. This makes her feel like a real human being you actually care about, as she's not just some guy with brown hair and stubble gunning down waves of baddies. She is also a well dressed character, dressed for the situations and fights she gets into, not to look sexy (don't worry though, she has the butt of a professional jeans model), and every character in the game (except a few villains) treat her with the respect she deserves. Later on, this story reveals how major villains and characters shaped her into the woman she is today, and these scenes still blow me away to this day.A fun part of the game is the memory remixes you get to do several times in the story. These are puzzles in which you break into someone's mind and try to change a memory to affect how they'll act, example: making a guy think he killed his girlfriend will cause him to commit suicide. These puzzles are brilliant and way too sparse, but also rather challenging at first. In essence you watch the memory like a cutscene and then you can rewind and look for ""memory glitches,"" these glitches allow you to interact with the memory and change things minutely, add up the changes, and something entirely different can happen. It's a very fun experiment in gameplay that the developers actually carried on to their next game, Life is Strange (an even better game than this), with a time travel mechanic instead of cyberpunk memory remixing.All in all, despite the linear level design, slightly repetitive combat (saved by the fun combo system and fun enemy types introduced later), Remember Me is a game I'll always remember. It is fun, intelligent, fast-paced, and actually rather believable unlike a lot of cyberpunk games I've played. The story is incredible as well, full of twists and turns and mind-bending surprises. I'm not 100% sure if I could recommend this game at full price, but if it is on sale it should be a no brainer to pick it up.			"

												Pretty nice game. It resemble something between Batman and Deus Ex. From Deus Ex in game a cyberpunk atmosphere, from Batman - fight system. Plot is pretty good (but linear). Not so much characters in game but all of them unique and in their place. Fight system deserve another few words. With 2 mouse buttons in special succession you can make combos from 4 type of hits. Plus after each hit you accumulate some focus for special attack. Some enemies can be hit only one type of hit or with special attack, some with the other. If you fight with few types of enemies fight can be pretty interesting. Each episode ends with special boss type. Every boss needs some other tactics. If you have expirience - play this game on max difficulty. It is really fun that way!Summary:Game is not very long, but not short either. It have good plot and characters, interesting fights and not cost very much. Definitly worth it!			"

												I am blown away by this game. The setting is beatiful and detailed, from the slums to high society. I spent the first few hours of gameplay moving slowly through the first level, taking it all in. The story is unique, intriguing, and has serious depth. Without spoiling anything, let me just say that the conept of remixing makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. This game will make you think, introspectively and about the big picture.Combat is also entertaining. Your combos can be heavily customized with more options than just ""this does more damage"". It's far from a hack-n-slash type game. There's also a good deal of Assassin's-Creed-style-parkour-ing, which is a marvoulous way to take in the beautiful atmosphere.I highly recommend this game!

												You know how you always wonder why is there only AAA and indie games left? Well, this game here belongs to that almost forgotten niche of ""not-quite-A games"". It lacks the open-worldness and sandboxness of the AAA-games in the genre, but I would say it's a plus. The game is story-driven, and resembles more the Arkham Asylum game (even has an equivalent of those Scarecrow sequences), which suits the game pretty well. Though the game mechanics aren't as polished as Batman's, there is enough variability in composing the combos that suit your playstyle or current situation, and the game subtly encourages you to adjust them during the fight if you notice that your current style doesn't cut it.Apart from the cringy QTE finishing moves I mostly enjoyed the fights, and as to the climbing parts, they are pretty straigthforward due to the augmented reality overlay.The story is compelling, though I'd prefer a darker tone for this cyberpunk setting.All in all, I can't find many critical points - the game doesn't overstay its welcome and the mechanics are introduced at a nice pace for you to get used to. If you like close-combat action games and cyberpunk setting, give it a shot!			"

												The two strongest aspects of this game are the memory manipulation sequences and the customisable combos.   The two weakest aspects of this game is the camera control and the size of some of the fight areas.  The memory manipulation is excellent, its relevant to the story line and very enjoyable. However, only appears four times within the game and only has one successful outcome each time. What I mean by that is that it would have been a nice touch to have more than one possible outcome to progress the story. Perhaps a simple dialogue or cutscene change. Just to vary up the play experience a little. Also, more of it! Only four times over? In a story based around memory manipulation?  The combos are a clever idea. Basically you're able to string together kicks and punches to form combos. Each individual kick or punch can have an action mapped to it. Basically the combo Punch-Punch-Punch can be mapped as Damage-Heal-Damage, for example. Should you come across a situation where you need to keep your health up and damage isn't as important then you can change the combo mapping to Heal-Heal-Heal instead. I think this really opens up your options when you find yourself in a difficult fight. When you find yourself failing over and over with the combo setup you've created, you can totally remap it to better suit the fight at hand. My only complaint in this area is that I feel the game should auto-save any combo changes as and when they are changed, rather than along with the game progression. As it stands, if you change your combo's going into a fight the changes you made will revert when the game reloads to the checkpoint before the fight. Another bonus to mention is that combos are not broken by correctly timed dodges, a hugely appreciated feature when it comes to fights with multiple hard enemies.  I thought the story and setting were good. I didn't want to be away from the game for long, the narrative, although somewhat linear, kept me interested and wondering what was coming next. Some of the environments were very good at setting the mood, be it dark, dirty and creepy or bright, clean and clinical. The only point I would raise against the story is that I felt that the protagonists voice acting was somewhat weak in some cutscenes and yet much stronger in others. I felt there was a ""that'll do"" vibe to the delivery on some of the lines.  Finally I'll mention the two things that had me gritting my teeth. Firstly the camera. Sometimes you've full control of the camera, at others the control is snatched away from you, unexpected on occasions. The chase style camera works well in some of the parkour sections but not so well in others. This isn't a huge deal, at least not until you consider my second grievance. The walls. Many of them are simply just too close together. Time and time again I would find myself FINALLY getting on top of a difficult fight against multiple challenging enemies, with victory in sight. I would dodge an incoming attack, only to find myself up against a wall, the camera would become pinned in some highly restrictive position and I would be overwhelmed whilst trying to escape the trap caused by an appalling relationship between the walls and camera. A solution to this would be to make the combat areas larger (I found myself up against the walls far too often) or to tighten up the camera controls.  Should you buy it? I know I've possibly painted the game in a poor light in my review, however overall I think this is a good game. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good narrative or a challenging single player experience. Theres a good blend of liner story, combo based combat, collectable hunting, puzzle solving and parkour.			"

												After beating Remember Me, I can understand, why this game has so mixed reviews. I cannot even fully make up my mind.Let's start with some of the really good stuff:The basic idea, the world they created is great.The story is very ambitious and - let's say - powerful and is partly very well toldHere and there the game develops a cineastic quality, which is rarely if ever seen in videogamesThe visual design of the levels, of the characters etc is good.Later in the game, it just serves you big chunks of story, with almost generic dialogue patched between - they cannot keep up with their own ambition.In regard to gameplay, the game oscillates around mediocre.You have the rather uninspired brawl-sequences, where you have combos, dodges and some special attacks. There is a little running around, but the game always shows you the way, you are basically on rails. And then there are very boring climbing sequences, they rarely pose any challenge and obviously serve only the purpose, that the game does not consist of (mediocre) brawl after brawl.Especially later in the game, when the storytelling becomes stale and the levels get longer, it gets boring and almost a chore to finish.Although in doubt, I do recommend this game.

The concept of the story about lost memory's is creative and the element are putted great into the game, it's balanced between all the different elements, because there are so many things. Maybe a little bit to much of quick time events, but who cares? Its an amazing gaming experience and i really liked playing it. I think this game is become my favorite game.			"

												Remember Me has been on my wishlist for quite a while and it certainly does not dissapoint. The visuals and levels are gorgeous and even on the easiest level it is so darn hard to collect everything there is to collect. The game is also very storydriven, something I can definately appreciate.The gameplay reminds me a lot of the latest Tomb Raider as you need to crawl on pipes and jump your way from rig to rig to get through certain areas. The combat system is lots of fun: you unlock more and more moves during the your playthrough and make your own combos. But the part were Remember Me really shines is its story and characters.I was really pleased about some of the character design choices, such as Nilin being of mixed heritage as well as being a strong, female protagonist.All in all I really enjoyed this game and will possibly replay it in the future to explore other options I might've missed.

												Visually this game is absolutely stunning. I was amazed by the amount of detail that they put into the city of neo-paris. The story and concept of this game is very fresh, intriguing and actually pretty cool. However the memory remixing was something that was not used nearly enough as that was one of the better and fun parts of this game. The only gripe is that the fighting mechanics are very repetitive even with the ability to change up the combos and that the world is not nearly open enough. I would recommed this game especially if you like games like mirrors edge. Overall an impressive story and visuals.			"

												think of a linear assassins creed/old prince of persia in a darker mirror's edge world with basic combos and a little qte. Its fun, I'm enjoying it quite a bit. if you mess up and die it takes you right back to where you were. I used to hate that in games. But i work two jobs and not a lot of free time. There isnt too many games that im willing to grind through an entire level to get back to where i was. The camera is a little screwy at times and the combos take some time to perfect. It's a fun game, however, i wish it wasn't so linear. Buy it if its around 15 bucks.7/10			"

												This game came as a big surprise for me as I was skeptical about it, and now I realize it for the diamond in the rough that it is. For being 2 years old, the game is gorgeous, the combat feels fluid and has combat similar to the Batman Arkham series, but adds strategy as different moves have different affects, as well as where you place them in a combo. I have not beaten it yet, but so far the story has me intrigued, it moves a bit slow at parts, but manages to pick up the pace whenever it begins to slow down. The definite highlight is at the end of each chapter they have a big boss battle, which are always my favorite as some of them prove to be challenging but not overly dfficult to make me want to quit and not pick it up again. Overall, I would give the game a solid 8.5/10, but it on sale as I did and it will be MORE THAN WORTH your money.			"

												This game has flaws, first and foremost. I felt the gameplay was very lacking at times, the combat shoddy (A poor man's Arkham series), but I absolutely loved the story of this game and the setting. Despite not caring for the gameplay, I stayed until the end for the story.If it's cheap, it's worth it. I don't feel like this game was worth full retail though, with all honesty.			"

												""Remember you soon...""A hidden gem, in all honesty. The review scores from sites like metacritic are pretty skewed and unforgiving. It has a lot to like about it, even if there are some elements that aren't so good. Pros: -The main character is pretty likeable, interesting, and is realistic. She makes the occasional quip or sarcastic remark, she's remorseful, she's skilled and strong but she doesn't pretend to be an invincible hero. She discovers her past and what she has done, and both accepts and laments who she is. She's flawed, but just as anyone should be. Also she's somewhat non-standard for a main/female video game character, and the deviation from the norm is very appreciated. -The story is all about memory. Recovering lost memories. Altering others' perceptions and world views. Learning what it means to really live, to embrace even the bad memories. Almost everything in this game involves the technology that surrounds this new day and age of ""Sensen"" and digital memories. Lose your memories, get them back, kick♥♥♥♥♥ and make everyone remember. Really cool take on the 'dystopia' setting. -The setting is a somewhat run of the mill 'future dystopia' kind of thing, but it still manages to pull you in with the beautiful scenes and art. From sewers, to modern apartment complexes and malls, to prison, it's decently diverse in where it takes you. You even revisit some levels, but they're not the same: they've changed with the events of the game as it unfolds.-The combat is a little clunky at first, but after a little adjusting and unlocking more of the system, it becomes pretty fun and fluid. It's kind of like the Arkham series of Batman games lately but with a couple of minute differences (like no counters). It can also seem a little repetitive if you don't enjoy a whole lot of beat-em-ups. She unlocks a variety of abilities and types of punches and kicks in her repertoire, and towards the end of the game it sort of challenges you to use these effectively. Also she controls pretty well. She feels sleek, athletic, and powerful. Outside of combat, not as much, but she still feels pretty responsive. (also the camera isn't that bad. It just has hiccups sometimes.) Boss Battles are generally good and fun to play, although a couple are a little irritating. -The Memory Remixes are really, really creative. They're a little sparse, but they're very fun and cool. Play with people's memories to 'change' outcomes in real life- or so the victim thinks. Make them believe that they killed someone. Make them believe something is their fault. Make them take on a different perspective. Super unique, one of the highlights of the game. -The soundtrack is good. Certain songs, I'd even say that they're lovely. Songs fit the situations well, no complaints. -Very good game-feel with a PC-controller (microsoft controller or otherwise)Cons: -Game is kind of short, I beat it in 9 hours and I was trying to take my time for a majority of it. Unfortunately, it doesn't have much in terms of replay value other than looking for things you missed (collectables) or piecing together parts of the story you may have not initially had already-parkour segments (climbing around) can be a bit repetitive. Also, sometimes there's a clarity issue where even when there's arrows that point to things you can climb, it's not always obvious where you have to go. I'm not talking like 'this should be blatantly obvious with a giant arrow' but more like 'did I go this way already?' or 'where's the next thing to jump to?' I got lost a few times in one of the later chapters. -The game is EXTREMELY linear. There's not much room for exploration, which is probably why they put so much effort into putting up the floating signs and whatnot around the levels (also putting detail into them, which is nice I guess).-Game tends to give out a few too many tutorials, which isn't so much bad as it is like 'okay, I get it thanks'-The difficulty is more subjective than anything. I found normal to be at least a little challenging, but people who play a lot of beat-em-ups might want to start on the highest setting.-Not so good game-feel with mouse and keyboard.All in all, I'd say it's a 4 out of 5 or a(n) 7.5/8 out of 10. Good story, good gameplay, creative mechanics, but could have used a little more polish, and a bit more length in the game itself. The hiccups are pretty easy to forgive, in my opinion. Don't let them get in the way of a good story (that actually made me cry at the end a little, i guess that's a small spoiler).			"

												Remember Me... oh... the potential is so totally there, and just barely misses it. The graphics are fairly well done, the story is multidimensional and rich, the combat and advancement system is pretty good. The mood, the music and the scenery all works of art in a noir-thriller kinda way. But the repitition in the short time that I played this game made me stop playing. The going from engagement to engagement and having to hit the same sequence again and again, and not messing up or losing my combo which was the only way to get something more exciting that kick kick punch going on, killed my enthusiasm. This is one of those hate to hate it games... because it is really a good work of art over all... and if you have more patience than I do, and don't mind a bit of repition in your game, then please do go for it. This is a good buy, but just in case you're on the fence, wait til its on sale. :) then you can still recommend it to others if you get a little short in the collar.			"

												Edit: I wrote this review at the end of 2015 and for the life of me I can't remember why I gave it a thunbs down. I have fond memories of this game, so I'm changing my review to a thumbs up. With that said, this was the review I wrote at the time.I want to recommend it. I want to give it a yes. I really do. I think the idea of dealing with memories and the consequences is a really-really cool idea. The story just handled it really poorly. Overly superficial. It was shaping up to be something pretty good too.You need a controller to play this. The keyboard controls are really bad. The combat is good, varied, but overall lacking. The graphics are very good and the game is well optimized. I'm playing on a gtx650 and I could play at 1080p on ultra with no problems.			"

												~For the best time, play the game on Easy or Medium difficulty so that the combat won't subtract from your otherwise AMAZING experience.~Delightful game. The story was impactful and deep, the scenery and art were lovely. The environment was rather uninteractive but I can appreciate it due to the character's focus on priorities. Superbly written characters, excellent music. My only groan was the combat felt bad. Making your own combos was a nice twist for sure, and the ability cooldown mechanic was very unique. However, once I'd gotten used to the combat, I turned the difficulty up to hard (Memory Hunter), which ended up taking my mind off of the pros of the game and onto ""please let me finish a damn combo it's been hours of dodging"".

												The strongest parts of this game is the story and the music for sure. It really keeps you hooked until the very end. The ending itself isn't as strong as the earlier parts but the journey was enjoyable overall. A lot of people complained that combat was pretty simplistic/repeatitive which is kind of true but in all honesty it isn't that bad. On top of that, while you have only a few preset combos to use, you do get a lot of diversity in how those combos help your character (basically you four ""power ups"" you can attach to your combos so that your combos heal you, do more damage, or lower your cooldown for special abilities, and the fourth is just a multiplier effect that amplifies one of the three powers). I also LOVED a special ability that your character has which is that they can alter the memories of individuals. I think that was something really unique to the game and it is great to recreate things and see all the different ways you can make the memory play out.I also thought it was great for the game to have good diversity in terms of gender and race. You don't see that much in games, and we gamers get a lot of flak for that sort of thing. Honestly, I will definitely refer to this game as a good counter example showing that games can have that sort of thing and still be a ton of fun.tl;dr if you are into a good story definitely pick up this game. If you hate linear games and/or despise gameplay that is a bit repeatitive then you may not like this game but honestly the gameplay wasn't that bad at all to me.			"

												Duration: ~9 hoursReplay value: I'm not going to, anywayVerdict: pick it up on sale if you want a simple, story-driven gameA nice little game that integrates its cental story conceits into gameplay. Fighting is incredibly simple, with a linear, highly directed story.Where this game shines is in the world-building, a nice distopian future, with a french theme. The characters are relatively dynamic, despite most villains being introduced in the same episode they're defeated, and some characters with potential for interesting interaction are very lightly represented overall.Where this game fails is in its story. The presentation of the story is ambitious, with focus on characters and a few key reveals. The problem is, in a game where a central conceit is the ability to rewrite, delete, and alter memories, the main character is never deceived, and reality is never in question. Story-wise this idea is used in a way any form of powerful science or magic could be used; creates monsters, has an exploit one bad guy can use to rule the world. It also gives an explanation for the tired trope of an amnesiac main character (which is doubly unnecessary in a video game, as the same sense can be accomplished with a silent protagonist ala zelda or half-life) but the revealed past, as these things come, is incredibly low-impact.Overall the game leads you to an overwhelming question: where did all the guns go, and why has nobody shot me yet?

												Remember Me is an underrated game.  One professional review knocked on it for its ""formulaic combat"", which I actually enjoy.  The gameplay itself is a very pleasant mix with nostalgic touches to it.  It reminds me of a Perfect Dark coupling with Assassin's Creed.  The storyline and protagonist give me fond memories of Joanna Dark, and the setting somewhat reminds me of the orignal N64 Perfect Dark.  The combat system, occasional puzzles, and style of climbing all over the place are close-to-home with Assassin's Creed.The game is a little rough around the edges on the tutorials (they are a bit lacking), but I actually enjoy its linear play style.  This game isn't intended to be open-ended or exploratory.  You're playing primarily for the storyline, which is enough to keep me hooked.Summary:If you're looking for a game that plays like an interactive movie that has strong influences from Metal Gear boss fights, Assassin's Creed combat, and a protagonist resembling Joanna Dark from the Perfect Dark series, you'll likely love this game.  I do recommend it, and it's rare to find a linear single-player game these days that is good.  This game is one of them.			"

												Now, keep in mind I haven't beaten the game yet, so take some of this with a grain of salt.Remember Me is a game about a society where memories are now a commodity. They are able to be shared, sold, and stolen. The game paints a picture of this bizarre world where (somewhat inexplicably) memories are mostly what run everything. The story follows a memory hunter by the name of Nilin, as she finds herself caught in a maximum security prison with her memories taken from her. She escapes with the assistance of the enigmatic ""Errorist"" who goes by the name Edge. With Edge's help, Nilin goes forth to take down the corporate overlords who run the show as well as recover Nilin's memory.Remember Me is a game that has absolutely incredible design. Neo-Paris is a vibrant and strange city, swarming with its own unusual culture and architecture. From what I see, the characters all have some glimmer of interesting traits, but aren't too groundbreaking--their designs, however, are quite interesting if anything. The music is a bizarre mix of electronic and classical instrumentation with a lot chops and cuts in it, I think it might actually be one of the strongest points of the game, as it really has a flavor of its own. Olivier Derivier did a fantastic job on the music for this. Now for the most weak point of the game, the actual gameplay. It consists of 3rd person action brawling and railroaded parkour. The brawling is vaguely reminiscient of the Batman Arkham series of games, except that instead of mashing punch to win, you alternate mostly between punch and kick buttons to win. There aren't counter moves, but there's some absurdly acrobatic dodge moves you can perform. The decidedly dull combat is only livened up by the Pressen system. With Pressens, you can attach certain properties to each attack in a chain of combos. There's damage, heal, cooldown, and link pressens that all help to try and add some variety to the combat system with varying amounts of success.Honestly, though, I still think it's worth playing. I approach this game in the same way I approached Alice: Madness Returns, I played that game to experience its art, atmosphere, music, and all-around weirdness and not for the dull gameplay that broke those moments of awe I experienced. That goes the same for Remember Me. I consider it mostly an art experience focused game, and not a gameplay focused sort of thing.I give it a Gold Star/10			"

												It's the year 2084 and you are a ""memory hunter"" in paris. You get to climb around and kick some♥♥♥♥♥with combos that YOU can decide on and edit. Unfortunally this game is not open world, this was one of my most biggest dissapoitments. The game lets you play in an extremely narrow coridor. You sometimes have no clue why you are doing something or even what you are doing but the corridor is so small that you can't stumble in the wrong direction, doors lock right behind you if you pass them so you can't even move 2 ways in this corridor, it's a one direction road. The combat is quite fun tho, you have some options concering your combos which will depend if you make it or not. The combos are really simple to change tho, even while doing a combo they can be changed so it gives you some room to play in, which if used to it's maximum can be devastating for your opponents. The boss fights are quite hard from what I have experienced, tho I should add that I played on the hardest difficulty. Mistakes in a fight are not very forgiving, ex. You get knocked over reciving damage, and while getting up they shoot you or channel something in your direction making it impossible to dodge.Memory changing missions are quite frustrating since it takes time and you have to do eveything over and over and try everything in different ways till you get the right combination of options.The graphics are good/oke, nothing amazing but they do have alot of clutter/detail laying around so the levels don't seem empty. The soundtrack is good, nice to listen to and nothing annoying, fits the scenes.Voice and other sound were done good, didn't notice anything really bothering.The story is not bad, have had worse and have had better. The scenes you get are nice, especially from the city and all the people and robots doing their jobs and what not. Tho I do feel a bit of emptyness, you can't interact with any of them at all and most of the people/robots feel more like props than actual people or robots living their lives.Overall the game is quite... special. Although I am not a rage kind of player this game had me taking a break at some times, so it's not for the few people that like to smash on the keyboard. BUT I still recommend this game for some reason, Im glad to have played the game and will probably never play it again. Get it for the right price and you won't have to many regrets. 6.5/10			"

												Under-rated game. The combat is decent, the story isn't bad, and the atmosphere is fun. It reminds me of a cross between Oni and Mirror's Edge, and not just because of the female lead characters. Take the gunplay and melee combat of Oni and add in Mirror's Edge's free running and you've got this game. The plot is even a mix of both games as well. Considering I enjoyed both of those titles I enjoyed this as well.Recommended, especially since it's on sale frequently.			"

												Its one of best games on the market. Amazing story, amazing graphics, combat is bit repetitive but since its more less fist fighting so no much variety to be expected and also game is linear story driven and not some hack and slash game. If you are looking far a game with amazing story line told not by point and click type game then you found it. It might not be one of those games that glue to the screens for many hours, maybe just for 1-2 play through due to even thou rather deep story but short game play. And after finishing game on credit scene you will lean back and think ""wow that was something""			"

												If you want a picture of the future, imagine a hand ripping out human memories - forever.Remember Me envisions 2084 as a time when human memories can be manipulated like any physical item, and as such are bought, sold, traded, stolen, etc. much as physical items are. You control Nilin, a ""memory hunter"" - one with the power to manipulate human memories, up to and including large-scale rewrites. Recently wiped of most of her memories while in prison, she escapes and begins fulfilling tasks set to her by the Errorist known as Edge - a mysterious man who seeks the destruction of the privileged upper class the memory technology has created.---So, first off, the character design in this game is a bit lacking. Nilin isn't bad, but there's not a whole lot to really like about her, and no character, overall, is developed a whole lot - not helped by the fact that, due to the theme of memory manipulation, the whole concept of ""character development"" is harder to apply here.The art style is well-done and the text design, in particular, is fantastic. Less can be said about the music, but at least it's not annoying. On a recommendation, I played with French voice acting, and I can pass on the recommendation - even if (like me) your knowledge of French is spotty at best, it helps with the recreation of the Neo-Paris atmosphere.The gameplay...I mean, it's linear, and the combat system clearly has a lot of thought put into it, but gets rather repetitive regardless. Neither is inherently bad, but usually those are used in conjunction with a game focused on story, and that's where Remember Me falls a bit short.The real killer is that the story premise is really quite interesting. Unfortunately, with the relatively short length and lack of character development, most of that potential doesn't go anywhere, and (very minor potential spoilers) the fascinating ethical questions of memory manipulation are essentially tossed aside in favor of a sappy ""people are not complete without their sorrows"" aesop. Not at all what the asking price suggests about the game.I still enjoyed my time with Remember Me, and if all of this has kept your interest so far, I'd advise you to give it a try (probably on sale, though). But if you're having your doubts? Nah.			"

												Wow...This has to be the most visually stunning games I have ever played, but I won't lie and say the game play is flawless because it's not.  Combat is like an 'Arkham City wanna-be' but comes nowhere near the fluid motion of any of the Batman games.  But if you can get past the first few levels and upgrade your combos it's not so bad.  Actually once I quit trying to play it like Arkham and started playing it for what it was, I started to come around to the combat and enjoy a tad bit.  There are also plenty of platforming moments that are all pretty easy.  They mostly serve to break up the gameplay and show off a wider view of the levels, and let me tell you.....The world of Remember Me is the reason you want to play this game.  When you move from point A to B don't RUN...hold back on the thumbstick a bit and WALK and soak in every bit of the detail.  These guys have made one of the most beautiful games I have ever seen in my life.  The level to detail is staggering and is Remember Me's greatest asset.  That being said, I do wish they would have went the Splinter Cell route instead of the Arkham City route and had more focus on stealth.  This could have been the Starcraft Ghost that we never got.  Can you imagine?!?!?  Oh well, it's still a beautiful game and well worth a playthrough, especially if your a little burnt out on the same ol', same ol' Call of Duty or whatever mainstream game that usually takes up your time.  Do yourself a favor and give it a chance.  It doesn't cost much and worse case scenerio you just don't like it.  I think if you open your mind and look past the clunky combat, and look at the world instead you'll find it's actually damn good.			"

												The setting is your typical scifi dystopia but the story is pretty unique so far. I either wasn't paying attention or it's legit but I did not see a plot twist come about in a later chapter of the game. The world is also incredibly well-crafted and beautiful. The combat is a bit repetitive, like most beat'em ups, but the story overshadows it completely. The rest of the gameplay is spot on, especially the parkour-style climbing. It has a strong female lead, too. Not just ""gun and sexy"" (though she is sexy as well) strong but stands out as her own person against her male counterparts. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good game to play.			"

												I think the story of the game is unique but slow.  It's a shame to me how such a beautifully made world is limited to explore.   Our protagonist, Nilin, seems well rounded in character.  However, going back to being able to exploring the world, it seems odd how she can jump such great distances and parkour like a boss, yet she can't hurdle a 2ft wall.  The world is also not very interactive.  Only the items that will help you progress in the game's story (besides the boxes that boost your health and focus) can be interacted with.  I was expecting a reaction out of some of the robots when I punched or kicked them...nothing.  The same thing happens with the NPCs in Slum 404.  One thing that is a plus and minus is the camera angles.  When it comes to the parkour, some of the POVs are very helpful. Sometimes I couldn't see where I was supposed to jump to next because the computer took over my camera and I had no control of where I was looking (also happens when trying to get a glimpse at the surrounding city).  The architecture is amazing, and it's very hard to admire it because you see only what the designers want you to see.  If you want to play a CyberPunk game that is unique, play this one.  It is fun, but be warned that there is not a lot of freedom in where you go and what you can interact with.  It's good to play through once.  I don't see a point in playing through it again (unless you really want those pesky achievements).  Honestly, a bit of side questing, more interaction with the environment, and a bit more freedom would give this game a much higher replay value.  Just a thought if these developers ever read these things (highly doubt it).  Other than that it's a pretty good game...but for $30, wait until it's on sale.			"

												Recommended if you like sci-fi/action films. And yes, I refer to this as a film intentionally, because that's what it's like playing Remember Me. Lots of cutscenes, one of the best dystopic futures ever created in a game, and the voice acting is excellent. Unfortunately, it's a very short game (even if you die a lot), the character development is patchy (some characters aren't introduced well and some just suddenly disappear in the story) and little replay value (unless you like grinding for achievements). Wait for the 80% off sale or more. If you aren't interested in those features, then I'd give this a pass. But if you are, this is an amazing experience. Remember this soon.			"

												The graphics are amazing, the trailers entice you with a warm inviting embrace and it looks fun enough to play, although it's a trap. A massive, trap for me in the very least.The game starts out innocent enough as you're learning the ropes but as you progress you have 4 modes of play that are horrendously repetitive. 1. Combat, wholly dependent on combos, bland and obvious. Use X skill to disarm Y enemies shield, use Z combo to cooldown skills and repeat. Dodging is easy enough, but clunky and basically... just going through motions.2. Assassin's creed style springboard jumping through the city ala la spiderman in a tutu minus the webs and emphasis on parkour. 90% of it is linear, it's usually obvious where to go. Mild old school platiformer patience of wait 3 seconds, memorize pattern, then proceed to dodge but there's so few of these areas. Some areas are insta-gib and unforgiving.3. Puzzles of manipulating memories and very weak riddles of pure trial and error with no semblance of what's going on. Basically poke a dead donkey and see what happens, poke it somewhere else and repeat until desired results occur.4. Stealth element is luke-warm MetalGear-esque. It isn't fun, nor is it a challenge. There's pretty much only one way through most of them.So, in the end what's this game have going for it? Concept and storyline. Props for being ballsy to try something new in a stagnant market of meme-sheepage zombie/warcraft etc games. It tried to be like Deus Ex, but has nothing that made the game fun. It COULD have been amazing if it wasn't some clunky mix-mash. Get it cheap, get it for the storyline, the philosophy, the perceptive of life and politics but if you want a game that can really draw you in and have replay value, steer clear.			"

But everything else, especially details of the worldbuilding, wants to be judged by the standards of canon cinema, not television or games.

												This game is good enough.Interesting setting and storyLikable protagonistRemixing mechanic is novelThe mechanics are solid enough to stay out of the way, but not particularly compelling on their own. This is not Devil May Cry. Play it for the good story, not for the gameplay.Remixing was underutilized, and would be more interesting if it allowed branching.Combat mechanics are mediocre. The controls feel crisp, so it passes the first test, but the fights don't feel interesting. The more challenging fights are more tedious than difficult. Certain enemies require cooldown use to defeat, and you can make those cooldowns available more quickly through the combo system. The problem is that your combos reset every time you defeat an enemy, so if you're fighting a lot of weak enemies, it can be frustrating trying to make your cooldown abilities available again. Aside from cooldowns, it's just unsatisfying in general to be unable to complete combos before enemies die.None of the enemies ever really felt threatening or difficult to defeat. Instead of those enemies telegraphing their attacks, they show an exclamation over their heads before they strike, the way Arkham Asylum does. The difference is that there's no blocking or countering; only dodging, and you can dodge anything from any enemy. You can pretty much win any fight by hitting dodge every time you see an exclamation. The result is that the combat feels trivial. Whatever skill you can add to the formula changes how quickly you can end a battle, but your success is never in doubt; I finished the entire game without a single combat death on medium difficulty.The game holds your hand through all the parkour/jumping puzzles, so that side of the game is trivial as well.

												This game is truly a beautiful work of art. The story and environment keep you entranced. I will agree with other reviewers about the combat, it can get pretty repetitive I imagine, but each fight does work like a puzzle in a way, which kept it interesting. Memory hunter difficulty was definitely tough at the start of the game but once you figure out the at-first-glance confusing mechanics of combat, it gets much more enjoyable. Was about an 8-9 hour play-through which is what I would expect from the standard action/adventure game. Pretty sad that a second one probably will never come out because this franchise was really cool not only as a game, but as an overall commentary on where we could be headed with technology and social media. Also, Nilin, the protagonist is gorgeous, who wouldn't want to have a third person view of that for 8 hours? :P "

												This game will introduce you to a dystopian future of mankind. Memories can be traded like goods and changed like a remix of a song. You play Nillin, a young girl who lives in Neoparis,  and help her unravel the mystery of her past and stop a big computer from salving the whole humanity.  The game has a unique story and has some real good and new play mechanism. Basically you beat your enemies but you do that by chain together combinations who either help you recover your health, deal additional damage to your enemy or cools down you special abilities a lot faster.  Also you can change peoples memories by remixing them. I don't want to spoiler here. It has a bunch of glitches though which some times makes you fall through the game and die which seems to be very weird. The Sound is OK and the background voices and noises create a realistic atmosphere. It is surely not the best game but if you want to spend an afternoon with a good story and an new game interesting game mechanism this game is for you.			"

												A bad case of Alzheimers.Anywho lets get into this review of Remember Me.In Remember Me you play as a character named Nilin, who has lost her memory and must retain them and bring down the Memorize Corporation with the help of a mysterious asset named Edge.To be quite frankly honest, Nilin herself isn't really an interesting character, she seems quite bland and boring for my personal taste. Some characters you meet along the way are far more interesting such as Olga Sedova (Interesting Fact: Olga's Character model was tweaked to become Victoria from ""Life is Strange"") anywho she just like Tommy, Bad Request, are Interesting characters whom you don't get much background from, and sadly they only make very few appearances, although they are your allies, only Edge whom you don't see phsically is in constant contact with you.The story itself is interesting, I liked the idea of a world where Memories were bought and sold, even stolen or wiped. It was an interesting concept that I enjoyed, and It made me wonder how it became to be and what would happen when we brought down the Memorize Corporation, will everyone be restored to Normal? or will we all have lost memories. The Story is interesting enough to keep you going from Chapter to Chapter, making you discover whats happening next. It was also nice to see throughout the game the restoration of Nillin's memory, slowly getting to know yourself again, before your memory was wiped, there was one major plot twist that I enjoyed but ill let you discover that on your own.The setting was perfect, the ""Neo Paris"" fit perfect to the theme at hand. From the  slums to the high class Neo Paris was an interesting place to explore.Gameplay, well to be quite frankly honest the combat got a bit repetative and at time it was annoying remember combos which you must land perfectly or you won't get your combo buffs. The enemy were pretty simple to kill, only the invisible lurkers were completely obnoxious (I hate invisible enemies). One other annoying factor is when your combo breaks (which will happen alot), when you fight a large group of enemies and your doing your combo, they hit you once and your combo breaks and you must start again, really irritating. The parkour is pretty fun though, jumping around and grabbing onto ledges and items.In the end I would say this game is ""Mediocre"" its not Good but its not bad either its average. I enjoyed playing it but did get to a point where I just wanted to finish and get it over and done with, but overall its a decent game.I would highly recommend buying this on sale, and not at the full retail price.

												I really enjoyed this game. It is very different from the mainstream games, it has gorgeous environments and if you have nVidia 3D Vision it looks spectacular. The combat system is a bit annoying and the boss fights made me curse several gods; I wish they had used the actual key symbols in quick time events instead of symbols of the actions those keys perform. For an example when the game prompts the player to press SPACE it shows an arrow symbol that represents dodging. But all-in-all, a very good game.			"

												Beautiful game. Everywhere you walk are these great little details like robots cleaning up, shopping windows, statues etc. that add nothing to gameplay but a whole lot to atmosphere. It is a very linear game, but that is not a bad thing at all. Because of it I think the creators were able to put energy into all those details.The combat system is also very enjoyable and original.			"

												This game is just 'okay.' The plot is a little bit dry, the battles are repetetive, and completing the game didn't feel very satisfying. I give this a 5/10; a solid middle game to kill some time. I kept playing hoping something would change to make it more apealing to me, but it never really happened due to the fact I am stuck fighting the same enemies over and over with very little variance in combat methods.Essentially, as soon as I beat the game, I uninstalled it. There is no real replay value in the game so I would only recommend a purchase if this game is on sale. I could see some people enjoying this game, but this just isn't for me. "

												I absolutely loved this game. I understood Nilin's sad childhood and it's an overall very depressing game, so the emotional appeal worked for me. There wasn't really any chance to explore Neo-Paris and if they did this like Gravity Rush, I think it would've worked better (missions with a set path but time to explore the city for as long as you want between missions). Spoiler: I didn't actually expect for Nilin to be the daughter of Sylla because I figured that it was just another remix like she did with Olga. I really liked how they did that because it wasn't super obvious until she's calling the little girl in the backseat by the protagonist's name. Another thing that could've been done for Remember me would be to have more chances to remix because it's so interesting, but maybe have slighlty less depressing remixes because I always felt sad after them (especially because you make a husband die, a man kill his wife which led to his suicide, blaming the mother instead of the child for a car accident, and having a father kill his daughter). Overall though, this is honestly one of my favorite games now because it drew me in with an interesting story, awesome character designs (espeically the holographs), and a heck of a lot of emotion. I am definitely going to look for more games made by DONTNOD. (Btw Jax and Nilin were precious together.)			"

												Remember Me is a fantastic game, to say the least. DONTNOD never ceases to amaze me, not even when I buy games that are a bit older already. So first off, this game is something I had been curious about for a long time. Simply because people told me that it's like one of my all-time favorite games, Mirror's Edge. And as I finally bought it during a sale, I was more than hyped about it. Only to find out that it's a lot less like Mirror's Edge than I thought. But was that a bad thing? Hell, not at all!I wouldn't want this game to be the slightest bit more like Mirror's Edge, because it's amazing in its very own way. But let me explain to you why I say so:First off, the setup is really cool. It's not something rare, but the way it's done is pretty great. It's a futuristic thing, but not too surreal. It's modern but not Sci-Fi. Neo-Paris looks like a possible future world, with its nice and not-so-nice sides. The architecture is a blast, and at some points, it's even a part of the story. The graphics are definitely not bad and I am not someone who'd choose crisp graphics over a nice feeling to the game.Then, there's the gameplay. The whole thing plays smooth on my gamepad, but I could also deal with the keyboard layout. It's a bit tricky using only a 4-way WASD control method, but I could adapt to it. Just overall the gamepad is probably nicer to use for most of you. There are 5 main elements of gameplay. 1. The movement is pretty much like Mirror's Edge in Third-Person. You have a good overview of your surroundings and you basically run and climb like in Mirror's Edge, Tomb Raider or whatever you could imagine. there is no running function though.2. The combat system is something that really caught my attention. Throughout the story you unlock different combos, which you can customize with different single moves, called ""impressons"". These combine to different combinations of movement and actually affect the way a combo works. So if you choose impressons of different types, the combo might have other effects on Nilin, the main character. You have impressons that deal extra damage, some that heal you, some that decrease the cooldown times for special attacks or effects and some that simply multiply the effect of the previous impresson. There is also a thing that lets you shoot something like electronic impulses, which are used in combat and for for several interactions. I won't say too much about this, because you should really look into this on your own. Trust me, it's worth to invest some time into this. There are also quite a few different types of enemies, which all require different combat methods, as some are invulnerable to specific attacks.3. Hmm, what should I say about the story? If you are emotional and maybe easily emotionally affected, you might fall in love with the story of this game. It has some heavy twists and you realize while playing that a lot of love went into the script of it. I am one of those people who were completely done after playing Life is Strange (DONTNOD's best game in my opinion), and I was so close to crying while playing Remember Me... It's what makes this game stand out so much. But yeah, I won't spoil anything for you now. Just buy it and make this experience.4. The gameplay in general is very dynamic. The game is easy to handle and even beginners should find their way into it quite quickly. The gamepad controls are really easy to use and once you get the hang of it, the keyboard will also do just fine. I never experienced problems with the standard key map.5. The music input of this game is greatly-chosen and absolutely fits the story. The mood in every episode of the game is underlined by matching music and it gives the whole thing another lovely touch. Also the general ambient sounds and the voices are nice, but the synchronizations of the latter aren't that well-done. At least for the German version. I quickly switched to English and turned off the subtitles and it was absolutely nice.Remember Me offers 3 difficulties. One for beginners, who haven't played games like this before, one for casual players, who are familiar with third-person action/adventure games and one for those, who regularly play that kind of games. I finished the game on the casual difficulty, but I tried out all and even the hard one didn't seem impossible, though it was a tough challenge after the second episode.Putting all of this together, I'd rate the game 9 or even 9.5 out of 10. The bad German synchronization and rarely-occurring fps drops kind of pull it down a tiny little bit. But I was totally amazed by the story and the visual part, and the gameplay wasn't bad at all, either. I recommend this game to anyone who's into a touching story and has quite a few hours of free time on his hands.Hope this review was helpful and you can enjoy playing Remember Me! Cheers :)			"

												finished the game under 15hours, the playstyle is very fresh, love the scenery and music, really a good job.However, not sure is it my laptop problem (with GTX960), when i played with controller, the game was lagging awfully, the framerate dropped the whole game freeze, sound started acting weird.When I plug out the controller, played with mouse+keyboard, the game seem no problems like previous, maybe just slow movement sometimes.I managed to finished the whole game with keyboard+mouse, but couldn't bear to unlock every achievements because I couldn't get used with mouse+keyboard and replay again just for achievement :(Nevertheless, the story is good, move my heart and of course plot twist.(and I feel Nilin just like Chloe from Life is Strange haha XD )For those who haven't play it yet, give it a try! It's a short gameplay but it is worthy!Remeber you soon, Nilin :)			"

												Remember Me is a decidedly average game. It has an interesting premise, however it is let down by its gameplay. Platforming is mostly annoying and repetitive, and offers no challenge. The combat is slightly less so. Although there's a very cool system of being able to build your own combos, to fit it to your needs. For example if you're low on life you can just construct a mega healing combo. I just wish there was more variety in the combat.The strongest aspects of the game are the story, the premise and most importantly the protagonist. That is what is going to keep you playing through to the end of the game.Beware that this game was not made with a mouse input in mind. It can become quite painful and frustrating to use it at times. Especially in the memory remix sections which are much more fiddly than with a gamepad.I'd recommend this game, but only if you don't have anything better to do.5 / 10			"

StoryFirst of all, Remember Me explores an interesting concept of controlling, remixing or deletingmemories that is available for anyone in the society. While at first, the user opens up to a glorious image of individuals being able to share their memories together, or being able to store the memories forever, there is a much darker side to the entire concept that is displayed throughout the events of the game. During the story, the player also explores the concepts of identity that is tied to our memories, as well as the conseqeunces of tampering with memories. The story itself isn't bad, it has its moments, and actually manages to pull off a few nice twists and turns. However, its downside is the horrible pacing of the game. Remember Me feels very slow and at times it can even be called boring. On the flipside, the latter parts of the game lift the story up a notch, but unfortunately the pacing still continues being an issue.GameplayThe combat within the game is unfortunately a pretty undeveloped concept. It revolves around mixing and matching different moves to create combos, unfortunately there are only four combos which ultimately makes this system too simple to actually make the combat worth remembering. Furthermore, the enemies are also very predictable and there really aren't any segments of the game that really challenge the player in regards to the combat. The game also features a large portion of climbing sequences which use a simplfied climbing system that  can be seen in almost any adventure game that came out within the last 10 years. The high point of the gameplay is the amazing design of Neo-Paris and its inhabitants that the user can explore, it is a feast for the eyes and any fan of cyberpunk should enjoy inspecting it. Overall, I think Remember Me is a good game, but with many ideas that could be further developed and explored. If you manage to persist through the uneven pacing and the somewhat uninspired combat system you may find yourself enjoying Neo-Paris and Nilin's story.			"

												This is a very pretty game, with a decent world & story and interesting (not unique, but less common) combat mechanics.  But the game is severely marred by several horrible design decissions:  Movies are unskippable, the story is entirely linear, the camera is too limited (so you can't actually look around at the gorgeous environments much of the time), combat is frequently interrupted with stupid (and again unskippable, you MUST do what it wants you to, even the menu choices are fixed) upgrade tutorials... And on top of that... the interface is clearly designed for a console, combos are in a fixed arrangement (yes, you can select WHICH punch, but it must be A punch), it's sometimes difficult to know how you leave some areas.  I've gotten stuck for several minutes, just hunting around...looking for the exit.This isn't really a ""recommendation"".  It's kinda fun, when it works, but punctuated with a variety of frustrations.  More polish could have cured the worst offenses.			"

												Remember Me is a very cool world, such a cool world that if you are into sci-fi Earth, you should buy it for the story / world-building alone: it's worth it. Where this game falls short is the outdated controls / mechanics / boss fights. The camera whips around erratically during combat, like it's early Silent Hill or something - or the really early Tekken / MK transitions into 3D survival modes: where someone is doing a flying kick at you, but you have no idea because the camera is very fascinated with a poster on the wall. Quick Time Events were a brilliant idea a decade ago, that were horrible in practice - and this game incorporates them into boss fights: so that's a mess. With that said, Nihil is an interesting character, Neo-Paris is awesome and gorgeous, and the story is fun. If this had a stealth option like Deus Ex (so that I could avoid all the unenjoyable combat elements) - I'd be in love. Play it for the sci-fi - worth it ;)			"

												Interesting premise and good art style and soundtrack. Mechanically, it's kind of iffy. There are QTEs. There are QTEs that will make you redo boss fights when you fail. The things that will kill you in this game are ""tricks"" that aren't effected by the difficulty setting (which seems to just be a lazy damage multiplier), so even if you make normal fights obscenely easy, it won't help when you actually need it. You'll still have to fight a boss that can only be hurt for a one-second window during which you're still stunned from an unavoidable attack, or you'll be unable to get any health back because time keeps speeding up and slowing down at random, making it impossible to time your attacks for a healing combo. Sometimes tips will pop up and give you really bad advice, too. A lot of the game is kind of fun, but it's gated by really obnoxious parts that aren't ""hard"" or ""challenging"", just pointless tricky things you have to do over and over until you succeed and are allowed to continue.Game is also a shameless console port. You will have to navigate menus that don't show your cursor, and react like you're using a d-pad instead of a mouse. You'll even have to move your mouse around in circles to simulate winding an analog stick.It's not a terrible game, but there are so many more enjoyable games out there that there's no reason to choose this one.

												Awesome game, bought it on steam sale and worth every penny. I avoided this title on release due to all the negative press. It's a gem though, good story, great worldbuilding, good music, fighitng and combo system is fine. There are a limited selection of opponents but it wasn't a deal breaker for me. If anything I can't believe how good this game is for a AAA effort from a first time game company. Shadow of mordor has much better combat, but I found it to be little more than an ork murder simulator, and it didn't hold my attention long enough to beat it. Even with the flaws in this game I was invested in the story and world enough to beat and I plan another play through in awhile on the max diffculty and to get come completionist achievments. I'm now going to get ""life is strange"" once it's all completed since it's from the same company, without playing remember me I never would have considered it...Pick it up on sale!I hope they make a sequel for this title down the road, it deserves a franchise.

												This is not an awful game. This is however, in my opinion, a very boring game. People have pointed out that the combat is weak before and it is, but it is weak because of the lack of moves available. through most of the game you can expect to be limited to 3 or 4 different combos which gets really repetitive really quickly. The enemies are very samey with little in the roster to add any variety. The plot is... ok I suppose. Two of the main characters are called Edge and Bad. Yes really. And it all seems a bit predictable as the plot weaves towards its conclusion. There are certain sections where the main character gets inside peoples memories and ""remixes"" them. This sounds better than it actually is with only one correct outcome so instead of being creative, the player is reduced to trial and error, adding or taking away certain pre-defined elements in the scene until they find the correct combination.Also in the game are a lot of short platforming sections. The movement of the platforming feels very rigid and stiff with no real feel of flow like other genre leading platforming games have (Tomb Raider, Uncharted etc).On the plus side, the game as a whole isn't terrible although I really despised the combat by the end of the game. The graphics really are very lovely with varied looking environments that try to keep the game feeling fresh as things progress. The music is quite strange with what I felt was a very uneven distribution of it through the game. Sometimes there is a lot, sometimes less so and sometimes it doesn't really seem to suit the scene or comes across as shoehorned in. What music there is though is mostly rather good with grand orchestral sweeps and nice compact peices. I find it hard to recommend this game to anyone apart from someone who was totally new to the 3rd person adventure genre. Which, as you can imagine, is practically nobody.			"

												Overall I give this game 7/10. I really wanted to enjoy this game, but I found elements of it so frustrating I almost rage-quit. But it was compelling enough to make me want to continue every time.Positives: The art direction in this game is stunning. It creates a very atmospheric cyberpunk world that is always fun to look at. It's rare that I even look at the concept art that unlocks during gameplay, but I found the art very appealing. The soundtrack by Olivier Derivière is also top-notch. While the combat system had its frustrations (see below), you are provided with a nice array of tools to defeat your enemies (""Pressen"" combos, ""S-Pressens,"" ""Junk Bolt,"" etc.) and I did rather enjoy using all of them and experimenting with different melee combos.Neutral: The writing is a mixed bag. There are some great story moments, but also some fumbles. I felt the same way about the voice acting. Kezia Burrows' performance as Nilin was a stand-out, but other performances were sub-par. (I was amused to read that Dontnod was told by several publishers that the game wouldn't sell because it had a female protagonist. Ha. My favorite line from the game: ""This little Red riding Hood has a basket full of kick♥♥♥♥♥""). I'm also neutral toward the implementation of the memory remixes. While this is a very interesting concept--and there's an awesome memory remix moment late in the game--in general it is under-developed and under-utilized.Negatives: The game hard crashed on me three times on a fairly powerful PC. Camera always seems to be a problem with third-person perspective games. I also agree with others who have criticized this game for being too linear. I enjoy platforming/ledge-jumping in games, but the linearity (and lack of jumping puzzles) made it somewhat dull here. I suppose we have been spoiled by the ""open-world"" paradigm, but still I wish I could have explored these beautifully designed levels more. To be fair, what limited exploration is available is rewarded by gaining power-ups of various sorts. My major frustration with this game centers on particular encounters that seem out-of-balance. I found encounters that involved Mourners and/or a swarm of Stranglers incredibly frustrating. I get it that you have to be constantly dodging, but when you can barely get a 3-combo off, the combat just gets tedious and punishing. If you're not into twitch melee, think twice before buying this game.All-in-all I was impressed by what Dontnod was trying to do here, even if they did not entirely succeed. It makes me want to check out their latest project, Life is Strange.			"

												The gameplay really brings this game to a grinding halt.  It also helped me fester on the massive number of invisible walls, the platforming/climbing that revolves around following yellow arrows on where to go next (because they made only very specific paths climbable with no choice really).  The story was relatively engaging for an action game, but the combat was terrible, and the world felt stale (inv. walls and terrible exploration climbing). Especially just coming from an Arkham game and DMC combat, this combat is just terrible comparatively.  The field of view is so small, that the enemies that climb up on walls and pounce on your don't feel like a challenge, they're just annoying (whereas in many other games, the camera zooms out so you can use your wits to plan).  The combos are customizable, but not the way you execute them, just what happens after you do them.  For instance, one combo is always X,X,X but you can choose to make some X's heal or some X's damage, which was kinda cool.  The combos often break after you dodge enemies (which is very often, there is no ""counter"" button, you must just dodge), so it only feels like luck whenever you get a long combo off.I've played so many games that do all these things better, that it wasn't even close to worth seeing a ""sorta kinda cool"" story (it's not really).  It's just a philosophical question of what memories really mean and if they define use ... etc etc.  I had much more fun playing many other fighting/brawler/combo/hack n slash games recently, Arkham games, DMC, Darksiders, Marlow Briggs, and I'm sure I'm leaving off some other ones.

The GoodThe game features a colored female protagonist but without all the nonsense: Nilin plays a powerful role rather than a sexualized one lacking a great deal of autonomy as one might usually see with female characters.The game features a rather unique visual style, taking elements of current life and remixing it (haha) with ideas of what the future may look like. It helps it feel more as though it could exist and that it's near in the future.The game's style is also very cohesive, bringing in visual effects such as glitching and static. Envionments throughout the game are highly detailed. The game makes an attempt to create as life-like and realistic an enviornment as possible. Various buildings are spattered with graffiti as well. Memory remixing and the addition of the combo lab* help to break up the video game formula. I.e. combos are decided by you (+1 for player autonomy) rather than preset, and you feel you have control over the story rather than simply following along with it. The game introduces various Sensen based elements that help break up the staleness The game has a good story* and with it being based on memories and memory-manipulation, you are reminded that people are their memories. It's very easy to understand and the ending helps tie it all together. Beautiful soundtrack. Soundtrack also plays around with glitching. Voice acting is great most of the timeThe game offers up a great opportunity to look at 3D character models and a relatively large catalogue of concept art. *See: negatives. The NeutralThe ending is rather open-ended. The story doesn't play too heavily into Nilin's backstoryThere are four memory remixes in totalEvery episode after episode 0 begins with Nilin monologuing. The Bad Combat is repetitive and slightly dodgy (haha)Combo lab does little to truly effect the gameplay. You're allotted less choice than you think you're being presented with. The game seems to make up for it's easiness by dragging out fights. Nilin's character design is somewhat boring. She pairs a cropped jacket with jeans and a pair of gladiator boots. While every character design takes from the present and remixes it for the future, Nilin's design is the only that seems to feel out of place. When the game introduces new mechanics (like new S-Pressens), you are often interrupted during fights, which can get annoying. Main characters' voices were on point, but side characters were generally hit-or-miss, often coming off as forced or awkward. Main characters sound more as if they're from the UK or US, rather than Neo-Paris (I personally don't mind this too much). You're heavily limited to a small area of Neo-Paris, and this could be both good and bad. It's in the bad list because I'd've loved to have seen the rest of the map they so heavily detailed. Camera is a bit fidgety. Third person perspective is fine, but throghout the game, the camera tends to move quite a lot into movie-style camera angles. My Personal VerdictOverall, I think this is/was a game with a lot of wasted potential. You are presented with 1.a great concept and unique style, 2.great visuals and soundtrack, 3.a well rounded female protagonist, but it's slightly ruined by bad gameplay. I love this game regardless, but I think it could have been a lot better. At the moment, there's little incentive for me to play through this game again besides being able to see the map one more time. 8/10 for visuals and story, 5/10 for gameplay. I'd only recommend the game if you can get it on sale. You may not get a lot of play time out of this game and $30 is a bit steep with all things considered. TL;DR for the mad eye lazy: good game with a lot of wasted potential. Great to look at amd listen to, but annoying to play. Worth it if on sale, but not for full price.  "

												I really got drawn into this game. The art and surroundings are just beautiful and original and the soundtrack is phenomenal. The story is really interesting and has some current themes, but Nilin's character remains a bit superficial because she doesn't get to have that many discussions. The game is also very straightforward -- so much that it's easy to forget to explore and you can easily miss out on valuable health, focus and story collectibles. This game would have needed some side missions and a more open world. The camera angles are also very restrictive, which is a pity considering the amazing views all around. The combat is monotonous, and I recommend using the controller. The initial feeling and the world kind of gave me the same feeling as the original Mass Effect -- only here you don't have freedom to roam, no side missions, no discussions, and therefore it doesn't really compare. It's frustrating how they invested so much in the art, music and background story only to make it so straightforward and limited. Still, if you like a good  immersive story with beautiful visuals, I recommend it. I truly hope they make a sequel where the shortcomings are addressed.			"

												The graphics and the basic storyline are wonderful, some of the best I've seen. However, the gameplay is very linear and the fight controls are horribly convoluted. It seems more like a straightforward console game adaption for the PC, and is somewhat of a let-down after playing ""Life is Strange"", which was far more engaging.I've completed about 20% of the game and will most likely uninstall.

												A unique game with an interesting premise.

												This is not an awful game. This is however, in my opinion, a very boring game. People have pointed out that the combat is weak before and it is, but it is weak because of the lack of moves available. through most of the game you can expect to be limited to 3 or 4 different combos which gets really repetitive really quickly. The enemies are very samey with little in the roster to add any variety. The plot is... ok I suppose. Two of the main characters are called Edge and Bad. Yes really. And it all seems a bit predictable as the plot weaves towards its conclusion. There are certain sections where the main character gets inside peoples memories and ""remixes"" them. This sounds better than it actually is with only one correct outcome so instead of being creative, the player is reduced to trial and error, adding or taking away certain pre-defined elements in the scene until they find the correct combination.Also in the game are a lot of short platforming sections. The movement of the platforming feels very rigid and stiff with no real feel of flow like other genre leading platforming games have (Tomb Raider, Uncharted etc).On the plus side, the game as a whole isn't terrible although I really despised the combat by the end of the game. The graphics really are very lovely with varied looking environments that try to keep the game feeling fresh as things progress. The music is quite strange with what I felt was a very uneven distribution of it through the game. Sometimes there is a lot, sometimes less so and sometimes it doesn't really seem to suit the scene or comes across as shoehorned in. What music there is though is mostly rather good with grand orchestral sweeps and nice compact peices. I find it hard to recommend this game to anyone apart from someone who was totally new to the 3rd person adventure genre. Which, as you can imagine, is practically nobody.			"

Remember Me—a story set in Paris, about 65 years from now. The world has changed. Smart phones and tables have been replaced by Sensen: a device that links to people's brain directly and stores the memories. The giant corporation—Memores, or somesuch—that invented it now controls everything and is performing unethical experiments on humans.You are Nilin, a woman with a pretty body and ugly face; a ridiculously athletic memory thief, who after a binge drinking session in prison can't remember a damned thing. Your job is to fight the enemy, steal or edit people's memories, and do comical acrobatics on ledges of tall buildings.  Remember who you are... and to figure out why the world in 2085 decided to use batons instead of guns.---This game is fantastic. I forget how much I paid for it, but were I to price it, $40–$50 is fair. The setting, premise, and great visuals of the game hold it against a few glaring plot holes and arcade, comical feel in battles and movement.Cons:  Camera movement takes a bit to get used to  Several glaring plot holes and minor issues with characters. Even though your character feels compelled to actually destroy the enemies, it's not too clear why she'd feel that way and you're propelled through the plot simply because there's nothing else to do. You're saving a damaged world, but it's unclear your methods are correct.  There are sound issues in a couple of places  Most of the movement is done by leaping across ledges, with your Sensen showing where to leap next with a marker. So you're essentially pressing the button the game tells you to press—no thinking is involved.  A central battle dynamic is either kicking or punching your enemies. You can setup combos to regain health, reduce power cool down, or do extra damage. This allows for varying fighting styles, depending on which enemy you're fighting, but in most of the fights, instead of watching the enemy movement, I was looking at the bottom of my screen, trying to execute a combo. This has an arcade feel that I don't enjoy much and the fights in the game were lackluster button mashing marathons.Pros:  Great premise: the company who made brain-to-electronics interface now pretty much controls the world. Very plausible.  Believable and immersive setting: the ""future"" is depicted quite realistically (aside from no longer using guns). All signs and many devices now appear as holographic augmented reality. There are serious issues due to climate change. A giant corporation owns everything good that's left in the world.  Unique gameplay dynamic with respect to editing people's memories—I only wish there were more of that.  Great visuals.  The story is interesting to follow, and holds up despite a few holes and cliches.  Despite being a bit muddy, the characters are believable and aren't annoying.  Great variety with how to kill your enemies: you have configurable kick+punch combos, 5 powers, and sort-of-a-gun.In summation, I thoroughly enjoyed the game. It has several unique elements and a great story. It's worth the money and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone.			"

												If you are looking for a high concept single player action game with a focus on story then I highly recommend this game. The combat is an Arkham City style beat-em-up with a clever combo building system that let's you customize your fighting style. The aesthetics and art direction are beautiful and the plot is surprisingly compelling, basically Deus Ex meets Inception. This game got like no press at all so check it out if you are interested, I doubt you will be disappointed			"

												I was cautious about buying this game because I'd heard mixed things. It is now on my list of top favourite games of all time. The gameplay itself is ho-hum but the story is absolutely beautiful. It's truly a pity that this game isn't open world because the artwork is spectacular. Instead it is very linear and leads you around by the hand the whole way through which is annoying. However I found the characters and themes in this game more than made up for that. Nilin is a wonderful protagonist, the perfect blend of confident and 'holy crap what the hell did I get myself into?' Most of the villians are well fleshed out and given believable motivations; Kid Xmas and Doctor Quaid being the exceptions. Most of the characters I wanted to see more of and I would welcome a sequel or even a prequel.  One of the things I loved about this game was that it forced you to look at your actions, to question whether or not you/Nilin are making the right decision; whether the outcome is worth the cost. The ending is very satisfying, heartwrenching but full of hope at the same time. The music was very atmospheric and I was completely sucked in. Would definitely recommend.			"

												Though I haven't finished the whole story, I think I've gathered enough to write an effective review. This game is brilliant. Set in a beautifully designed dystopian, cyberpunk-esque world, you take on the role of Nillin. She wakes up in a facility to find that she cannot remember her past. You travel through this (once again, beautiful) world trying to uncover the secrets of Nillin's past, while also fighting against Memorize, a company making money by digitalizing human memories. The story is fascinating, the characters are interesting (particularly Nillin, there doesn't seem to be much development on the other characters), the combat is fluid and just simple enough, and the design is fantastic. This may be one of the most well-written, well-designed games I've ever played. 10/10			"

												Okay, overall, I thought this game had a good concept, okay execution, and pretty good voice acting.  Possible mini-spoilers so please read at your discretion. If you're looking for a game with a beautiful word, you'll find it in the city of Neo-Paris. But what disappointed me upon first play was that the world was not as interactive as I thought it would be, considering how much detail went into interesting rooms and objects that you merely passed by during gameplay. Like the robots that scatter around the city of Neo-Paris. I wish they served more of a purpose within the game because they're everywhere, but they're not mentioned at all in the storyline.To be honest, everything about this game felt like a half-full & half-empty glass of milk. After the first major secret of Nilin's past was revealed, most of the rest of the game became predictable. I liked Nilin as the main protagonist, but I believe that a lot of the side characters just lacked reason for their actions, or they just... weren't very convincing as villains or stricken heroes. The reasons didn't convince me and felt forced. And also, I felt like the game was trying to do TOO much. There were too many things that the game wanted to include in the story and that's where all the stuff fell flat because it got boring after awhile, and the story seemed overstretched. Instead of episodes and quantity in information, they should've gone with quality and precise information. The explanation of some back characters also weren't very clear, and a lot of characters who were important in one episode were forgotten for the rest of the game or came back at awkward or weird parts of the story. The messy use of the side characters kinda made me confused and bored as well because frankly, after that character was gone so long, I had stopped caring about them and any character deaths weren't very sad for me. And the emotions and relationships felt fake since we only saw that character once or twice before so there was not really much of a connection that had me emotionally invested in the game.Anyway, that's just some of the bad things that I had to get off my chest. Regarding the good things, like I said, the world is very beautiful. The first major plot twist was very interesting (though the rest proved predictable afterwards). Nilin was excellent as a main protagonist suffering from amnesia, and I thought that was very clever because we, as the players, could learn along in the game as she did. The mechanics of the memory remixes were very fun because I made♥♥♥♥♥♥go wrong just for the heck of it, and I wish they included more options for the memory remixes to create more outcomes. Either way, I really liked the whole ""memory hunter/remixer"" thing going on. Another thing I really liked was the parkour stuff, climbing walls and scaling odd structures. Wish they could've also incorporated more of that actually...Anyway, I'm really in-between in the game. I think it's a good game to play once, but even then, I don't think it's a very memorable game other than its interesting concept and pretty art. I'd recommend getting it on a sale if possible.			"

Thanks to it, you don't need to focus that much, so you have a lot of time to admire the amazing design, graphics and animations.- A little bit too linear. I have nothing against linear games but being prevented from going back by a door closing behind you once in a few minutes is just too much.- Remixing memories is an awesome idea, but there are only four or so remixes.

An enormous potential destroyed by old game design: no physics, only scripts, the world is not coherent (i.e. you can make 6meters long jumps and a 30cm barrier can stop you, wtf?), the story it-self is not coherent.

What it turned out to be is a linear-corridor walker with radio-exposition-dude and occasional groups of enemies spread thin enough for me to anticipate them for variety only to immediately regret it anytime because the combat is boring as well. Again, looks fabulous, but plays incredibly dull.And now I feel bad for downrating this game because I really would want to like it. But... I just can't.			"

												TL,DR: While Remember Me is definitely a bit rough around the edges, it delivers on an interesting story, and generally enjoyable gameplay.First, the rough patches: the controls are sluggish and unreliable (though usually not to a game breaking extent), every five minutes you'll have to drop everything you're doing to listen to someone force feed you another chunk of exposition, there are times when the audio just cuts out for no reason (on my machine Alt-Tabbing out and then back in fixed this), the camera occasionally points in entirely the wrong direction for you to see what you're doing, and parts of the level/game design can be fairly unintuitive.Next, the redeeming qualities: level design as far as the general atmosphere is fantastic at communicating the feel of the city of Neo-Paris and the fictional times in which the game is set, memory remixing is a blast (it's like a choose your own adventure version of a cutscene), the overall plot is compelling and definitely takes a few exciting turns.Last, what this game is not: if you're really into TPS combat games like Devil May Cry (or even just Legend of Kora) Remember Me's combat system will leave you sorely disappointed at it's repetitive and surprisingly inflexible nature, if you really enjoyed free climbing as found in Assassin's Creed (or even Splinter Cell) you should remember that no matter how it looks Remember Me only doesn't have a free climbing system, it has one that only let's you travel on very specific routes that aren't necessarily obvious to the casual observer.So, do I recommend this game? It's definitely worth a look for the story and the developers deserve to be supported for the thought and innovation they put into the remixing mechanic. Is this a particularly good game? If you aren't bothered by it's flaws and limitations, it's a pretty enjoyable experience, otherwise I recommend waiting to pick it up when it's on sale.			"

												This game is one of the worst main stream game I have played in a long really time. The combat system is bad, voice/mouth sync is nonexistant, the story is boring and nothing really happens. This game was not worth its money.The only thing I liked about the game is the combat music, whenever it decides to play properly, and the holograhpic signs that shows up everywhere, I'd love to have those IRL.

												I really enjoyed this game.  It was very stable -- something you cannot take for granted in today's gaming environment.  A great inventive story.  Game mechanics/controls worked well.  Graphics looked great to me -- although I'm not super picky about that anyway.  It was like you were participating in a big budget movie.  I'd definitely recommend this game.Some minor criticisms (mainly for the developers) about a couple of common annoyances in games:a) non-skippable really long cutscenes (several minutes).  If I'm having trouble a with a particular sequence right after a long cutscene and I have stop -  I don't really want to be forced to watch the cutscene again (and again ...).b) When you die, the game does not remember your combo configs.  They go back to what they were at the last checkpoint.  It was a bit annoying on a difficult sequence to have to reconfigure the combos after every time I died.  In frustration to get around this, I reduced the game difficulty temporarily just so I could get through the sequence because I was tired of repetitively having to reconfigure the combos.  This was only a factor for me in two spots in the game.But this game was a great deal of fun and the pros far outweighed the cons for me.			"

												This is the only game I've bought that compelled me to write a review... that being said, I think that Remember Me is severely underrated due to its mixed reviews. In my opinion the negative elements of the game were looked at too harshly and took away from the greater positive elements. The soundtrack and visuals are amazing, as well as the story having the ability to pull the player in. Some elements of the game were too repetitive such as the combat system: It was very interesting and cool at first but becomes really boring. But besides that, If you don't mind ""on-rail"" games, I think the story told, as well as the gameplay are worth the buy. 9/10			"

												I really wanted to like this game... I really did. But no go.Where should I start? First off I got it on sale along with the DLC pack, and I'm sorry I even bought it.I have not completed it yet, but given its mishaps it's unlikely I will.Let me explain in it in PRO / CON:PROs:The game itself is graphically pleasing, it has a certain style to it (even the graphic glitches add to the flavor of the story telling)Sound and soundtrack are fit for the whole theme of the gameCinematics are well madeWorks properly with SteamCONs:The game has VERY FLAWED controls with a mouse and keyboardMovement and interactions are awkwardThe combat system is downright machinatedMemory mixing UI/controls are uninspiringStory is meh... It could be that my expectations were too high from the trailers (even with 80% off the purchase price)Reading the Mnesist Memories doesn't really add any depth to the story or any information of value in helping with gameplayMost of the time in the game is spent either in stupid (and unwieldly) combat or moving from one place to the next as you try to piece together story elementsIt feels like a french movie, almost looks interesting but in the end everything is left hanging because they don't know how to make a proper ending.Like I said, I really wanted to like the game but in the end because of its poor design/execution I'm going to see if I can get a refund.

												It's hard to say whether or not I actually like this game.To begin with, all is good. The story is interesting, the combat (where you customise your own combos) is fun and engaging, and the protagonist is that rare thing in video games: a well-written female character.Then after about two hours, it starts getting uninteresting. Not boring by any means, but just not interesting. The game's fun enough when I play it, but the combat gets repetitive, and I have no desire to load it again once I close it. So I don't even know if I'll carry on past the point I've reached.I suggest you get this on sale.			"

												Neat concept, poor execution. The big thing dragging this game down is the combat, it's just really tedious and frequent. The plot is also pretty dumb, and the memory-stealing and ""remixing"" should have been a lot more prominent. Also, the level design would have benfitted from being a bit more open, giving multiple paths and making you think a bit rather than just having a linear route to follow. I like what they seemed to be going for, but I just can't recommend the game they actually made.			"

												No idea why this game has such a bad rating. Game has a rich, imersive story set within a sci-fi lover's fantasy that combines the futuristic elements we all love from well known stories such as aeon flux with the current archetecture of France as if fantasy and reality simply melded. On top of all this the voice acting is pretty decent and the gameplay fluid and very responsive. Fighting elements of the game remind me of batman arkam asylum with  a twist as Remember Me allows combos to be customised to give different affects. Climbing aspects of the game are used very well and show the depth and detail of the world Killin is making her way through. This is one of the most well rounded and balanced games in terms of playability, story and concept I have played in a while, worth picking up full price if not during a steam sale.			"

												If you are a fan of third person hack n slash/beat em up's then you have played this before and you won't be playing this game for anything unique in the gaming department. The combat is mediocre, where you are prompted when to jump out of enemies attacks and as the game progresses they get bigger, have new skills and you fight more and more. The platforming was easy, constantly being told where to go, having my hand held all along the way and I think I died maybe once from a platforming sequence. What makes Remember Me a good game was the science fiction and the world you play in. Whils the world is very linear and you are confined to tight paths, just go along the ride and experience the world as the set designers and artists made it. The concept in the game is also pretty badass and kept me playing till the end. Whilst the gameplay and story was rather mediocre, the concept and the world kept me playing. I give it 6/10			"

The gameplay, it's balanced, you run then you fight, run and fight and then you sneak into someone's mind, that's what I found interesting, I like finding every piece of mind, every object I can see to see the result of changing one simple thing, finding the bug is satisfying.I would give it a 8 out of 10, cuz even tho it's a good game, it's not perfect, plus some parts... just some parts are kind of boring or repetive (it's something that every game has tho so it's not a major problem)			"

If you remember what it was like growing up with a PS1 or PS2, and seeing all of the new IPs that were poping up left and right, the excitement of picking up a game and wondering what it was all about, Remember Me captures that feeling perfectly.

												I got this game as a bonus for a Humble Bundle so from my perspective it was essentially free.  That being said I feel like I overpayed.Do you like button mashing?  Do like linear gameplay? Do you like absurdly frustrating boss fights that result in you uninstalling the game (I can't be the only one).  If so this game may be for you.Aesthetically speaking I like it. The visuals are gritty and twisted, the style is mostly contigous. The story leading up to the first boss was definitely intriguing, the concept has potential. This however is the unrealized version of these things.The combat is in fact dreadful. Yes you can technically ""craft your own combos"" but what that really entails is struggling through an undescribed, unintuitive interface to select between different versions of the same thing, the only thing that really matters is that you can consistently hit the dodge button. This part was somewhat expected and so I was starting to overlook how tedious and unfulfilling the combat was, I mean hell I was on a role.  Then it happened...So I alluded to it previously but when you are building your combos in the interface different buttons map to different moves.  You don't get a legend or explanation for which button is which move however and in fact they are represented by these little symbols.  Meh, after getting your face eaten a few times you can manage to pull off one of the two combos you've created and then repeat until the battle is over.  Then you get to the boss, suddenly the tone changes from futuristic memory thieves to what might as well be wrestling, it's that over the top.  At first you even get to follow the same lack luster combat techniques used for previous encounters and then suddenly ... horribly ... in order to proceed ... you must respond to quick time events (okay you're saying, that's not the end of the world) but instead of the events being dictated with something you could recognize they are instead flashed on the screen as the cryptic symbols from the combo configuration screen.  So basically you have a fraction of a second to attempt to correlate that little symbol with one of the buttons on whatever device you may be controlling the game with, good luck.♥♥♥♥ this, ♥♥♥♥ them, ♥♥♥♥ quick time in general, but especially ♥♥♥♥ this cryptic♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t quick time that demands you memorize their little crappy symbols and how they map out.

												This game is really awesome, it's really nice and pretty much something new.You don't have weapons (like guns and grenades) but you have tools which you can use to fight enemies.At first i thought it was something like Deus Ex Human Revolution, and some mix of assassin's creed, but really it's nothing like that, and i am really looking forward for a sequel or prequel of this game.Pros:- Graphics- Story- Gameplay- This girl can fight really GOODCons:- Some minor bugs that can happen, so you get stuck at some parts in the game- A bit priceyConclusion:- Buy when on sale			"

												This is your standard thrid person fight, puzzle and jump game.  That being said Pros, Cons and other.Pros-Nice graphics, her jacket acully moves when she does, including not in cut scenes.-Combo system is weird but fun and lets you tweak it to your liking.-Finding items is usefull but not required so if you miss it no big deal.-90% of the map is resonable laid out and intuitive on how to get thru.-Good story.-Great atmosphere.-While the combat isn't revolutionalry it does manage to feel fun and have a good flow most of the time.-Has a decent fun factorCons-The other 10% of the map-Short (11 hours on hardest difficulty for me, and I wasn't rushing)-Jumping puzzles are so easy there boring.-Lack of replability, this is a one and done unless you are a completionist.-Could use a higher dificulty settingOther-Needs a controller			"

												The stylish Remember Me will take you on a heavily guided tour of the striking cyberpunk city of Neo-Paris.Remember Me is not an open world game in spite of how tempted you will be to explore the highly detailed world of Neo-Paris.  Your journey from the slums and sewers to the corporate megaplexes of Neo-Paris will be strongly guided by little yellow chevrons that highlight what path to take and to which ledges to navigate.  Deviating from the recommended path will yield rewards of health and Focus (mana) increases, but the immediate dead ends will soon guide you back to the prescribed path.  While this seems like more of a deliberate design decision than a shortcoming of the game, I think it is important to know what to expect from Neo-Paris.  What you see will be beautifully detailed, but it will be exactly what the designers want you to see.The combat is based on a combo system and while you cannot alter the sequence of punches or kicks, you can choose with which boons to imbue them.  As your character progresses you will be able to unlock punches and kicks that replenish health, deal extra damage, shorten cooldowns of your special abilities, or amplify the effect of the previous attack.  Although you will frequently be outnumbered by foes that interrupt your combos, their attacks are broadcasted in such a way that you can dodge them to hopefully continue your combo on the baddie you have singled out.  Successfully completing a long combo will yield extra PMP (XP used to unlock Pressens, the perks you use to enhance your punches and kicks) and finish off enemies faster.  Bosses will often be surrounded by these lesser mobs and defeating them helps build the Focus you will need to execute your S-Pressens (special attacks) to overcome the bosses' immunities and ultimately defeat them.  After depleting a boss's health, you'll enter a sequence in which you stylishly deal the finishing blows to your enemy, but you'll have to satisfy QTE prompts to dispatch him.  Failing any prompt will kick you back to the regular combat where you will have to whittle down the last fraction of the boss's health again before attempting the QTEs.  While people may not appreciate QTEs, I enjoyed the cinematic flare with which they allowed me to finish off a boss.The S-Pressens mentioned earlier are unlocked at specific points in the story and it is up to you to figure out which ones are best used against specific enemies to exploit their weaknesses or overcome their immunities.Also at specific to points in the plot are the memory remixes wherein the player is tasked with reviewing an NPC's memory and changing details of it to alter how an event is remembered.  Rotating the thumbstick of the controller to rewind or fast-forward through memories was a satisfyingly tactile experience (microfilm, anyone?) and although reaching the desired outcome of any memory remix is mostly an exercise in trial and error, the solutions are not as random or obscure as many puzzles of the point-and-click genre.  There are only four of these remixes throughout the game, but they are a welcome improvement on the passive cut scenes they might have otherwise been.Neo-Paris is a fitting backdrop for uncovering a plot whose theme centers around memories.  In a world where the technology allows for the storage, transfer, and manipulation of memories you will be tasked with recovering your wiped memories and thwarting a plot to use this technology to topple the utpoian Neo-Paris.  If doing so in a richly detailed cyberpunk world with some stylish fight sequences and light puzzle and platforming sequences sounds good to you, consider picking up Remember Me.			"

												Its one of best games on the market. Amazing story, amazing graphics, combat is bit repetitive but since its more less fist fighting so no much variety to be expected and also game is linear story driven and not some hack and slash game. If you are looking far a game with amazing story line told not by point and click type game then you found it. It might not be one of those games that glue to the screens for many hours, maybe just for 1-2 play through due to even thou rather deep story but short game play. And after finishing game on credit scene you will lean back and think ""wow that was something""			"

												The game feels like a giant quicktime event.  Its looks good, it tells a story, but the game consists mostly of combo mashing in combat (you can design the combos but it really doesn't matter what how you do), quicktime events where you must press one of the 3 combat buttons, and perfectly linear platforming where although the stuff your climbing is identical to all the other stuff around you but you are able to climb this particular stuff in this path because there's a little yellow arrow telling you too.

												This is a game that could have been. It has an interesting premise about playing around with memories which sadly isn't what the gameplay is focused around.If the memory scrubbing sequences was 80% of the game instead of fight scenes I think it would've been much better.Play it if you liked Batman's Arkham Asylum fight style.

												I didn't like the game mechanics. But if you treat it as a visual novel--no, that doesn't work either; the story is not compelling. But everything else, especially details of the worldbuilding, wants to be judged by the standards of canon cinema, not television or games. Set it to Easy and subtitled French, play it on rails, and eat up the eye and brain candy.I'd say replay value is very low, but here I am playing through it a second time.			"

												I've wanted Remember Me for a while and got it at one of the last sales at a discounted price.So far, it appears to be a straightforward 3rd Person adventure.It feels like a rails game since its not an open world. That is, you're guided rigorously to the next goal. The only deviation is the occasional hunt for collectibles/boosts.The memory remixing is pretty cool since its not as straightforward as you'd think. You can't just change everything, it needs to be a specific combination of items. It's a different take on the rewind/fast forward time manipulation mechanics. Outside of that, the combat feels like typical button mashing, combo building, dodge mechanics. From there, the art direction is cool. Futuristic Neo-Paris. Nothing you really haven't seen before.I recommend this game if you can get it on discount. It's not going to break any ground and probably only has 6-7 hours worth of content.			"

												Fews games have a distinct sense of style, Remember Me is one of them.  The environments and charater design both serve to strengthen the story rather than distract from it.  The story itself is incredibly enganging, a sci-fy or tech noir tale that leads to a satisfying conclussion.The game play works well, even though if it is not my prefered style of games.  It feels and performs like a console game and I was glad that I had a controller to enjoy it.  I would guess that keyboard and mouse would be less enjoyable.  At times the battles in the game tended toward lasting too long and I would say that, at times, they felt a bit tedious.  Boss battles also suffered from the same problem.  It took work to figure what was the correct strategy for some of the big fights.  Then it took practice to be able to execute the strategy successfully.These negative points however, were not enough to detract from what was a memorable gaming experience.  Take the time to discover this game and emerse yourself in this dark future Paris.			"

												Highly reccomend.Albeit the gameplay can be difficult to get accustomed to at first, the world is so incredibly immersive. The story is highly captivating with twists and turns in every episode (8 total). Best way I can sum it up without spoilers:The year is 2084, and your are Nillin, a political prisoner in The Bastille, an underground fortress built to contain NeoParis' greatest enemies. The city has been taken by storm by Charles Cartia Wells' invention of the Sensen, a small hollographic chip that uploads all of the wearer's memories to a cloud storage site where they can be shared, accessed, or hidden forever. Take Nillin through the city as she tries to reclaim her memories which were stolen and restore order to the dystopian city.			"

												Picked this game up as part of he humble bundle.Pros:-Interesting concept (Memory mix)-Good artstyle-Great soundtrack-Interesting story (Distopia with memory and such)-Great animation-Interesting combat style. (You can mix your own combos and such)-Gives you a ""cinematic"" feel-Well done enemy design. (Most enemies)Cons:-Combos are very unpolished. (Maybe its just me but I can't get the game to flow. The combos stops whenever I switch targets and theres no simple way to deal w/ lots of enemeis except to blow them up with spells)-Terrible tutorials. (No option to turn it off)-Story falls short (A lot ofthe plot are just not that well written and simply doesn't make sense)-The memory mix hardly gets played and is a lot of trial and error-The gameplay itself doesn't really ""fit"" into the setting. (Combats? really? I can understand if its in a VR or something)-Bad enemy design (At one point of the game you will face these elite guards that when you deal damage to them, you also take shock damage back. This forces you to use the regen move sets against them which just cancels out the regen part. In other words you need a combo just for regen if you want to fight them)Conclusion:Meh.This game feels like a game with a lot of potential that just falls short of everything. It feels like a jack of all trades master of none kinda game. It tries to be everything but became nothing really.In short its just a very meh game.5/10 would not recommend			"

												Don't listen to the bad reviews, this game has a cool atmosphere, interesting story, and captivating characters. It gets off to a slow start and the combat is boring until you start gaining your combos and super-abilities, but then it gets a lot more interesting. Especially fun is how you stack your combos and when you use each one as dictated by the circumstances. And by that time, you've explored so much more of future-Paris and gotten sucked into the story that you keep enjoying it.My main complaint would be the camera angles can be frustrating but I learned to work with them. Also, it's very linear similar to Bioshock games, so don't expect open-world Assassin's Creed or GTA. I like open-world a little more, but linear has its place so long as the story is exceptional, which in this game it is.			"

												Highly recommended for those who like cinematic games. The graphics are pretty unique and the combat is relatively similar to your typical beat 'em ups. The game's main feature is the story though, and because of this, everything is practically linear. It's practically impossible to get lost, since many branching paths just lead to a dead end, and the only things you can interact with are the things that progress you through the story. This might make some people lose interest, but because the story is quite immersive, it makes up for the linearity. Combat is pretty straightforward since you only have 3 options: punch, kick, or dodge. You'll then be able to equip special powers into combo strings, which can help you hit harder, heal yourself, or even grant special ability cooldowns. You gain all of these as you progress through the game, and each chapter practically (and conveniently) introduces a new element up until the finale. Animation is rather fluid and satisfying to watch, making for a rather entertaining experience whether you're playing or watching the game. Controls are a bit wonky at times though, but the game is quite forgiving and leaves you at a place close to where you left off in the event that you die. Camera angles can get a bit weird too, but only in certain spots without any events going on at the time. Overall a great experience.			"

It's not the most open world experience and a little bit linear but being a relatively newcomer to these kinds of games, it works really well for me. The graphics and storyline, as others have mentioned, are stunning. If you play in 3D, it's very impressive. I've paid way more and had way less fun, let's put it that way.In only a couple days now, I find myself putting down my regulars and wanting to come back to it more.

												So far, so good.Some framerate issues, but im sure it would iron itself out if i installed on my SSD.Lots of Environment climbing, ala Assassins Creed; but not free form. There are only sections that can be climbed, but for some reason this game focuses on the traversal almost as much as the fighting. Fights are pretty predictable, at least in placement. New open area after climbing around buildings? Fight some dudes.Combos can be made by YOU, as you unlock different strikes. there are 4 types of attacks, with around 8 different options of each, as you play and unlock through pummeling many many foes.The story is a bit odd, but then again i started the game, then put it down for a few months; so i was a bit confused as where i was going and what the hell all these sewer dwellers were doing wrecking Paris...overall, it was worth waiting to buy this on PC instead of console.

												Remember Me brings to the table an absolutely sublime world known as Neo Paris. The designers have gone all out to craft a world that feels believable but is nevertheless, bursting, with novelty and creativity. Life has been brought to this world by a first rate graphics engine and texture art that produce stunning lighting and sharp detail. The score also merits special mention. Holding everything together is a fairly engaging story with a few surprises up its sleeve. Gameplay includes some novel elements (memory `remixing' and the combo lab, for example) that keep things feeling fresh and made the experience enjoyable--even for someone not usually fond of the `brawler' genre.The main shortcoming of the game is that it holds your hand too much. Everywhere you go, the next move you need to make is pointed out by an obnoxious orange arrow. Hesitate for just a moment during a boss fight, and a window pops up telling you exactly how to exploit the enemy's weakness. This excessive mollycoddling ultimately detracts from the player's sense of agency, making those gorgeous environments feel even more linear than they actually are.My advice: buy the game and enjoy the scenery. Just don't expect Skyrim.My playtime for a leisurely playthrough of this game: 13 hours.			"

												A cyberpunk vision of Paris, France. Remember me is breathtakingly beautiful, from the neon-lit labyrinth of the ghettos to the beautiful Saint-Michel district, almost every location feels like it should have been part of some big-budget animation somewhere. You will find no shortage of dramatic camera panning here. As soon as you walk into a new location and you can be certain you will be presented the eye-candy architecture of this world.Though as beautiful as it is, it is just as dramatically short. With about 7-8 hours of gameplay, you will find yourself on a very direct set of rails, with little to no ability to explore this world. But this shortcomming is made up with a well constructed storyline, an amazing soundtrack, and supringingly unique game mechanics. Bottom line: I'd recommend it, but its probably because I god damn love me some cyberpunk.			"

												If you want a picture of the future, imagine a hand ripping out human memories - forever.Remember Me envisions 2084 as a time when human memories can be manipulated like any physical item, and as such are bought, sold, traded, stolen, etc. much as physical items are. You control Nilin, a ""memory hunter"" - one with the power to manipulate human memories, up to and including large-scale rewrites. Recently wiped of most of her memories while in prison, she escapes and begins fulfilling tasks set to her by the Errorist known as Edge - a mysterious man who seeks the destruction of the privileged upper class the memory technology has created.---So, first off, the character design in this game is a bit lacking. Nilin isn't bad, but there's not a whole lot to really like about her, and no character, overall, is developed a whole lot - not helped by the fact that, due to the theme of memory manipulation, the whole concept of ""character development"" is harder to apply here.The art style is well-done and the text design, in particular, is fantastic. Less can be said about the music, but at least it's not annoying. On a recommendation, I played with French voice acting, and I can pass on the recommendation - even if (like me) your knowledge of French is spotty at best, it helps with the recreation of the Neo-Paris atmosphere.The gameplay...I mean, it's linear, and the combat system clearly has a lot of thought put into it, but gets rather repetitive regardless. Neither is inherently bad, but usually those are used in conjunction with a game focused on story, and that's where Remember Me falls a bit short.The real killer is that the story premise is really quite interesting. Unfortunately, with the relatively short length and lack of character development, most of that potential doesn't go anywhere, and (very minor potential spoilers) the fascinating ethical questions of memory manipulation are essentially tossed aside in favor of a sappy ""people are not complete without their sorrows"" aesop. Not at all what the asking price suggests about the game.I still enjoyed my time with Remember Me, and if all of this has kept your interest so far, I'd advise you to give it a try (probably on sale, though). But if you're having your doubts? Nah.			"

Combat is like an 'Arkham City wanna-be' but comes nowhere near the fluid motion of any of the Batman games.  But if you can get past the first few levels and upgrade your combos it's not so bad.  Actually once I quit trying to play it like Arkham and started playing it for what it was, I started to come around to the combat and enjoy a tad bit.  There are also plenty of platforming moments that are all pretty easy.  They mostly serve to break up the gameplay and show off a wider view of the levels, and let me tell you.....The world of Remember Me is the reason you want to play this game.  When you move from point A to B don't RUN...hold back on the thumbstick a bit and WALK and soak in every bit of the detail.  These guys have made one of the most beautiful games I have ever seen in my life.  The level to detail is staggering and is Remember Me's greatest asset.  That being said, I do wish they would have went the Splinter Cell route instead of the Arkham City route and had more focus on stealth.  This could have been the Starcraft Ghost that we never got.  Can you imagine?!?!?  Oh well, it's still a beautiful game and well worth a playthrough, especially if your a little burnt out on the same ol', same ol' Call of Duty or whatever mainstream game that usually takes up your time.  Do yourself a favor and give it a chance.  It doesn't cost much and worse case scenerio you just don't like it.  I think if you open your mind and look past the clunky combat, and look at the world instead you'll find it's actually damn good.			"

												Good: Gameplay a mix of Uncharted and Batman Arkham. Good story Great visual a interesting vision of the future.Interesting combat great your own combo set it up then when you successfully execute a combo you will be rewarded with health, stamina or boost your special meter.Bad: Feels like a one time play trough game, Linear and the memory manipulation only has one outcome.But my final taught its worth playing especially when its on sale i really like the story and i wish i could have savior it more.

												The setting is your typical scifi dystopia but the story is pretty unique so far. I either wasn't paying attention or it's legit but I did not see a plot twist come about in a later chapter of the game. The world is also incredibly well-crafted and beautiful. The combat is a bit repetitive, like most beat'em ups, but the story overshadows it completely. The rest of the gameplay is spot on, especially the parkour-style climbing. It has a strong female lead, too. Not just ""gun and sexy"" (though she is sexy as well) strong but stands out as her own person against her male counterparts. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good game to play.			"

												I think the story of the game is unique but slow.  It's a shame to me how such a beautifully made world is limited to explore.   Our protagonist, Nilin, seems well rounded in character.  However, going back to being able to exploring the world, it seems odd how she can jump such great distances and parkour like a boss, yet she can't hurdle a 2ft wall.  The world is also not very interactive.  Only the items that will help you progress in the game's story (besides the boxes that boost your health and focus) can be interacted with.  I was expecting a reaction out of some of the robots when I punched or kicked them...nothing.  The same thing happens with the NPCs in Slum 404.  One thing that is a plus and minus is the camera angles.  When it comes to the parkour, some of the POVs are very helpful. Sometimes I couldn't see where I was supposed to jump to next because the computer took over my camera and I had no control of where I was looking (also happens when trying to get a glimpse at the surrounding city).  The architecture is amazing, and it's very hard to admire it because you see only what the designers want you to see.  If you want to play a CyberPunk game that is unique, play this one.  It is fun, but be warned that there is not a lot of freedom in where you go and what you can interact with.  It's good to play through once.  I don't see a point in playing through it again (unless you really want those pesky achievements).  Honestly, a bit of side questing, more interaction with the environment, and a bit more freedom would give this game a much higher replay value.  Just a thought if these developers ever read these things (highly doubt it).  Other than that it's a pretty good game...but for $30, wait until it's on sale.			"

												It feels like a 3D version of an excellent side scroller.  Glad I bought it on-sale. It's just not a world I felt free to explore, it almost plays like an obstacle  course. I really appreciate that it doesn't feel like you are doing a bunch of chores/tasks; there's something sensible they did that removed this annoyance. I wish other games would do the same.			"

												Remember Me?Sure will!An extremely underrated game with a plethora of unique ideas.Maybe not a plethora, I mean there's a lot, the memory remixing will probably be the most innovative...I recommend it. The story is nice, though the twists are a bit... predictable...It only has one DLC and it's not even an ""I win"" DLC, though I do recommend getting it as it makes combat much better by bringing in some really great animation.It does have QTEs but not TOO many, like, they don't do your head in.The leapers are terrifying and I don' like 'em... (""Give me your face!"")You'll have to play the game to find out what context that's in.Music's a bit wierd though... What are they using, a theremin?Overall 9/10 I can even recommend it at full price! (Even though I finished it in 8 hours...)			"

												Remember Me is a game bursting with promise. The stunning visuals of Neo-Paris are an appropriate backdrop for amnesiac ""memory-hunter"" Nilin to leap and fight against, and several unique gameplay mechanics set this game apart from similar titles. Unfortunately, the game never really reaches its full potential. Gameplay is entirely linear, leaving the player feeling more like they're just along for the ride rather than making meaningful choices, and while the storyline hints at some fascinating concepts, the exposition seems rushed and skims over much of the deeper context that really would have brought this world to life. Nonetheless, Remember Me is a great game that brings something new to the table, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys games that have some complexity and story to them.			"

												In a sentence, ""The Giver"" with a twist.This is, first and foremost, a thoughtful title, a provocative title. From the look and feel of its world to its story and music--to even its journal system, where you can read entries on the history of the world, and be notified of ""how many people remembered"" and ""how many people forgot."" It's been described to me as an amazing 7/10 title. I thought that fit quite nicely. It's also one of the better sci-fi movies I've watched in awhile.To clarify, by sci-fi, I mean a movie that uses science-fiction elements to ask a philosophical question about the things that make us human. In this case, the question is about memory.Having said that, my biggest complaint with the game is that certain combat puzzles range from ""oh, that's fun"" to ""WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ DO YOU WANT ME TO DO.""I really, really, really hate quick-time events, especially in a world as beautiful as this one. That aside, I wish there had been more thoughtful puzzles involving memory manipulation, even though every manipulation event made me feel very uncomfortable--like I was violating someone's private space.

												It's difficult to give this game a thumbs down, but it's also difficult to reccomend - especially to anyone familiar with action fighting games. Remember Me has great artistic direction and interesting philosophical ideas, but an extremely lackluster combat system and hand holding platforming hold it back immensly. It ends up being a game that would have felt better as a film.Combat is the biggest issue - it starts with the interesting idea of customizing combos for the use of different abilities. Unfortunately, these customizations are actually rigid - you repeat the same four combos over and over as follows (xbox controls):XXXYXYXYXYYXYYYYYYXXXXYYou can change what each button press does (extra damage, self healing, special cooldown), and activate five specials to combat enemies. The one redeeming quality is that the specials have a tactical use against the varying enemy types, which I eventually enjoyed. My personal problem was that this payoff only came from the repetion of those combos - it is droll. TL:DR - If you just like story, this game is cool, put it on easy. If you want solid gameplay, seek elsewhere.			"

												A fun, if linear, action game with an interesting, if convoluted, story. Great graphics and wonderful art direction are a high point. Sometimes boring/frustrating combat. Combat can devolve into button mashing if you arent careful, but even then the extent of the combat system is use one of the same 4 combos all the time and hit ""A""  to dodge every attack.The game is quite linear, and it seems like you're almost on rails for most of it. There are hardly any detours from the main path and not much to explore in this beautiful world. Would have worked marvelously as an open world game with some parkour mechanics such as those in Mirror's Edge. The existing climbing and jumping feels somewhat stiff and not as fluid as, say, the Assassin's Creed series, and for being such a big part of the game, I wish there was more to it than following the premade linear path.Also of note is difficulty. I beat the game on Hard with only a few sections that made me angry. It seems the combat is either you're good at it, or you hate it.The memory remix sections were really cool but underutilized in my opinion. I'd like to have more of them. Cool soundtrack as well.6.5/10. Recommend for one playthrough, but there will be little to bring you back after that.Pros:+Graphics+Art Direction+Cool Soundtrack+Low-ish difficulty (could be a con to some)+Story Heavy+Strong Female ProtagonistCons:-Repetitive combat-Convoluted story that is sometimes difficult to follow-Very Linear-Not much replay value-Camera can be your worst enemy at times-Somewhat stiff climbing/jumping			"

												Remember Me offers a downright stunning cyberpunk Paris environment, interesting lead character and a gripping first few minutes of gameplay. Sadly the game's potential is squandered by a terrible camera, mediocre button-mashing combat, linear/repetitive climbing sections and somewhat hammy dialogue. The saddest part of Remember Me is that the game feels like it could've been an enduring cult classic with some more polish. It's enjoyable enough and worth picking up on sale for the absolutely gorgeous visuals and interesting premise, but I don't see myself going back to play it again in the future.			"

												The camera is iffy, the controls can be annoying, and the animations sometimes plod. Those are nitpicks however. Remember Me builds an immediately engaging world and fills it with interesting enemies, fun allies, and most of all new and interesting mechanics. Utilizing the manipulation of memory is the name of the game and it does it well, using it as a shorthand for superpowers in combat, and doing something truly remarkable elswhere. While by no means perfect, the world building is there, the writing is there, and the ingenuity is there. It's worth a play for game mechanics alone, but the story should pull you along as well.			"

												I got this game as a bonus for a Humble Bundle so from my perspective it was essentially free.  That being said I feel like I overpayed.Do you like button mashing?  Do like linear gameplay? Do you like absurdly frustrating boss fights that result in you uninstalling the game (I can't be the only one).  If so this game may be for you.Aesthetically speaking I like it. The visuals are gritty and twisted, the style is mostly contigous. The story leading up to the first boss was definitely intriguing, the concept has potential. This however is the unrealized version of these things.The combat is in fact dreadful. Yes you can technically ""craft your own combos"" but what that really entails is struggling through an undescribed, unintuitive interface to select between different versions of the same thing, the only thing that really matters is that you can consistently hit the dodge button. This part was somewhat expected and so I was starting to overlook how tedious and unfulfilling the combat was, I mean hell I was on a role.  Then it happened...So I alluded to it previously but when you are building your combos in the interface different buttons map to different moves.  You don't get a legend or explanation for which button is which move however and in fact they are represented by these little symbols.  Meh, after getting your face eaten a few times you can manage to pull off one of the two combos you've created and then repeat until the battle is over.  Then you get to the boss, suddenly the tone changes from futuristic memory thieves to what might as well be wrestling, it's that over the top.  At first you even get to follow the same lack luster combat techniques used for previous encounters and then suddenly ... horribly ... in order to proceed ... you must respond to quick time events (okay you're saying, that's not the end of the world) but instead of the events being dictated with something you could recognize they are instead flashed on the screen as the cryptic symbols from the combo configuration screen.  So basically you have a fraction of a second to attempt to correlate that little symbol with one of the buttons on whatever device you may be controlling the game with, good luck.♥♥♥♥ this, ♥♥♥♥ them, ♥♥♥♥ quick time in general, but especially ♥♥♥♥ this cryptic♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t quick time that demands you memorize their little crappy symbols and how they map out.

												Remember Me is one of those games that had incredible potential but squandered it with weak, nonsensical storytelling and broken game design.At it's core, Remember Me is a linear, story-driven action-adventure game of a sort we don't commonly see anymore. Think Enslaved: Odyssey to the West and you'll have a pretty good idea what you're getting yourself into. Unlike that game though, Remember Me takes place in a cyberpunk future where the world is dependent on devices called Sensen's that monitor and control memories. This along with several global disasters have created a society where memory is entirely controlled by a corporation called Memorize and while the rich are doing fine, the poor are left broken, living in slums and occasionally losing their minds, becoming what the game calls Leapers because reasons.You play as Nilin, a former rebel who has had her memories erased and now must listen to a mysterious voice in her head telling her what to do. She has the special power to ""remix"" people's memories, essentially altering details to change the outcome and thus, alter a person's thinking.While all of this sounds like a pretty great concept, none of it comes together to make any sense at all. Rebels are fighting against memory control but have these Sensens implanted in them anyway? Why? The limitations of these machines aren't ever adequately explained either. The very first cutscene of the game says that it's basically a  big memory backup machine but it becomes very clear, very quickly that people actually lose the memories they backup. So it's really a mass storage? Later, it's implied that the machine acts as a big hive mind and shares everyone's memories with everyone but people constantly talk about how they've forgotten things. So, which is it?This wouldn't be such a big deal except altering people's memories is the primary form of combat throughout the game as well as a major plot device used several times. Nilin gets a move called Overload very early on that acts as a finisher but that implies that memories are being shoved into someone's brain and overloading it, right? But other times, she takes people's memories and that doesn't seem to affect her at all. Also, does this mean she's shoving her thoughts and memories into someone else? Wouldn't that tell the enemy what she's doing? Wouldn't that mean she forgets what she's doing? Again, never explained. This is only the start of the inconsistencies as the plot gets more and more absurd, sending Nilin into situations with plot holes large enough to jump through.Not only do the actions not make sense but the themes don't even tie together well. It's not much of a spoiler to say that the theme of the game revolves around memories and how losing them causes us, as a society and individuals, to lose our identity. Yet throughout the game, Nilin ""remixes"" people's memories almost without hesitation. The slight hesitation she does feel at times doesn't end up ever having any resolution either so the whole story winds up just feeling hypocritical.The plot's forgiveable though if the gameplay is alright. The game works as a mix of Uncharted-esque parkour sections and combat sections more than a little reminisce of the Arkham series. It becomes formulaic pretty quickly but it isn't too bad for the first half of the game due to the interesting style of customization. Combat works by executing different combos made up of the X and Y buttons (when using an Xbox gamepad which is HIGHLY recommended). The cool bit is that you can actually customize these combos by giving each button press a different effect. You can't change the pattern of X and Y buttons but you can make certain button presses more powerful, decrease your special attack cooldowns and even recover your health. You unlock these different ""pressens"" by gaining XP. It's a neat little system with a ton of potential. Throw in five special attacks you get throughout the game and even a gun with different abilities and combat can have a lot of variety.The problem is in how restrictive the combat becomes. At first, the enemies are basic enough where you can freely experiment with your different moves and it's decently fun, if not a bit repetitive after you find your groove. About halfway through the game though, it seems as though they ran out of enemy ideas so they made new baddies that only respond to one specific way of killing them. The worst are enemies that hurt you every time you hit them so you need to hit them with only regenerating pressens or else you'll lose health quickly. As regenerating pressens make your combos weaker, battles become extremely tedious and these enemies show up in very nearly every encounter. Suddenly, all of your customization plans go out the window as the developers force you down a single path.The parkour sections range from alright to downright boring and tedious as well. The game is extremely linear with only  minor exploration allowed (think Final Fantasy XIII's endless hallway). The developers tried to break up the monotony by sprinkling collectables throughout every level but since the game is almost entirely linear with narrow corridors, these are pretty easy to find if you give even a minor amount of effort.If you're still reading at this point, you're probably wondering why I haven't discussed remixing memories yet. It's the major marketing piece for the game and is the gimmick that was supposed to be what the game was known for, right? Well, yes, and to be honest, remixing memories was my favorite part of the game. These sections give you access to the persons memory seen as a recording. You cycle through the recording by rotating the joystick, making it feel like you're editing video frame by frame. You have to find certain memory bugs, displayed as visual glitches, which you can than activate to alter the memory slightly. These sections all have an objective so you need to find the specific glitches that will add up to give you the outcome you require. They clearly put a lot of work into these sections as each bug and combination of bugs activated can give you very different outcomes. One particularly memorable one allows you to alter a medical procedure resulting in the death of a variety of people, depending on what you choose to do.Some people will find these too base as the puzzles themselves aren't that challenging but I appreciated the variety of outcomes and enjoyed seeing the little nuances of each sequence. The biggest problem is that there are only four of these in the entire game and they are all plot determined. That's right, the gimmick that the game was marketed for barely lets you use it and never freely.Ultimately, Remember Me is a series of great ideas strung together with terrible implementation. Poorly made enemies, extremely linear gameplay, awful writing and a lack of the game's best feature make this a game to pass on.			"

												I will start off by saying that I would give 6/10 for the game. But let me explain. The one thing that I cannot praise high enough for me is the art style of the game. Everything in the game is really well polished and it is a pleasure to look at. It looks really modern and sci-fi without being too far fetched. The art canvas that are unlocked as you play the game are stunning and a good reward for the play through. Congratulations for the artists and designers for these. With regards to the story, I found the story at times captivating, at others (and most of the time, really) to be a bit obvious. But what I found most interesting was the philosophical discussions and the struggle of the main character when she is still recovering her memory. Having said that, the whole story is very linear. These two points for me were the highlights. Now, some parts of the game that could improve.Although I found the mechanic of allowing you to create your own combos, however limited, it was interesting enough to the point that changing it during a battle could prove very helpful. Having said that, I found the battles to be a bit repetitive and fairly easy. Once you get the mechanic of an enemy or a boss, even on the hard difficulty, it was still fairly easy. With regards to the puzzles like climbing walls, jumping at ledges, climbing pipes, etc, it was a bit simplistic and at times rather frustrating, because as the game is not open world sometimes there were inconsistencies where you can leap up 4 meters from ledge to ledge and sometimes you cannot climb a 2 meters wall where you KNOW there is something behind it. And for me, the most frustrating part was when I was looking for an item (such as health or focus) and because of the linear part, you end up exploring a bit in order to reach the item, which would involve entering rooms to check it out. But if you happen to enter a room that was going to move the story forward, sometimes the door would just close behind you and would not allow you to go back, hence, you will lose the opportunity to get the item. Unless you play the whole game again, because there is only one save slot and the game auto-saves. The memory remix mini-games were quite interesting, although, it is fairly simple to deduce how to solve, or if you are feeling like exploring the alternatives, just try everything, it won't take long for that and might have some interesting side-effects. These parts are very surreal which, again, congratulations to the art team. Overall, for me it was an interesting game and experience, but it felt like a one trip pony, i.e. once you play once, it's enough. The replayability of the game is fairly low, because the second time you play, there won't be much novelty, with the exception of getting the missed items because of locked doors behind you.			"

Remember Me—a story set in Paris, about 65 years from now. The world has changed. Smart phones and tables have been replaced by Sensen: a device that links to people's brain directly and stores the memories. The giant corporation—Memores, or somesuch—that invented it now controls everything and is performing unethical experiments on humans.You are Nilin, a woman with a pretty body and ugly face; a ridiculously athletic memory thief, who after a binge drinking session in prison can't remember a damned thing. Your job is to fight the enemy, steal or edit people's memories, and do comical acrobatics on ledges of tall buildings.  Remember who you are... and to figure out why the world in 2085 decided to use batons instead of guns.---This game is fantastic. I forget how much I paid for it, but were I to price it, $40–$50 is fair. The setting, premise, and great visuals of the game hold it against a few glaring plot holes and arcade, comical feel in battles and movement.Cons:  Camera movement takes a bit to get used to  Several glaring plot holes and minor issues with characters. Even though your character feels compelled to actually destroy the enemies, it's not too clear why she'd feel that way and you're propelled through the plot simply because there's nothing else to do. You're saving a damaged world, but it's unclear your methods are correct.  There are sound issues in a couple of places  Most of the movement is done by leaping across ledges, with your Sensen showing where to leap next with a marker. So you're essentially pressing the button the game tells you to press—no thinking is involved.  A central battle dynamic is either kicking or punching your enemies. You can setup combos to regain health, reduce power cool down, or do extra damage. This allows for varying fighting styles, depending on which enemy you're fighting, but in most of the fights, instead of watching the enemy movement, I was looking at the bottom of my screen, trying to execute a combo. This has an arcade feel that I don't enjoy much and the fights in the game were lackluster button mashing marathons.Pros:  Great premise: the company who made brain-to-electronics interface now pretty much controls the world. Very plausible.  Believable and immersive setting: the ""future"" is depicted quite realistically (aside from no longer using guns). All signs and many devices now appear as holographic augmented reality. There are serious issues due to climate change. A giant corporation owns everything good that's left in the world.  Unique gameplay dynamic with respect to editing people's memories—I only wish there were more of that.  Great visuals.  The story is interesting to follow, and holds up despite a few holes and cliches.  Despite being a bit muddy, the characters are believable and aren't annoying.  Great variety with how to kill your enemies: you have configurable kick+punch combos, 5 powers, and sort-of-a-gun.In summation, I thoroughly enjoyed the game. It has several unique elements and a great story. It's worth the money and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone.			"

												I've got many feelings about this game. First of all, Neo-Paris is beautiful and hideous at the same time, the environment that we get to play in is simply stunning. I just wish we could explore more of it, but we cannot, because the game is EXTREMELY linear. There were many places I wanted to access, but the game simply didn't allow me to. You have to follow the path it provides you with and it's painful. A game such as this should allow players to discover at least small bits of the city and interact with characters. Unfortunately that's not how it is. The second big con is that combat is very boring and repetitive at first. It gets more complex and involving once you unlock more powers. The combo system is pretty creative but still I ended up repeating the shortest ones, because long combos are difficult to land without being interrupted. You will come across different enemies, but the variety of them isn't astonishing. Now let's move on to the biggest pros of this game. Visually it's stunning, I loved the aesthetics. Another big advantage of this game is the wonderful music, I'm going to listen to it on regular basis, it's really beautiful. Finally, the thing that I liked the most about Remember Me is the story. The writers deserve a medal, because the plot is the reason why this world is so interesting. It unwinds slowly, but once it reveals all it's secrets-you will feel bad for all the characters. It's a story about sorrow and regret. Neo-Paris is an utopia, where the citizens begin to lose their humanity. It's so touching, but at the same time gives a lesson that bad things will be happening no matter what you do. Do I recommend Remember Me? Oh hell yes, but keep in mind that it's not a game for you if you enjoy exploration. It's a game that you should play just to go through the amazing story. Remember you soon!			"

												Sure the parcouring is maybe not the most exiting part of the game nor is it innovative, but the incredible graphics of neo-Paris as well as the very intriguing story, make this game a unique experience. I personally believe the price tag might be a little exaggerated but if you are lucky to catch this game while on sale, do not hesitate to add this little jewel of ingeniosity to your collection.

TL;DRVisual: Brilliant. This game is GORGEOUS with a wonderfully realised and unique sci fi aestheticMusic: Interesting digitally 'corrupted' orchestral score. Fits very well with the visual aesthetic. Narrative: Interesting thought provoking, overall it is pretty great. It falls short of its potential however, removal of repetitive and lengthy combat sections to have story and world building more competently integrated with the combat would have made this game better.Combat: Competent, but distracting from the plot and needlessly pads out sections. Leaving trash mobs and focusing on plot centric combat would have been preferable. With all of the poor ratings this game received I was a little skeptical going in but the concept was too intriguing to pass up. The concept of playing with memories, backing them up, remixing them, and using them to alter what a person is, was something that I found very compelling. Remember Me does its world building surprisingly competently, with a brilliantly realised visual aesthetic in a cyberpunk dystopic Paris. This extends to the sound track, an orchestral score which is subject to digital artifacts which fits in very well with the overall tone of the game. It also takes the idea behind the technology and runs with it pretty well, seeing what may come of such a technology. I would have liked the game to have gone further with this instead of having such a focus on the combat. The combat is an odd choice, it forgoes guns altogether and sticks with a  hand to hand combat system with the player unlocking attacks which they then construct into custom combos which can then have modified attributes (attacks can deal extra damage, charge up special abilities or heal the player). While this plays well, it does lead to a strange situation where a dystopic corporately controlled security forces wont engage you with more than a baton. Taking guns away does allow more focus on the technology and the story, but perhaps if the game spent more time on the narrative and exploration and characterisation, and less on a combat system, the game would have been for it. This brings me to the biggest issue, the characterisation and story is shallower than the central premise would lead one to believe. This is a great shame as I think it could have been a masterpiece if the focus had been on a narratively driven game, rather than trying to have beat-em-up arcade combat worked into it as well. Overall it wound up surprising me however and I would recommend it.  "

												I constantly wanted to hug Nilin, and I am sure she would not appreciate that. Or maybe she remixed my memories...?Anyway, the story offers a few twists (surprising or not - depending on how familiar you are with storytelling techniques) and is, overall, well told and paced. Neo-Paris is a gorgeous setting, fusing the antique cityscape with high-tech architecture. Very beautiful to look at. Ambient sounds and voice acting add to the atmosphere.Characters behave consistently and have understandable motives. As Nilin has lost her memories, she starts to question her mission as she regains them, making for a good character arch.Moving through Neo-Paris works rather well, the controls are console-y, yet the animation is smooth and camera angles are well chosen, adding to the mood. Generously distributed hints make it quite clear where to go next. Climbing around felt great, like Assassins Creed and Mirrors Edge.Combat worked well for me, too. Challenging, but not frustrating. Some fights require special abilities to proceed - should you be stuck too long, the game offers help automatically. You can mix your own combos with moves that deal damage, heal yourself, or shorted the timers on the special abilities, allowing you to tailor fights to your personal style of playing. Around mid-game, the 3-step combo of healing and timer-resets was my favorite one... Moving around the combat area, attacking and evading enemies is well animated and very fluid.As you play a memory hunter, you get to tap into people memories, and re-arrange them so certain key events are remembered differently. It is a nice integration into the game, and could have happened more often.While the game has a good flow, it is linear. There are no choices in the dialogues, and no choices regarding the actions of Nilin. On the other hand, this allows you to follow the storytelling a bit easier.Annoying bug: the audio system does not play certain sounds; I had to change my sound card configuration to stereo (from 5.1), then the in-game HUD messages played. Still some cutscenes were silent for me - activate subtitles, so at least you know what everyone is talking about.As the game is not overly long, you might want to wait for a discount. Especially on the Combo DLC, which gives you a few additional moves to add (I would not feel they are worth 4 EUR extra). Then if you play the game: give Nilin a hug from me.			"

												I would say that I enjoyed this game very much, however I would caution that it provided a little over 8 hours of play before I finished the game and had nowhere else to go. This was the major draw back and should really only be bought during those sales. on the posotive side the story drew me in and kept me interested, I wanted to finish the game to see where it took me. the combat was enjoyable and constantly changing. the one thing that left me a little dissappointed was that the game was linear and felt like one long tutorial that didn't allow you to open up and test your limits. I feel like there could have been another chapter as you strike out into the world you have created.			"

												It's hard to say whether or not I actually like this game.To begin with, all is good. The story is interesting, the combat (where you customise your own combos) is fun and engaging, and the protagonist is that rare thing in video games: a well-written female character.Then after about two hours, it starts getting uninteresting. Not boring by any means, but just not interesting. The game's fun enough when I play it, but the combat gets repetitive, and I have no desire to load it again once I close it. So I don't even know if I'll carry on past the point I've reached.I suggest you get this on sale.			"

												First let's say I was really hyped before this game launched, and I got this as a gift. This game will run nice on low end macchines. I played through it in my notebook (i7+gt555m) using a xbox360 gamepad and connected to the tv. cons:The game is short. More enemy variation would be nice, a part from the bosses, the generic enemies feel really generic and in the end you feel like you've seen every possible combinations of enemies.I wanted more combosThe towns have too may doors I can't enter, and this make them like empty shellspros:there is a gimmicky way to change the present by altering people memories from the past, it doesn't happen a lot, but it's really coolsome little puzzles, I was able to solve all alone, without looking elsewherefighting stuff is funThe story has a single layer but it's well told.I think this is the first game of the Don't Nod company, and I'm gladly they did it.

												This game is overall very good, but it has some flaws.Story itself is interesting and has some good plot twists. It is told through cut-scenes, and dialogs and monologs while you walk/run/parkour around areas. Characters are well done as well. The setting of the game is spectacular. Neo-Paris is just beautiful and every area is gorgeous and unique. I have played at max settings and every corner of the game was just amazing. After many games I finally felt that it was actual a city with people living in it instead of just place for hero to beat the bad guys. Music was fitting and well executed, especially when you walked into a place where you could see Neo-Paris in its glory, then special music started playing and you just had to enjoy that view.As for the gameplay, for myself it was not the best, but still very enjoyable. Fighting was not easy and you had to pay attention or your health went down quickly. Unfortunately camera was mediocre at best. Sometimes it would be doing exact opposite of what you would have wanted. Fighting could get a bit repetetive even though you can make your own combos, but that basically just change whether you hit opponent harder or you heal yourself or make cooldowns faster. But I did enjoy boss fights which were each different and challenging. They are QTE in the end sequences, i like those, but some might not feel the same. But especially in later stages of the game I was almost forced to run around and just dodge enemies because attacking them would be the end of me.Your character throughout the game unlock special abilites that you can use in combat to gain an advantage. Every ability is different and gives you the edge in some area of combat. You also unlock abilities outside of combat to help you get around the enviroment. Parkour and freerunning is done really well. Always jumped where I wanted to and it was easy and intuitive to use.There are also some riddles to get your brain going. Some are easy some are a bit difficult.But the best part of the game was pretending to be a DJ :D Remixing memories is a cool ability that allows you to change memory of your victim. You tinker with little things, and people and enviroment reacts accordingly, rendering new outcomes. You must ultimately accomplish what game asks you to, but you can get different results while remixing and get even achievements for doing so. If you ""mess"" up, you just rewind and change some things again and new possibility awaits! Great feature, but unfortunately there are only couple of them :(To summarize my experience: It is a beautiful game with a good story and some great gameplay ideas, okay combat and sometimes annoying camera. It is about 8 hours long on normal difficulty.I would give it 8/10Remember you soon...			"

												Gorgeously rendered movie.  But that's all it apparently is, just a movie.  You do not control dialogue, there is only one path, and in some instances you can't even move your field of view to look at the pretty scenery.  The tutorial is overly extensive in some areas(you got a new pressence!  Let us tell you in EXHAUSTIVE detail AGAIN how to use it!), and non existent in others(you unlocked a new combo!  We're not going to tell you how to access it).And I wanted to like this game.  I REALLY wanted to like this game.  You will not get better graphics in this day and age, not in games OR Cinema.  The Art team deserves an award, seriously, the graphics blew my mind.  I bought this because nobody would invest this much into the art and leave the UI complete garbage.  Or...I THOUGHT nobody would, at least.This should have been released as a movie.  it has a solid, interesting plotline with, again, the most gorgeous rendering I have ever seen.

The best parts of the game (like memory remixes) are an interesting device but they don't happen often enough, and the bulk of the gameplay (combat) is incredibly basic, with special moves (S-PRESENS) to mix things up a little.Recommended for anyone who would like to have a different experience from the average Action game in terms of visual style, story, and characters, withouth expecting much of the combat mechanics.We could use more games with a strong female protagonist of color.

												This game is probably one of the underrated of 2013 I have had the pleasure of coming across. The game is not perfect or the best of, but rather is a balanced mix of things. It touches upon a few elements over the course of the game; brawling, exploration and scaling heights and ledges, puzzles, and an interesting memory remix element.I feel if one tries to dig too deep into or wants exclusivity on any of the things the game brings to the table, I feel that is where most disappointment comes in. It is true there are other games out there that do any of its elements better and with more depth, but Remember Me does a decent job of blending these together and telling a story of a world that has fallen from trying to find ways to be perfect in this digitized memories society. This is a game where one needs to take everything in equally and not in pieces.Remember Me is a living form of art. The level design, ambience, culture, scenery, sounds, and music, it's all gorgeous. I have found myself stopping to admire what a world these folks have shared. The ride I was brought along on was quite satisfying from start to finish. Combat in the game is pretty basic, but has intereresting ways to change your combo sets to inflict damage, heal, reduce cool-downs, and chain up previous hits for an added bonus. You also learn other abilities along the way that utilize focus, a type of energy you build up as you damage opponents, and nicely enough, when they damage you, too.The game has an intriguing plot that I was interested in following the whole way through. Plenty of things in-game give you stuff to read up on for subjects not quite explained or just to get more in-depth information on. It's not a long game by any means. One could probably get at least 10 hours from it. Possibly more if you're like me and like to take in the details now and then. Despite this, though, the length felt about right for the direction the story was going. It's a linear game, but that is no flaw by any means. While there is no true freedom of open-world exploration, it's not needed for the type of game this is. In any regard, there is plenty to see and experience along the way if such a thing is not a deal breaker.Normally, I sometimes tend to wait on games for prices to drop as I tend to have a lot on my plate to need to worry about getting any new ones right away. But, I admire the developers of this title for pushing to have a female lead and struggling to find a publisher that would take this game seriously. The sad story was that most turned them down because they felt the game would not do that well. I would look around online for stories about this. I wanted to support them for their efforts and give this game at least a bit more attention than it's currently getting. I really hope to see more of this universe as I can see quite a bit going for it. I normally also don't don't recommendations like this, but this is the first time I really felt compelled to. I hope this little gem finds your way to your collection, should you feel it would be one deserving of such an honor.			"

												This game brings nothing spectacularly new to the table. What it does is very much what Tomb Raider 2013 did; Refine existing ideas. Remember Me doesn't do that quite as well as Tomb Raider did, in my opinion, but it's certainly not a title to miss. The story, is good. Cheesy, but good. Graphically, this game is gorgeous. The set pieces are astounding, and the art and camerawork, mix with the music to give a very Scifi Movie vibe. This art direction and music direction are very consistent throughout the entire game.Nilin the Memory HunterSpeaking of the music, Remember Me features dynamic fight music. Landing a combo successfully on an enemy will cause the music to play louder and more naturally, while getting hit, or losing too much health will cause it to degrade to just the basic beat, or sound like it's ""glitching out"". This creates a sort of reward for doing well, and when the music starts hitting it's high points, and you're on a roll, it feels amazing. The music is on a whole other level. It's a mix of Classical string and brass with digital beats and Synth effects. It comes off as epic, and distorted but in such a way that it accentuates the story.Madame FightAnd now about the combat... I feel the combat is good. There are a few things that cause me to dislike fighting in the game, but it's mostly just annoying enemy types, or too many enemies attacking at once. If I had to sum up the combat in this game I'd say it's like Batman's but the enemies don't wait, or take turns. For some, this is great, and it seem more realistic, but from a gameplay perspective, I feel it adds unneeded frustration.The FightYou play as Nilin, a Memory Hunter, who's memories, ironically, have been stolen. You wake up in a lab, and someone from your past, named Edge, is trying to help you escape being turned into a human vegetable. The story is dark, and while much of it can be seen from a mile away, I felt there were a few good twists here and there. Some of the acting is a bit cheesy, but I'm usually a fan of cheesy acting, and storylines.Combat MusicThe setting is Neo Paris. Pretty much what would happen if Paris became Taris from Knights of the Old Republic. Grungy under-city, and posh higher society areas create a contrast-heavy universe where it's never hard to tell where you are. Things in the environment feel lived in as well as alive. Beams. shutters, pipes, holographic screens, people, wind. Everything is animated, and feels like it's right where it belongs. The lighting is another thing of note. This is one of the prettier Unreal Engine games of last gen. It seems like the developers, even though fairly new, had a deep understanding of UE.Title ThemeIf you're in the mood for a dark, scifi game with a pretty unique and engaging setting, then I would say this is 100% for you. The developers put a lot of work into this one, and it deserves far more than what it got in sales. It's not perfect, but it's great.Our ParentsAfterthoughts:I want another game in the same vein, or even in the same world of Remember Me. Neo Paris is just too cool and the vibes I get from the music are intense. It's the perfect playground for a Deus Ex-style game. ;)			"

												TL; DR: Buy it on sale. I would recommend any price ~$15 or lower (I got it for $12.50) if you like good stories or beat-em-ups.For those inclined to actually read into the details, I enjoyed this game, but let me get into why:This game is in fact a beat-em-up. Not so much in the vein of the recent Batman games, but the combat is at least a little less vanilla than batman.During combat, Nilin (the protagonist) has combos that she uses to take down enemies. The lower level enemies can be simply taken down with basic combos, but different levels of commanders normally accompany these grunts. Most of the commanders cannot be taken down directly and most of the time require a little bit of ingenuity to dispatch using Nilin's Sensen abilities. In short, when she fights or gets hit she gains focus meter (very similar to meter found in most fighting games) that allows her to do very strong abilities to help eliminate enemies. Most of the first playthrough you'll be using these on a *need* basis moreso than out of convience. However, you can upgrade the amount of meter you can hold and thus allows you to speed up progress. On this subject, you'll be fighting one of about 5-6 kinds of bosses, most of which can be eliminated using the same tactics. Two pairs of bosses you'll fight will be identical--they can be eliminated exactly the same. It is a little stale, but there's about 8 boss battles, so you're not missing out on too much.Most of the bosses do require a certain combonation of abilities and moves. Don't be worried if you cannot figure out the formula as the game will happily point out an exploit, and you can go on your merry way.The story is nice: it's not going to be the next Hollywood film or anything but there were a couple of twists in there that were appreciated. The story did seem to drag on towards mission 7 (out of 8) but quickly picked up for the final mission.Hidden items: There are a few. One of them increases health and is quite common while the other increases the meter mentioned earlier. The last is nonbenificial and is a hidden item for the sake of being a hidden item.Overall: It's an RPG meant for the modern crowd. I would sort of compare it to the latest Deus Ex in that it is dumbed down quite a bit but unlike Deus Ex this game is stupidly linear. This game was a fun experience: since I just completed my first playthrough I plan on gettng the hidden items and then leaving the game alone. I would expect ~15 hours after all unlockables and that should be that. TL; DR #2: Buy it for cheap. Good, but not exceptional. "

												A well performed storyline is what i can say about Remember Me, it is very thorough and makes you want to play further and further. The combat system is something i have really missed in other games it is very catching instead of the usual just spam click and then they die, here you really get to customize how you want to fight your opponents			"

												     An outstanding work of interactive audio and visual art.  Although I do NOT normally play third person perspective games, this one was well worth the time and money.  If you are Deus Ex and/or Fallout 3 fan then, you will love this!  This games' story line is linear, very well thought out, and will not disappoint.  And, the graphics are just amazing!  In fact, I look forward to playing it again to accomplish more the achievements.     There have been many complaints about the controls.  I am a PC gamer who uses a keyboard and mouse.  The controls felt good and worked just fine.  They (the controls/visual perspective) took some time to get used to but, once familiar the enemiy attacks are fun to  dodge and avoid.  If you are using a game controller, this game will definately test your hand/finger coordination,  dexterity, and stamina!  In my opinion, the controls are fine and work very well for this game.     Excellent Game!  5 Stars!			"

												Decent beat-em-up with interesting graphics and style. Enjoyed it up until I couldn't get past Madame to my dismay. It's not that she was really difficult, moreso the last quick time event wasn't working for me--the prompt says to press the dodge button, so I do, but she just throws me back into the phase two fight again and again. I tried holding the button, pressing the button gently, spamming the button, and even rotated the analog stick while spamming in a desperate attempt to get past that point, but nothing. It might have something to do with my SteelSeries controller, but I had no problem with the game up until that point. It's a shame, really. All the same--Remember Me is definitely worth checking out if you enjoy a good beat-em-up.			"

												These are the reason you should buy this game:- Amazing revealing storyline.- The game slowly unlocks new abilities so you feel progression.- Ability to remix memories (with different unexpected outcomes)- Collectibles (Requires exploration)- Achievements (if you are that achievement ♥♥♥♥♥)- A song that only activates in combat if you are doing well.- Freaky Robot dudes (you'll see)- A unique style of graphic fidelity.- Robot ♥♥♥♥♥s (For all those automated needs)- People with disfigured facesThe only thing that might put you off is the combat.The combat is kind of clunky as it requires you to follow a pattern with a beat to get what you want.Other than that it's really amazing.

												A decent game that is worth playing for the graphics, mood, and story alone.  Indeed, the game is more like a very long movie that you are allowed to interact with.  The little touches bring the city to life.  It's not often that a game claims the setting is in x and actually puts little x touches in it.  In this case it's Paris and there are French accents from the deco, to the words on papers, to the food everywhere.They have also managed to create very believable cast of characters that you want to know more about.  They have a depth of feeling and drive that certainly make them interesting and support the story.The game, though, does have it's faults.  The customising the combos isn't really custom beyond chosing what type of hit or kick it is and even then it's no control on the stype of hit or kick.And there is the actual game glitches.  There seem to be issues with graphs to sound for almost everyone that either have to be fixed before the game is played, suffered through, or stop the game from playing at all.  However, we are not in the late 90's when games had to be released with perfection or die and many games suffer from this.  In comparison to other games, they are minor glitches.The saddest part of this game though, is the length.  I could have used more game play and there were parts of the story that could have been filled in to do this.  Such as parts between episodes could have been fleshed out to give more hours of gameplay and deeped the story building.Overall though, a good game and I look forward to more from this developer.

												This game had quite a great story to go through. Your character has had their memory removed and they are as puzzled as to what is going on as you are. The fighting in the game is fluid for the most part but sometimes with the amount of enemies they add the combo system can become fairly annoying to get a full chain. The boss fights are all fairly unique. Each boss fight ends with a quick time event of you kicking, punching, jumping, or actioning at the right time but if you fail you just have to fight the boss a little longer and try again. Overall, the games story is what will pull you in on this game. The fighting will keep you around.So, what is wrong with it? This is what you really want to know. There are two issues I would like to call out. The first is memory remixing. You only remix a few memories in the game. It is one of the coolest things about the game but it is used only for certain characters. It was kind of a let down when I found this out. The other is that the game is too linear. You are in this big city and trying to get from point A to point B. There is only one path and it is always going to be obvious what it is. They hold your hand and throw in a few if you don't jump quickly you fall and have to start over sections to spice it up. Even with this it is worth the play through for the story.			"

												This game does a good job with familiar game mechanics while presenting a really good looking, futuristic environment and a good story.This version of the future has everyone with a special device installed in the back of their heads.  The device allows them to see virtual signage (lots of which you'll see), selectively replay memories, or purchase new ones to experience for themselves.  The main character, Nilin, is a memory hunter, an agent who infiltrates or invades different environments in order to steal or alter the memories of a target person, usually to influence big business to the benefit of the client.  This is a cool and strange consequence of the whole memory market that this game presents.  Things go wrong when Nilin wakes up in prison without her memories, a common punishment in this society.The two main aspects of the game are, simply put, fighting and athletic traversal.  Thankfully, you're never doing both at once.  There's really nothing to the athletics.  You guide the Nilin to predetermined holds along ledges, walls, and ladders, trying to get to the next point in the story.  Points to grab on to are highlighted nicely.Fighting is an assorment of strikes done via predetermined combinations of X and Y buttons, as well as some super powered maneuvers that you earn throughout the story.  Interesting, though, is you assign different punches and kicks to your combos for one of three effects: damage, health recovery, or super recovery.  Customising these combos is a nice little puzzle.  And getting the results you want in combat--like recovering health by striking weaker opponents and maximizing damage on harder opponents--is really satisfying.  Frustrating, though, is the inability to spread the combo among multiple targets; changing targets mid-combo means you have to start the combo over.  (Personal side note: lots and lots of games are relying on guns to defeat enemies, often addining a minimum number of gimmicks.  It's very cool to see all the martial arts and hear different things besides tired gunfire.)Different enemy types and different super maneuvers eventually make combat more and more interesting and challenging.  It's fun, but doesn't drastically change the genre.Somewhat changing the pace are sections where you play through a person's memory, rewinding as necessary, to manipulate certain predetermined aspects with the goal of changing the person's conclusion about the event.  These are amusing, since changing certain things can cause different outcomes that don't represent a solution and yet you still get to see the result anyway.  Mildly entertaining; neither welcome or unwelcome.Overall, gameplay should be familiar for avid game players and the real draw should be the environments and story.  I really felt the desire to understand who Nilin was and why her mysterious benefactor placed such an importance on her mission.  All the while, seeing all the ultra modern society made it really cool and inviting.  Shamefully underated; recommended.			"

												This game is really, really good fun. The fluid, graceful chaining of moves and dodging feels very tight. I'm not having any difficulty playing this with mouse and keys, but some may prefer the controller. First boss battle was not overly difficult, but challenging enough to feel a sense of triumph when succeeding.The environment is stunning. Rich, full of detail and ambiance. The pace of the story is good, I'm only a few hours in as of this writing and I feel drawn in. The first ""re-write"" of a persons memory...what a great way to handle it. From the mouse input feeling so natural to ""scrub"" through the memory timeline, to the great visuals...very well done.Traversing the environment is not anything super-amazing, but it's well done enough and handled decently. Your moves are executed confidently and appear natural and smooth. This is not ""Mirror's Edge"" so don't expect over-the-top parkour. Your acrobatic moves during combat will make up for it.Combat may at first appear shallow, but there is some depth to be found for the patient seeker. Finding your pace and timing in combat feels really good when you get into the groove. Evading, flipping over an opponent to continue a chain, rapidly switching targets to maintain control all feel rewarding. Winning a fight against multiple opponents feels like an accomplishment, not just the result of random button mashing.I always reccomend watching gameplay videos and watching/reading plenty of reviews before making a decision to purchase. Chances are, if you like the dystopian/cyberpunk genre, this game will appeal to you.It goes without saying, people are different, they like different things. Some will hate this game, some will love it and others will be ambivalent. I can only say that I'm having a lot of fun playing it, and I think it's an experience worth your time and money. Some may disagree, but in my opinion this game is an underrated gem and I'm glad I picked it up.Thanks for reading, and Good Gaming.			"

												I cautiously recommend this game.  The story is interesting, but unremarkable, in contrast to the graphics which are impressive, but underservered by the very linear levels.  The game has a nice variety of enemies, of varying [imposed] difficulties, that seem to exist more to draw out the limited gameplay, rather than as a real challenge (I'm looking at you Elite Enforcer!).  But it is the controls that will be your greatest foe in this game.  They are, at best, dodgy, and at worst (particularily when trying to target a particular enemy with ranged attacks), unresponsive.  Boss fights will require a peek at a walkthrough to understand what you are supposed to be doing, but it's the mass fights in increasingly confined spaces that will cause you to walk away from the game, thanks to the inaccuracy of the controls.  The idea of remixing memories is interesting, but only occurs a few times in the game, and is as logical as a '90s Sierra game, and will probably come down to trying random combinations, or just looking at a walkthough.It's not a bad game, but has too many problems to be more than a decent game.   Buy it on a sale if the graphics appeal to you.			"

												Remember Me is a great third person, parkour, fighting game. This game is bassed in the distant year of 2084 where everyone has a device called sen-sen which lets you remember everything, upload and share their memories on the net, as well as remove unhappy or unpleasant memories. But this sen-sen device also can turn people into leapers, which are memory-addicted people who have absorbed too much memories which makes their sen-sen degrade and makes them mutate into a subhuman form. Nilin's ( the character you play as ) job is to destroy sen-sen to stop the leaper plague.This game is full of plot twists, has a unique fighting style, a great sound track and a great moral to it			"

												I bought this game on launch because I'm a sucker for a unique setting and art direction.  I was not disappointed.  This game is a great visualisation of Neo-Paris later this century, its very different but fully fleshed out environment was a great backdrop to a game which I thought was quite interesting.  The combo combat was quite different - especially for the PC - while especially the main character but all the characters made me care about them a lot more than most games these days.  The protagonist was a multi-layered character and while the start of the game started with the whole 'I've forgotten everything' cliche: it makes sense in the context of this game unlike most games that trot this out.There were some patches where the game did get bogged down in repetitious combat, but on the flip-side, the boss battles were as interesting as fights that you'll see on the PC for a game such as this.  The combo customisation did keep things fresh, and there was just enough of a break-up between combat and platforming to keep me moving along at a rapid pace through the game.One of the few games I've bought on launch in the last couple of years, and even fewer still of games on launch that I've bought and not regretted the purchase.  I highly recommend this game.			"

												A nice game in the line of the ""old school"" french games, which were mostly focused on characters and ambience. Here, it's a success. The views are breathtaking, you feel you're in a coherent universe, every detail is tailored to make you feel like you're in that cyberpunk-ish Paris, ... And the character development, while it's not the most fantastic I've ever seen, is really worked on and can really catch you. You can easily feel some empathy for that amnesiac girl who doesn't know what the hell is happening. Some were critical about the gameplay itself. While it's no Arkham City, it's still pretty smooth and you quickly find yourself using various combos. It could have been more inspired, indeed, but all in all, it's far from bad. Actually, I'd see it more closer to a Skyrim than a Call of Duty. Not because it's an RPG like Skyrim, but because you don't only play Skyrim for the combat but also for the general ambience. Skyrim's combat system isn't so great, its main story isn't so great either, but that's not what you're looking for in Skyrim. Same goes here ! If you're looking for a great dystopian video game, you'll have what you want.Bonus point for an actual good main female character. For once, it's not a friggin' bimbo, nor is it a poor lost princess, or some big hulk. It's a refreshing change.Finished the game in around 9 hours in normal mode, but I didn't explore much (I wanted to finish the main storyline).			"

												I'm enjoying this game. Great graphics and story. Neo Paris looks great and although it's not open world it  has some stunning set pecies and feels  like a living city. some people may not enjoy the combat which without a gamepad would I imagine be awkward. The combat sequences also make you think about what  combos/powers to use when and where on different types of enemy. Fights aren't hard but  maybe  planing out and remebering combos (which can be  altered to how you want them) might be annoying. There is also a fair amount of clmbing/jumping puzzle type sequences (sometimes there  clever, sometimes just meh) which are okay but perhaps not as good as say tomb raider. It also has a few memory remix puzzles which are fun and something I've never seen in another game.  Perhaps does get a little repitive after a while story/climb about a bit/ fight/ boss fight..next episode but story keeps it going (well does for me). Overal if you like good looking games with a futurstic story that engages and  tries to be a bit different I think you'll enjoy it.			"

												Довольно линейная игра. С хорошим сюжетом о мире будущего в котором все плохие воспоминания изолируются, а хорошие продаются... Неудобная и невнятная система боевки, которая представляет из себя связки ударов ногой и рукой. Опять же ""боевой режим"" активизируется только когда мы подходим к противнику очень близко... т.е. в остальное время ничего делать нельзя... есть пара головоломок, но не очень сложных.Посоветовал бы игру тем, кто любит книги на тему отдаленного будущего человечества... игра не напрягает.

												This game undeservedly went under many radars, which it simply did not deserve. Remember Me is built quite linear, but it has some hidden things to find to keep you looking and enjoying the (mostly linear) visually beautiful level design. You simply have to adore the developer Dontnod's amazing mixed architecture style for Neo Paris. From time to time you will maybe encounter smaller problems with camera placement and the climbing passages are far too easy, thanks to an automatic system which shows you where you can hang on to or jump to.The combat system is combination based similar to the actual Batman game series, but with the unique twist of giving you the ability to design your own combos with different effects for different demands. Some very well implemented special abilities will also wait for you. The sound is pretty fitting and the music is also adaptive, which means that, for example, if you make a successful combo the music boosts up. Story wise the game is interesting enough, especially that it plays in the future where your thoughts can be harvested and even redesigned aka remixed, to keep you want to find out what the fuss about the main character Nilin is all about. I've played this game via a gamepad, because i just don't think that games like this should be played with a keyboard/mouse combo, simply because they aren't meant to be.Overall Remember Me looks good, sounds good and feels good ! Definitely worth any game collection.			"

												I'd recommend this game. Visually this game is stunning at times and the futuristic vision of Neo-Paris is awe-inspiring. There are some low-resolution textures there-abouts in the game that can take away from the beauty but in general, it looks fantastic. The main protagonist is a fairly interesting female character who is well voice acted, although there are a few choice lines from the script that can be off-putting. Her character has some abiguities at times with her morals and decisions, which I find intriguing and although the story was decent, I felt it had a much higher potential and could have gone deeper into some of the grey subject areas this game touched upon with memory manipulation. Quite a few of the antagonists, on the other hand, are a bit weak and encouters with them can be very cheesy. Voice acting beyond the main protagonists, such as random NPCs, can also be very weak.Combat is similar to the Batman system in that you punch, kick and evade enemy hits but it's different and a little less fluid. It differentiates itself with a unique combo system. You have four 3-8 hit combos that are fairly simple but what I like about this system is you can assign traits to each hit in the combo such as more damage, health gain, or regenerate your special ability. This allows you to customise combos to your needs and depending on how you trait yourself, it can make the difference between an impossible fight, a challenging one or even a simple one (on the hardest difficulty). The camera leaves much to be desired however and can sometimes impede your view of the fight, though evasion warnings are easy to spot and it's not necessary to keep your enemies in view at all times.The music is this game is probably the best part of this game. It is simply amazing throughout and a joy to listen to each piece during the credits.			"

												Remember Me is a short game, but it might be one of the best that I've played in the past months. The story is very linear, and you should abandon any hope for decision-making right now, because you play basically along with the story. In fact, I fared pretty well (expectation-wise) as soon as I decided to see Remember Me as a story with several gaming elements instead of a game which also tells a story. Maybe a predictive story, but nevertheless an interesting and (at least for me) emotionally touching story. My opinion of the gameplay (apart from the story) is mixed: The fighting is fun; you get to design your own combinations by adding up different techniques, and the fighting itself is definite eye-candy. Controlling Nilin during everything else apart from fighting is a bit boring; the pathfinding system works maybe too well, climbing is no challenge at all, and have I mentioned already that you don't get to decide anything? The camera is not very helpful - I think that camera settings are well-made if you hardly notice that it is there at all. But in this game, I've tried countless times to change the perspective - only to find out that I could not. Other aspects:The graphics are beautiful. I could just play it again to look at the architecture, the streets, hell, even the advertisement managed to look interesting.The soundtrack is great, too - it captures the atmosphere of the game in general and of each scene in particular very well. I would recommend it to my friends (I already did) - but before you play it, please reconsider your expectations.			"

												This game completely took me by suprise at how good it really is,so glad I took a punt on it! The graphics and look of the game are so beautiful,the gameplay is sleek and the combat has a really good feel to it...similar to games like Ninja Gaiden where it's close,fast and furious. Even with this similarity though it maintains a innovative uniqueness that is a nice change to the same old concept for games. I really enjoyed the storyline and the ability to remix peoples memories with different outcomes based on what you choose is awesome. To me,this is what a ""next-gen"" game should look and feel like...love it!			"

												Oh Capcom. Nostalgia. The production quality is very high. Soundtrack is excellent, the attention to detail by the devs is very rewarding for the player. Simple yet enjoyable UI and gameplay choices make it a charming title.Remember Me is a very linear story driven  game done well - it's what i would have like the new Dues Ex to be. It tries to break up from the norm with some nice arcade style combat which is simple, perhaps repetitive, but rewarding. I have no idea why this game got ignored and scored poorly on meta critic.Set in a fantastic universe with a great story and solid voice acting, attention to detail and solid visuals.Wish people made more games like this still.Cons.Controls can be frustrating.Camera control can be *infuriating*.There is a lot of jumping at times (ala Prince of Persia).The price?

												In my experience, this game was well balanced and fun to play. It stands out in its design and atmosphere, The game looks simply beatiful with a lot of attention to detail. The meticulously created backstory and lore, however, are somewhat lost to me. It's a short game that doesn't get the chance to use it to its' full potential. Other than that, the story is well paced and interesting. Combat is solid and you can mix it up a bit, but it is not very impressive. What I liked about it very much though, was that you relied on your combos to heal, which is somewhat innovative and fun. enemies and bosses were a bit repedative.The game was fun, inviting and interesting without becoming a chore. Great design and setting, but mediocre combat. Still a solid 7/10 and nothing less.			"

												This is the 2nd game I have gotten on Steam that is now unusable. The first was Far Cry 3 when I came to a place in the game then could not advance due to a bug. The same is happening with this game. I just started the game Remember Me and have entered into the combo screen where I am to configure pressens so that I might continue. I followed the instructions to build  pressens. I have come to a point where I must select a pressen then press enter in order to continue - according to the instructions. However, the ""Enter"" button is missing from the screen and is nowhere to be found. There is no way to exit the screen - there is no back button. I have to use the control-alt-delete keys to exit but I cannot go beyond this point. Pressing every other key on the keyboard does nothing - the game is frozen. I do not recommend this game. The forums do not address this problem and the game's instruction is poor.			"

This was the major draw back and should really only be bought during those sales. on the posotive side the story drew me in and kept me interested, I wanted to finish the game to see where it took me. the combat was enjoyable and constantly changing. the one thing that left me a little dissappointed was that the game was linear and felt like one long tutorial that didn't allow you to open up and test your limits. I feel like there could have been another chapter as you strike out into the world you have created.			"

StoryFirst of all, Remember Me explores an interesting concept of controlling, remixing or deletingmemories that is available for anyone in the society. While at first, the user opens up to a glorious image of individuals being able to share their memories together, or being able to store the memories forever, there is a much darker side to the entire concept that is displayed throughout the events of the game. During the story, the player also explores the concepts of identity that is tied to our memories, as well as the conseqeunces of tampering with memories. The story itself isn't bad, it has its moments, and actually manages to pull off a few nice twists and turns. However, its downside is the horrible pacing of the game. Remember Me feels very slow and at times it can even be called boring. On the flipside, the latter parts of the game lift the story up a notch, but unfortunately the pacing still continues being an issue.GameplayThe combat within the game is unfortunately a pretty undeveloped concept. It revolves around mixing and matching different moves to create combos, unfortunately there are only four combos which ultimately makes this system too simple to actually make the combat worth remembering. Furthermore, the enemies are also very predictable and there really aren't any segments of the game that really challenge the player in regards to the combat. The game also features a large portion of climbing sequences which use a simplfied climbing system that  can be seen in almost any adventure game that came out within the last 10 years. The high point of the gameplay is the amazing design of Neo-Paris and its inhabitants that the user can explore, it is a feast for the eyes and any fan of cyberpunk should enjoy inspecting it. Overall, I think Remember Me is a good game, but with many ideas that could be further developed and explored. If you manage to persist through the uneven pacing and the somewhat uninspired combat system you may find yourself enjoying Neo-Paris and Nilin's story.			"

Amazing story, amazing graphics, combat is bit repetitive but since its more less fist fighting so no much variety to be expected and also game is linear story driven and not some hack and slash game. If you are looking far a game with amazing story line told not by point and click type game then you found it. It might not be one of those games that glue to the screens for many hours, maybe just for 1-2 play through due to even thou rather deep story but short game play.

												If you want a picture of the future, imagine a hand ripping out human memories - forever.Remember Me envisions 2084 as a time when human memories can be manipulated like any physical item, and as such are bought, sold, traded, stolen, etc. much as physical items are. You control Nilin, a ""memory hunter"" - one with the power to manipulate human memories, up to and including large-scale rewrites. Recently wiped of most of her memories while in prison, she escapes and begins fulfilling tasks set to her by the Errorist known as Edge - a mysterious man who seeks the destruction of the privileged upper class the memory technology has created.---So, first off, the character design in this game is a bit lacking. Nilin isn't bad, but there's not a whole lot to really like about her, and no character, overall, is developed a whole lot - not helped by the fact that, due to the theme of memory manipulation, the whole concept of ""character development"" is harder to apply here.The art style is well-done and the text design, in particular, is fantastic. Less can be said about the music, but at least it's not annoying. On a recommendation, I played with French voice acting, and I can pass on the recommendation - even if (like me) your knowledge of French is spotty at best, it helps with the recreation of the Neo-Paris atmosphere.The gameplay...I mean, it's linear, and the combat system clearly has a lot of thought put into it, but gets rather repetitive regardless. Neither is inherently bad, but usually those are used in conjunction with a game focused on story, and that's where Remember Me falls a bit short.The real killer is that the story premise is really quite interesting. Unfortunately, with the relatively short length and lack of character development, most of that potential doesn't go anywhere, and (very minor potential spoilers) the fascinating ethical questions of memory manipulation are essentially tossed aside in favor of a sappy ""people are not complete without their sorrows"" aesop. Not at all what the asking price suggests about the game.I still enjoyed my time with Remember Me, and if all of this has kept your interest so far, I'd advise you to give it a try (probably on sale, though). But if you're having your doubts? Nah.			"

												Wow...This has to be the most visually stunning games I have ever played, but I won't lie and say the game play is flawless because it's not.  Combat is like an 'Arkham City wanna-be' but comes nowhere near the fluid motion of any of the Batman games.  But if you can get past the first few levels and upgrade your combos it's not so bad.  Actually once I quit trying to play it like Arkham and started playing it for what it was, I started to come around to the combat and enjoy a tad bit.  There are also plenty of platforming moments that are all pretty easy.  They mostly serve to break up the gameplay and show off a wider view of the levels, and let me tell you.....The world of Remember Me is the reason you want to play this game.  When you move from point A to B don't RUN...hold back on the thumbstick a bit and WALK and soak in every bit of the detail.  These guys have made one of the most beautiful games I have ever seen in my life.  The level to detail is staggering and is Remember Me's greatest asset.  That being said, I do wish they would have went the Splinter Cell route instead of the Arkham City route and had more focus on stealth.  This could have been the Starcraft Ghost that we never got.  Can you imagine?!?!?  Oh well, it's still a beautiful game and well worth a playthrough, especially if your a little burnt out on the same ol', same ol' Call of Duty or whatever mainstream game that usually takes up your time.  Do yourself a favor and give it a chance.  It doesn't cost much and worse case scenerio you just don't like it.  I think if you open your mind and look past the clunky combat, and look at the world instead you'll find it's actually damn good.			"

												The setting is your typical scifi dystopia but the story is pretty unique so far. I either wasn't paying attention or it's legit but I did not see a plot twist come about in a later chapter of the game. The world is also incredibly well-crafted and beautiful. The combat is a bit repetitive, like most beat'em ups, but the story overshadows it completely. The rest of the gameplay is spot on, especially the parkour-style climbing. It has a strong female lead, too. Not just ""gun and sexy"" (though she is sexy as well) strong but stands out as her own person against her male counterparts. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good game to play.			"

												I think the story of the game is unique but slow.  It's a shame to me how such a beautifully made world is limited to explore.   Our protagonist, Nilin, seems well rounded in character.  However, going back to being able to exploring the world, it seems odd how she can jump such great distances and parkour like a boss, yet she can't hurdle a 2ft wall.  The world is also not very interactive.  Only the items that will help you progress in the game's story (besides the boxes that boost your health and focus) can be interacted with.  I was expecting a reaction out of some of the robots when I punched or kicked them...nothing.  The same thing happens with the NPCs in Slum 404.  One thing that is a plus and minus is the camera angles.  When it comes to the parkour, some of the POVs are very helpful. Sometimes I couldn't see where I was supposed to jump to next because the computer took over my camera and I had no control of where I was looking (also happens when trying to get a glimpse at the surrounding city).  The architecture is amazing, and it's very hard to admire it because you see only what the designers want you to see.  If you want to play a CyberPunk game that is unique, play this one.  It is fun, but be warned that there is not a lot of freedom in where you go and what you can interact with.  It's good to play through once.  I don't see a point in playing through it again (unless you really want those pesky achievements).  Honestly, a bit of side questing, more interaction with the environment, and a bit more freedom would give this game a much higher replay value.  Just a thought if these developers ever read these things (highly doubt it).  Other than that it's a pretty good game...but for $30, wait until it's on sale.			"

												It feels like a 3D version of an excellent side scroller.  Glad I bought it on-sale. It's just not a world I felt free to explore, it almost plays like an obstacle  course. I really appreciate that it doesn't feel like you are doing a bunch of chores/tasks; there's something sensible they did that removed this annoyance. I wish other games would do the same.			"

												Remember Me is, at it's heart, an action-packed fighting-type game, but don't let that fool you; the interesting take on a 'cyberpunk' future is itself both visually stunning and extremely fresh. In a world where technology has managed to make people's memories more like flash drives, the world is severely corrupted and blinded to what makes them 'human'. As Nillin- a freedom fighter who's had most of her memory removed, you're trying to get your memories back and stop Sensen, the technology that has made these things possible. Nillin also has the ability to change people's memories herself, something that has a variety of consequences and makes for an extremely interesting gameplay mechanic. When you couple the action, unique vision and the emotionally charged story, it becomes a game more than worth checking out.			"

												It feels like a Dreamcast 3 game.Absolutely beautiful. I love it. A journey through a beautiful landscape. Who it's for:Work-at-home IT folks who love Sci-Fi and video games but get stuck on conference calls every hour or so.This is a game you have running in the background and then shift+tab to when work gets slow. Not to say the game deserves background treatment. Rather, it is like a reward for working hard during the morning. A momentary escape from real-life. There is something vaguely nostalgic about the game. It reminds me of what I thought games would be like in the future when I was a kid.			"

												Very nice game. I didn't play this when it came out but I picked it up while on sale and it would have well been worth full price. This game reminds me of a mashup of Prince of Persia + Assasin's Creed. A really really really cool idea in this game is the ""memory remix"" puzzles, where you basically rewind time and mess with different objects and then press play and watch what happens. Moving different items at different times produces different results and you have to get the right order to cause the memory to continue with the desired outcome. I hate that there are so few of these because it is the standout feature of this game and I would jump to play a full game full of these types of missions.Fighting is not the main objective but basically a means of showing progression through the very interesting story. It has a unique although hard to get used to combat system, similar to the Assasin's Creed games although not so timed and it is harder to dodge. It has all the fun parkour of Assasin's creed with fun Prince of Persia style jumping puzzles.A great game I would definitely recommend. Perhaps it will encourage them to create a new game or reuse some of the aspects of this game in a future title.			"

												Really enjoying this game. It feels like the kind of game people wished for when talking about playing in the ""present day"" for Assassins Creed, mixed with Mirrors Edge and a little Batman thrown in there too. With influences from so many games it's a bit surprising to say, but the game also feels quite fresh and original. I love the memory remixing parts of the game and nothing feels better than doing an overload and seeing data shoot out of people heads like a shotgun blast. I know for an original IP the full price tag can seem daunting. If you've been waiting for Mirrors Edge 2 and hoping that part of it takes place in the slums of the city and you enjoy the Batman combat style then you'll probably get your monies worth. If it seems a little risky to you then just put it on your wishlist and pick it up when it goes on sale which is definitely worth it.			"

												Got the game on sale. I made 12+ hours out of it (first playthrough on the hardest difficulty with no looking at guides). I say if you like cyberpunk you should take it. In more details:- camera isn't very friendly- certain doors close after you pass them; although it helps you move forward, you may miss a collectible behind- a couple of times I had sound disappearing; going to main menu and reloading the last checkpoint helped it+ after finishing the entire game I had it only 91% complete, which means I've missed quite a few collectibles and bonuses, some of them are hidden well (duh, apparently)+ considering how boring fighting in these games usually is, you do need to rebuild your combos for specific situations (bosses or big groups of enemies)+ interface is very simple and friendly+ it is impossible to get lost+- your eyes will get tired (lots of flashing lights and colours, hello cyberpunk)+- I enjoyed the first half of the game more than the last (same with Deus Ex HR, though)Decide for yourself. I do not regret purchasing and finishing it through.			"

												Great game, fantastic graphics and well crafted environments.  The Memory remix puzzles we're pretty slick and it was great just playing out some of the scenes just to see what would happen when you make certain changes.  The combat is both love an hate.  It's so satisfying when I can get a long chain combo but with so many enemies around sometimes it' difficult to get the longer chains completed without either using that combo on the final enemy or rely on your stun ability to pummel them.  The storyline was also well done and just kept me engaged episode after episode.  Definitely looking forward to seeing more from DONTNOD studio and hope Capcom releases more great games like this :-D			"

												A great story and absolutely jaw dropping visuals (although texture and model quality falters under scrutiny) are offset by boring and frustrating fighting mechanics and overly easy to navigate platforming. Memory remixing is an incredible gameplay element that scratches the surface of interesting philosophical discussions; I wish they had more of that and less punching dudes in the face to regenerate health. The music is simply incredible, and the soundtrack is as worth a purchase standalone album.Being someone that likes story driven games and doesn't mind a well tailored linear experience, I had enough interest in finding out what was going to happen to grit my teeth and deal with the gameplay. If you're up for a good sci-fi story game with a big asterisk on it, it's worth picking up on sale.			"

												I wholeheartedly recommend this game. It's one of those underdogs which never really got a real audience, despite receiving a fair amount of critical acclaim.The setting and the narration are very well done and manage to immerse you in the story and game, as well as motivating you to play on. The graphics are superb, making you pan you camera to either look at Nilin, the protagonist, or at the breathtaking scenery around you. The voice acting is superb, at least if you are lucky and wise enough to play it in English. If you are in doubt, I do recommend the English version - the voice overs for Nilin are very well done and render her as a vulnerable, reflecting person, despite the combat prowess she possesses.The only thing that bugged me are parts of the gameplay. Okay, it's a button masher game, at least on the easy difficulty setting, which I admittedly used. I wished to enjoy  the story without having frustrating moments of being beaten around in the combat scenes. But despite the easy mode, I still felt the game to be quite challlenging, which is probably due to my lousy reaction time. The quicktime-events in the boss fights surely made me growl, but luckily my memory is better than my button-mashing skill, so I simply memorized the correct keystroke-sequence.With combat being the defining gameplay element, I have to say that I found it annoying to be dumped into ""arenas"" for every fight, which kinda broke the immersion for me. Once you enter a fairly large enough room, you simply know there is a wave of enemies waiting to attack you. So you hop in, walk forward and then go through the ordeal, rinse and repeat until you stumble into the next large hallway.On the bright side, the player is prompted to alter ""dreams"" of other persons, meaning that you are called to juggle around bits and pieces of someones memories to make him or her believe in a different reality. With quite drastic consequences. I really enjoyed playing through these sequences, because it's been interesting and fun to watch the consequences of my""real time"" editing of the dream sequence.But well, all said and done ""Remember Me"" is really worth playing:- If you enjoy a dark, cyber-punk setting. - If you enjoy good music, good voice acting and believable characters. - And if you are able to go along with a quite monotonous combat gamepleay.If you are still in doubt, just wait for the next sale and get. It's a sweet piece of eye candy and cyber-punk narrative, which gives you the chills as well as the faint feeling of sorrow that you have to part from your heroine once the credits come rolling down the screen.

However, this is one title that does really well in terms of plot and ambience; the music goes really well with the setting.Strangely, the ambience reminds me alot about ""Syndicate"" from Bullfrog games back in 1990s.There's not alot of replayability, but I've found it really entertaining on my first run through.I'd really recommend adding it to wishlist and getting when it's on offer!

												A fairly simple example of it genre, yes, but Remember Me is a rarity on the PC, as most adventure games of its type are console-only.  It may have its flaws; some hackneyed dialog, plot holes, linear level designs, but as a whole Remember Me offers a competant play experience. The environments are gorgeous. Neo-Paris is incredibly detailed to the point of being cluttered. There's just so much to look at -- even someplace as sterile as a prison.  Sadly, the linear nature of the levels makes exploring limited. Character designs are just as beautiful though. 3D models unlock with achievements for you oogling pleasure. This high detail makes cutscene trasitions near seamless. Combat is easy to grasp; one button to dodge and a variation of two other buttons to combo attacks.  A simple leveling mechanic allows to later customize and extend combos, adding a little strategy and depth.The most unique feature of Remember Me is the memory remixes -- changing a person's (victim's?) memory of a specific event to manipulate them. Remixes themselves are basically cutscenes which can be edited to change little details in the person's memory which compound into completely changing the outcome of the event.  This leads to the person's outlook or personality to completly change. Remixes also add some experimentation and replayability to the game, as there can be multiple outcomes in these manipulations. (only the 'right' way will progress the story though)Overall I recommend Remember Me. Its short length (about 8 hours) benefits the pacing of the game, as no chapter (level) feels slow or trodding, nor do the linear levels and combat feel too shallow.			"

												Tomb Raider + Cyber Punk + Total Recall + FF Spirits within = Remember MeStory : 9/10 :I felt the story was good and enjoyable perhaps a bit linear as they didnt intend for this to be an aventure but more of an action game. It's a one , play once time story; but none the less a good story. Protagonist: 9/10:I personally Liked Nilin's personality she is a strong, confident woman and sometimes shows fear but unfortunatly keeps it quickly bottled up though...  It's hard to know more considering that her memory is wiped in the begining. I expected her to have a differnt reaction meeing her father though. He had a more expected reaction than she did. One thing I liked, is she knows she can fight and isn't afraid to show it.Voice Acting: 10/10I felt this was well done and engaging. Cost : 10/10 I feel that this was worth the experience and time put in.Music: 7.5/10 Music is good but it seems to get cool the dive off . I tend to hit hard here and be very critical. It wasn't til almost the end that I felt it became epic.Combat System : 7/10 : I felt they had something here but I realized that there is technically only 5 ways to activate a combo and I only used 4 of them as the 5th one was too hard to get off as enimies would swamp you in that time. When I realized that I probably wouldnt use the strongest and last combo, I just kept to the same patterns that worked .  Also I felt croud control to be the most challenging thing about the fights. they're a few guys that you have to think about how you kill but over all its more about crowd control more than anything and sometimes that feels like all enemies move together like a flock of geese.Boss Fights: 9.5/10Boss fights are awesome! I mean I enjoyed them a lot! I didn't like the quick time events to finish them off but I really liked the fight.Other thoughts:Memory remixing was probably one of the coolest things in this game! I enjoyed it a lot. others complained that there wern't enough . I felt it was just right.  I in the end didnt want to remix any memories cause it meant screwing with people and the last one you do ,  I really wanted to talk things through, rather than screw somebody over.you can beat this game on skill alone, which is cool.Puzzles were pretty neat too . Creative.Cons:Some times I felt like I wanted to explore as the world is very pretty but this isn't that type of game.I wish they had a bit more epic of music, like it was in the end; Still good though.The last fight I expected it to be awesome (It was ok) like the fight in the prison.. MAN that prison fight was EPIC!!!!!I expected to see enemies with guns and it seems like they out lawed guns or something. Felt weird, to be honest.Over all I would give this an 8/10. It's a good experience and worth ones time. "

												I'm a big cyberpunk fan and that's why I started playing this game and was not disappointed. The artstyle is amazing and adds a lot upon the great atmosphere this game has. The melee combat is based on combos. it's kinda good and enjoyable but can get repetitive, because although you can change your combos. it's pretty much a matter of different animations. The main character is a black woman. which is very rare this days in video games. The concept of Remember Me is excellent and the story is interesting as well. I recommend this game. I think it's underrated and you should give it a shot.			"

												Okay, overall, I had fun with this game. I'm certainly not feeling like I was really cheated out of my money, and I can think of several things that make me recommend this game to the community as a whole... That said, this game still lacks a lot of polish and when you carefully look at the game as you play, it's not hard to see that this game wasn't given the full potential that it coulda been.The story is interesting, and it certainly has me going forward, and there's a lot of material that the game can play with when it comes to the premise that memories can be downloaded and shared just like MP3s today, not to mention be deleted altogether... but it still falls kinda short, like there was supposed to be more that the game could do, but the devs had to cut it short for one reason or another.The gameplay itself is solid, but lacks some polish. There are moments where you're tasked with 'remixing' memories to change the result, and by extension alter the behavior of that particular character, but they are too few and far between. In addition, the control scheme for these events is somewhat finicky, and it gets frustrating when you have to keep rewinding to change things. Moving about in the game is fairly easy, and anyone familiar with games like Uncharted or Assassins Creed would easily latch onto the standard set of movement mechanics without much trouble. The combat is both interesting and a curse. The combo creation system is a great idea in theory, but the game limits you to changing the effects of the buttons rather than altering the combos themselves. (i.e. you will always have a combo 'X-X-X', and you can alter the last two 'x' presses to any combination of 'heal' 'deal extra damage' or 'reduce cooldowns') It's sometimes difficult to get the right combo going, and it is rather hard to pull off a specific combo when you're in a large crowd (the game claims you can dodge and keep the combo happening, but I haven't had it happen often enough to be reliable.) Finally, there are enemies later game that are really best dealt with by using special attacks, but when you use one, there's a cooldown on that ability that's upwards of 2 minutes.... yes you can use the 'reduce cooldown' effects in combos to lower that, but when you're dealing with enemies you can't attack because it would be either countered, you'd take damage for hitting them, or they're just plain invisible.... yeah, it gets tired quick.I enjoy this game, I really like the story that's running through it, and I don't feel cheated out of my money. Anyone looking for a brawler-style game won't really be unhappy with it. However, I really feel sad because this game coulda been SOOO much more as a open-world game. I could see a lot of potential in this setting through that. There's a lot of things that you can read about, but would have been so much better if you could GO and SEE these sights. If it's on sale, go ahead and splurge a little, it'll be fun... But if story-driven games with bugs and less-than-optimal polish bother you, yeah, not really your cup of tea.			"

I think deserving of closer to a 78 than the 65.This is a reivew playing on the hardest difficulty:The combo system works well. It's not overly complicated and gets the job done. I had a little trouble with aiming a device you get later in the game during a fight, but setting yourself up to be positioned better helped without too much fuss. The main character isn't incredibly engaging interesting herself, but the environment she's in, your Navigator, and the story that she's involved in is interesting enough to drive me to keep playing. You also meet some somewhat interesting characters along the way.This is not an open world game. THIS IS OKAY. Not every game benefits from being open world. Not every open world game is inherently good because is ""open-world"". This game is focused and linear with optional collectibles that are only slightly off of the beaten path. It annoys me to this day that people are disappointed that all these games aren't open world. Open world usually means less focus on the experience and a bunch of non-interesting side quests littered all over the place unless you're a big bugdet title and can afford to make a proper experience even in the nooks and crannies of your world, like Witcher 3, SWTOR, World of Warcraft (?), etc.It was just under a 10 hour game for me getting probably half of the achievements as well. I'll likely pick up the rest of them at a later time.Fun game. Not a 10/10 by any means (but I don't give a 10/10 to hardly anything -- this ain't IGN), but an enjoyable experience for someone that has missed this game on release, and really doesn't have anything else new to play right now.

												It's rare to find a game with such an enthralling story that doesn't sacrifice gameplay for a ""movie-experience,"" and yet this game had me playing almost non-stop throughout precisely because every moment left me wanting more. The combat provided smooth intermissions that were engaging and satisfying for a video-game experience, and the characters and story drove me to continue traversing the ambient environment for further understanding. ""Remember Me"" is a great game and definitely a worthwhile buy if you are at all considering it.			"

												This is the 2nd game I have gotten on Steam that is now unusable. The first was Far Cry 3 when I came to a place in the game then could not advance due to a bug. The same is happening with this game. I just started the game Remember Me and have entered into the combo screen where I am to configure pressens so that I might continue. I followed the instructions to build  pressens. I have come to a point where I must select a pressen then press enter in order to continue - according to the instructions. However, the ""Enter"" button is missing from the screen and is nowhere to be found. There is no way to exit the screen - there is no back button. I have to use the control-alt-delete keys to exit but I cannot go beyond this point. Pressing every other key on the keyboard does nothing - the game is frozen. I do not recommend this game. The forums do not address this problem and the game's instruction is poor.			"

												I thought the story itself and the characters were very good and the end was plenty satisfying for me.  The combat does get repetitive and I wish the combos were more forgiving as far as being able to keep them going against groups of enemies.  The movement through the environments is also pretty restrictive without much choice on how to proceed.Remixing memories is awesome and unique and I'd be very interested to see what a sequel does with that, if it happens.  I also thought the graphics were great which is why the ability to explore a little more would have been nice.Overall, I thought the story was definitely worth experiencing despite the shortcomings I mentioned.  I enjoyed my time with this game in this world.			"

												Neat concept, poor execution. The big thing dragging this game down is the combat, it's just really tedious and frequent. The plot is also pretty dumb, and the memory-stealing and ""remixing"" should have been a lot more prominent. Also, the level design would have benfitted from being a bit more open, giving multiple paths and making you think a bit rather than just having a linear route to follow. I like what they seemed to be going for, but I just can't recommend the game they actually made.			"

												This game, besides having some lengths during some of the fights (played on normal, middle of the three difficulties), really captured me through an interesting story. There might be some logic flaws, the side-Characters could've been a little bit better flashed out the controls could've been a little bit better. Still, i finished this game in 2 sittings and would've in 1 probably just because of the strong main Character and the really interesting story of a utopian world that slowly falls to♥♥♥♥♥♥ The philosophical aspect really hit me aswell. All in all, gameplay might not be perfect, but the story is certrainly worth playing through at least once. Maybe more often, if you don't remember anymore :).			"

												(I Don't Write Many Rewievs But I Hope This Helps)This Game Is... Awesome! I've only played it 5 hours and i love it allready!Reasons i love this game:1. Storyline! The storyline is awesome! I can't give any examples since i don't want to spoil anything for you.2. Combat system. The combat is hard (depending on difficutly ofcourse) and fun, the Sensen abilities (If you're familiar with League of legends you might call it your Ultimate Ability) are really awesome, they give you that advantage you need when you're in a tough pinch with a few Leapers (Humans that have lost their minds due to memory wipe) or Soldiers.3. Parkour. It has its ups and downs, but its good anyway.4. The Riddles and Puzzles. A riddle in the game made me ponder about it for about 20 min, that means its a pretty hard riddle if you ask me :D, The small puzzles are very fun to do and figure out how to complete.5. You never get lost! (YAY). There's a simple waypoint marker showing you where to go and where to jump to get to the destinasion the easiest way. (not that there are too many other choices but...Still)6. Graphics, They're really good. no weird glitches or anything (unless they want them to be there ^^)			"

												I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed this game. Not to say it was perfect, but it was quite, well, fun. Some random thoughts:It wasn't crazy difficult, the platformer gameplay wasn't necessarily original (felt a lot like Tomb Raider), but it was a good balance of action, puzzle solving and story. The memory remix element is pretty interesting and isn't just a gimmick; it is crucial to the story. The environments are gorgeous, but, even with my reasonably good gaming computer, I had some areas with pretty significant frame rate issues... game could use some optimization. There are very few loading screens! They did a great job loading content on the fly.The combat gets a little repetitive but it does in any game like this. Being able to create your own combos is nice. You also choose how to integrate healing and other elements in to your attacks.			"

												(LONG REVIEW, WITHOUT SPOILERS)First things first: you, reading this now, the game deserves a chance, buy it! (but not at full price)I liked Remember Me, actually, i liked it a lot. Primarily because it's a breath of fresh air in this FPS-infested gaming community.Why? because of its plot (not superb, but really good and interesting for a change), and thus, its setting: having Neo-Paris at your back while you're going around is a blast. Backgrounds and environment all-around are incredible, devs did a great job making you feel like you're in the future, that this could actually happen sometime. Grafics are amazing, quite beautiful.A very decent combat system (and fun to an extent), New Game+, and some ingenious game mechanics (manipulating memories have never felt so entertaining), adds to the experience and make this game worth playing, with a little bit of replay value.So, with those strong points, why isn't this game ranked higher? why was it a failure commercially?Well, as it has very positive things, it also has a lot of problems.* 1- Holds your hand all game long, and doesn't let it go:Most notorious issue with the game. Go here, jump here, hit this enemy, activate this button, etcetera, never ending indications. The game makes you follow a predetermined path, without any other possibilites. So, you better follow the non-stop instructions or you'll never go anywhere. Don't try jumping here or there, trying to see if you can go any other path, is pointless.Is super frustrating: there's the intriguing Neo-Paris on your back and you can't explore it!I'm not even asking for an open-world game (which would've been epic, none the less), but at least give us some freedom to explore more! I hate when a game has to guide me through it.Also, please for the love of God, if you despise this too, as I do, never EVER use the ""Aug-Eye"" feat in the game, as it directly spits on the player's intelligence, telling you how to solve every single situation. Please no.* 2- Super short length:Only 6 hours, total (could be a lot less), if you don't mind about getting all the optional stuff. Really guys?It's a breeze, and it's a shame. Because you feel that it ends when you're starting to get into it. Leaves you with a ""that's it?"" face at the credits.* 3- Platforming and combat lacks development:When this game came out, people said it was ""Tomb Raider in the future"". No, just... no.Platforming here, because of point 1, is pointless and so scripted that you'll grow tired of it at some point. Yeah, there are a couple of sections in the game where you've to think a little bit (without Aug-Eye, that is), but doesn't help in this topic.Combat is decent, batman arkham-like, but fixed combo lenghts and button combinations still restrict you to repeat the same patterns over and over again.On a side note, how's that this game doesn't have counters??And the answer is the dodge... because it's an insta-win move. Why? you can dodge EVERYTHING, it's so fast and spammable, that you can keep dodging and never get hurt. You can dodge while doing a combo and if done correctly, the combo won't break and you can finish it. Again, a shame, because it could've been so SO much better. Feels like there's no risk while in combat.* 4- Abused linear storytelling:This isn't really a negative point per se, but this game abuses it too much.There's a great game mechanic called ""Memory remix"" that its fun, and something new for these kind of games. But, having only 1 valid outcome for them, destroys its potential. Imagine if the devs let us continue the story with other results, setting up your own paths on the story and changing it based on your decisions when remixing. That'd be awesome. But no. At the end, it's just a trial-and-error mechanic.Finally, after 4 big negative points, why should YOU then give this game a chance? why I still recommend it, when it seems like it wanted to mix so much things that it couldn't reach success in any of them because of that, right??Well, my friend, because even if the game has important flaws, it's still very enjoyable, and above all, it's a game TRYING TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. This is not you copy-pasta big-budget game, it's a well thought game that couldn't quite get to where it tried to.There's SO MUCH potential on this, and that's why you should give it a chance.For me, I'd love to see a Remember Me 2. An almost impossible thing to happen due to its sales, but fingers crossed anyway!			"

												I really enjoyed the story with this game. I did play it on the lowest difficulty though and finished the game incredibly fast. It's not a very long game. If you're in to melee action games it's great. The story was amazing and interesting but the combat got too repetitive for me especially from how there's only two buttons to use when fighting, ""x"" or ""Y"" (depending on your controller). They did try to make it interesting with the combo creation and adding chains to either gain health or deal more damage. There are also some cool abilities you can use during combat too, but for me I felt that wasn't really enough. There are cool little memory remixes you can do to manipulate a character's past experiences which I thought was an awesome touch to make the story more enjoyable. I thought making the game world more open than it was could've changed a lot, and potentially adding side missions to explore would've made it more enjoyable for me. But if you play it for what it is and enjoy the story, it could be a good time.Pros:Story richLikable charactersSome cool combat abilitiesNillin is just a total badassCons:RepetitiveShort storyLimited combat options "

												When I play a game I want to like it, and there is plenty to like in Remember me. There are of wonderful elements to appreciate in this game from the amazing soundtrack, to the incredible visuals, to the fun and intriguing cyber punk story, and a unique take on a free flow melee combat system.The game is far from perfect of course. A few mechanics don't quite always work and it seemed like there were a few hit detection issues, sometimes enemies seemed to have an unfair reach, and at times they seemed to have a near precognitive ability to know right where I would dodge so that they were waiting to get another cheap hit in as soon as I landed. Some of the cheap shots and other issues seemed to be alleviated as you found the best rhythm in each fight. Quick combos to regain health then dodge dodge, quick cooldown combo and etc. The combo system, combined with your various special abilities, do give combat a very strategic feel and there is a nice array of enemy types to always test you. Overall it can be very rewarding when you manage to pull out a win against all odds, or bring your health back up from the brink of death, but on the flip side it can be terribly frustrating. Not often but in some of the bigger battles certainly.However, I would still highly recommend this game. I was surprised how much I liked the story and it certainly went certain places and explored certain themes I had not expected. This is a game and setting with so much potential. Sadly, I feel they didn't get to explore the full potential in this game. But then that's all the more reason to support original IPs like this. Its entertaining and it felt incredibly unique, which is often hard to do these days. So pick this one up and give it a try.			"

												""Remember Me"" exemplifies everything I love about video games. The depth of the storyline pulls you in, makes you care about the world and the characters, and leaves you determined to change what has gone awry. I even got a lil emotional at certain points of the game... T.TAnd like, the gameplay... got awesome all over my face.The ability to craft combos was neato, and the fluidity of the fighting mechanics was really enjoyable. The jumping around/traversing heights was a nice touch. Even with the indicators lighting your way, there was still a need to find a safe path inherent. The creators even threw in a few riddles to solve.*GASP* The game actually makes you think? The horror.Which brings me to the memory remixing... super fun! Some of the remixes weren't really easy to determine a progression of events that would shape the desired outcome. This led to a fumbly bit of trial and error that, initially, left a bad taste in my mouth. However, as the game moved on, the memories you resculpted offered a series of choices that began to highlight a specific pattern to uncover.Yes, more thinking. D:Also, the game is realllllly pretty.This game has everything. I will be replaying it veryveryvery soon. <3			"

												I took a chance on this game and I'm pretty satisfied that I did.Set in Neo-Paris in 2084, Remember Me drops you into a world where our current social media obsession has evolved into the Sensation Engine (Sensen) - a technology that allows someone to upload and share their personal memories, experiences, and emotions with the always-online world or even go so far as to erase bad memories or live someone else's.The player takes the role of Nillin - an amnesiac who finds herself locked up and about to be lobatamized but escapes with the help of the mysterious Edge. Edge claims he and Nillin are vital members of the resistance fighting to take down the company who created the Sensen and as a result have indirectly achieved incredible power and influence.The gameplay balances 3rd person melee combat with fairly straight forward platforming sections. While the combat is no God of War or Devil May Cry, its simplicity doesn't actually hurt the game and presents a challenge in its own right as the player encounters numerous enemy types with differing strengths and weaknesses - forcing you to adopt different strategies, use different abilities, and create your own combos. Platforming on the other hand is more akin to the Uncharted series rather than the open world type found in Assassin's Creed.Overall the game is quite well polished, it looks fantastic, the voice work and animation is great, and the soundtrack is superb. The only real downsides to the game is that some experienced gamers may find it too easy even on the hardest difficulty as well as the fact that the game might only be six or seven hours in length.The most important thing to know before buying this game is that it's a linear story/character driven experience. If you were a fan of Ninja Theory's Heavenly Sword and Enslaved Odyssey to the West you'll enjoy Remember Me. If not then you're taking your chances with it.			"

												Personally i think its a good game. Definetly built for a console more then a PC (A lot of fixed cameras). The strory is very interesting and immersive, but for the deeper immersion the developers had to build the game in strictly linear way. The combat system give you 2 playstyles. First, you can abuse dodge, forget most of the combos and you will be untouchable and bored (For those who dont want to experience a combat system in this game). Second, customize your combos and use them (personally i needed only 3 of the 4 combo chains you will be given), thats where the combat will shine and will start to be interesting and challenging. All of the Boss fights are different, interesting and require some tactics. Good looks, fine voice acting, a lot of awesome movies. I had 2 problems with this game. First, some failed scripts forced me to restart the checkpoints couple of times. Second, none re-picks of the taken routes. You took the path and you can forget about the other one. Just cause of horde of checkpoints but only an ability to reload the last one. That means, if you took the path that doesnt contain the collectible or a boost pack you can forget about them until after the end of the game when you will be given choice to reload every Episode you have played (VERY annoying). It took me 12.6 Hrs to defeat the game in the hard mode with 86% of completion. IMHO, i recommend this game for those who like a very good stories,animations and deep immersion into the games. Those who want to experince only new combat systems and want to feel some adrenaline rush will not find it in this game.			"

												A Great game, but needed just a bit more.This game, made using the Unreal engine, is gorgeous. When you have the time, stop and look around, you'll find exquisite detail, and jaw dropping back drops. Gameplay is... passable. I love the combo system, and I love remixing the combos, but i felt a little restrained, like the game wanted to give me more control, but just couldn't. A few more available combo strings would have been nice. The pressens were varied, and I loved chaining them together and watching new animations.Now the exploration could have been a little more actiony. The mechanics for traversing the vast city was a little robotic, and not very fluid. The same could be said for the combat. though the combat made a little more sense, on the fact that you were able to throw random animation together and in any combination, I would have like to see more fluid traversal, since that was something the devs had control of. Not to mention, if your gonna be a terrorist in a neo-cyberpunk Paris and you end up on roof tops, ya best be parkouring over every little piece of architecture you can find.The music, a lot better than expected, it had a nice ambiance, and didn’t get annoying, and the tempo kept you rolling with the best of them throughout. Some vocal tracks would have been a nice touch.The story. Now this is where this game gets interesting, the character Nillin is an errorist and starts the game with amnesia(how many times has this happened in games now), which provides a vehicle to move along how she learns all of her abilities, and how she also is made into and errand girl for all of the game........ALL OF IT. This character talked about the freedom of choice and was more willing to follow a disembodied voice for forever and a day. Which is funny, because the character talks about how she hates doing that. The basic premise of the story is small band of rebels, and big bad corporation, and the meaning of memory. A classic story trope, and done well, especially in the setting, it’ll be a great play for anyone who picks it up7.5/10			"

												The Matrix meets Inception, that is perhaps giving it a little too much credit. Set in a cyberpunk future ""Neo-Paris"" where memories can be copied, shared or stolen. Remember Me has style for sure however when it comes to one of the most central parts of the game: the combat, it falls short.I wouldn't recommend playing with mouse and keyboard if you have a controller, I played with an xbox controller and even that felt clunky. The combat is frustrating for a number of reasons, there is no Lock-on feature when fighting, the only lock on is for your ranged weapon. Dodging is awkward and a little buggy sometimes you can find yourself stuck in a dogpile of enemies if you do not compensate for that eventualilty. The combos can be really hard to pull off even though they aren't that complex buttonwise, the problem is when fighting multiple enemies one always sneaks in a jab and breaks your combo, you can dodge and resume the combo but the time you're given to do so is very short. The combo editing system had the potential to be really awesome mixing and matching damage, health regen, cooldown reset and multiplier moves however it simply isn't mainly because a jack of all trades combo set isn't good at anything and you are much better off focusing one of the four sets soley to do damage or regen health ect.7/10. Great visuals and story, great sound design and voice acting, poor music however and then of course the flawed combat.			"

												BEST GAME EVER - 11/10! If you enjoyed Mirror's Edge and the Batman Arkham Series, and you have a knack for gadgets and futuristic landscape art with amazing lighting effects, this game is DEFINITELY a MUST-PLAY adventure. They did such a great job of implementing new mechanics around the storyline. In chapter 3, you're still learning how to do new move types and combos, and gaining new abilities, which can then be used to unlock more puzzles. Plenty of secrets to find throughout the game, and collect. Certainly is an absolutely stunningly beautiful game, with an amazingly compelling storyline, attractive main character, and all the fist fights you can ever hope for. Music is great too, done by the Philharmonic Orchestra. It's such an incredible game, and I believe it's worth the price. Fantastic job with this one DONTNOD Entertainment!			"

												Simply an amazing game. If you are a fan of Blade Runner, Inception, or the like, you will love this game. The story is simply astounding - and the idea of remixing memories is novel, as is an economy built on the commoditization of them. The plot twist I was expecting (but didn't happen) is that you in fact aren't the main character, just another person who had her memories transplanted in you.The game is satisfying, if linear. The only criticism I would have is that the places where the bonuses are hidden aren't very well indicated many times, and if you make a wrong turn and continue the story, you can't go back.Outside of that, time and money extraordinarily well spent.

This game's futuristic environments/soundtrack really set an atmosphere that must be experienced. Easily one of the best games this generation and a must play. Forget MetaCritc scores on the console versions as the engine was just too ambitious for such old hardware. Gameplay mechanics are slick and the control was tight. 9/10, well worth the $50 price tag.			"

												Remember MeAt first, I was very wary of this action-adventure game set in a cyberpunk setting. It had mixed reviews and while the game is far from perfection, I can't say Remembe Me is bad. Far from it actually! But sadly, there is a few irritants that unable Remember Me to be outstanding. To make it short, you are Nilin, a memory hunter, in Neo-Paris set in 2084, that somehow, got herself arrested and get's a mindwipe that erases most of your memories. You're liberated from a shady contact, called Edge, who wants you to remember who you really are and also, wants to change  the world as they know it since it is very repressed. The people in this game's world buy/sell memories either good/bad like some simple commodity. There is some addicts who are living in the slums and they've lost mostly if not all their personality.The gameplay is quite similar to the Batman Arkham games except don't expect a ""detective mode"" when you're roaming the places. The combat is almost a direct copy of Arkham's except you setup your own combos how you want them once you have unlocked sufficient points. It took me a while to figure out how it works but once you do understand it, the gameplay will be much easier! I played the whole game with the Xbox 360 gamepad since the Keyboard and Mouse controls were really atrocious in this game. But the controls, even on the XB360 gamepad, they're very wonky and even laggish... and during combat, you can't have wonky unresponsive controls! The story unfolds at a good pace. Total playtime is fairly decent for a modern game as they usually clock under 10 hours. The platforming moments are pretty easy as they're highlighted properly. Remember Me has a few Quick-Time Events that mostly occurs on bosses and they aren't too intrusive. There's a few puzzles mostly towards the last three episodes and they're fairly easy to resolve!My gripes are mainly on the movements. Secondly would be the annoying patrolling drones that you can't disable, only evade they're detection field.PROS:+Fascinating dark vision of the future.+Truly impressive visuals (graphics, 3D modeling, etc).+Fitting soundtrack on this cyberpunk world.+Remixing memories (manipulating memories) is a cool feature enabling you to craft memories into an individual.+Edward Snowden would love this game... as it explores hot-topic issues like surveillance and social media.+Nilin is a strong protagonist that make's her feelsvery human.CONS:-Cumbersome camera that get's in the way very often.-Ordinary and stiff combat that get's frustrating at times, until you figure out how the combo-setup/system works.-Extremely linear and little exploration. Level design feels constricting. You see the superb Paris on backgrounds yet you never get to explore much.-Not enough Memory Remix and sadly, only to main characters. Would have been greater to do that at others!-Dialogue is mostly all cheesy in this game.-British accents for French citizens? Hmm... something's wrong here!-Little replay value (only if you seek all achievements and collectibles that is!).OVERALL:A fun game that has a few irritants which holds Remember Me from being a very good game. Granted it is DONTNOD Entertainment's first game and clearly, these irritants can easily be fixed in a possible sequel or another similar game. The combat and platforming are the least interesting parts of Remember Me, and they're what you'll be doing most. You don't have much exploration to do as once you reach a certain area, you're locked out. Though Neo-Paris is unforgettable, your journey through it isn't.RECOMMENDATION:Yes, I do recommend this game. If you can ignore its issues, you're surely going to enjoy Remember Me. It's not a perfect action-adventure game but in my opinion, it get's the job done in entertainement!RATING:7.0 / 10			"

												Surprisingly satisfying game. While the combat remained rather stale and button mash-y throughout, the storyline and impressive visuals kept me engaged. While I thoroughly enjoyed the French language voice acting, I found it quite odd (and a bit of a letdown) that I was unable to change the subtitles or the in-game language to accompany the audio (especially for a game from a French developer that's set in Paris).
