												tl;dr: Don't get it if you have a problem with short, old, adventure games. For everyone else that's even considering it, don't hesitate.The Shivah is a short noir detective adventure starring a rabbi. It's a traditional point & click, intelligent, well-written, with an understated sense of humor. Its storytelling actually does a surprising amount of justice to the themes of faith and morality. The puzzles (sleuthing mostly, no item combinations or enviromental puzzles) are all logical and solvable, so resist the occasional headscratching and stick with them, you shouldn't really need a walkthrough. I have a special soft spot for its voice acting, I personally find it absolutely brilliant (don't miss the voiceacting bloopers!). The remastered edition completely redid the game's graphics, and if you like the WadjetEye style, you will appreciate them, even though they're nothing to phone home about. They also added new music, which I really enjoyed in how perfectly it sets the mood. Despite how short it is, The Shivah feels like a complete experience, in the same way a good short story does, so it won't leave you unsatisfied. If you are intrerested in replaying it for the achievements and the alternate endings, I'd suggest playing it with the commentary on (Kibbitz Mode), it is short and non intrusive to the playthrough and offers a bit of background story.This game was the starting off point for WadjetEye Games (Gemini Rue, Blackwell series, Resonance, etc) and as far as I am concerned it by now belongs to the cannon for lovers of adventure games, as an interesting example for understanding the evolution of the genre and as one of the few games that touches religious topics in a mature way. I have been replaying it once in a while since it first came out and despite its small flaws, it is a lovable little gem and as much of a treat to play today as it ever was.			"

Dislikes:--The slow, unskippable monologue you have to sit through every single time the game starts. Or if you die and need to load a save, you have to sit through it AGAIN before you can get to the load menu.--Final confrontation feels a little too trial and error.--UI/HUD elements feel a bit rough.--Extreeemely short.Likes:--A rabbi having a crisis of faith is a character type I've never played before, and judaism more generally is a theme I've never played before, so I was very happy playing as a new type of protagonist in a new type of backdrop.--Two cameos from Rosa Blackwell!!! And a cameo from Sam Durkin!!! Also, the apartment that the Lauders live in is Emil's apartment from Blackwell Epiphany! I LOVE IT!!!--I like that the game has ""moral choices"", but that choices are not intended to be a question of whether you (i.e. Rabbi Stone) are good or evil (you're a good guy no matter what), but more a question of faith and principles. You're not just choosing between good/evil or goodcop/badcop. You're choosing between the human response and the faith response. Because you/Stone are depicted as having a crisis of faith and are therefore sitting on the fence in this regard, both choices make perfect sense and seem equally acceptable. It feels less like the game is judging your choice than it often does with the blunt good/evil type scenarios you usually get. And when I say ""crisis of faith"", it's not that Rabbi Stone is becoming an atheist or anything like that. It's not that kind of crisis of faith. He's just reached a point where he's unhappy with his life and starts to feel that his faith is not getting him anywhere, so he's having trouble putting his faith in god's will instead of his own. So your ""moral choices"" are a choice between giving a situation to god's will or giving a situation to your own will. I like that this gives the moral decisions a slightly different flavor than usual and it's something I wish would have been even more pronounced. (Although I am not religious myself, I still found this very interesting in character exploration terms.)--In the final encounter, I was impressed with how many different outcomes that encounter could have depending on the choices you make in that scene and the choices you made in earlier scenes. I was also extremely shocked and saddened with one particular outcome of one particular choice.... daaaaang that was harsh. Fortunately I was able to avoid it on another attempt. Whew.Final Thoughts:While it didn't quite blow my mind the way that the Blackwell games did, it was an interesting new character and subject, and looking at moral choices through the lens of a crisis of faith was a kinda refreshing take on a tired old gaming trope.

												I really want to recommend this game, but honestly, I just can't.The game's story is a pretty solid murder mystery, and reminds me heavily of the Ace Attorney investigations. You collect clues to progress, and can combine them in a sort of logic system. But, throughout the entire game, you'll only actually recieve one inventory item, and collect 4 total clues. The Shivah's length absolutely is it's own worse enemy. While there's no filler or downtime to chug through, the game can easily be completed in less than an hour if you know what you're doing. The only real length to the game would be the trial and error combat sections. You fight two different people in the game, and both of them can only be beaten with an exact choice of words. Over all, the game wasn't bad, just extremely short. You don't really have enough time with Rabbi Stone to really resonate with him, which is a shame, because the premise at the start seemed really interesting.			"

												A short but self-contained point and click adventure game telling the story of a depressed Rabbi who got entangled in a murder mystery. Despite the religious angle, the game itself doesn't get too deep into Judaism and stays on the surface while focusing on the investigation. Some elements of the story appeared as either lazy stereotypes (the Italian mafia) or downright controversial (opposing inter-faith marriage), as the game's setting could have allow for further exploration of relevant religious topics. Ultimately, the game left me unfulfilled, aside from replaying small sections of the game to get the remaining achievements. The music is thematic and on point, but the voice overs vary from amateur to serviceable with a few glitchy lines. Worth it just for the unique setting and achievements. 3/5			"

												Another solid, but short, point-and-click adventure game from the same guy who made the Blackwell-series; Dave Gilbert. Its about a rabbi trying to solve a crime. Its is quite straight to the point and with a limited amount of puzzles was still an interesting experience and has a bunch of different outcomes. Worth giving a shot.Most of the achievements are tied to the different choices and outcomes in the game so you either need to replay the game a few times and act differently or simply use savefiles efficiently to get it quicker.

												This is a really impressive adventure game. In its brief length it manages to touch on themes like organized religion, inter-faith relationships, and corruption in a way that doesn't give an answer as to who is right and who is wrong. It delivers this dialog in the context of a murder mystery that is told in a way that only a game could. The game oozes with atomosphere not only through it's art and sound design, but also its writing and puzzle design. If this game had any flaws it would be its criminally short length as well as a couple obscure puzzles. However, those factors really shouldn't keep you from a game this reasonably priced.			"

												The Shivah is an old adventure game made by now veteran game company, Wadjet Eye. I recommend it for:- Those who are fans of Wadjet Eye, have played their newer offerings and are interested in seeing the progression in quality- Those who are fans of Wadjet Eye and want to support them by purchasing an additional game- Those who are interested in experiencing a very short story which captures a bit of Jewish NYC cultureIt is very difficult to rate the Shivah because it hasn't aged very well in terms of game design and overall plot quality. The individual character interactions though are a delight. You can definitely see the roots of talent which the lead designer has refined over time. However, if you're new to adventure games or to Wadjet, I'd recommend one of their newer games. It is rough around the edges and may put you off the game mechanic genre or the developer.			"

												TL,DR: The Shivah has a lot of potential in regard to its unique themes and characters, but the end result feels weak and rushed. It's not a bad game and it's worth playing if only for the fact that it has a lot of plot elements you don't see in other games. However,  the previously mentioned issue combined with unengaging gameplay make it hard to recommend. ----------------------------------------------I like Wadjet Eye games. I""ve played through the entire Blackwell series. I enjoy adventure games, story heavy games, all that kind of stuff. So, I was excited for The Shivah. It's gotten a lot of acclaim and it was the first Wadjet Eye game I had heard of.Unfortunately, it falls very flat, not working as a game or a narrative. Let's start with the game aspect: there is not much here. The clue combining mechanic, which was used later in the Blackwell games, is used once in The Shivah. It makes you wonder why it was even in there. The puzzles are extremely repetitive. Almost all of them involve figuring out computer passwords. From a logic/story perspective, that makes sense. In the real world, that makes sense. You're doing detective work, you need information, checking someone's e-mail is a good idea. From a gameplay perspective, it works once and after that it gets tedious. It's not particularly challenging, either. There are two dialogue puzzles that use the exact same mechanic. The mechanic of these puzzles is something that is under-scored through the entire game, but I did not catch on to the gimmick. It's not a big deal in the first instance, but can be kind of frustrating in the second. It's not cheap, like I said, the key to these puzzles is all through out, but it's always used as a joke. That makes it hard to connect it to a more serious situation. It can also be figured out through trial and error, but, as with all adventure games, if you start getting frustrated or annoyed your logic and your observation can start to break down.The Shivah is more about the story and character though, both of which have a lot of potential, but not much is done with either. The concept of a murder mystery involving the Jewish community is interesting and gave me flashes of the movie ""Homicide."" The plot is fairly boiler plate which wouldn't be a problem if everything else around it were stronger. In particular, the main antagonist is much too broad. His motivations don't seem to be much more than money and because he's evil. The biggest problem is with the main character, Rabbi Stone. Stone could have been an amazing character if Gilbert had done more with him, fleshed him out. Most of what we see of Stone shows him as little more than angry and down-on-his-luck. Then, at the end, when one of the big plot mysteries gets revealed a new layer of depth is shown that was barely alluded to. This reveal should have at least made me go, ""Ah, I see, that makes sense."" Instead, it felt ham-handed and almost a side-note for the character. Stone has the potential to be one of the most complex characters in video games and it's disappointing how little is done with him.Also, for such a short game, there are a lot of logic problems/plot holes. Some of them are relatively small, kind of nitpicky things, but others really mess things up. The most central is why would Jack Lauder will money to Rabbi Stone? This can be theoried away and a little ambiguity isn't a bad thing. Much harder to hand wave away is the fact that nobody calls the police, ever.  The original form of the game was created in a month (at least that's what I understand from the commentary). It was later given a revamp for its graphics, music and voice acting. I wish Gilbert would have taken advantage of the fact that he was no longer under such tight time constraints and gone deeper with everything.The Shivah is worth playing and $5 isn't an outrage for a game that has such a good foundation. Honestly, I'm happy to have paid it just to support Dave Gilbert and Wadjet Eye Games. However, I have enough issues with it that I can't recommend it.			"

												Great little adventure game, reminiscent of  '80s and '90s classics. A dark comedy where a jaded rabbi becomes a film noir gumshoe to solve a murder - really, that original premise alone justifies the game's existence. Thankfully, it's a good story, with the main character grappling with some interesting serious issues as well.Not a very long game - initial playthrough probably about an hour - but the achievements and commentary give it a little replay value. Solid music, dialogue and voice acting. Glad they put in the effort to upgrade the original version from many years ago. Highly recommended for fans of the genre.			"

												From creator Dave Gilbert and his Wadjet Eye Games studio behind the awesome projects such as Gemini Rue and Blackwell playing their first product - point-and-click adventure game from 2006 - The Shivah - was pretty nice experience. Just for the record - this is not original game from 2006 but Kosher Edition from 2013 which features brand new music, graphics and re-recorded voice-overs. Why it was? Well, it doesn't happen often, that you are able to play as a Jewish Rabbi who's Sherlock Holmes on his road to exploit crimes of big business and also really old man with enough boxing skills that he's able to knock out an assassin whose first murder happened when he was 12 years old. Pretty solid right?Dialogues are very well written, actors are fair enough, whole story concept isn't the best we could possibly encounter, but if we consider it as a game to fill up late evening and no expectations, we got it and it's calm af. Music was truly good. I don't even want to talk about it much, you just need to listen to it.Dave Gilbert did a great job and even the fact that he did something with this project after 7 years to make it little more better really counts. And I will thank him for that soon. Bonus Point: IdeaRating: 6.000.000.000/10			"

												I liked the game a lot, despise being very short, but it gives what an adventure game should: it has an intriguing story and somehow a realistic resolution, but I rather not spoil it. In addition the game does give you few different ways to continue, more like to go through, since you can choose different speeches and, sometimes, change some last parts at the end depending on the choices. Nothing big but I like that.For me the real drawbacks are the length of the game, like I said, and the fact that it's a little out of reach, since it has jewish elements and I can't say if some things are for real or not and can be a little hard to get into it unlike, say, Deponia and their comedic settings. Not sure how close to the source it is however.If you like point and click game that doesn't last for too long and have a different mentality than usual, this could be interesting: it's probably nothing revolutionary, but for me those two hours were well spent.

												Fantastic game. For it's 5$ price tag, the 1 hour length is perfectly fine, as far as I'm concerned. The story is legitimately interesting and has the best style of puzzle for an adventure game like this. In almost every situation, the pieces are laid out in plain sight at all times. But not only is it on you to put them together, but to realize what the pieces were. I've heard complaints that the final ""boss fight"", for lack of a better word, was too trial and error. I contest that it's perfectly fine and has a couple hints that are BEYOND brilliant. Now back to that story I mentioned breifly, earlier. It's fantastic. The only complaint is that the Rabbi Stone is about one empty bottle of Jack Daniel's away from a ""grizzled detective"" stereotype. Other than that the characters, even the ones that don't show up, are all well fleshed out in the short runtime. Ultimately I'd give this an 8/10			"

												An enjoyable narrative experience following a failing rabbi and his equally failing synagogue, it's fairly a bleak look into a man with a troubled past and what feels like a fundamental loss of faith that he can regrow as he investigates the death of a former member of his congregation that has left him a significant amount of money through his estate.The story itself is actually fairly dull and pretty predictable but the game itself is heavily dialogue laden - near all conversation and text is as if it were a rabbi talking, with some ""puzzles"" even solved by taking the rabbinical answer to whatever situation is posed. That's really the key to the game: the dialogue and the development of Rabbi Stone as a character, they are both brilliantly written and pick up the slack in the story.Though, it is a point and click game with a few text and combat puzzles - usually based around remembering key facts around people and placing them into the in-game equivalent of Google at your computer terminal so paying attention is actually a must. The downside to this, is the fact you normally have to travel back to your office to find the information required to progress in the story.I would recommend this game to people that enjoy art house, narrative driven, emotionally charged indie games. It's a very niche product, but I would absolutely recommend it to those already on the fence.			"

												The Shivah is the most Jewish game I've ever played. In what other game can you play as a down-on-his-luck rabbi? This opens room for all kinds of conflicts you can't find anywhere else, and The Shivah takes advantage of its unique angle, even though the story doesn't turn out to be anything spectacular. The game's creator, Dave Gilbert, has a bad habit of writing great down to earth, slice of life stories (as he did as well in the Blackwell series) that culminate in ridiculous situations which are a far cry from the relatable realism we see in the beginning. It was hard for me to take the final climax that seriously and I was disappointed that Rabbi Stone showed little to no character development.If you enjoyed the Blackwell series, then you probably know what to expect in terms of gameplay from The Shivah. A point-and-click game with occasional bouts of frustrating stretches where you wonder back and forth between locations, trying to figure out what detail you are missing. Your choices in dialogue do cause some small deviations in conversations, and there are several different endings that depend on the choices you make in the last scene (I would save before entering the final location so you can try again if you don't like the ending you get). Despite its flaws, I would recommend picking this game up on a sale, as the story is engaging for its short length (think around two hours to beat). And I mean, where else can you play as a rabbi?

												Intelligent but very short mystery adventure game dealing with themes of justice and human faultiness.I really don't want to give away anything from the plot because sadly this game is very short. It feels a bit like the developer started working on something greater but gave up and decided to wrap it up abruptly. Gameplay follows standard point'n'click idioms; left click to walk and interact and right click for a description or protagonist's thoughts. There is also a clue system which allows you to ask characters about key topics and combine them to form new clues. Not quite as ingenious and practical as the long- and short-term memory system in Resonance, but it's a break from the more traditional object-oriented approach. The clues, dialogues and terminals are your main interfaces to solving puzzles in this game.Regarding the story, suffice it to say that the main protagonist finds himself unexpectedly and rather uninvitingly dragged into an ambivalent situation that motivates him to set out to seek answers to ever-increasing questions and gradually gets more involved in the mystery. Then, it's over. But I liked the ending.I just wish there was more story, environments and characters in this game. The premise is good, the writing and dialogue are generally good and managed to evoke my interest in both the characters and their interpersonal affairs and the unfolding plot, art is good, music was perhaps on the forgettable side but not bad by any means, and you get to make some choices that breathe a bit of extra life into the dynamics and work together with the philosophical contemplation present in the dialogue (or monologue). There is no voice acting and I don't miss it.Besides scantiness of content, there is one more complaint I have: The god damn terminals. Accessing information through in-game terminals is a pet peeve of Wadjet Eye Games', and The Shivah takes it a step too far forcing you to do a lot of ""office work"" to follow up on clues. It wouldn't be so bad if the game was lengthier, but as it is I find it hard to justify the current office work to exploration ratio. That said, it still feels satisfying to pull off a fruitful day at the office.I can't comment on the price as the question of whether it's reasonable is so relative.

												Nice but shortThis is a sweet little game that does a lot of things right. From the start, the game works hard to build up a noir atmosphere, complete with the heavy voiceover. The jewish bits work fine with it as well, as a lot of the fun in the story comes from protagonist Russel Stone, wrestling with heavy moral issues. This he does, while balancing his role as a rabbi with his new role as a brooding noir detective, and i have to admit that i enjoyed that mix quite a lot. The semitic bits never gets in the way of the game though, and i appreciate that a little part of the game consists of learning some jiddisch for example. Also, it takes a lot of place in the dialog, and there is fun to be had seeing things from, and acting from the perspective of a rabbi, and the dilemmas they face.This does a lot for pushing the story along, and i enjoyed interacting with the character, and slowly unravelling the thread of the investigation. The problem is that the game is over when you are just getting started.It’s not that you don’t see the end coming, though. The game is paced very nicely. When mucking about with the investigation, you always feel like you are making progress, and you get that little AHA-feeling of discovering something new, and when you finally reach the end, there are no loose ends. But it also feels like you just got the hang of things, and now, you're all done. And that's a bit of a bummer.The game is also pretty good looking. The visuals might get a little bit flat sometimes, but everything looks and feels nice and atmospheric, with it's glorified sierra look. It also made me miss a point system, for added replayability. The voice acting and writing can get a bit hammy, but all that stuff is forgivable considering this is a game from a studio of just a few people. Considering that, i don’t expect Hollywood performances, but instead enjoy it for what it is. The shivah is not an epic, but that's kind of sad, for it has potential for a far bigger and more involved story in it. "

												*Slight Spoilers*The Shivah starts out very promising. Atmospherically, it perfectly captures the mundane life of the city, but mixes in heady philosophical questions and a dash of murder. Throughout the story, Rabbi Stone wrestles with what it means to be a ""true Jew"" while figuring out why a recently murdered acquaintaince left his failing temple a large portion of inheritance money. The game takes you to a few locations in NYC, set to slow croning music that perfectly captures the noir theme. The characters are colorful, if not just a teeny bit stereotypical. The game is your average point and click, but the game is based less on exploration and more on discovering clues through dialogue trees. It requires a heavy amount of critical thought otherwise you will definitely reach a point where you hit a wall and cannot advance without a walkthrough or something. The difficulty is refreshing, but certain solutions to the puzzles are extremely obscured and will frustrate you. However, if not for these, the game could probably be completed in 10-30 minutes on a blind run.However, a critical junction of the game wherein it turns into a sort of action drama is where the game falls apart. Fighting is done through a series of dialogue trees, with your choices having minimal effect outside of lose conditions and achievements. It is at this point where the game tonally shifts completely and becomes almost a self-parody. The two fights in the game center upon a sort of tongue-in-cheek reference to rabbinical procedure (answering questions with questions) and characters are punished for not adhering to this. The motivations of the characters quickly unravel as the game becomes increasingly more ridiculous.The games abrupt ending leaves you wondering if Rabbi Stone really learned anything; and I can't help but think if this game was expanded an hour more, chose to handle the action sequences more tactfully, and actually dwelled more on the rift between Stone and the changing realities of Jewish culture it would be an effective vehicle for a compelling story. But maybe its for the better that they did not dwell too much on the religious undertones. Stone is a good example of a flawed character and one of the best aspects of the game.Don't pay full price for this.			"

												Let's start by saying that I'm not particularly good at point-and-click adventures. They're too slow and time consuming and the puzzles usually don't make much sense to me. Having said that, I did enjoy The Shivah, mainly because it's a short game that even *I* could complete, with its 2-3 hour length The puzzles also made sense, and weren't too hard to finish. The last 'puzzle', on the rooftop (if you've played it you probably know what I mean), was unnecessary and unrealistic. I actually enjoyed the game less because of that one puzzle, because the puzzles before that were logical. This one just wasn't. Truly a shame.In the end The Shivah was a fun game, but I wouldn't ever play it a second time. Point-and-click adventures will never be my thing I'm afraid.[Rating: 75/100]			"

												Rabbi Stone is facing a religious crisis made worse by the fact his synagogue is almost out of money and has been facing poor attendance for a long time: an unexpected visit reveals that a former member oh his congregation left him a good amount of money after his sudden death and Stone decides to look into what exactly happened.With a good story and some provoking moral dilemmas The Shivah is a very good game despite its short length and low production values.PROS:-great story deals with mature themes (without spoiling too much there's blackmail, organized crime, murders etc)-a couple of great moral dilemmas directly impact the last scenes of the story and the ending you get-some replayability for those interested in seeing how things change with the different choices you can make-the soundtrack is pretty good-fully voice actedCONS:-a bit light on puzzles, you mostly connect clues and speak to people about them-voice acting suffers from low production values, some voices are a bit metallic and mic noises can be often heard-graphics are quite barebones-short at 1 to 1,5 hours to complete

The Shivah doesn't last long but it does offer a very well-written story and some thought-provoking choices while you play it, its religious theme also delves into a few philosophical and moral questions that should be interesting for players with the right mindset to appreciate them. Its overall low production values can be forgiven when you think this was originally a freeware game made in a month and when you consider its low price (especially on sale when it goes lower than 2$).I truly enjoyed my time with it and found its gritty story truly enjoyable: that's why it's an easy recommendation for anyone interested in the genre.

												The Shivah has some really big flaws that got in my way of fully appreciating it:- There was one puzzle about a third of the way into the game that I felt had no obvious clue of how to solve it. I ended up using a walkthrough to find out the solution and it was not at all clear how you were ever supposed to know that information.- The final segment of the game is tedous. You can't save during it, and if you fail you have to watch the opening scene animation all over again, then hit space bar a million times after you've loaded the most recent game to skip through dialogue you've already read. I think I had to do that 5-6 times before I was able to beat the game properly.Having said all that, the subject matter of the game was very unique, and even though I'm not Jewish I found it refreshing and interesting. I'd love to play more games with such unique atmosphere.			"

												Well, this is another (short) adventure masterpiece of WadgetEYE. The graphics are well remastered comparing the original. The story plays in the Jewish community of New York and you are a Rabbi. It starts with the comissioner is asking you some questions about a murder. There you first can use the funniest feature - to answer the rabbical way - which means to ask in return. Altogether the atmosphere in this game is melancholic and criminal, but nicely done. It's hard to find out some login passwords but if you come to the final scene 3 different endings awaiting you. There's also a little jewish dictionary in this game  - nice.			"

												One of Wadjet Eye's very very early games, with a simple story that lasts about 30 - 50 minutes at most.  My added playtime was for getting steam trading cards.  I used a guide to figure out one of the endings but more or less managed it fine otherwise.Its hard to say too much about such a short game.  The story is passable, the music is passable, and the few puzzles can be a tiny bit clunky because you dont have too much time to get used to the game, but none of it is bad.  Probably best to wait for a sale if you want it and even then consider picking up Wadjet Eye's more robust later titles, this one is just a bit too short.There are a few failstates in the game involving the death of the main character, which revert you back to your last save should you encounter them.  They fit the setting and choices invovled, but they do involve death by gunshot to the head and there is the option to murder both the villains when they are encountered in a few points.  Also, if you wish to run the game in windowed mode you will need to run a setup exe in the game folder, but nothing any experienced PC gamer will have trouble with.			"

From Wadjet Eye point'n'click adventure games, I would rather recommend Primordia, which is one of my favourite adventure games, but if you can get The Shivah on a sale, you should buy it too, if you like this genre.

												Although The Shivah is a very short graphic adventure (you can get through it in about an hour or so), don't let that turn you away. The writing, characters, and dialogue are excellent throughout, and while the puzzles are simplistic, they don't detract from the storytelling one bit. This may make the game border more on ""interactive novel"" than ""graphic adventure"", but as mentioned, that doesn't hurt the game's storytelling.As few games hit up the content that The Shivah does (the Jewish faith and what it means to have faith in oneself), this is an experience worth undertaking.

												Before the Blackwell series, before Technobabylon, before Gemini Rue, a man named Dave Gilbert got together with a few artists and voice actors and made a short little entry for an adventure game competition, about a jaded Rabbi trying to unravel the reasons behind an unexpected inheritance.  The entry was so well received that Mr. Gilbert formed a company called Wadjet Eye Games, expanded the contest entry to be longer, and released it as his new company's first game: The Shivah.  While many other games would follow it, The Shivah shows where a lot of those later titles get their style and many of their mechanics, the ever-popular ""notes and clues"" system in particular.Separate of all that though, The Shivah is a fine title in its own right.  It's a bit short to be fair, with a first-time playthrough likely clocking in at around an hour or two, but it's a solidly constructed few hours, with great voicework and a decently compelling plot.  There's also plenty of detail to the relatively small slice of virtual New York that the game inhabits.  If you're the kind of adventure game player who wants to see all the descriptions and interact with all the things you can, there's a good amount to keep you occupied.  If you're more interested in a short-but-well-done ""whodunit"" with a few branching paths and a fair bit of dialog to listen to, then you also will be happy.About the only bad thing I can say about the game is that the price might seem a bit steep for something that is so relatively short, at least to people who aren't already fans of Wadjet Eye.  If you are though, then this is a fantastic version of their very first title, and well worth a play.			"

												The Shiva is a charming and overall enjoyable game, that has a lot of problems though.The Story of Rabbi Stone trying to solve a murder mystery of former congregation member is a good setup for an interesting story that tackles questions of faith, and the few characters you meet are interesting and well written and vioced. But ... it's about that.The game Rushes to it's conclusion so fast, that you can finish it in half an hour when you know the puzzle's solutions, only 3 (!) NPCs are important to the murder mystery, the mystery itself is found out through a quite clever puzzle idea, but that idea is overused and about the only thing you can do to advance the Plot. A certain way of talking is used as a joke, but while funny initially (and again at the end) it soon loses it's comedic value.The end fight itself is done in a unique and clever way, and fun once you figured out what to do, but the leadup to that fight is a series of more or less random dialoge choices that will lead to game overs over and over again unless you find the right path via trial and error. A puzzle shouldn't be done like this. This wasn't a puzzle. It was a chore.So what could have easily been a 9/10, ends up a short 6/10, or perhaps a 7/10 if you like the music and the setting.I can recommend the game wholehardetly if you can get the Key cheaply in a bundle or on Ebay, but don't expect too much from it. It is good to waste a rainy hour, but not for much more.			"

												I'm not sure exactly where I stand on The Shivah. On the one hand, it's a point-and-click adventure with reasonable, enjoyable puzzles, a really solidly written story, and a (thankfully sensitively handled) Jewish twist on a classic film noir recipe. You play as Russell Stone, a down-on-his-luck rabbi running the saddest little synagogue in Manhattan. Faced with imminent bankruptcy, you suddenly find yourself inheriting a tiny fortune from a dead former member of your congregation who, by all rights, has every reason to despise you. With the police eyeballing you as their most likely suspect and your faith teetering on the edge of total collapse, you set out to discover exactly what's going on, armed with nothing more than a mean left hook and a knack for answering questions really obnoxiously. I quickly found myself liking the cast and appreciating the effort that went into the voice acting, and you can tell the dev team put a lot of love into bringing the story to life.On the other hand, it's noticeably short (I finished the game, replayed it, got every ending, and snagged every Steam achievement in under three hours), and it introduces features that get used exactly once before being set aside for the rest of the game. While this is better than a game that runs too long and relies too heavily on adventure game non-logic, I did wind up feeling just a little bit cheated. I'm not saying I wouldn't tell my adventure game-loving friends to try it out, but I think I might wait until it hits a Steam Sale first.			"

												The Shivah starts out with the best of intentions, but ends up an ultimate disappointment, a truly stupid and halfassed game. For what it's worth, it actually begins rather well. It sets the stage for a good murder mystery, and the first half is a pretty satisfying detective adventure game requiring some modicum of cleverness. It instantly peters out from there, however, and reverts to what might just be the most base example of trial and error option picking I've ever seen. Interesting mechanics ultimately go nowhere, characters are left flat and uninteresting, and what we're left with is a story that culminates in worn-out platitudes and a game whose developers seem to have just given in on this whole video games thing and wrapped it up for the sake of getting it out the door.

Not my go-to for law-abiding citizens, but okay Very short for $5, but if you can get it around $3 or less and want an hour and a half of pretty well-laid story, it's cheaper than a movie.			"

												While the story certainly could have been stronger, and perhaps a little bit longer, this game certainly is an enjoyable ""oldschool"" adventure game; one which is filled with humor and style, complete with excellent dialogue and voice acting.The story seems to be pretty much front and center, with very little variation in scenery or puzzles. Most of the areas that you can visit are confined to 1 or 2 screens, and most of the information is garnered through snooping around on computers. There is an Internet search function as well, which I found to be neat, but it's easy to get stuck if you can't think of the correct terms to search for. But, they shouldn't hold you back for long.All in all though, it's a decent mystery adventure-game starring a rabbi.			"

												This is a remastered version of an early game by Wadjet Eye Games, released in 2006. because it was the first commercial game by the developer it was very short and had some design issues like characters appearing rarely and adding little to the story and lacking in game mechanics. Still it was very fun and enjoyable, the story was good and while the writing is not the best by any means, it is still good enough to be interesting and engaging. The graphics got an overhaul and look very professional and modern, the backgrounds are large and detailed and the characters animated very well and have multiple face images for dialog. If there was something I was dissapointed about it was the voice acting, the accents don't much all the time with the characters, the pacing and acting in the voice wasn't always appropriate, and at some lines the volume was diffrent and made the voice feel off place from the game.The game has multiple endings and a couple of achivements, but i felt like the end part was a little rushed. the dailoge options and gameplay mechanics to get the ""good"" ending weren't merging with the story and characters fluently, and i felt odd ""winning"" the game. still the eventual conclusion was good and worthwhile, and i liked it didn't only invlove solving puzzles but also saying the right things.All in all, i recommend this game, it's a fun old school adventure games that can fill a couple of hours and also a piece of history since the company made award winning games after this one. But frankly, if you want to be blown away and get a game that is really a testament to why classic adventure games were so good, get one of wadjet eye's later games.7 out of 10			"

												A true classic graphic adventure of the old school. Rabbi Stone receives a sizable inheritance from a man who hates him, leaving him with a moral quandry and too many questions. The Shivah has some very difficult puzzles and requires a few intuitive leaps, but the story is rock-solid and left me wanting more. Basic knowledge of Jewish law and rabbinical methods is helpful but not required.			"

												The Shivah is a really interesting game, just for the simple fact it has a main character that you don't see very often; a Rabbi. As the story continues on, you find that the choices you make aren't the usual extravagant uber choices, but do affect things subtly. I found finishing the puzzles to be a little easier than most games in this genre, but still felt highly rewarded once I figured it out. And at only five bucks, it's definitely worth picking up.			"

												If video game ratings were less about morality and more about maturity, The Shivah would be rated Adults Only. I wish more games wrestled with—or boxed—issues that adults face as they get older like The Shivah does.From the get-go, with Rabbi Stone's self-interrupted sermon, to his immediate ruminations on the state of his life, The Shivah establishes a mature theme that the player soon discovers will play out in a hardboiled detective genre adventure. While that adventure maybe loses control of itself as it spins wider and wider into a mafioso plot culminating in a series of deaths or possibilities of death, up to the reception of Rabbi Zelig's business card/the opportunity to visit Paddy O' Hare's, The Shivah does a great job of exploring the desperation many adults reach as their lives are overwhelmed by unfortunate events. In fact, all that staccato bloodshed and mafioso plotting at the end, though helping to place The Shivah in the tradition of Martin Scorsese—the ending of Taxi Driver immediately comes to mind—ultimately shoves too much plot into too brief a game, lessening the impact for me.I could also tell from the get-go that this was a literary sort of game, in part due to the literary roots of its genre. And while The Shivah can be hit and miss in its writing—the barcode reader metaphor near the beginning stands out in a bad way, and the overblown feeling I get from the ending is largely fueled by the dialogue between the Rabbis—I appreciate the attempt. With video games drawing so much time from so many of us that could be spent reading great stories or books, such attention to game writing is a praiseworthy endeavor.I greatly respect what Dave Gilbert attempted here. I only wish he fleshed The Shivah out into a novel, rather than a short story. This mature, modest adventure game made me want to play more like it, and maybe even design one myself!			"

												The Shivah is Wadjet Games first foray into vintage adventure games and if something that shows in the length of the story. It's not impossible to finish it in about an hour, but if you're not too familiar with these types of games you can probably get 2-3 hours out of it. But that is a couple of hours filled with the evils that humans can commit both in the name of religion as well as for personal gain, making the narrative quite unique for an adventure game.Recommended for it's excellently written mature storyline alone, even if it's short it's still in my opinion one of the strongest titles in the Wadjet catalog.

												I got the game on sale for $1, and even then I felt a bit ripped-off.  I was really impressed with the Backwell series, and knew this was an older entry in the Wadjeteye collection, but at that price and that level of talent, I had to give it a go.  The game took a little over an hour to play with a few choices, puzzles, and areas to explore.  There's a lot of potential on display here for a better, more developed game, but everything left me wanthing more.I want to say, I was really intrigued by the premise.  So often are games built around sci-fi or fantasy ideas, that to play a game grounded in reality among a sub-culture of America that I have little experience with outside of film and fiction is enormously intriguing.  But the story really fails in its follow-through.  At the beginning, we meet Rabbi Stone, a man at the end of his rope  ready to give up on his faith and his livelihood.  A previous altercation with a member of his congregation gives him a second chance, and the investigation reveals his long history of stubbornness and insular thinking.  Over the course of the story, you'd think it would teach him to forgive, to re-assess his faith, and become a better person. Nope.  He's still a jerk at the end.  So why did we even bother?			"

												I heard about this game a while ago, and was immediately intrigued by its premise. You play as Rabbi Russell Stone, whose synagogue is in debt, and dying fast. After abruptly ending a service early in frustration, a detective asks Stone some questions about the murder of a member of Stone's congregation, who was kicked out eight years previous.Mysteriously, the man left 10,000$ to Stone, this leaves the detective accusing him of murder, and in a very difficult place as he tries to discover why he left the money and eventually why he was killed. The game looks, and plays like a 90s adventure game, which is both a good and bad thing. The graphics of the enhanced “Kosher” edition are much improved over the original, make it look like a more professional game from the mid to late 90s and give it a lot of charm, but there's a lot of tedium in the format as well in regards to trying random combinations of options to proceed, in the later parts of the game it can be very frustrating. It's also really short, which is a shame because there are a lot of themes in the game that I would have loved to see touched on a little more. I would love to see more, longer, and complex games like this. It's in the Humble Bundle right now, go grab it!			"

												Without getting too much into ""joke"" reviews, this game is okay. As the Dev commentary suggested it was made in 1 month for a project. That's not to say it's a bad game at all. The story is there. It's not horrible. It could be longer. The current price tag of $5 I can see considering the voice acting, direction, art assets for payment. However, there is not $5 worth of gameplay. Probably ~$1-2 worth of gameplay. I would appreciate it if they would include an easier way to edit the window size/gameplay size from within steam as it initially launches 640x480 in fullscreen. A jewish person would get much more out of this game than a non-jew, but both enjoy the game.			"

												Although the Shivah is marked to have been released in 2013, this is actually a remake with new graphics and music, called the Kosher edition, of the 2006 original.  In the first game made by Wadjet Eye Games, you're introduced to a rabbi in charge of a financially unstable synagogue.  As a reflection of his growing cynical view of life, his sermons also share the same nature, which in turn drives members away.  After ending his sermon early one night, with a drowsy member as his only audience, he is visited by a police investigator looking into the murder of a former member of the synagogue who happened to have listed the rabbi in his will with a large sum of money.  Because this money would also solve the synagogue's debt, the rabbi is viewed as a suspect with a possible motive for murder.  The rabbi, however, is unsure why the person would leave such a fortune even though the member had left on disagreeable terms.  This adventure game follows the story of a rabbi looking for the truth behind the death of a former member of his congregation as well as the reason for being on the receiving end of generosity despite their unamiable past.  If you've played the Blackwell series by the same developers, then you'll know what kind of game you'll be getting into, an old school style game with solid puzzles and story.  The Shivah is fairly short with a bit of replayability if you're looking to get all of the achievements, and while it finishes on a note that suggests that there could've been a continuation to the adventures of the rabbi, it does complete the story that it starts.  This game is fairly cheap when on sale and is worth a play through.If you've enjoyed playing this game, then be sure to check out the Blackwell series made by the same developers.			"

												Reploished first trial of Dave Gilbert, creator of the wonderfull Blackwell series... would have been better to be left at peace. As a game, it is horrible. As a story, it is barely okay.The bulk of the game is made up of reading e-mails after the ridiculous ""hacking"" of three e-mail addresses (one of which is your own, but it still requires password-guessing). According to the developer, ""finding out"" passwords after finding ridicolously obvious clues is a good puzzle -- not only it is not, it is tiringly repetitive here. After the e-mail reading, you have some really straightforward chitchatting and then you can come to the endgame.The endgame is one large puzzle which can end in disasters in so many way. So most of your time playing this game will spend on re-re-re-re-re-playing the endgame and try to solve it with try-and-error. Because there is very little you can learn to help you to find out in advance how to avoid the pitfalls. As to the story, it is schematic and largely incoherent. It is also very short. I would be willing to pay for a two-hour game if it comes up with a gripping story, but it is like the overly simplifed, bared-downed draft of a thirteenth-class film noir.If you like this childish amateurship or you are a devouted fan of Dave Gilbert, buy this game today. If you expect the brillant, touching storytelling of the Blackwell series, stay away.			"

												The Shivah is a retro style point-and-click game where you get to play a Rabbi Stone who feels obliged to solve a murder even though he's already got a hard time running his small synagogue.It takes an hour or so to complete the game. While the game is technically quite simple (and there are only about five different in game locations you can explore), it's got a couple of alternate endings. The inventory system is sketchy at best and the game is based mostly on dialogue. The soundtrack is nice and the voice acting is good, but now and then the quality of the recording is bad. What makes this little game stand out is the whimsical and dark atmosphere spiced with Jewish religion. There's an element of humor in there as well; it's noteworthy that in the dialogue options you can choose rabbinical responses.This isn't a game that will keep you glued to your seat for hours and hours. It's more like a tasty little snack. If you can get it for the price of a bagel, go for it.			"

												Excellent point and click adventure game. It's a bit short (can be beaten in an hour or so if you choose the right options), but the story is actually pretty captivating and I don't think I've ever played a game where your character is a rabbi. Also, if you're into that sort of thing, you can get all the achievements pretty easily (though it will take a few reloads before the final scene to get them all)My recommendation: Wait for it to go on sale or into a bundle (although at this price, it's still pretty affordable) and enjoy it, you momzer!

												Nice game in quite an interesting setting. Totally recommended.It's a short detective story, designed in style of the other developer's product, Gemini Rue.You are free to travel between locations, you're a rabbi and you have no quest markers, no ""mission journal"", no flashy coloured lines in your dialogues. You have to find the solution _by yourself_. And this feeling, that you are actually conducting your own investigation, is great.Well, there are some cons, including bad graphics. Although the stylization is nice, the game seems to be running in like a 640x480 and have no option to run in window mode.ps. yes, there IS an option to always answer a question with a question. In case of two rabbies talking this may cause brain cancer... or something			"

""USE RABBINICAL RESPONSE""From creator Dave Gilbert and his Wadjet Eye Games studio behind the awesome projects such as Gemini Rue and Blackwell playing  their first product - point-and-click adventure game from 2006 - The Shivah - was pretty nice experience. Just for the record - this is not original game from 2006 but Kosher Edition from 2013 which features brand new music, graphics and re-recorded voice-overs. Why it was? Well, it doesn't happen often, that you are able to play as a Jewish Rabbi who's Sherlock Holmes on his road to exploit crimes of big business and also really old man with enough boxing skills that he's able to knock out an assassin whose first murder happened when he was 12 years old. Pretty solid right?Dialogues are very well written, actors are fair enough, whole story concept isn't the best we could possibly encounter, but if we consider it as a game to fill up late evening and no expectations, we got it and it's calm af. Music was truly good. I don't even want to talk about it much, you just need to listen to it.Dave Gilbert did a great job and even the fact that he did something with this project after 7 years to make it little more better really counts. And I will thank him for that soon. Bonus Point: IdeaRating: 8/10 "

												I bought The Shivah thinking that it would be a deep look at the more complicated points of religion’s intersection with reality and the crisis of a potential loss of faith.  While there are certainly elements of those questions here, they are examined in a plot so cliché and trite, in environments spare and uninteresting, all with gameplay so short that most season finales run longer in actual play time.Just when I thought the game might be getting good with what I thought might be one of several “boss fights” the game ended.  I think if Wadjet Eye would take this game, flesh it out and extend the story it’d be worth playing, but only just.  The real compelling material of crisis of faith needs to be examined in more depth.  Of course the answer may be that adventure games aren’t the right medium for those sorts of questions. "

												The Shivah has plenty of building blocks for an excellent story: the pathos of a rabbi losing his congregation and his life's work, the conflicts of duty to your convictions vs. your obligations, and a murder mystery to give it all direction.But investigation chiefly comes down to hammering through conversation trees, digging for names, and hammering through the conversation trees once again. And the story doesn't really get any more fully realized or compelling to reward that work. Tack on some ""moral choices"" that, like too many games, come down to being a bloodthirsty psychopath or a heroic paragon, and you're left with not much more than disappointment.Such a shame. A game like this could have been a much more weighty, significant thing.			"

												I really wanted to like this game simply because it seemed like something unique.  You play as a rabbi investigating the murder of one of your old congregation members.  The gameplay is run of the mill 90s era point and click, but without any interesting settings.  All of the characters are as stereotypical and one dimensional as you can possiblyget, and all in all the game lasts about an hour.  The storyline is pretty weak, and every important detail of it would probably fit in a tweet.  I like the idea of using such a non-standard protagonist, but this game didn't pull it off well.			"

												I received this as a joke from a friend and was surprised to find that it was a very enjoyable experience! Even though it was fun, it was quite a short little adventure where I was able to go through and get all three endings in a few hours. The voice acting was very nice and Abe Goldfarb as Rabbi Russell Stone delivered his lines wonderfully. I was interested in the story, but do wish it had a bit more twists and turns or it at least wasn't so glaringly obvious who the true villain was.			"

Everything was pretty straight forward and I breezed through the game up until the ending which after a bit of trial and error all resulting in my character's death I realized I just didn't care enough to keep going. Voice acting was mediocre, plot was dull and generic and the mystery was just too simple to walk through. There were a couple of moments that made me laugh a bit but it didn't seem like intentional humor. If you can get the game for $1 or less and you've got a little (very little) time to kill then go for it. Otherwise don't bother.			"

												This is a short and bittersweet game, but it is definitely worth playing. What I love about this game is that there is choice in how about you have Rabbi Stone handle things. Lets just say there are more choices for an ending than poor Shephard got in Mass Effect 3. There is little humor in this game except for those moments where we see a familiar supernatural detective (WadjetEye fans should know). I'm glad to have this game in my collection. It makes one think about life choices and faith. Abe Goldfarb again is the main character. I love his voice acting. When I heard Rabbi Stone I thought, ""It's Joey!"", but he also plays a great rabbi. I love the included blooper reel and the dictionary for all us goyims. An interesting title in my point&click collection.			"

												The story is great, and that makes me wish this were a better game. At first, the mechanics seemed promising – Instead of carrying a ridiculous number of objects, the character will mostly be collecting bits of information. That idea has a lot of potential.  Sadly, the developer did not make very good use of it.  Almost none of the important bits of information you find go into this ""Clues"" inventory, and the few interactions you can do with the ones that do could have just been handled by adding lines to a few dialogue menus.

												Short but well-written point-and-click game that's honestly closer to a visual novel than anything. Which is good, honestly.There's no filler here. There's no moon-logic puzzles. That's good. I like that. It leaves the game a bit short but I'd rather a short but well-made package than a long and overly bloated wreck. The plot is pretty unique; it's a noir detective story type of ordeal, but the main character is a rabbi. The game has many a reference to Jewish culture and really centers around this aspect, making it stand out among the average detective story. The mystery on its own isn't especially enthralling but it serves its purpose well and it's not bad either. The characters are the strong point here; they're all real, believeable characters, which is good in a game primarily based around character interaction. I honestly don't know what more I can say about this; it's not the best game I've ever played but it's definitely good and has gotten me interested in the other Wadjet Eye games I already own (which is a lot... hoader alert >.>; )			"

												Allow me to be a mensch by guiding you to enlightenment. The Shivah is a simple point and click game, noir, and old fashioned. Reminded me of ""Flight of the Amazon Queen"", but it has none of its complexities, it's not a bad thing, actually it allows you to investigate in Shivah in a more logical manner throughout the game, without the picking up items and trying to fit them in others just to get the game progress going, like Amazon Queen or Monkey Island games accustomed us. Without ""item pickups"" the game is simpler point and click, but it's not a lesser game for me because of it, you still need logic and reasoning to get you somewhere.Personally I bought it on sale for half the price, which, in my opinion, is the justified price for the game, it's short with a simple plot. So even if you´re a goy or a shikse with a thing for detective point and clicks, you should try it out.			"

Coupled with a very short duration (1 hour), it makes me question why it's even being sold for real money rather than shared through shareware.

What is most impostant here is that it's the first game from Wadget Eye. From here you can see all the elements you will find in their many other games: Great plots, great universes, great characters, voice actors, more story oriented than puzzle-solving (which can be good but often reduce the game's longevity...).I had a great time with Gemini Rue, Primordia and this one.

												An excellent point-and-click adventure game in the style of the classics. If you've ever used Lucasarts and Sierra in the same sentence, you oughta give this a look. It's relatively short, but offers a lot of choice and I found myself very invested in the characters rather quickly. The voice acting is a bit off, in my opinion (or rather, the recording of it: microphone crackling is audible in nearly every other line), and I got stuck twice at moments where I didn't realize what exact thing I was supposed to type in, but it does a good job of giving you just enough information to connect the dots. I was given this as a gift, and have very limited knowledge of Jewish traditions, but the game even includes a guide you can access in your inventory listing specific terminology you may not know, so when it does become important, you still can find everything you need within the game itself.In short, an excellent adventure game in the style of many out there on CD and floppy disk, not very lengthy but worth every minute.

												(Linux version reviewed)I’m not normally an “adventure” player, but I found this game to be  a pleasant surprise. The film-nior-ish tone of the game, set against a backdrop of  Jewish religious culture, was an interesting change of pace from the fantasy/sci-fi games I normally play. The “Jewishness” of the game was actually quite mild, so don’t be scared away if Judaism doesn’t interest you. The game is actually a mystery involving the death of a member of the rabbi’s synagogue. “The Shivah” has an intriguing story leading to a rather exciting conclusion, with interesting locations, characters, voice acting, and puzzles along the way. The graphics and interface are definitely retro/old-school, and the game can probably be beaten in a few hours by the average adventurer.  I enjoyed it for the story and the not-too-obscure puzzles. It is short, though.... One or two nights, tops, in beating it.  "

There is no evident purpose to this game except to throw in a cameo with Rosangela from the Blackwell games.And the few puzzles you have to solve take place on the computer. Or rather two computers. Figuring out your own username and password is NOT a good puzzle... And as for voice-work of Abe Goldfrab as the rabbi... Sigh.... Is this man married to Dave Gilbert?

												Intelligent, dramatic, sometimes darkly funny. A classic point-and-click that does everything well, in an unusual but interesting setting. Short, but worth playing a few times to see the different interactions you can have with characters, and to see the different endings.			"

												Hashem help the lazy ***kickers at Wadjeyeye. Blackwell was great, and so was Resonance; so I went ahead and got Shivah and Technobabylon (which I won't review asI only played the first 3 chapters, refusing to play what is less of an adventure and in reality an interactive story whose protagonist(s) I can't identify with). As for Shivah - at 5$, money isn't the issue here. So what is? in short, the fact that ""classic"" adventure gaming is no excuse in my mind for treating an adventure gamer to Sierra-like RANDOM, PRACTICALLY UNAVOIDABLE, REPEATED DEATHS. I had to play the ending scene more than 10 times, until I ultimately gave up and reosrted to a walkthru. It saddens me to write this, but I'm done taking this kind of abuse from Wadjeteye.			"

												Bottom line: Outdated game with thin characters inside an interesting cultural context. If you love the genre, you may find it to be worth some nostalgia.+ Interesting and rarely seen cultural context in games (Jewish life)+ Thoughtful non-dialogue narration.- Average to below average voice acting and dialogue for the most part.- Bland, generic plot with little characterization.- Extremely simply gameplay, even for a point and click game.- Very short (1.5-2 hours).This was not an awful game but it is a game that I feel showed its age. When it was released, perhaps it felt a lot fresh but I have to judge it from a modern day context. I expect a higher level of dialogue, characterization, and voice acting nowadays, especially for this type of game. The main plot never at any point really invested me in caring about it and it was lacking in anything truly compelling -- it feels like an episode of some detective/police procedural.However, the use of Jewish culture was a definitely plus as that's something you rarely see in video games. When those parts shined the brightest the game was the strongest. Jewish culture has a rich existential tapestry to draw upon and I wish the game would have delved deeper into that (ala something like A Serious Man). It does some in Rabbi Stone's inner monologue but it gets pushed out by the seen-it-a-hundred-times-before plot and other characters. How can we feel at all invested in the fates of Lauder, Raj, or Zelig when we know so little about them? Due to the shortness of the game (1.5-2 hours to play through), it'd be very hard to have a lot of depth.Additionally, there is not much of what one would call gameplay. There's not really any puzzles or secrets to discover, just a few places where you have to mostly guess.I appreciate the Rabbinical response options and achievements, though. That got a chuckle out of me.			"

The story pulled me in, but the boringly simplistic investigation and moon logic at the ending pushed me right back out. If the story really interests you- and I will give the game credit there, the story was very good- MAYBE get it when it's heavily discounted during the next steam sale.

												The Shivah is a short and contained adventure that can be completed in about an hour or two; The game is written well enough, and despite a few small issues with certain game mechanics, as the genesis (or rather the remake of that game) of Dave Gilbert's commercial career (Dave is the founder of Wadjet Eye Games) it still holds up despite the rough edges.The only complaint I can really muster is it's overall brevity compared to later wadjet eye games (which is tempered by the length of time the original game was built in), and the decision not to smooth out a few of the rough edges within the game's puzzles. Ultimately it's still a worthwhile experience for fans of Wadjet Eye Games and old school point and click adventure games in general.			"

												WadjetEye did it again. Another fantastic title on it's catalog. An adventure point&click game, The Shivah features a well beyond good voice acting (specially the main character's voice, Rabbi Russel Stone), an interesting and ""rabbinical"" story and a simplistic clue and inventory system. If you don't mind the low resolution and pixelated-like graphics, The Shivah will amaze you for about 2 hours, which is plenty for the price it's tagged at. Throughout the game, you are prompted to choose if this or that happens, and this changes the ending. Because of choice-making (that actually affects the story) you are able to go through the game two times or even three without it getting boring. Recommended, mostly for gamers that enjoy the point&click genre.			"

What I most appreciated about this title was that it had a real-life aspect to it that was refreshing. There was no goofiness that we usually associate with this genre (Monkey Island, Deponia, etc.). All puzzles were fairly logic based. I only got stuck once, and used a walkthrough to easily navigate to the final ending (there are multiple).Totally worth five bucks to waste away an afternoon. I would also like to see more episodes for the same price. I think I could get into more of this.			"

												I was hoping for a story-heavy visual-novel-esque adventure game that shows how hard it is to be a Rabbi in New York City, but instead I get a boring murder-mystery that makes me solve puzzles to advance the plot. It tells the story of a Rabbi whose congregation dwindles and is on hard times. Not far into the game it's revealed that membership died down not because he's a minority in an unforgiving city, but because he's an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who scared away his followers, which is slightly less sympathetic.I really wanted to enjoy the amateur voice acting, but I couldn't bring myself to. Every time someone talks in an angry tone you can hear their breath echo into their microphone. That is kind of unacceptable and I don't care if you're low budget, that's worth fixing.Two out of five Lennys( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ) ( ) ( )			"

												Clocking in at around one hour, The Shivah is the shortest point and click adventure game I think I've ever played. Despite that, I enjoyed it. It works very well when viewed as a prequel for the Blackwell games, and it plays/feels very similar.My main complaint with most point and clicks is that it's easy to get stuck. Sometimes you have to do really non-obvious things to progress. Luckily, The Shivah does not suffer from that for the most part. There was only a single point when I was really banging my head against the wall, and I got through it eventually.And who knew Dave Gilbert could sing?			"

												The Shivah is a great little point-and-click game. It presents the user, who plays a rabbi with a dwindling congregation, with a murder mystery to solve.Good things:- The actual puzzles are fairly fun to solve, although some are ridiculously hard to work out. You may need a walkthrough guide, especially to get the acheivements!- The voice acting is good (although I skipped through most of it to play through quickly)- References to religion and deeper meanings (although I'll admit there weren't many and they weren't that deep. But there was a whole Torah in here compared to CoD or Pacman)- Storyline. It was fun and engagingBad things:- This game is ridiculously short. Without a walkthrough (or if you're a bit slow to grasp things) it will take no longer than 2 hours to finish, and probably much less. You will probably have to use a guide anyway, so there's really only an hour or so of playtime here. - Alternative endings. Unlike, for example, The Stanley Parable, the alternative endings require extremely specific sets of actions to complete, making finding them pretty dull.- Storyline. It was a very cliched plot. Although, to be honest, this is a tried and tested formula and it worked alright.- Graphics. This is actually the nicest looking port of the game, but it does look like it was made in 1990. With that being said, the graphics aren't massively important to the gameplay anyway.So I would recommend it, but preferably on sale. £4 is probably too much to pay for a couple of hours of gaming with little to no replay value. I got it in a Humble Bundle, so it was well worth my money!			"

												It's pretty bad. Puzzles take the form of dialogue trees since eventhough you have an inventory you don't gather items so no item puzzles.  And the problem with diologue puzzles is that it makes very little sense unless you pick every possible option and see the result first. So that means is a lot of saving and reloading is necassary to get anywhere. The story didn't intrigue me much, neither did the characters. It's all very shallow.			"

YouTube™ Video: The Shivah - Full Playthrough 

			Views: 95		

			This game was a bit of a surprise to me. I got it as an extra I didn't really care about through a Humble Bundle, and never really planned on playing it.		

I found this to be quite a charming game. I really enjoyed the Jewish angle on it... I can't remember that being done in the past. Personally, I didn't know what this game really was, I got it through a Humble Bundle, and had no intention of ever playing it. But I'm rather obsessive about putting all my games in their proper category... so since I didn't know what this was all about I started it up to see where I should put it. The game drew me in, and I ended up plaything through it twice. The above video is from my second play-through.I'm glad I gave it a chance. The graphics are aweful, compared to most any modern game. The voice acting is imperfect, the overall audio has a rustic, cheap sound to it, but all that seems to just add to the charm. The story is fun to play through, even though it's a bit short. My first play through took about two hours, and my second, as you can see, about an hour. I think there may be one or two more endings I didn't see, both my two games had different endings.Overall I'd say it's a neat game to check out. $5 might be pushing it a bit for value, but on sale, it would be a great buy for any adventure game enthusiest or anyone interested in Jewish culture.

												I liked this game, although it was quite short. I was just getting into it, and then it was over. I think it'd be much more enjoyable to members of the Jewish community. I got a few of the references due to similarities between Yiddish and other languages I speak. but the cultural stuff was a bit lost on me. The voice acting was very good, and the story was nice. It was just a little too short. All that said, it's not exactly expensive, so still well worth it. I just think people who get all the cultural references will find it more intuitive and funnier.

												From creator Dave Gilbert and his Wadjet Eye Games studio behind the awesome projects such as Gemini Rue and Blackwell playing their first product - point-and-click adventure game from 2006 - The Shivah - was pretty nice experience. Just for the record - this is not original game from 2006 but Kosher Edition from 2013 which features brand new music, graphics and re-recorded voice-overs. Why it was? Well, it doesn't happen often, that you are able to play as a Jewish Rabbi who's Sherlock Holmes on his road to exploit crimes of big business and also really old man with enough boxing skills that he's able to knock out an assassin whose first murder happened when he was 12 years old. Pretty solid right?Dialogues are very well written, actors are fair enough, whole story concept isn't the best we could possibly encounter, but if we consider it as a game to fill up late evening and no expectations, we got it and it's calm af. Music was truly good. I don't even want to talk about it much, you just need to listen to it.Dave Gilbert did a great job and even the fact that he did something with this project after 7 years to make it little more better really counts. And I will thank him for that soon. Bonus Point: IdeaRating: 6.000.000.000/10			"

												A solid story, with easy puzzles and somewhat weak animation. A really short game, but the length makes sense. Voiceover is decent too. The game prompts some interesting moral and theological issues for the player to consider. The most standout aspect of this game is how your decisions actually matter and influence how the story plays out - for better or worse. Worth the few hours' investment.			"

												The Shivah is a visual novel point & click mystery adventure.  The protagonist is a rabbi who is doing his best to hold his synagogue together.  He tries very hard to stay true to his religious beliefs while his congregation is falling apart, but finds himself in a complicated moral dilemma when he is forced to accept a cashed in life insurance policy.  The police start investigating him, his fellow rabbis are shunning him, and shadows are creeping behind him.The story, plot, and script is well written with extra attention to making every decision a challenging moral dilemma.  Each moral decision affects the end of the story, similar to Telltale games like The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us.  Outside of the story based decisions, the puzzles are very detail oriented, and I recommend keeping a notepad on the side to write down clues.  Not every clue is going to be obvious, but each scene is pretty limited as far as interaction goes.  I completed the entire game in about two hours without any outside help.  If there was more to explore in each environment, the overall experience might have been a little more compelling.  Some type of pillow shots would have been welcome to build up suspense and reflection.The graphics are a bit on the simple side, but are well visualized none the less.  The voice acting is decent, and the ambient music helps flesh out each situation without feeling too contrived.  You’re not going to play the game for the audio and visual effects, or be compelled to download the soundtrack, but the game does well with what is provided.  The main focus is on the story anyways.Overall, despite it being short and simple, the moral dilemmas really made the game well worth the price I paid for it.  I do have to give a warning to those devout of any religion.  The game touches on subjects that could be interpreted as being sacrilegious, and may be very upsetting to some.  The environment and circumstances do touch on real life situations that are not completely unheard of.  I hope that anyone who plays it realizes it is a story of fiction first and foremost.  I do recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good whodunnit mystery.			"

												I have to applaud this game for taking game storytelling in a new direction. The storyline follows a rabbi who has begun to question his faith after a murder takes place on someone he kicked out of his congregation many years ago for marrying a non-jewish woman. I think the game itself is well made with decent production value and some great voicework. I definitely enjoy the setting as it is quite different to what you normally get in an adventure title. I would recommend giving this one a look if you are a fan of the genre and fantasy settings have begun to get a bit dull.			"

												A very bad game. Puzzles make no sense and are often based on trial and error. Story is shallow and full of cliches, dialouge are bland and the different endings/options unsatisfactory. Really short, but this wouldn't be a problem if the quality was high.The only interesting thing is the odd settings and characters for a video game, although the game fails to fully take advantage from those.

												This game is nice, but nothing special about it.I sure love playing indie games such this one, yet the plot is not that original.You could also switch the rabbi to a priest, with christian motives, and the plot would not even change at all.The game is really short - you can finish it in 40 - 45 minutes, and can play a little longer to discover the other endings it has to offer, or just wait for trading cards to drop.I don't think it is worth paying 5$ for..

												Really short adventure game.It looks like the classic games by Lucas Arts and, it gets you interested, at the beginning.I mean, you have to use the computer to search for info, to go ahead in the game, and that makes it more real.But, things go weird once you put the few clues all together.I hate the first screen, with a lot of jewish ads that you cannot skip and, it's a screen that you will see several times, after dying and trying to continue the story.The story line is ok but, there is too much da da da and very few things to do, at the end.Not good, not bad.

												90% of the objects in this game are ""I have no reason to use that"", and most of the dialog is ""I don't know anything about that"". Woo, awesome. Within the first 5 minutes, you're expected to remember a name that came up in conversation and to ""google it"" on the game's search engine. If you weren't paying attention or didn't write down the exact spelling of the name, you have to restart and pay closer attention. It was then that I discovered that with a good walkthrough, you can plow through this horse♥♥♥♥♥♥of a game in about 25 minutes. "

												First Thoughts:This game allows you to play as a Rabbi in NYC.  You can perform many rabbinical duties, however, you can't perform a virtual metzitzah b'peh.  Because of that, i have no choice but to rate this otherwise perfect game a 9/10.1,000+ Hour update:This game gets more amazing every hour i play it.  So many easter eggs to be found.  The city this game is set in (NYC) is MASSIVE.  At around 800 hours in game, the NPC's which generate side quests started to give me duplicate quests.  At that point, i thought i was going to have to put this game down for good.  Luckily there is a mod you can download for online multiplayer, which ups this games life ten fold (add and message me for details).  I expect i will put around 8,000 hours into this game before it gets old.  9/10			"

												Russell Stone is a Jewish Rabbi at a poor synagogue in New York City. He is a devout man with a problem. Membership is way down and he lacks the funds to keep his synagogue open. Things are looking very bleak, and he has grown progressively more cynical and bitter with the passage of time.Just as he is on the verge of packing it all in, he receives some interesting news. A former member of his congregation has died and left the Rabbi a significant amount of money. A blessing? Or the start of something far more sinister? Can Rabbi Stone just accept the money and move on? His conscience says no. Step into his shoes as he travels all over Manhattan in his attempt to uncover the truth.Features rabbinical conversation methods, a unique method of fighting, an original score, and three different endings!

												If you are looking for a Far Cry 3 or Battlefield 4 like graphics, you would most definitely not find this here. To be honest, the graphics in this game is so horrendous that you would be forgiven for thinking that you were playing a video game made in the 1980s. It is that bad.However, having said that, if you are a gamer who does not place much importance in the graphical aspect of games but instead the plot and content of the game, then this will be the game you would be looking for. The story-line is excellent here. Despite being quite a short game, the price tag justifies it. The puzzles are challenging and thought provoking.In summary, I thoroughly enjoyed my time being spent on this game. Highly recommended but you can forget about the quality of the graphics.  "

												I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with Wadjet Eye Games.  On the one hand, I like how they're a game company that specializes in adventure games, a genre that I spent my childhood absorbed in.  On the other, their puzzles can leave a lot to be desired, what with goals and inventory items not being 100% clear.  But what I've always respected from them was their drive to always try something different from their last project.  And with The Shivah, I can see where that drive started.The Shivah is the adventure game equivalent of a novella (about an hour if you know what you're doing).  You play the role of a Rabbi who finds himself caught in a web of intrigue from one of his previous synagogue attendants.  The story plays out in typical noir fashion, not really striving to break the mold of the classic criminal tropes.  But it's the characters that really make this game stand out.  To see this from the perspective of a lowly Rabbi adds a new take to what can be a fairly predictable genre.  As a result, the game provides you with a keyhole glimpse of the Jewish faith; not a crash course, but a clear distinction of its unique heritage.Like the game suggests, it is an almost-standard adventure game, complete with point and click methods of continuing the story.  I say almost standard because of the sleuthing mechanic, a feature that would find its way into the future Blackwell series.  And also like I said before, it may not be clear what you need to do.  There can be times where you'll be clicking on every entry in your notebook to look for a new clue, when the next step is to retrace your steps to another location.  You know: standard adventure game tactics.  Thankfully, the logic behind most of these puzzles is grounded, so they can be naturally discovered through time and thinking.Sure, it doesn't reinvent the wheel.  But it doesn't have to.  This is a project that offers a unique experience to step into the shoes of a Rabbi and learn something about Jewish traditions that I didn't know before.  So in the end, I'd call that a worthwhile purchase.  Especially at 5 dollars.			"

												I am a fan of Dave Gilbert's work. I am grateful that he's putting effort into a genre that isn't getting as much attention anymore as it used to in the good old ""Monkey Island""-days.While reviewing this game, it's good to point out that it was originally made as an entry to an adventure game making competition, apparently, so while it has a short length and low production values (slightly raised by the newer version's graphical improvements among other things) it still stands out as a very enjoyable experience.This is one of those adventure games that would prefer you keep a pen and paper handy, writing down clues and names so that you can check up on them later - feeling like an actual detective, even if for just a short while.The voice acting is not very good, bordering on annoying with the sound quality being slightly amateurish at times, but I can easily forgive that. You can just turn the voices off if it bothers you too much. Looking at Gilbert's later games, he often mentions that he slowly got the hang of recording more ""proper"" voice acting and also got a lot of great talent for it.As I said, the game is short, and I got through it the first time in two hours, hardly ever stuck even for a moment (which I would have if I hadn't kept notes) and I also got to see the rest of the optional endings with an extra fifteen minutes of reloading saves and doing things differently, earning me the rest of the Steam achievements in the progress as well. Being short is not necessarily a bad thing, though. It was a very unique persepective on a story, for one, and it also made me feel like I was doing a good job since the puzzles weren't in any way illogical and made me keep track of the information.If you are a fan of adventure games, you can easily spare a few hours to play this one through. If you are not a fan of adventure games, you probably didn't bother to read the reviews anyway.Mazel tov.			"

												A shortly delicious game. An austere protagonist guides this bitter but throughout moral detective adventure. Great experience to play a jew, this game is a real privileged uncommon plot to partake in. The voicework seems crude and roarse but gives personality to the pixel characters, and sets the tone the rabbi is in. In a detective game thread in reddit, someone commented that here some actual detective work was supposed to be done, and it is true. The interface reminds you of the clues, but it won't guide you by the hand; also, not everything is apparent, as it wouldn't be in a investigation, especially shoveling about emails. And the dialogue! And the climax! Adam Jensen would tap out, I bet! No happy ending guaranteed.A must for point and click and/or adventure game fans.			"

												I picked this game up during the sales not knowing what to expect. I'd never seen a Jewish point-and-click before this one, so I was curious to see what this was about. Not surprisingly, it's about Jewish people-- but that's about the only prediction I got right, this game is genuinely surprising. The creators did really well with their choice of music, settings, names, in-game computers (the jokes made me laugh a lot) and even the inclusion of Yiddish words, so you're bound to pick up at least a few Jew-isms, which is great to say walking away from a point-and-click. The game-play itself is fairly straightforward, and the story progresses quite nicely if you're smart about it. The clues are honestly not that hard to find, it just takes a bit of thinking to figure things out. The atmosphere and the story itself inspire a sense of dread and desperation, though I can't help but love the main character. There's a lot of zionist themes (surprise, surprise) in this game, and while I'm not a fan of zionism itself, I appreciated the dialogue, discussions, and explanations. I was terribly uncomfortable listening to Rabbi Stone's introspection and existential crisis, but it was something worth listening to, and I enjoyed it for that reason. I also enjoyed how the game touched on issues within the Jewish community, it's a pretty brave thing to discuss those things in a video game.Definitely pick this up during a sale, it's only major flaw is that it's too short, but otherwise it's a gem. Even if it's not on sale, this game is more than worth the 5 dollars. Don't be a meshuggah, support this thing!			"

												""The Shivah"" is a point & click game I have mixed feelings for.First of all: You play  Rabbi Stone  in New York that has seen better times. Out of nowhere Stone receives the news by the police that an ex-member of his community was found dead and that he left Stone a lot of money. But why? And how did he die?The story's not the most exciting one I've seen but it's okay. It made me curious that there's something like a Jewish crime plot created as an adventure game. But outside of that gimmick ""The Shivah"" is rather mediocre than good.The game is very short. And solving the puzzles involves a lots of email reading. Not really exciting even though the mails provide you with clues like possible login data which are a pain in the *ss to figure out without consulting any walthrough guides. The rest is talking to people and going through clues a few times. I've played a lot of adventures games and the best of them give you a variety of actions: dialogues, using and collecting objects, going to lots of places. So the gameplay in ""The Shivah"" feels a little dry.One of the biggest problems is certainly a bug problem. In my case mail texts and dialogue boxes would just appear for a part of a second and then go away (so important information might get missed). If you notice the same thing, press the ESC key. But beware, it happens throughout the game, especially after leaving the Steam screen inside the game.But what's good in the game? Well, if you love point & click adventure games, a Jewish crime plot is at least a change.I like the music, the graphics are nice and the voice acting is a nice touch (even though it could be better sometimes).Plus: You can consider learning a bit of Yiddish vocabulary and reading Jewish jokes as neat bonus features.So: I neither say ""Go play this game, god damnit!"" nor ""Avoid this!"". If you're interested as I was, just give it a try but better don't pay too much for it.			"

												An interesting and dark old school point-and-click adventure game, a murder mystery set in the Jewish community of New York City. The graphic is adorable retro and reminds one of the original Monkey Island or Idiana Jones Adventures by LucasArts. The riddles are mainly solved by talking to characters, the inventory barley exists. An intelligent game, but also a very short one. And at one or two occasions one can be stuck very easy. Most likely nothing for casual gamers, but more for fans of the genre with a love for existential philosophy.  Also I never died so often in a point-and-click adventure game…			"

												The Shivah reminded me why Point-and-Click games have fascinated me since the moment I started playing games. It takes a certain level of detective work that transcends the mundane ""click on everything until something happens."" You really have to THINK. Every detail is important. Any periods of frustration are rewarded ten-fold by the ""Aha!"" feeling when you figure it out. The combat system is not explained, but figuring it out is perhaps the most rewarding moment of the game. The game is much shorter than I expected, but this game is a gem and definitely worth your time and money.			"

												I liked The Shivah. The artwork was excellent, the story was compelling, and the voice acting was pretty decent. Though I wish that the VAs had access to better recording equipment, there was some scratchiness to it. It took me a little over two hours to beat it, and I spent a little under two hours getting all the achievements. Which I hardly ever do.The characters were good, given how much screentime they had. I wish that the game was longer, so they could have been fleshed out a little more. I think a sequel wouldn't be a bad idea.It's hard to be sure, since I just finished it, but I think The Shivah has left a better impact on me than most games in the 1-4 hour range. It was worth my money.			"

												After playing through the excellent Blackwell series, I've been wanting more in the same vein, so when this was presented to me during a sale - another Wadjet Eye point-and-click mystery - I had no choice but to purchase it.I am glad that I did.This game is very short, but worth its price tag nonetheless.  It had all the darkness-with-a-touch-of-humour that I have come to treasure in the Wadjet Eye game along with references to places and characters I was familiar with from the Blackwell series.  It had a rich story and interesting challenges to overcome, and I found myself surprised at how well I connected with the main character - a jaded middle-aged jewish rabbi.  I definitely recommend this to the people that I like and to fans of the point-and-click mystery genre.			"

												I liked the The Shivah and felt it was a great game and on par with Wadjet Eye's other games, my chief criticism however is it is way too short. I took me about 1.5 hours to beat and if you know what you are doing then it beaten even faster. Having gotten the length issue out of the way, I loved the experience The Shivah offered. The voice acting was great, what few puzzles it had where logical, the writing was good and the music was excellent. Despite its length shortcoming The Shivah didn't suffer from any serious pacing issues.If you can get over the games length then I would recommend The Shivah to any avid Point and Click Adventure fan.5 out of 5.

												Many games rely on hours upon hours of gameplay to create a deep story with memorable, gripping characters. Some attempt it, and fail miserably. Some attempt it, and while the story and characters are great, it's certainly a long journey.Somehow, The Shivah manages to be incredibly poignant and deep in a short amount of time. My first playthrough took me about 4 1/2 hours, if that. But in those 4 1/2 hours, I found myself gripped and held tight by the game. One of the reasons is the characters, especially the main, Rabbi Stone. Even if you aren't Jewish, the tale of someone questioning things when everything goes wrong is something we can all relate to, in some way or another. His thoughts evolve with your choices as the story goes, for good or ill, and it's actually quite subtle.I found myself thinking a lot as those choices came up. I won't say too much about the stuff the game poses, but it's definitely a game where the journey is far more important than the destination. And the choices you can make can change that journey so much. I don't honestly think I can recommend this enough. I'd love to see more games like this, especially from this publisher.Also, I have to say, the humor in some points is completely amazing. That's just the icing on the delicious cake, but I have to mention it.			"

												What an interesting little gem we have here!  Once I booted The Shivah up, I didn't put it down until I had 100% completion.  There story told within the game hooks you from the start and keeps you entralled throughtout your journey.  It brings back memories of early dialog based adventure games without being terribly difficult.  With a little bit of memory and some logical lines being drawn, I wouldn't see why anyone would have too much issue with completing it.  The music is par for this style of game, nothing too fantastic, but also not too repetitively annoying.  The main standout point for The Shivah is definitely the dialogue!  The character interactions and choices presented are all very solid.  I also feel this game deserves credit for the excellent voice acting.If I was to point out a flaw in the game...if it can be called a flaw...would be that the game is pretty short.  It didn't me two and a half hours to see the game in it's full capacity.  Granted, I play a lot of this style of game, so I tend to move through these games fairly fluidly.  Even for an inexperienced adventure gamer, I don't really see this game lasting too terribly much longer.All in all?  For $4.99?  I don't feel you can go wrong picking The Shivah.  At basically $1.99 an hour for entertainment, it's cheap entertainment.  Cheers!			"

But if you just ignore it, you are not losing much. Reviews that say this is comparable to ""real literature"" lie, this is barely a comic-book level storytelling.

												As a Jew, I saw this game in passing a couple times and was inevitably drawn to give it the once-over. I'm happy that I did, because I thoroughly enjoyed playing. It's a bit short, yes, and I WILL say that the replay value is limited to maybe three replays, by my standards at least, but the story is very well-written. I enjoyed the fact that, unlike many games that CLAIM to give you moral decisions to make, this one actually comes through in the strictest definition. Over the course of this story, I think the choices you make more or less reflect who you, the player, are, which is something I hadn't been expecting. Another thing I liked is that it exposes the player, whatever their faith may be, to elements of the Jewish faith without being preachy. It doesn't push itself onto the player, but just provides a harmless glimpse through a window at bits and pieces of Jewish customs.As a protagonist, Rabbi Russell Stone was inspiring, teaching us that anyone, no matter who they are or where their path in life has led them, can ultimately do some good, that an ounce of concern for your fellow man can change the entire course of a bigger picture, and the importance of Mitzvot.So, to conclude, my only complaint would have to be the length of the game. I felt it could have been a bit longer and a bit more in-depth. Other than that, I highly recommend this game!			"

												A game that is half theologic reflection and half noir thriller.  The game tackles mature issues in an adult way, while also carrying a shlocky, yet fun detective story.  Anybody who's a fan of adventure-genre games should check this out.  Anybody who's interested in stories that treat serious issues (death, meaning of life, grief and guilt) should buy it right away.If you care about how long it is, you can get through it in one sitting.

												After playing through the excellent Blackwell series, I've been wanting more in the same vein, so when this was presented to me during a sale - another Wadjet Eye point-and-click mystery - I had no choice but to purchase it.I am glad that I did.This game is very short, but worth its price tag nonetheless.  It had all the darkness-with-a-touch-of-humour that I have come to treasure in the Wadjet Eye game along with references to places and characters I was familiar with from the Blackwell series.  It had a rich story and interesting challenges to overcome, and I found myself surprised at how well I connected with the main character - a jaded middle-aged jewish rabbi.  I definitely recommend this to the people that I like and to fans of the point-and-click mystery genre.			"

												I liked The Shivah. The artwork was excellent, the story was compelling, and the voice acting was pretty decent. Though I wish that the VAs had access to better recording equipment, there was some scratchiness to it. It took me a little over two hours to beat it, and I spent a little under two hours getting all the achievements. Which I hardly ever do.The characters were good, given how much screentime they had. I wish that the game was longer, so they could have been fleshed out a little more. I think a sequel wouldn't be a bad idea.It's hard to be sure, since I just finished it, but I think The Shivah has left a better impact on me than most games in the 1-4 hour range. It was worth my money.			"

												The Shivah reminded me why Point-and-Click games have fascinated me since the moment I started playing games. It takes a certain level of detective work that transcends the mundane ""click on everything until something happens."" You really have to THINK. Every detail is important. Any periods of frustration are rewarded ten-fold by the ""Aha!"" feeling when you figure it out. The combat system is not explained, but figuring it out is perhaps the most rewarding moment of the game. The game is much shorter than I expected, but this game is a gem and definitely worth your time and money.			"

												An interesting and dark old school point-and-click adventure game, a murder mystery set in the Jewish community of New York City. The graphic is adorable retro and reminds one of the original Monkey Island or Idiana Jones Adventures by LucasArts. The riddles are mainly solved by talking to characters, the inventory barley exists. An intelligent game, but also a very short one. And at one or two occasions one can be stuck very easy. Most likely nothing for casual gamers, but more for fans of the genre with a love for existential philosophy.  Also I never died so often in a point-and-click adventure game…			"

												The Shivah is a very short classic style adventure game.  Although some may look at the length as a negative, I actually found the shorter length to allow for a fairly gripping story without any lulls that are common in other games of the genre.  The puzzles were all very logical, except for the final scene.   In order to get the best ending it boils down to trial and error with the dialogue, which is a weaker way to end an otherwise strong adventure game.			"

Puzzles should be more than ""I have ten actions available to me, and have to do them in exactly the right order or I lose"", and especially not two of those directly in a row.			"

												I still enjoy this game to this day.  It was the very interesting topic of a speech I gave within the 2014 PAXAus convention about the use of religious topics in video games.  As a member of that audience it was such a shame to see it dominated by such staid minds.  Referring to this ""story"" certainly gave a much more diversified viewpoint.  Again, I highly recommend giving this at least one play through.			"

												A bit rough around the edges, but a good game overall. Recommended if you're already a Wadjet Eye fan. If not, start with Technobabylon or Blackwell Legacy.			"

												It's good. If you like the blackwell series, then you'll like this.It would be a great game if it wasn't so short.			"
