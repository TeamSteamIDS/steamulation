												This game reminds me of Coraline and the gameplay itself is rather fun, this coming from my experience in other point and click games. From the brief amount of time I have played, i've noticed something which to me seemed rather annoying. If Violett can't perform a specific task there is a 3-4 second wait while she shakes her head.I recommend you pick this up while the launch sale is still on!			"

												So, this game is pretty and that's about it.Without a narrative, you have no idea what it is you're doing and why you're doing it.You are doing puzzles that are almost completely random so you're just doing trial and error until it works and half the time I didn't even understand WHY it worked.  It was just a thing that I did.  Difficulty pays off when things become clear, but this is just ""pull this until a thing happens.""  The puzzles are only difficult by virtue of the fact that they make little sense.  Also, your telekinetic ability is incredibly selective; you can effect something a screen away, but you can't use it to pick something up that's just out of physical reach?  Music is pretty boring, the gibberish that passes as speech is very grating on my ears and the sound in general made no impact whatsoever on me.It was a waste of $9.99 and I regret the purchase wholeheartedly.

												I'm playing this game with my wife, and we have quite mixed feelings about it.Pros: This game's plot seems to be inspired by the animated movie ""Caroline"". Quite interesting, I must say. Music is nice, graphics too.Puzzles are, how I should say ... unusual, something different from typical point-n-click adventure. And this leads to ...Cons: puzzle controls give you HELL. They are suitable for a tablet game, a touchscreen PC, but totally not for playing with a mouse.Also after a few scenes I don't have a clue what are these colored spheres for?If Steam had 5-star ratings, for now I'd give this game 3 stars - for music and graphics. Can't recommend for everyone, can't dislike too			"

												Abstruse and sometimes outright broken in its design elements, Violett commits the worst crime for an adventure game: it confronts the player with poorly designed puzzles that require little logic and lots of luck and clueless clicking in order to be solved.An intriguing premise and interesting art style aren’t enough to drag Violett up to the level of other more accomplished point and click adventures.You might enjoy the time that you spend with Violett, but you should approach it with modest expectations and a good deal of patience.Still, Violett is only priced at $10, and it’s probably the type of game that’s going to go on sale a lot, so if you’re looking for something different then it’s not the worst thing in the world to purchase and try out.Overall 5/10.

												Storyline: Annoyed emo chic Violett gets drags off to the ""country"" by her upset/angry parents to her uncle's (?) delapitated house, and ends up having a very bizarre adventure like Alice, Corinne or Dorothy (Wizard of Oz, movie; the OZ books are even more bizarre).  The environments are a tad creepy in nonsensical, illogical and flat out bizarre type of way, much like Wonderland, Oz or where ever Corinne took place, are. And to all those ""there is no story line"" complainers out there please explain to me how Alice in Wonderland made any sense at all, ever, in either book or any of the countless movies (and movie remakes).  Violett's entire storyline occurs during the preliminary movie, and has absolutely no bearing on the adventure.   Puzzles: Unique and with some very obscure clues at times, plus the gamer really has to look at the details in the background to realize what to do in some cases.  Good for that out of the box thinking and improving those observational skills.  The logic for the puzzles is there, a tad obsure at times, I admit, but if the gamer takes the TIME to LOOK FOR and TALK TO all the characters, the characters will explain pictorially what to do.Worst puzzle: Chimneys.  Not difficult to figure out just timed.  I knew what to do but was highly frustrated by the fact it took so long to do it.  Only time I needed a hint, and the hint I needed was that the puzzle was timed.  (It would have been easier to do with a reset button too.)  A side note to the puzzles and overall concept: this game makes far more sense and is far easy to play then Limbo.While playing watch Violett.  If she makes a negative Uh-huh sound while vertically moving her hands the gamer is on the wrong track.  If she puts her hand under her chin in a thoughtful pose then the gamer is on right track.  She is the best clue giver in the game.For most gamers I would say the biggest drawback is actually taking the TIME to look around and examine the objects while thinking about what to do and where to do it.  Half way through the game the gamer starts accumulating an inventory which needs to be used in another environment.Collecting orbs:  In my first playthrough I collected 80+, 90+, 90+ of the orbs.  Unfortunately some of the green orbs are so well hidden the gamer needs a guide to find them. (They are invisible basically and the gamer needs to know exactly where they are.)   Collecting orbs takes TIME, a keen eye, and just a bit of intuitive thinking.  They are needed for the end game, so the more the gamer has, the better off the gamer is. (I highly recommend Dspecht's orb hunting guide.)      Overall: Wonderful game with whimsical if not fantiful music.  Simple yet highly detailed environments. Logic puzzles based solely on the ""thinking"" of illogical characters (In other words, what to do would make sense to them, not us.)  Admittedly the end game surprised me, I definitely was not expecting it.  Biggest drawback: TIME.  From all the reviews and comments I have read after I played this game time seems to be the biggest complaint.  This game took me a couple of hours to play through the first time, in a very leisurely and casual manner.  I enjoyed it immensely, looking at the detailed environments, chuckling over the diary pages, and simply shaking my head in amusement at the overall bizarreness.  This is not the type of game to speedrun or meant to do as fast as possible.  This game is meant to casually stroll through, while doing things like solve puzzles.  If an action packed speedrun type of game is what you want then this is not the game for you.			"

												The graphics are fantastically pretty.But, that's about all I can wholehearedly endorse about Violett.  The best puzzle-adventure games use subtle signalling to show the user what's possible and have a sort of internal logic and consistency.  Violett is not really one of these games.  There were a number of really nice ""Oh hey, this situation reminds me of this thing I saw a couple rooms back maybe I can use that oh look it worked"" bits, but maybe 20% of the time what you were required to do made no sense at all and it just degenerated into ""click random things on the screen until something changes.""  Especially the parts where there are several on/off switches strewn about the screen and you get to guess which ones should be set which way.They probably knew this sort of thing happened, which is why they put in the hinting system.  Unfortunately, even if you take the hint for what you're supposed to do there's still no guarantee that you can actually do it: the controls are often fidgety and difficult to get to work with a mouse, something that was especially frustrating in the later parts of the game where you had to actually time actions properly.  I'm guessing the controls were actually designed for a tablet of some sort.The first part of the game is by far the most irritating, due to needing to getting used to the controls and on account of the illustration-based explanation style.  Probably they did that in order to avoid needing translation, but sometimes the explanatory illustrations are as mysterious as much of the rest of the game.Speaking of translation, they clearly didn't get anyone native to look at their English.  Fortunately it's all flavor text so you can ignore it.All that said--it's not actually bad, so pick it up if it's on sale or something.  Just expect to spend the first 30 minutes cursing.General disclaimer:  I don't generally play casual point-and-click games, which might account for some of the controls difficulties.  I do like and play puzzle solving games.			"

												Really enjoying this so far! I've gotten two of the jewellery pieces, and have solved a few of the puzzles. The controls are a little clunky, but once you get used to how they work it gets a lot easier. That's another thing I liked - this game isn't too easy! Too many modern games seem to hold your hand a lot and have really easy puzzles with a default easy setting that you have to ramp up to ""hard"" so it's not boring (vanity difficulty?). Not this one; I find that it defaults to challenging. Violett reminds me of older games that you kind of had to walk away and stew on them a bit to figure out.  I have had it crash a few times, but it autosaves well and reloads without issue, but that may have to do with the game setting I've chosen. I haven't had it ""stick"" in places like other users have mentioned. I did start with the hints turned off, and when I got stuck on the drawer puzzle I turned it on. Unfortunately, the hints stayed off. Looks like I'll have to solve it the old fashioned way. It's probably for the best, doing it on my own will be a lot more rewarding!Despite the minor operational issues, I REALLY like this game. Lush, vibrant environments and a lovely sountrack to boot. It's very charming! With the sale going on right now it's really worth the time and investment. Especially if you enjoyed games like Myst and 7th Guest in the past.			"

												Just finished the game. Overall I would give ie 5-6/10Aspects of the game I really enjoyed:- very pretty, rich colours and lots of detail- love how imaginative the illustrations were, I really felt like I was somewhere magical- how all the different scenes fitted into each other. It wasn't a linear, point A to B environmentAspects of the game I found quite frustrating:- lack of instructions, which in itself is not bad, except when there are game glitches as well. A few times when I was stuck, I wasn't sure if it was me, or a glitch. - The hint thing at the bottom of the screen hardly ever worked for me. - lack of logic and cohesion- I found the picture instructions given by the different characters very vague. As the game progressed, everything became easier but at the beginning I had no idea what the caterpillar wanted. If the instructions were in colour, it would have helped.			"

												Violett is a challenge. Not necessarily because the puzzles are extremely hard or because the game play is terrible. Simply because it's a point and click puzzle game and they tend to come with their own brand of problems.That said, I found Violett enjoyable. (For the record, if you don't like point and clicks, don't play this. It will drive you up the wall. I've seen a few reviews by people who said they don't usually play point and clicks, so why on earth did they play this?)There are a few bugs to the game:*The cursor doesn't always seem line up with what I'm trying to click on, some times there are more technical bugs (I personally didn't run into any, but there are reports).*Some of the puzzles don't make the most sense.*There are a few plot holes (the Diary is referred to as Uncle's diary. Is it her Uncle? Is that why her family moved there when she is clearly more a city girl?)*Achievements aren't always rewarded as advertised (I got Sherlock Holmes in a game that I used hints but have still yet to be granted Supercharged...)The game feels like it was designed for a touch screen. The recommended setting is for a swipe setting, which doesn't always translate to mouse movement well.  Which, thinking about it, is probably why the mouse cursor doesn't always line up right. A finger working as the cursor would have a much larger interaction than the mouse cursor. I definitely had the sense in the beginning of ""What the hell am I suppose to be doing?"" It's hard to determine what's interactable environment and what's not.On the other hand, the music is delightful and subtle. The puzzles aren't repetative, which is a frequent problem I have in point and clicks. Once you figure out the quirks of the game, they're fairly consistant over the entire game. The Diary has wonderful insights in to the world you're running around in and I'd really love to see more of this, maybe in a sequel? (Seriously though, I'm never going to look at garden gnomes the same.) I'll fully admit, I don't mind replaying the game over and over, trying to get the achievements (I'm at run through #4 now, trying to get Supercharged).So, while not my most favorite ""OMFG you have to play this"" game, it's definitely been a delightful little game and I've enjoyed working on it.

												TLDR: poor puzzle design with no feedback, interface problems and mazelike hubworld that wastes your time makes Violett an uninteresting experience. Potentially serious bugs. Buy at your own risk.Long version:  You play as Violett, a young girl trapped in fantasy world trying to piece together an amulet to get home. The game starts quite promisingly with a nice cutscene and some excellent artwork. It really seemed like an interesting world to dive into and even if the heroine of the story was very silent it seemed like she would be given a lot of personality (like in Machinarium). I only played for about an hour and a half  though (according to Steam) with a break inbetween, so don't take this as a review of the whole game. The reason I quit was because there does not seem to be much beneath the surface. The interface is incredibly clunky and seems to be suffering from ""I'm designed to work on a phone""ites. It is impossible to even guess what will happen when you click something and sometimes you have to click multiple times to get it to work. It is also hard to click precisely on something when several items are near. So thank you for the ""Keep clicking pointless things"" achievement game... I like being insulted by the games I play when I have a good reason to blame the game for the problems. The absolutely biggest problem though is the lack of feedback though. You click on something and Violett shrugs... can she do nothing with it? Do I need I item to use on it? Do I need to click something else first? No clue. Hell, there are some items that you can drag and others that you can't. You better hope you realize when you can because otherwise nothing will happen... or as with the wheel in the caterpillar room, it will do something which means you won't realize you can move it unless you accidently drag it. Speaking of the caterpillar... he asks for a ring to give me the key. I give him a ring, he takes it. Nothing happens. Talk to him again, he still wants a ring? Was it the wrong ring, but he took it? Does he want two rings? Is it just a bug and I should restart from before I gave it to him? Not a clue.Add in the mazelike hubworld that you have to run around to get to different places that is a complete waste of time and also have deadends... nah. A game needs goodwill for me not to be annoyed by timewasters like that, and Violett has none. I would not recommend buying or playing Violett. Maybe it gets better later on, but I doubt it and I will not try to find out.			"

			Violett is an awesome little Point and Click Adventure by Forever Entertainment S.A. Subscribe for more puzzle goodness.		

If you love point and clicks go buy this game now, if you're on the fence read on. Violett is the usual Point and Click affair, there’s a puzzle and you have to solve it. You might have some inventory items and you may need to backtrack every so often in order to get all the pieces. All that stuff is in Violett, if you're a fan of something like the Monkey Island series you'll feel right at home here. Violett differentiates itself through its mysterious natureViolett is a world where nothing seems to make sense and there’s a lack of cohesion between levels, and that’s a good thing. It represents how crazy this world Violett is in and keeps things fresh and non-repetitive.There’s no comprehensible language, as such you learn everything about the world visually and through interactions with other characters. They do have speech bubbles but they’re filled with various pictures/drawings and from that you have to solve the puzzles.While this helps the narrative of Violett and brings a sense of mystery and wonder, it’s also where a large portion of the frustrations come from. Sometimes objectives are unclear and you’ll spend more time trying to work out what the objective is rather than trying to solve the puzzle. Violett does its best to alleviate this issue but it doesn’t always succeed. Violett features a really nice soundtrack, though they feel more like compositions than BGM. It comes free with the game so you may as well give it a listen! The songs for the most part are well choreographed with the background images. The scenery is of a high standard and there’s enough going on that you can spend a large amount of time just taking it all in. In saying that Violett does seem to stand out very harshly in some of the environments and while it can be said this is to show how she’s out of place, it sometimes ruins these amazing backdrops. This isn’t always the case though and is only something you notice in the more simplistic levels.Thanks for reading my review! Check out the video and follow the channel, I do Indie Game reviews nearly every day!			"

												This might be one of the hardest games I have tried to review so far, as far as pros and cons go.The art style is very well done--a mash-up of cartoon mixed with very surreal objects and environments.  It is quite an engaging atmosphere to traverse as you go from each distinctly different room to the next.You start in a cage and you are on your own from there.  It can be rather daunting trying to figure out what you are supposed to do, even from the get go, and you are going to be doing a lot of random clicking on objects that are both identified by a cursor change to let you know that an object is intended to be used or picked up, as well as interactive objects that you are offered no cursor change to signify whether or not it is something that can be used, picked up, or perhaps intended to later be used as part of the seemingly random puzzles that each room offers.  There will be lots of orbs that you pick up, with no explanation whether these are merely collectables (which they are as it turns out, so far as I have noticed--I am just past the first ""part"" of the game) or ""inventory objects"" for puzzles.If you don't mind thinking WAY outside of the box and relying mainly on experimentation (or a walkthrough) than this game has a lot to offer.  It breaks the traditional mold of a point and click adventure game, and I have yet to decide whether this is a good thing or a bad thing.  I, personally, enjoy both point and click adventure games as well as hidden object games, and I grew up playing all of those silly Sierra and Lucasarts games that had you often using item in unexpected ways, so the culmination that is Violett is overall appealing to me.  It certainly won't be for everyone, but if you can pick it up cheap or in a bundle somewhere, it is definately worth taking a look at.  There is something very luring about the abstract areas that you explore, and while some parts are hair-pullingly frustrating, other parts cannot help but make you smile and want to see where else this odd game is going to take you.

												*sigh*Ok.I don't want to do this, but sadly, I will have to downvote this game. This is hard to do because if only these game would have a couple of details done right, the experience would be so much different. Let's start with the positive things. The visuals are really well done, they are colorful and kind of trippy at times and that's awesome. I love it. Have you ever watched Coraline? You know, the creepy movie that doesn't look like it's going to be creepy so it's even more creepy? Well, this game seem to be heavily inspired by Henry Selick's film so if you liked it, this game should call your attention. The soundtrack is kind of good, I guess, it's not something mindblowing but it does goes well with the lore of the game. Sadly... that's about it.Puzzles in this game are horribly bad done and you start noticing it at the very beggining of the game. They just make no sense,  most of the times I actually solve a puzzle I have no idea how I did it and when I do, I realise there is no logic to it. I frequently find myself just clicking around and hoping something happens, because when I think I have figured something out I realise that is not the way this game wants it be done. The actual story of this game is not much better. Since there is no actual dialog, the only input you have from the characters is from communication bubbles showing drawings inside them (kind of like The Sims showing you what they want or what the are talking about). They mostly show items as hints but the problem is that it's difficult to understand what is being told or how you are going to do what you think is being asked. Actually, this game tends to not explain me where I'm going or what I'm doing and sometimes I end up picking items at random that I don't know how to use. This is this game in a nutshell: completly confusion and frustration with a beautiful package. So, should you buy it?Well, not at full price. At least I wouldn't recommend it. But if you can catch it on a bundle or with a discount you might want to try it. Also, I would like to keep track on the developer's next work. I expect Forever Entertainment to learn from this mistakes and make an awesome game to recompense for this one :)			"

												For a point-and-click adventure, you're either going to enjoy this game or you're going to hate it. The initial premise evokes strong deja-vu of Coraline almost to the point of feeling like a blatent ripoff. You play Violett, a goth girl who moves into an old house and finds herself lost in a strange world - complete with a spider antagonist. This is where the simularities end however... as well as the depth of story. Simply put, if you're someone who prefers a heaping dose of narrative and gets annoyed when things are left vague, this game isn't for you. If you don't mind a game that gives you the breadcrumbs and encourages your own interpretations, you'll find an adventure reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland or The Neverending Story.Each scenery you'll encounter is incredibly imaginitive, from opera singing frogs who can control the weather with their voice, to haunted teapots that torment their owners. The puzzles can be frustrating, but for the most part are never truly illogical. At least, they're generally as logical as a Wonderland-esque world ruled by the phrase ""we're all mad here"" is capable of being. The overall aesthetic is unique and (I felt) fascinating. The soundtrack is alright and comes with the game automatically.And now the bad side. First off, the controls can more often than not be frustrating to deal with, especially if you're moving between several rooms at once. I also encountered some bugs. For example, one achievement failed to pop because one of the criteria glitched and I was forced to start a new game to complete it. Another bug involved ants that forced me to exit and enter the area several times to correct. The ""boss fight"" at the end is also a complete joke.Bottom line, I would say the game is worth looking into if you're a fan of the aforementioned stories, but due to the potential problems with bugs I can't recommend paying full price. Get it during a sale.			"

To preface: I encountered zero bugged areas, quest issues, broken achievements, crashes, screen blips, or hangups while playing this on Win 7 64-bit, so the devs most likely tackled all or most of the issues people have been complaining about up till now (Jan 2015). That said, don't let the bug complaints in other reviews deter you. Violett. Admittedly, this is a tough one. I adored the music, the art style (the 2.5D in-game, not the 2D intro/ending), the colorful characters, the bug world, and the goals. I'm a fan of puzzle games and ""collect-them-all"" type of scavenger hunts, and I rarely have difficulty completing them on my own. However I simply could not complete Violett without a walkthrough. Many of the puzzles are ridiculously convoluted, and that's aside from the main 4 required for the Brain Overload achievement. The roof elevator puzzle alone nearly made me weep and ragequit.Even ""simpler"" puzzles are not at all intuitive. They could take hours of trial and error, especially:- If you miss a necessary item that you can only get in another scene (but you aren't told where); - If you move to one side of the screen, the scene elements can block the very thing you need to click on (e.g. the Kitchen & Garçon de cuisine achievement, or any number of orbs that are hidden from certain angles);- Any instance of ""nope, can't have this/get there till you do this/find that/give this character X number of these"";- If you don't figure out the specific puzzle mechanics or ""logic"", which are rarely or never explained.I'm not saying games should hold your hand through puzzles. That wouldn't present any challenge. But when the clues and/or a solution to a puzzle are so COMPLETELY off-the-wall and nothing you'd even think to try without tripping over it accidentally -- that's just bad foresight in the puzzle design itself.And then there are the doors. Oh god, the doors. Go in here, come out there. Go back in the same way, come out on a different level. Rinse, repeat. It's like a damn Benny Hill hallway chase scene, except you're the only one running around like a loon. Oh, and even worse, if you pull a lever/push a button in those scenes, every route changes and you have to figure it all out again. *facepalm*I do wish the characters had a bit more interesting/interactive elements instead of just being part of the scene or spouting chimpmunk-speed gibberish (sounded like Russian at some points) along with a single picture bubble as a ""clue"", but that limitation didn't really take away from [mostly] understanding what they wanted from you.You WILL need a guide if you're going for the Supercharged achievement to collect all the orbs. Some of them are so hidden away it's like the devs don't want you to find things unless you click every spot on the screen. At least there aren't any click penalties, cuz man, would I be in trouble.So why do I recommend the game?Aside from the frustrations of the puzzles, I would still say Violett is a unique and fun experience. I didn't really mind using a text or video walkthrough for some most parts, because I could look past that and enjoy other aspects of the game, like the art, character design, ""2.5D"" level design, and silly Alice-like atmosphere. If you have no issues with ""reading the directions"" and then just enjoying it while you follow them, you may get the same level of enjoyment out of Violett that I did.It's not a masterpiece by any definition, but even after a complete playthrough my mind drifts back to Violett's bug world now and again, and in that sense I would say the game is pleasantly unforgettable. I wouldn't get it at full price (mainly because the insane puzzle designs waste far more playtime than they should), but when it's on sale (especially for .99 cents), you should consider giving it a shot.

On my PC Im getting bugs and glitches keeping me from playing a game that should be a walk in park to a frustrating storyline.Pretty graphics semi easy puzzles make this a nice game if you are a fan of hidden object games.

												In my opinion this is not a Point and Click Adventure so if you're looking for that don't buy it, I don't understand why it has that tag.But I recommend it as a Hidden Object and Puzzle game with a very wonky controlled boss fight at the end, (but it's the only scene where there is anything like that and I got the hang of it after a few tries).The puzzles are for the most part logical enough when you get used to the style of thinking for the game, these types of games useally differ in how the person who made the puzzles think and it always takes me a puzzle or two to understand what's going on, but after you do they aren't really hard just some of them are a little wierd.Alot of review mention alot of bugs but I've only played the remastered version and appart from the game crashing twice (it had autosaved where I was so that wasn't really an issue), other then that I encountered only one bug, which was the green orb on the queens hat was not clickable for me, that seems to be a known bug though and I found all other orbs so I got the Supercharged achivement without getting that one orb.

												This game is oozing with style. Unfortunately that's all its got going for it. The puzzles are horrible and unintuitive. The interface gets stuck at times, forcing you to reload. The tips were not helpful and from the very start I wondered how to use items from the inventory, what the interaction mechnics were, etc. The music, while fitting, never appealed to me melody-wise, it just wasn't memorable music. Getting lost in the 'lobby' or staircase area isn't my idea of a fun staging area. But more than anything... you will just get stuck in a senseless and/or broken puzzle, even sometimes to the point of having to restart the entire game over. I'm sorry I spent a dime of my money on this.... don't waste yours.			"

												Well, I just got done with Violett and I must say there's a lot that's both good and bad.The Good:Overall, I found the experience charming. The art is excellent, most (but not all) of the puzzles are challenging but not impossible, and I liked the hidden item collection. The Machinarium-style pictograms were a good choice, making localization a breeze.  Music was great too, and I appreciate the OST coming with the Steam release sale. The Not So Good:The hint system is TERRIBLE!  Totally tells you nothing you need to know. Plus, some of the puzzles aren't tremendously intuitive, and when you suddenly need to start backtracking after a series of self-contained rooms it's unexpected.  The hidden item aspect, which I do like, actually makes no sense in terms of mana since you never use it. I haven't tried, but I expect you can finish the game quite handily without picking up a single bit of mana throughout which makes it pointless except to gain an achievement.  Finally, there's the rather inexplicable ending scene which I suspect was intended to be interactive but somehow plays automatically.  Makes no sense in context, since you haven't seen or heard about this character from the beginning, so it's quite confounding.I should make special mention of the story, or rather the lack thereof. At the beginning, we are given a pretty bare-bones setup. Unhappy girl, taken to big house, finds amulet and gets sucked into another world.  And...that's pretty much all you get.  Other than a glimpse at the beginning of the game and a diary entry that you can easily miss out on, the player has NO CLUE who the villain at the end is. Even then, there's no indication if they're the one who brought you into this world. You also aren't given any idea what this place is, or how it's related to you. There's one reference that the diary belonged to your uncle, but that's the sole mention of him, so again we're lost.  Finally, there are the bugs. I only had to restart the game from the beginning once (from the library) but others have had to do it multiple times. I also ran into a couple of graphical glitches towards the end. Better quality control should have been done before this was released onto Steam, for sure.Overall:Despite all that, I'd still recommend the game although you might need to look in the community for hints. It is undeniably charming, and that's a large part of it for me. I just wish there were a more engaging story to go with it.			"

												To start off, this game has huge potential. Hidden objects everywhere, secrets, puzzles, (beautiful graphics) it makes my head spin. Sure, there's some clipping, and some things just seem out of the blue annoying, but honestly, at the point the game is at, the faults are made up for. Really, the one thing that bothers me about this game is that I needed a guide so much. A lot of the times you're thrown into a scene and have to do something, find something, or make something happen, but you aren't really given anywhere to start. On occasion, when I'd get stuck, I'd go to every room and click all around the screen because that's the only way you'd find out if you'd missed anything. But, for a game that was just starting to get on it's feet when I got it, it shocked the heck outta me. To put it plainly, it was captivating. I just HAD to solve the next puzzle, HAD to get to the next room, HAD to remove whatever got in my way.And that leads me to my next peeve about this game.It's a ""burn out"" game, and by that I mean you play it until you wear out, and don't go back for a while, then play it again until you burn out again... and the cycle repeats. If that still makes no sense, I mean it holds my attention until I exit the game. Once you're out of it... it just doesn't seem welcoming. Nonetheless, I'm sure they'd updated plenty of things since I last played, which was about an eon ago, so maybe things are slightly different. I, also, still highly reccomend this game, because, hey, every game has its perks and erks.			"

												Edit: After the new hint update, I tried giving it another shot, and it made the game much more playable. I would say it's about 50/50 whether I can recommend this game or not. If you enjoy classic style point and click adventure games, this one may strike a chord with you. However, it's also very frustrating and generally incredibly vague on what you need to do next. There's really no story associated with the game, and the only dialogue is in pictures and garbled voices, so there's no Monkey Island or Day of the Tentacle style quips to keep you entertained, and no real cohesion between levels other than you're very small and in a sort of fantasy insect world.Overall, there have been times when I've enjoyed this game, and times that I've been so frustrated that I turned it off and went and did something else. And unfortunately, the latter has been more prevalent. The graphics in the game are cool, I really like the concepts that the designers came up with. The music is very well done, but it gets a little obnoxious playing on repeat if you get stuck on a certain level for a long time. For the most part it fits in well with the game, though.I've really enjoyed the design of some of the puzzles, like the cupboard with numbered drawers and the Mole Man water puzzle. However, a lot of the puzzles don't really seem like they're things that make you think, just things that make you click on a lot of different things or give up and use a hint. The elevator with the arrows, for example. I figured out the left and right part easily enough, but I never would have gotten the specific solution if I hadn't used a hint. And there are a lot of puzzles like this, unfortunately. With the updated hint system though, while it hurts my pride to admit defeat, I can still use a hint and get past it instead of being stuck and not being able to play the game any more.My only compaint about the hints is that if I'm 90% through a level when I get stuck, if I haven't used any hints up to that point, it makes you use the hints in order. I have to use 4 hints just to get help with where I'm currently at. It would be nice if it would keep track of your level progress and grey out or skip hints that no longer apply to you.			"

												This game looked very pretty, but there is not enough logic in the puzzles, so there seems to be no way to figure out the solutions without an unbounded amount of random clicking.  A good point-and-click game will present a consistent and logical universe, where you can understand how the parts interact, and figure out how to use the available tools to solve the puzzles. This game didn't do that.  Even once we solved some of the puzzles, we weren't left thinking ""Oh, that makes sense!"" but rather ""How were we supposed to guess *that*?""(My 6-year-old agrees, and quickly lost interest.) "

												I quickly snapped up Violett and eagerly jumped into the game once it installed. I have to admit feeling a little lost at the beginning as there is no spoon feeding. You are plunged straight into an environment that encourages you to explore. I normally enjoy these sort of games but I find Violett frustrates me more than entertains me. I'm a good portion of my way in and I no longer have the satisfaction of solving a puzzle or the excitement of a new location. Graphically it is interesting and the imaginative game world, inspired by Alice in Wonderland, certainly adds a new dimension. Music is okay and helps set the atmosphere. But something is missing, something just doesn't quite gel. Most of the puzzles do make sense in their own, sometime surreal, way although I do find myself randomly clicking on things without a sense of direction when I'm stuck. Other times I've missed important clues that blended a little too well with the background or solved something by accident without really knowing what I did. A few puzzles were simple enough to solve but tedious to execute and my only satisfaction in completing them was I didn't have to do it again.Maybe part of what is missing, for me at least, is some sort of feedback mechanism. I feel detached from what is going on in the game. I can only make sense of the various scenes by what I see with my eyes. Violett does not attempt to enrich that with any further explanation, for example items that are picked up cannot be examined closer nor do they have labels. I've come across a few things that I have no idea what they are let alone what to use them for. Violett is also a little helpless when trying something that isn't valid. Just a shrug with little indication (in most cases) as to why it is not valid. It reminds me of those old school Text Adventures that had the default response ""I can't do that"". I'm never sure if it's because it is impossible in the game or I haven't satisfied all the prerequisites. It must be noted that the controls are simplistic but unfortunately a tad clunky. They feel as they've been designed with a touch device in mind. I'm playing with a keyboard and mouse so that may be why.I can't not recommend this game as it certainly does have merit, it's reasonably executed and it has generated a lot of eager discussion and favourable comments in the forum, but for me I don't think I have the will to progress much further. If you enjoy puzzle based games then you may get something out of Violett but mileage will vary. "

												Violett is a delightful point and click game, though partially also a hidden object game, containing engaging puzzles, colorful and creative landscapes, and a memorable soundtrack. It's a bit of a blend between Coraline and Alice in Wonderland; you fall into this world of intelligent, sophisticated insects and tiny mammals, and are working towards freeing them from tyranny, and yourself from being tinier then a mouse.What I liked best about this game was easily the setting and the audio. The maps were colorful, a creative mix of exotic flavors and household objects, and the mini game of finding all of the hidden objects (there's an achievement involved with that) helps you explore and appreciate it a little more thoroughly. The music...it's charming, and cute, and gets stuck in your head easily. I'm a fool for a neat artstyle, and both the powers you use in the game, and the style of the game, reminded me a bit of Psychonauts. While the plot isn't directly spelled out for you, journal pages and direct observation provide the bulk of the simple, age-old story.Mechanically, the game was decently smooth. It was always clear where you could go, the pathing was very fluid, and the animations never glitched or did anything unpredictable. There was no mad clicking, and whenever it required anything different then clicking, a helpful icon would appear at the bottom of the screen telling the player to drag the mouse in a certain direction.There are a couple of known glitches at the time this review was made, though they didn't retract from the game. One is an unclickable orb, which does not prevent the achievement from granting, and the other is around an area called the Labyrinth, where the game crashes while saving. It saves successfully, and autosaves frequently, so you won't lose any progress, but might need to restart in that area a couple of times. While yes, it's not perfect, it hardly bothered me and was the last time I saw a glitch in the game, in that early area.The major topic of the puzzles...The one every fears and has a great deal of conflict on, whether puzzles are understandable and readable, or if they are counter-intuitive and too hard. To my perspective, Violett is not difficult to understand. There's visual cues in every level, detailing what you should be focusing on. In every level, there's either interaction with NPCs who directly tell you what they require from you, or a visible problem that you must correct to proceed. A couple of the early levels are actually the toughest, involving long puzzles with back and forth steps required, and items from different areas necessary to complete puzzles from previous areas. The game actually gets progressively easier and more intuitive, which I wasn't expecting, the puzzles later on being far more isolated within their given screens or pathway forks.Over all calls? This game is worth playing for it's creative atmosphere and decent puzzles. It has a couple of issues, but the puzzles follow the logic of the story, and at no point did I ever hit a wall. New content and glitch fixes have been added recently, so it clearly gets attention from it's developers.((Ways to improve the game? More visual cues, looking at the reviews. Maybe unique sounds for when the screens are complete, or all the orbs are gone from a screen, or a puzzle mechanic is finished. The newly added content was maybe even a little better then the original content, and didn't feel forced or shoehorned in.))			"

I had some issues with the character not moving the exact spot I wanted her to go to, and some times she would get stuck on pieces of the environment. The orbs were also very hard to find even when really looking for them.			"

												I'm torn about recommending this game or not. There were some control/command issues that I found which made gameplay irritating in many places....including the boss fight. The plot lead in and ending could have been better, but the adventures during gameplay were interesting enough to keep me slogging through the control issues. I did love the artwork and animation. The solitary cut-scene was kind of random, but it's skippable. I finished the game with about 12 hours of game-play. It kept me entertained while I was sick.That being said, I know the developers have recently mentioned finding bugs and working to fix said bugs. Patches have been rolled out etc. I'm certain with more time they will be able to smooth out the control issues, particularly if people are willing to let them know about them.I think I'm going to go ahead and be optimistic that more debugging in the future will help the game and go ahead and recommend it to others. But with a warning: if you are easily frustrated with buggy controls, don't bother until more debugging's been done. Currently I give it a 4 out of 10, but it has the potential to be much better with further debugging.			"

												Point and click games generally have three factors that determine its quality: story, art style, and puzzles.This game has a rather simplistic straightforward story, so don't expect any plot twists, internal conflicts, or multiple endings. In addition, even though the story is largely derivative of Lewis Caroll's Alice in Wonderland, the diary pages do provide some interesting and amusing backstory to the characters that you meet along the way.In terms of art style, Violett has some very pleasing hand painted 2D background art and the 3D models are not too shabby either. Also, don't fret about turning this game's graphical quality up to the highest. It barely causes the fan of my low end graphics card to spin faster.Finally, the puzzles and challenges of this game aren't too difficult provided that one has a keen eye in spotting patterns and hidden clues. Also, the game has a hint system for those that are stuck on a particular puzzle. Of course, if you choose to use it you won't qualify for certain achievements.Overall, this is a point and click game is with an emphasis on puzzles and challenges. If one is looking for something akin to the Deponia series or The Longest Journey, then one isn't going to find it here in this game.			"

												This game is both a joy and a frustration to play!The setpieces are literally taken from fairytales, there's a hint of a dark, strange atmosphere and the puzzles will have you scratching your head in confusion at times, although in hindsight they're all pretty logical.The music is also a very appropiate addition to the overall feeling and the whole ""Soundtrack Edition"" thing on Steam is not entirely without its merit. Unfortunately, the technical aspects of the game are not as polished as I would have liked. Setting 4:3 resolutions will literally cut off your image and there will be things you will not see (which is of vital importance during some puzzles), the English localization sometimes looks wrong and the controls are sometimes very annoying and slow.In addition, whenever she fails to do something, Violett undergoes a very long animation that effectively prevents you from doing anything for a few seconds.To sum it all up ... you should definitely give this game a try, but you could wait for a better promo (currently it's 6 euro) or until the devs iron out the kinks.

												I really enjoyed this, a great puzzle game. Some of the puzzles are genuinely challenging to figure out, so that was fun. There was only one puzzle annoying enough for me to look up, the rest were challenging at times but fun to figure out.I really liked the bizarre setting, it has a really nice mood, and the music is *amazing* and fits the setting really well. I also like that the NPCs are really just going about their own business and their lives don't revolve around you as a nice departure from the 'do this for me' quests usually found in point-and-clicks. Achievements ranged from easy to challenging but were fun to fulfill for the most part. The orbs are a little annoying to get sometimes so you might want to guide it once you've had a good go. It would be nice if you got some hints about the remaining orbs once you'd beaten the game or something since they already have hints for the main game and it's less spoilery than looking up a guide that tells you outright where they are.The boss fight feels a bit odd, standing out from the rest of the game mechanics-wise, but it gives meaning to collecting all those orbs which is more than a lot of other games bother to do. And it's not too hard once you get the hang of it. A practise room with a dummy would've been cool though, so you can have used the skills before fighting the big bad.Update: The free update was pretty good as far as I can tell: the new areas had fun, well thought-out puzzles. They fit in seamlessly and apparently there are other improvements which I didn't encounter when I replayed the game. (Possibly they were hints.) It was pretty decent of them to add free bonus content, improve graphics and more fixes to the game.			"

												Violett is a little girl tumbling into a fantastic adventure where she shrinked to the size of a bug. While the main aim is to find back home to her parent's house, she needs to solve lots of puzzles with many crosslinks. The graphics are nice and cute, the music is interesting like some film score.  She can only walk - in the beginning. Through her journey, she will find many balls/orbs in three different colors and three special glowing orbs that gives her special powers (jump, psychokineses and defense shield). The normal balls will fill the energy levels for all three powers.She has to go to the same scenes several times to completely solve all puzzles and many orbs are hidden very well (sometimes they are invisible hidden). If you are stuck, you can get help with the icon circle in the lower right. If she speaks with animals, you only here some strange queeks with some words and speech bubbles explaining the required item in sketches.The very first scene, where she is trapped in a cage, can only be played once - all other scenes can be visited again. There is an autosave feature but you might want to save your game already right in this first scene (in case you want to get all achievements by finding all orbs). You can also save your current game in new save slots, if you like. Unfortunately, the game ""froze"" a few times, i.e. Violett wasn't able to move anymore, everything else continued on the screen. But saving and restarting solved these issues.<SPOILER ON>The very last scene is some kind of boss fight with the spider queen but I wasn't able to move Violett as I liked to. I somehow made it but this was just try and error and some luck. Too bad as an end for this nice puzzle adventure.</SPOILER OFF>Despite the few glitches, I recommend this time waster as it is challenging and has nice graphics, music and puzzles.			"

												First of all, this game reminds me an awful lot of the movie Coraline. Second off the controls in this game are just awful. There are no indications for doing anything right and the puzzles are overly simple. The only reason I had to use a walkthrough was because I wasn't sure if I was doing something right, simply because the controlling was so off. I couldn't beat the boss in the end because the fireballs wouldn't release. This game is definitely not worth $10.00 in my opinion. The artwork is beautiful, but the gameplay and story is just bad.

												After having finished Violett, I am in two minds about whether or not to recommend it, so in the end I've chosen to recommend it, but with some (significant) caveats.In Violett, you'll guide the titular protagonist through a beautifully rendered fantasy land, which is peopled with strange creatures, and reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland. While doing so, you'll be enjoying excellent background music, which is also included with the game as MP3s. Violett is a point-and-click adventure game, with elements of a hidden-object game. Not only are many objects with which you need to interact hidden, but there are also collectible ""orbs"" which (as far as I can tell) only earn you an achievement if you bother to collect them, in addition to diary pages which flesh out the mythology behind the fantastical creatures you encounter. The player is thus rewarded for carefully inspecting each landscape and interacting with everything. Overall, I found the puzzles to be pretty reasonable, though there are some needlessly repeated actions in a few cases.Similarly to Journey of a Roach, the game does not include actual spoken dialogue (the words spoken are gibberish), but instead relies on pictographs to convey meaning. Mostly, this works pretty well, but in a couple of cases I found it hard to decipher the meaning of the pictograph, until I had inadvertently stumbled upon part of the solution to the puzzle at hand. However, that leads me to the issues I have with this game, the main issue being the control scheme. Actions typically involve either clicking on stuff (which works well), or dragging items from the inventory or from one place to another on the current screen. Unfortunately, it can be rather difficult to drag stuff, and I even had difficulty with something as simple as dragging items out of my inventory. This was a constant source of frustration, and the only positive I can say with regards to this control-scheme, is that the game will tell you when you have to interact with an object by dragging it.Secondly, the game is rather buggy at this point, with one patch just released. Several times, Violett would be stuck in a ""can't do that"" animation loop, and I was forced to quit to the main menu and resume the game to continue. Even worse, one puzzle forced me to repeatedly reload, so that it would reset to a state where I could exit it from my current position (the elevator puzzle). Similarly, I could not interact with a couple of items (plant-bulbs), even though I had obtained the prerequisites to do so, and missed a couple of diary pages due to this.Thirdly, the actual plot is very sparse (due in part to the lack of dialogue), and the ending came as a bit of a surprise.However, if you are willing to put up with these issues, then I'll gladly recommend trying out Violett.

												I've never rage-quitted point 'n' click game before. And now I did because for every puzzle in the first hour of playing I had to use the walkthrough. It's all about random clicking and trying out different solutions (or alt-tabbing to the browser again and again) because the game tells you nothing and the solutions to ""puzzles"" are totally accidental and make no sense. For example: to leave the room you need to catch the fly in the bottle. Why? No idea. To open the door to another place you need to click few symbols from provided group. Which ones? You either spend next few minutes staring at the screen or google the answer. So yeah, definitely not recommended. There are plenty other point and click games that are actually worth your time.			"

												Violett is a game that makes you think. It is light on the story, but features some really interesting and beautiful environments. None of the puzzles are alike, although you begin to learn the logic behind the puzzle makers as you play through. Each room is a puzzle to be solved. Outside of a few rare cases, you shouldn't have to leave your current room for other items in order to solve the puzzles there. In the few cases when you do, the faries are asking for something that you know you can't find in your current room. On the downside, the game is quite buggy. I've been lucky that I only had a game stopping bug once. I was able to play through the rest of the game without too many issues. Most people are advising you make a new save for each new room you enter on the off chance you bug out. The developers are listening and have been patching to resolve some of these issues. Try everything. Some of the puzzle solutions are not obvious and take quite a bit of work to get there.			"

												Generic, but enjoyable mix of Alice in Wonderland and Coraline. Quite decent amount of gameplay that reminds of old point-and-click adventures. As usual, some puzzles don't make sense, but it's easy enough to solve them with some luck. User interface made for touch screens can be annoying at times when playing with a mouse.			"

												This game is beautiful.  The way 3d rendered and hand drawn mix together is something to be noted.  The plot is almost missing, and what is there I think is lost in translation to english.  There are many gems to this game.  The diary notes are really great, and the idea of adding hidden object finding to an ""adventure"" game should be done more.  The bad things about this game are there right from the beginning.  There isn't a tutorial, and by the time you figure out what you should be doing, you are halfway through the game.  The puzzles are comunicated through thought bubble drawings that can be terribly confusing.  I loved Dropsy for this feature, but this game does a horrible job of it.  You never know what you are really doing, and when you can't get somethign to work, you can't be sure its not a bug in the game, which there are many.  The music I really want to like, but somehow just adds to my annoyance of the game. There is NO fast travel.  Looking for missed things or figuring out a multi room puzzel is maddenly time consuming.  I managed to finish the game, but mostly just to be done with it. The game had little parts that I could appreciate, but I spent most of the time frustrated and/or annoyed.  I can't say I hate the game, and I really wanted to like it. Its just such a wierd situation.  In some ways its almost a great game, that just needs a few things ironed out.  In otherways its too far gone, and should have been scrapped and never released. Either way I can't recommend buying it.  If you already have the game or got it for close to free, then use a guide for the first few rooms, to serve as a tutorial, and try not to get too frustrated.I would watch for future projects from this developer, their next project might be better.One good thing that stands out is the gamepad support.  It is pretty neat that they added point and click as well as character movement control.  Sadly, it doesn't work very well and its hard enough to solve the terrible puzzles, without second guessing if the gamepad button does what I think It does.  There is a situation where the click button no longer is the ""use"" button is some cases and it gets really confusing.  I do want to give them credit though for being innovative. the gamepad support is almost good.*edit* I forgot to mention one of the most frustrating parts, you have to turn off the hints HUD element to actually find and click things you need to in game. How bad is that? It's hidden in the options. If you are going to brave this game, turn off the hints icon and just use the steam guides if you have to.			"

												This is ok game with nice graphics and music. But there is not much plot and it is easy not to understand what you need to do so solving puzzles takes some time. Many puzzles are solved just on luck. If I could give neutral I would because this is not a very good point and click game. I'm giving thumb down because prize is too high for what game gives you.

I do wish they would add a way to restart the room for it as that would help as I can loose myself in some of the puzzles and forget what I was doing in the room.  I do love this game and the art just puts me in day dream land.			"

												This took me under 6 hours to complete with barely any hint helper. Very cool design. Reminds me alot of Alice in Wonderland. The diary pages added a nice touch of exposition and the puzzles were fun to solve. My only issue with the game is the ending. The Boss had little to no build-up, I didn't know why I needed to kill her, and the ""powers"" I gained along the way weren't really for fighting. Besides the ending, a nice game to spend a few afternoons fiddling with.			"

Posted: September 6, 2014
												I recommend Violett but I have to do so with a few caveats: 1. While it has an inventory system and a few inventory based puzzles, its puzzle style is more in line with hidden object games, especially when you are motivated to find a number of hidden orbs scattered throughout the game's many beautiful landscapes.2. Imagine you went to Wonderland and couldn't speak the language, nor could you find any ready guides to understand how things worked. This is also what playing Violett is like, for better or worse.3. The final boss battle, not found in the game's original release, frustrated me greatly. I guess they wanted to have some climax beyond ""walk right to win"", but I think they could have done a better job. The fight does tie back into why you are collecting all of the orbs you find at least. What could have been a clever manipulation of the environment with your powers turns into a quick and dirty clickfest.That said, I loved Violett's aesthetics. It is a game world full of whimsey and the journal pages you can discover help flesh out the madcap world around you. The puzzles for the most part are fetch quests or isolated one screen puzzles that involve keen environment manipulation. While the fetch quest elements are not too bad, with characters stating in picture word bubble form what they need, figuring out the more obscure puzzles were frustrating but nothing on the level of Sierra classics. Even then, that chimney puzzle will haunt me forever for not making one lick of sense to me. A hotspot indicator would have been nice, at least for interactable elements while leaving the hidden orbs alone. Instead of voice acting the characters all speak in animated gibberish; the music is lovely and fits the world well. By the end I was addicted to the delightful chimes you receive when you collect a new orb.Hard to recommend at $10; would recommend it more for fans of hidden object games than traditional adventures, but still worth a pretty few hours of your time.

												if you like point and click games, add this to your game collection. game is 6-7 hours long using a walkthrough.  if you are going for 100% completion, use a guide - there's a lot of hidden items in the game which makes up most of the achievements.  i did encounter some bugs but after exiting the room it is back to normal.

												A nice, old-school point and click, just like you remember them - no hand-holding, no tutorial, and so far no actual dialogue.Buy this if you want to put your thinking cap on, and remember - you're not going to just figure this all out in one sitting. When  you get frustrated (and you will), go do something else. This is the kind of game that will distract you all day as you try to figure out the puzzles before coming back to it after work.Graphics are charming and a nice step up from the days of DOS, music is catchy but not annoying (important, since it'll be stuck in your head all day) and controls are simple, yet effective.

												Pros: -Visually Pleasing-Nice Music-Mysterious environment keeps you interested / wanting to finish the gameCons:- Interface / Gameplay is pooly executed (You click here, she goes there).- Puzzles don't make sense. -Characters don't talk at all (not even text), only make noises and use symbols to TRY to communicate (poorly). -Lacking of a substantial story/plot (they try to show you through the pictures, but it is quite lacking).--- Worst of all are the GAME BREAKING GLITCHES. There are lots of small irratating glitches throughout the game, but also major problems to where you can't finish puzzles, or where your chacter gets stuck and you are forced to start all over from the beginning after hours of play. I finished a puzzle and Violett got stuck. First she would just pace right and left without being able to go anywhere else, after a while of clicking the entire page trying to get her to move somewhere else she began walking in place. I couldn't go down the stairs, tried clicking the door to leave the room, but she only continued walking in place. Restarted the game in hopes it would fix iteself, but the auto-save kept her right in her spot and she continues walking in place to this day. After looking into it, seems there are many spots in the game that have this issue, which have been reported by numerous people. From what I can see, however, the developers have done very little to solve the problem. So why begin the game all over when there is a very high chance it will just happen again. I paid for a game that is not even playable. So until they fix all the glitches / problems - I DO NOT recommend this game.   "

												I was excited to get th is game as a gift for christmas. It was on my wish list, and the artwork and video looked very pretty and engaging. While playing, I soon became aware that there are no real hints to help you figure out your path, you have to click on almost everything to figure out what moves what doesn't, no highlighting of items when hovered, no change of mouse clicker unless activating a button or such. I had to go through a couple of walkthrough's to figure out where I was missing something, realizing it's not just a fun push forward game like I expected, you have to backtrack alot. after 8 hours of gameplay, i came to a point where it seemed as if i should give 2 items to this in game avatar, so i did. This has since been the downfall which caused an action integral to move forward not to take place. Since it autosaved,which others in the discussion board said didn't happen, I lost the ability to go back 2 hours of game play and start there. So I am done with it now. What really makes it pointless is you collect orbs throughout the game which have no value on how it ends or your powers or anything but achievements. It has a difficult puzzle adventure game that is not kid friendly, although the art would make it seem so. It's just too difficult for a kid to get. I'd give this a 1 out of 5 if i could. Maybe if they fix some things and give more direction when items should be used, it would be easier, or a map of the land too to figure out how far you actually are in the game.			"

												Seems like a great point-and-click adventure, however the bugs keep me from really enjoying it. There are points in the game where it is possible to get stuck without the ability to go anywhere which wouldn't be so bad if there was a ""restart level"" or ""reset room"" option. As it stands if you hit one of these glitches there 's no option but to start the game over and race through to the point where the game gliched out, remember what caused it and avoid doing whatever that was. For now I'm going to wait a few months and start over. Hopefully the bugs will be ironed out by then. I couldn't recommend this game as it is right now, however.			"

												""Violett"" is pretty good - for it's character, locations, puzzles, atmosphere (watch it on youtube if you are not sure). It's really cute and funny, and, what's important - you always have an ability to use hints, so the hardest puzzles can not ruin your enjoyment if you are not a hardcore player.I hadn't completed it yet, but the only bad thing about the game - is that it's remaster is much more buggy than original version, and, also, remaster don't work on my main PC on Windows XP, while the original do. Anyway, I bought it twice, so I can download older version from torrents, what I can suggest to you if you bought it and don't care much about cards, achivements and other playtime ruiners.Some can add to contras that it has some minor errors or illogical puzzles sometimes - but it still plays good. None of mentioned fatal bugs affected me in both remastered and original versions.UPD: Just finished. All the illogicallest puzzles looks really obvious on the second thought, after they've been completed. It's definetely worth playing. Sorry to see it lose it's cost so quickly and hope to see more games from dev team, especially - if they will be able to spend more time on game. This product still looks unfinished a little bit.P.S. Remaster package needs some cool artworks or wallpaper of the game - it could be a great addition c:			"

												If you like games that state the obvious such as you cannot use this item here or you need another part to complete this task, then this game is NOT for you. This game does not hold your hand.VO’s:There are no VO's so to speak. If you can akin their speech to ""SIM"" talk, that's what you get here. They kind of chitter or chirp you could say. The basic story is about a teenage girl who is defiant to her parents, doesn't listen, you know the usual. Her and her parents have moved to this old house and while her parent are fighting she goes up to her room. She finds something that shrinks her to insect size and is now on a quest to get back to her parents while along the way helping the friendly little bugs and insects that reside within the walls of the house and outside. If you help them then they will in turn help you.HINTS:There is a hint system, but not in the typical sense. This game does not use words to give hints but rather pictures. There is a circle in the bottom right hand corner of the screen that is quartered and numbered I, II, III, and IV. If you are unsure of what to do you can click on each section which gives you pictures of what to do next. Hovering over certain items will give you pictures as to what to do with that area. It's not easy as sometimes the clues don't always point out that you have to do something else in order to accomplish that task even when you use the hints in the bottom right.GRAPHICS:The graphics are cute. They are bright, charming and very imaginative. Makes you think of what it would actually be like if bugs did live like this.SOUNDS:The music and sounds are cute. It's not over bearing and doesn't drive you insane. Of course you can adjust it in options.GAMEPLAY:This is a point and click adventure. Shoes will show up if you can travel to a certain spot. A door shows up when you can travel to another area. A hand shows up if you want to move something, which you click and hold then drag to the desired spot, or if you can slide a door open for instance. A speech bubble, with pictures of what one wants, will show up over characters you can interact with. These are your quests. You have a backpack that is in the upper right hand corner of the screen where your collectibles and usable objects are stored. You hover the mouse over it and click and drag the object to where it needs to go. You collect little green, blue and celadon orbs, which I think help with upgrading your powers. You also collect diary entries on the different species that are in the game. In the beginning you get the telekinesis power from a fairy. This is something you will use quite often. Some areas require you to dress a certain way in order to continue on to the next area. It seems hard but once you get used to the gameplay, you start figuring out what makes sense for each area. I never used the hints. You just have to put some thought into it, even if it doesn’t make sense. These are bugs we’re talking about here.There is no choice for hard or easy that I saw. You can change the controls to touch or swipe. As an example, in the beginning you have to swing a cage back and forth and I found it easier to use the touch rather than swipe. I couldn’t get my mouse to swipe well. I recommend using a plug in mouse rather than the built in laptop mouse for this game. But to each their own.PUZZLES:The puzzles are pretty easy. In the beginning for example you have to swing a cage back and forth to hit another cage next to you to get your telekinesis power, then you use that power to move things around so that you can get free from the cage. In the next area you have to distract something in order to get past it. In other areas you have to find objects that will complete something that can help you move from one side to the other or you may have to move ladders in a certain way in order to climb something. In another puzzle you have to divert water a certain way in order to acquire an object to use for another part of the area. Once you understand the mechanics, the games starts going faster.OVERALL:This game is not for everyone. I loved it because it was different and I don’t like my hand being held. I liked the idea that they used pictures for what to do instead of words. I’m usually the type of person that doesn’t go with everyone else. So try it out first and this game may surprise you			"

												Violett bridges the gap between classic point&click and the causal gaming 'busy picture' genre, and tries to make more use of touch functionality doing so.The art is fantastic, the story bits are funny and contain great humor. The character design is one really neat piece (I love that snails :D), and the fantasy-setting Violett finds herself in is a refreshing approach to the genre. There are one or two translation errors in the found diary pages, but since they are 'only' flavortext, this does not matter much. The puzzles are nicely tailored and make sense most of the time, but this is where my ranting starts.The logic of the riddles is not very consistant leaving the player to simply grab unreachable objects by magic in one case, and completely ignoring this ability in another, similar case. Also there are some timing-based riddles, where you need to hit the right spot at the right time. The Bossfight - just so much: collect as much of those 'orbs' as possible, you will need them.Especially the 'dynamic' puzzles and the 'swipe' mechanic might feel pretty alien to someone who is used to point and clicks, but I recon it a worthy experiment.All in all the game is not as frustrating as it seems to be, it's not too short… just a nice, and really sweet looking short story.It's absolutely charming, neatly drawn, and certainly worth your money if you like dream-like fantasy, insect kingdoms, 'shrunken characters', busy-picture games, magic, fairies, or just quirky non-mainstream art.

												I mostly liked this game, except for the last portion of the game when it suddenly turned into a platformer. The battle itself was not complicated or difficult but the lack of explanation on how to utilize your powers made it very difficult. The game uses picture hints but that makes it quite difficult in a first time battle setting that also happens to be the final and only boss character. The puzzles were challenging and the level designs were pretty nice. It was hard to click on a few things and I can see some people getting frustrated with figuring out what the picture instructions/hints mean. There was a decent amount of world building in the game through these loose pages that you can find that are like a beastiary of the different characters you come across. Those were entertaining. The general plot had some holes and you just never have an explanations. Like why things are happening, why the bug queen is evil, what's with the jewels, why is the necklace in her dresser.  "

												Forever Entertainment S. A. - Oh yeah, that's a weird developer - makes games, that on Store are brilliant, but inside actual game - it's too frustrating.Our protagonist doesn't speak... literally, if she can't do anything, she just do some mumbling, which is annoying. There are some orbs to find - that's totally bad aspect of the game, in my opinion...Storyline - was probably made to create base atmosphere - because it's grotesque world...There is a lot of clicking... from going from place A to B... because there is something like ""puzzle hub"" between parts of levels... yeah, you need to backtrack sometimes, which is not cool!Edit: Tracks used in this game are really good piece of music...PS: Bugs (and I don't mean animals).

												Violett is a pont & click adventure game with beautiful graphics and music. It's not story driven like most games in this genre, you have to discover what to do by wandering through the scenes and trying to solve the enigms.Unfortunately, developers are still ironing out some bugs and improving some enigms. I would thus give it a 6 or 7/10 waiting for the game to be fully polished.			"

												Stuningly colorful and full of vision and climate. Dificulty seems to be set on ""as hard as it gets"", so gameplay is quite satisfactory. Evolutionary step forth in development of point and click adventures. To make my point: GRAT GAME			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed the puzzle aspect of the game!  I did encounter some frustration and had to restart the game because I did a part of the puzzle before I was suppose to.  A key element of the puzzle disappeared that was to help me out.   It is a quick game you can do it in a day.  There are limited resources of walkthroughs or outside help but I did find one that helped a lot.  The hints mechanism to me really wasn't much of help and to move some items from side to side or up and down was at times hard to grasp and led to frustration levels sparking.    Take your time with this game, it is quite fun.			"

												My only wish is that we would see a return of Violett, because this game was as fun as it was beautiful. The art is fun and whimsical and I really enjoyed the puzzles. They made me think without being overly frustrating. Outside of two minor bugs that were fixed quickly, this game was worth every penny. If there is another point and click made by the same devs, I need it.			"

												I enjoyed this game a lot. The music and graphics are nice and most of the puzzles are fun.But it seemed to me kind of unfinished. It is very short and as stated before, at that point were you think it's starting, it ends.I've played it through in under seven hours and was very dissapointed with the ending. Also it lacked story for my taste.I would recommend it, if it's on sale and for people who just enjoy the whimsical world (like me). For those on the search for logical, well thought out point and click it's not the right choice.			"

												A colorful yet odd little point n' click style adventure that shamelessly steals its character design from the Coraline movie.  Very quirky and unintuitive with some annoying backtracking.  There doesn't seem to be a lot of rhyme or reason to many of its elements.  There really wasn't anything in this game compelling enough to make me play beyond the first few screens.  No realy story, no real cohesion to its elements that bring it all together.  Mostly just a lot of random stuff thrown together that makes litte, if any, sense.  The puzzles can be neat, but often unituitive trial and error with some major pixel hunting involved.  Appear to be an almost direct port of a mobile game.			"

												This game needs a lot of work. With multiple grammar issues in the diary pages, a lackluster storyline, unworkable controls, and several disruptive bugs, Violett is certainly a game that needs vast improvement. However, It shows potential and eventually can grow to the level of other memorable point-and-click adventure games. I would not recommend buying this game at the stage it is in right now, but in the future (after plenty of updates) this game could be a good experience. It's just not worth the money at this point in time.			"

												I've only played the first few screens, but this is already one of the most frustrating adventure games I've ever played. First, the puzzles so far make no sense. I understand that this is a dream world, but (spoiler alert) how does trapping a fly in a bottle mean that the giant teacup will stop shooting steam at me when I try to leave the room? Also, the controls are terrible. Most of the puzzles involve grabbing things onto things and moving them in different directions. This sounds great, except that the objects often do not react in expected ways, making it very frustrating to get the puzzles right even when you know exactly what to do. Finally, I've run into several annoying bugs that I fixed by saving and reloading my game. On the bright side, the sound track really is amazing. It might be worth the $7 alone.			"

I liked the sound, graphics and storyline. The puzzles were fun.I didn't like the lack of a record of your tasks. The picture explanations were ok in the main, but on occassion they weren't clear and on one occassion I could not get the NPC to repeat the instruction which was a pain because I had been distracted the first time and half missed it. The only other thing I wasn't a fan of was the ending; it jarred with the rest of the game IMO.Although it looks like I disliked more than I liked from the above I'm glad I bought and played it. It took me about eight hours to play through it. But for the price of a pint I think that's ok.			"

												A classic point and click game with some interesting uses of 3D, Violett is amazingly beautiful, full of haunting music that will soothe you when you want to rage over the insane puzzles. The visuals are obviously a labor of love, the characters silly but interesting, and there are tons of interactions and little easter eggs to find, without feeling like a cheesy hidden object game.  The lack of speech or text works, but having nothing but a symbol or two for a hint can definitely leave you lost. If you enjoy brain-bending logic puzzles that are usually pretty fair for the world they're in, this is your game. I don't think I met one puzzle that I felt was completely stupid, just lots that were a little too complicated or where I had been right but clicking slightly off. It's not an unqualified approval, however.Now for what's broken: I'm not 100% sure that all the earth globes are actually there. I've even tried following a globe walkthrough and got nothin'. The achievements are bugged; the wardrobe one doesn't trigger no matter how many times I change, and other people have lots of trouble getting a particular puzzle's achievement. The full journal one actually triggers BEFORE I get all the pages, as soon as I get the last page, in fact. (I went back and found more that I'd missed.) It crashed 4-5 times, mostly in the beginning, but the autosaves kept that from being a big deal.			"

												I bought this game because it looked like a gorgeous point and click adventure game that I could play when I wanted something that was a little more relaxed than some of my other games. What I got was 3 hours of frustration that got me no where.There is no direction. Occasionally little thought bubbles pop up to help you, but if you miss them they won't pop back up. If you get stuck too long there are supposed to be hints...but usually they were either completely unhelpful, or it was an action that you couldn't do just yet, or I'd miss it all together because if you're not paying attention you won't notice the faint sparkle that indicates your target. There are also sheets of with notes about some of the characters you seem to run into...but they fail to include any information on how to get past them. Then, when you finally think you've figured it out, the actions don't always work, or they require you just clicking repeatedly until they do what they should. I had only made it as far as the second room when attempting to control a buzzing fly drove me nearly insane with clicking.You collect little stones but have no idea why. There's a little animation that appears in the corner sometimes indicating I should move my mouse side to side? I think? But I have no idea why. I'm not sure if it's a hint or what. Having no idea why seemed to be the theme generally. On top of all this, the game was glitchy and had to be restarted a couple of times because all my actions froze, which I know was an issue with my friend playing as well. I love a good challenge, but randomly clicking all over a screen hoping something will happen is just frustrating and left me wanting my money back.			"

												This game is very, very frustrating. I am a seasoned adventure game player. I dont mind hard puzzles as long as they are fair. This game has very badly designed puzzles. You have no idea what you are doing because the doodle instructions are vague and unclear, and disappear quickly from the screen when you are trying to deipher them. The game feels pointless and meandering. Puzzles are solved by luck and trial and error which defeats the purpose and ruins the fun in my book. I regret the purchase in spite of its pretty looks. It's rare for me to just give up on a puzzle game but this was just too boring and annoying.			"

Pros:1. Great art work.2. The Trading cards on offer are currently selling at a very high price on market.Cons:1. There is always lag when you click because of the character animations. So you cannot click twice or thrice quickly because the character animations need to complete after each click. This makes the whole experience a very frustrating one.2. There are many puzzles requiring quick clicking rather than intelligent solution. Combine it with the lag pointed above and you have the complete recipe for frustration.3. There are many instances when your click don't register because the click activation zone for an object doesn't match the artwork of the object itself. So if you have rod object, it has the same click activation zone as a balloon object. So clicking at one end of the rod object doesn't register a click.Verdict: 2/5 for me. Not recommended at current price.			"

												Violett has nice artwork and music. It is fun and challenging. There are a few puzzles where the lack of any dialogue makes it hard to understand what's going on, but it's mostly OK, and there are walkthroughs available anyway. Unfortunately, I ran into a bug 2/3 of the way through the game that made it unplayable-- whenever I load my save file the screen appears super ""zoomed in"" and I cannot play. From the forums it looks like at least 2 other people complained about this bug, on both Windows and Mac platforms. I was playing this game with my daughter and it is very disappointing for us that we have to stop 2/3 of the way through now. I hope the developers can fix this.			"

												It's very pretty and has potential, but should not have been released yet.  Game breaking bugs.  I got to a puzzle in a room/cave with an old turtle where what looks like a 4 level combination lock built into a stalagmite; that you are clearly supposed to turn in a certain combination to line up the gold squares, except it would not let me turn it left at all.  The in game clues clearly show it turns both ways, and after even looking at youtube walkthroughs to prove I wasn't crazy, and trying for almost an hour to no avail, the dials only turned right no what combination of eldritch mouse movements, clicks, and curses I tried.  So that was game over for me.   Hella LAME.A shame tho, I was really getting into it.   Otherwise, the controls needed work.  Too much ""mouse icon overlap""    Whatever, I'm too butthurt about the bug that ended it for me to give a fair review anyway			"

												The game is beautiful. But the logic behind the puzzles"" is illogical.  Everything is difficult, simply because the solutions are so far from any classic point n click logic, that it's very frustrating.  For example, there is a puzzle which involves water and pipes.  Violett must activate valves to flow water.  But nowhere is there an indication where the source comes from to know which valve does what. Narrowing down what I thought would be the source pipe, turning valves in certain directions doesn't match with other combinations.  I had give in and use a guide.In a nutshell, this game is impossible without a walkthrough.Story progression is messy and lazy. Off the start, we have no idea why Violett is in her ""Wonderland"".  I almost thought I missed a cutscene.  Violett meets all these characters which have no personality, and somehow as the player, you're supposed to want to solve their convoluted problems. But you don't know why they want help or have any interest.  You just want to get the puzzle done to see more of the game.  Then there's the completely pointless hidden object mechanic.  You can locate hidden orbs throughout the game - which I'm sure do nothing except give you an achievement - no idea.Oh yes, there's the hint system.  The pathetic hint system - which is a puzzle itself trying to figure what the hand-drawn sketch mean exactly is more frustrating than rewarding.  And it's timed.  You'll find yourself clicking the hint button numerous times, just to get a long enough view of what the picture is supposed to represent.Such a promising notion - a game with gorgeous visuals and abysmal logic design.  As a fan of Monkey Island, Torrin's Passage, King's Quest, Grim Fandango, Toonstruck, Day of the Tentacle, etc, Violett simply sucks.The major basic reason Violett fails as a game, is that you puzzles are neither interesting or rewarding. You just want to see get them over with to ""see"" more of the game.I couldn't finish the game.  Sadly, this game has multiple bugs.  I came to a part called ""Clock Tree"" or ""Tree Clock"", I can't remember. But the game broke.  Violett is supposed to get 3 corks from a black ant.  But the ant and cork have disappeared from the game.  Numerous people have reported this same glitch, and supposedly a game patch came out before I purchased the game to fix this.  Well, it's still broken.  And since the game uses auto-save, apparently the only fix for me to restart the game.  Well, that's not going to happen.  I hope this review helps you avoid this broken game. "

												I was very disappointed. This is billed as a point and click game but it is a point and shake, point and drag, and point and shake then quickly click on another point before it's too late game. Even the walkthrough shows multiple attempts at an early part of the game because you need to move the mouse just so and to be very quick. If like me you're using a touchpad, that part is pretty much unplayable.			"

												Don't let the red thumb discourage you, I really enjoyed this game. -The art styles are amazing, except for Violett herself, which leads me to believe that they threw her in a point-and-click-adventure game that they were already working on. Seriously, her walk animation looks really silly on some of the paths that they make her take. This is also shown by orbs that are hidden in each scene that don't give the ""clickable"" mouse when you hover over them, which is the general basis of their replayability: to find all these orbs.-The music is also well done; it had quite the catchy main theme and enough tracks to have a different song for each area. -The puzzles not making any sense actually makes sense in the context of the game, as you are a young girl lost in a fantacy world where things really shouldn't make sense. This however, like stated by many of these other reviews, does not create a healthy game environment as a lot of the time you are just clicking objects randomly until the pieces start to ""fit"" together. To be honest, I only flew right through the first puzzle only because I watched a gameplay demo before playing, however, I was quite tied up on the next room and it took me nearly an hour to figure it out. The only reason I didn't stop there is because I'm a little biased towards it for its resemblence of Coraline, which I absolutely loved.-The thing I hated most about this game was the minimalistic gameplay, which is expected in a point-and-click adventure game, but this one was even more so. There were only a handful of mini-game puzzles and a couple times where you were timed on your actions, but outside of that, a lot of the time it's just you watching Cor... Violett walk across the screen to where you clicked only to watch her shake her head in shame. But even this didn't come close to how frustrating the end was. It looked like they had created an entire mini-game based around you actually fighting the main antagonist in the game (which really can't be called that because you don't really know it's the antagonist unless you read the flavor-text diary pages) but cut it out last minute and decided to turn it into a ""cutscene"" by having (spoiler) Violett defeat it in ONE throw of a fireball. JUST ONE ATTACK DEFEATS IT, AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN GET TO DO IT! It was the biggest let down I have ever experienced in a game before, the devs laughing like, ""oh you wanted to do this? Too bad!"". I'm probably exagurating this too much, as they probably just didn't have the time/will to script the battle scene, which is sad because it looked really fun.-I didn't run into any glitches that the other reviewers mention, however, there was a point where it seemed like it when she was on a ladder. Other than that, the game ran through it's scenes pretty well.TL;DR: Great art, seems like it was supposed to be a different game, terrible ending, hard to get into, great for any Coraline/Alice in Wonderland fan if they're persistant.

												You will love Violett if you enjoy having no indication of what is going on at all times. If you like that, than by all means have at it. Personally, I get enough of that in my day-to-day life.When the game indicates what you should be doing (or where the puzzle even begins) it is so subtle that I don’t realize it until I’ve accidentally triggered the next step of the puzzle, e.g. “Oh! That’s why it’s a mouse and cat!”If the game developers implemented a little bit of character dialog to shed light on why actions don’t work, a tad more plot to explain the fantastic scenes, and more indication in the game mechanics on what is actionable (for example, it’s unclear what you need to drag backpack items to), I think it would be great! The puzzles are original and the art is lovely. Maybe I’m just too much of a dunce for Violett.			"

												It is unfortunate, but this game looks much better on the store than in actual movement.While the scenery and character design are first rate, 3d modeling and animation leaves plenty to be desired, perhaps the developers should have tried doing the entire thing in 2d since their ilustrator were clearly very talented.The biggest problem this game has is the lack of narrative. While I can apreciate their attempt to tell a story with no actual dialogue, they werent thorough enough to give me any idea what the hell was going on after the game's intro. I was unable to understand Violett as a character or feel any sort of empathy for her.In the beggining of the game, it was pretty much impossible to get trough the puzzles without hints, as the first few ""rooms"" you are presented with make no sense whatsoever, it's like trying to logic your way out of a fever dream.Also, navigating an Escher maze to get trough the first 4 or so rooms? HATED IT SO MUCH MY BLOOD BOILS AT THE MEMORY.So, uh, no, if you are a fan of pont and click adventures, look elsewere. This is a great graphical piece anchored down by terrible writting and design.			"

												Violett is a point and click adventure game. It's story is told through your actions as violett, and the game's imagery(mostly without words, the diary pages being the exception). This is a really cool concept, letting the player discover the story through the gameplay and not the other way around. However even with the games very pleasant artwork, and smooth animations The game struggles. The puzzles are very unintuitive, and the game carries very little direction for the player to follow. Most of the time spent in the game is wandering aimlessly around trying to figure out what to do next. A puzzle's hardness should not be defined by it's lack of clarity, in an attempt to elongate game time. Most point and click games have some amount of vagueness to them, but this one kind of takes it to a new level. There is a pretty generous hint system in the game, but you shouldn't NEED that hint system to progress. Other than walking around and solving some puzzles you have the ability to collect colored orbs, which is less optional then the game lets on. These little orbs are power for your abilities that you will need to fight the final boss. So if you spent the game ignoring them and ou get to the end, you'll find yourself having to do a lot of backtracking to tediously comb over completed areas. It can be a bit fun looking for the little trap doors, or moving objects to find them, but several of them are behind immovable scenery and are effectively invisible. Meaning unless you get lucky clicking around, or pick up a guide you won't find them. There is also no real way to know if you've found all the orbs in one area, making the whole thing a bit difficult for no real reason.My last big gripe against the game are the glitches. The controls aren't great, so sometimes you end up getting stuck in one spot and are unable to leave that spot (I got stuck in the library next to the weather book, and a few other places where my icons just dissapeared, looking for orbs).I immediately went to quit the game without realizing that even though I had saved in another slot, it would continue to auto save over my manual save, leaving me trapped on the book case unable to do anything. I had to start over. It was partially my fault for not being more careful, but if you're going to force players to re-search areas having glitches like that are pretty annoying.On the positive side I found the art very pleasing, And the diary pages' snippets of inhabitant lore very cool. Those two elements very clearly had a lot of hard work and love put into them.Overall, I don't recommend the game, because pretty art, and tidbits of interesting lore don't make up for the gameplay it lacked.TLDR; Pros: nice artwork, some cool world lore.Cons: unintuitive puzzles and gameplay, lots of wandering around aimlessly, Hard-to-find-for-no-reason orbs, lots of backtracking to pad the game, glitches that may cause you to restart entirely.

												As you can tell, I didn't get that far.Game just didn't grab me.I like point n click games, this is just one of them that I don't like. This game just makes me want to play Monkey Island again.It's... not even a BAD game. It's just not one I foresee myself ever playing ever again. I looked at the game, and the graphics weren't nearly charming enough to make me keep playing. That's what happened. I had no fun, I clicked things, nothing interesting happened.Maybe one day I'll actually play it all the way through. For now I'm rating it down, because I was expecting to be thrilled by a fascinating new universe - instead I feel disappointed. I was promised a gorgeous world.Some people have mentioned it was made for mobile devices. If so I absolutely see what's wrong: there's nothing for me to gawk at.Bastion was a bright and vibrant game too, with graphics I found far more charming. And that was completely 2D. That's what Violett should have been in the first place: entirely 2D with entirely hand-drawn animations and art. The guys who made this game seem to pride themselves on that, so lets see some more of it. 3D models that look this poor are just unappealing to look at. I'm not whining about the quality of graphics. I'm not saying it needs to be in Unreal Engine 4 with godrays and cel-shading. I'm not saying everything needs to be a 300,000 polygon model with 4096x4096 textures or anything. I just wish that they'd stuck with one thing. Stretched out on my desktop, this game just doesn't look good.Monkey Island still looks good, it's charming, funny, and has voice acting on every character, leading the world to feel far more alive than it would otherwise - for instance, in Violett.Maybe this genre should stay dead.

												Violett, while I like the idea, and it has a basic wonderland everything has gone mad vibe to it. I liked the art (except the noses in the cut-scene but I got over it), the normal game art was beautiful. I tried so hard to like it, I really did, but it left me bored and wanting it to end. I didn't care if Violett saw her parents again, or if she even made it out of there. I just wanted to stop all of the tediously boring 'puzzles' if you can even call them that. It's a very vague game that gives you no direction. If your not lucky you'll have to do even more mind numbing, slow, backtracking just to get things done, and are lucky if you know what you're doing before doing it. It has an unspoken, glimpse of a story that's easy to forget in the chaos, no dialog which would of helped instead of nonsensical noises with vague thought bubbles. It's a point and click that I hope I'll never click again. In my view, only play if you have nothing good to do or play and only buy when it's on sale and there's some money burning a hole in your pocket. Before you think maybe I just haven't played a point and click before, I have, I loved Deponia, but this is a magicarp using splash in comparison. I'm being a little bitter sweet here, but it just was a heavy, time consuming disappointment for me.			"

												As far as puzzle games go, this wasn't the best I've played. The 3D models don't match the background nor do they interact well. There are a few visual glitches as well. I'm not certain I like the mumble talk and the diary pages have spelling mistakes. There isn't much of a story which is a shame and it is rather short. This game has a lot of potential but it is lacking. The music is beautiful, the backgrounds are fantastic, the puzzles are straightforward, and although I did enjoy playing Violett, I cannot bring myself to recommend it. It's good but it needs more.

												Overly complicated with touchy controls (Like swinging the cage right at the start). Its the basic premise to the vast amount of the content within the game, its less logical steps and more click everything until you can find how to advance.I went in expecting something better and ended up dissapointed, the person I bought it for liked it even less.

												I liked the demo, and so did my 5 year old who is a great little gamer (sometimes better than me!) so we bought the game for 9.99. Well, the game is cute enough, and the worlds are trippy and surreal. And thats about it for the positives. The characters dont speak, they just mumble jibberish, so its hard to figure out what you are supposed to do, let alone what the whole backstory/game narrative even is.  I never finished the game, I got stuck halfway throught the game and clicked everything and followed directions on every board to no avail. As an expeienced gamer who has played hundreds in the point and click genre, this one was very disappionting. It wasn't horrible, but definitely was a waste of money for me. I've bought way better games for less.			"

												I agree with the other 'not recommended' review points in that the way the game elements are put together was just too obscure to allow me to engage with the game early on.  A good example being the power of telekenesis, the use of which is not at all clear until you start waving the mouse pointer around and seeing how the icon changes.  The lack of guidance adds to the frustration as does the lack of description for the inventory items aquired.I am disappointed because the graphics and music are nicely polished.  Maybe if the problem elements were ever redesigned I would revisit it.  A great premise from the intro which sadly turned into a frustrating experience.			"

												Okay... there's one very good point I will give this game, and that that it's absolutely gorgeous and imaginative. A true piece of art. If you're looking for an abstract painting (you'll recognise its inspiration, such as MC Esher), but that you can interact with a little, than you've found something you'll like. Otherwise I have many grippes with this game. After less than an hour it was too annoying and I couldn't keep playing.First off, the interaction system is wayyy too clunky. I much prefer the good ol' verb-based system : push, pull, take, talk, etc. Here you have to actually pull stuff by making very specific motion with your mouse. And because of this, it took me the longest time to get out of the cage at the beginning. After clicking furiously all around the screen, after having poked and pulled at the paperclip to no effect I was about to give up already. Then I just went crazy on it, moving my mouse all around, and it finally fell. My only thought was : ARE YOUR SERIOUS?So yeah, this isn't nearly as intuitive nor as charming as Monkey Island, unfortunatly. The few characters there are only speak with speech bubbles and gibberish. This would be fine if their message was interesting, but they are only boring. Yes, the characters are pretty much untinteresting at best, shallow and blank at worst. Even the main character is weird and uncharacterised. He/she never speaks, you don't really know anything about him/her except that his/her parents moved in a new house and she is pulled into this miniature dimension. It would of added a lot to have given him/her an actual voice, so he/she could give his/her thoughts about the strange world he/she got into. The puzzles themselves seem very contrived and strange, which follows the style of the world. I guess I'm just not smart enough, but I honestly couldn't solve most of them. The problem being, I didn't even know what the problems were most of the time. One room I solved out of pure luck, distracting an evil teapot with a fly I randomly captured in a bottle. Half the time I just looked, scratching my head, trying to understand what I was looking at. If the character could at least of given me a hint or something to identify what I needed to do it would of helped. Unfortunatly, after seeing all the strange rooms and not making any progress, I decided to stop playing. Now you might decipher the cryptic solutions to these rooms, connected by a kind of MC Escher maze, but I wasn't enjoying it so I couldn't be bothered. The last straw was a room where a firework kept firing in an endless loop of ear-destroying pain, while I got posed by a piece-swapping puzzle to this noise. NO THANKS. I'M OUT.So yeah. Very pretty game, but mechanically too frustrating. If you're the type, like me, to enjoy artsy visuals, than I recommend this. Otherwise, if you want a well put together point n' click game, look elsewhere. Unless its on sale for very cheap. If you want a number, I'll give it a 6.5, 5 points for excellent visuals plus 1.5 for playability. It just couldn't pull me in (pun intented).			"

												While the concept of this game is interesting, the gameplay is not.  It is a point-and-click adventure with no direction whatsoever.  And by this, I'm not talking about hand-holding - I still have no idea what I am supposed to be doing in this game, and very little idea on how to actually do it.  There seems to be no rhyme or reason as to what you are able to interact with and what you are not, which would be okay if it weren't for the several second delay after trying to interact with something you aren't able to interact with.  Overall, I would not reccomend this game.			"

												Less than an hour in. The poor animation at the beginning establishes a very basic plot that really does nothing to establish the game's narrative. Why does Violett have to go to some old house? She finds a necklace, but then is in some fairy prison? It didn't take me long to decide that I didn't even really like her very much, and the ""dialogue"" screeches (in the style of Link) were irritating. As far as gameplay, I'm not a fan of point-and-click, so that certainly affects my experience with the game, but even so these puzzles seemed particularly unintuitive. You have to capture the fly instead of just taking the cork and stopping up the kettle's spout? The little wooden cat and mouse leave the screen to return with a matchstick, but not the wooden dogs? So the Jawsome Beaver hates soap, so why aren't I looking for some soap instead of a raft (that he ends up eating anyway)? Alice's Wonderland had a wonderful logic to it (a caucus race is good exercise: to dry off, try a good dry lecture): this doesn't. I don't have the patience to click all over the screen, anyway. Graphics are nice but not memorable (not in the way Trine is, or Papo y Yo). No thanks, I'll pass. 4/10.			"

												If you are a fan of classic point-and-click adventure games, then Violett will satisfy.  It's a traditional game with a simple structure and puzzles that are challenging without being overly frustrating.  In an era of revitalizations of classic genres and reboots of the great titles of yesterday, Violett is a combination of modern art design, and genre-traditional gamepay.  The little touches in level design and the way the story is silently told make this another entry in the recent trend of games that has been creating artistic statement in the narrative by embedding the story in the gameplay.  Violett is a lovely new entry in a series of titles that are taking gaming into a new more artistically-mature direction alongside games like Limbo, Braid and, more recently, Gone Home and The Stanley Parable.

It's short, lacks flow of movement in certain moments, annoying controls (bad port from tablets, maybe?) and quite short with unimaginative riddles (mainly about click here or there). The story is way too simple and uninteresting.All in all, buy it only for a day of fun and cheaply. Polish team, still a few things to be learned in games production ;-)			"

												I don't even understand why people are complaining. My 9-year old son and I played this through. It has a lot of charming rooms and if you just give it some time, the answers will come to you. I truly loved this game and I was sad when it ended. Also, the characters are wonderful, like an alternative Wonderland. Thumbs up !			"

												Well. The game's art is great and so is the music. For some reason the main character is the worst looking thing in the game.Violett moves to a spooky house in the country with her parents. She seems unhappy about it. In her room she discovers a magical amulet in a mouse hole. This takes her to a magical world of fairies and bugs. Think Coraline with a lighter tone and more colours.This game is incredibly frustrating in many ways. Some times it's hard to know where you can walk because of the layout of the map. Some times this is solved by the creators by putting an arrow in the landscape, so I guess they realised their error and fixed it an easy way. The clickables sometimes changes the mousecursor to an 'available action' hand, some times not.As a completelist I haven't been this frustrated about collectibles since as long as I can remember. The orbs are sometimes easy to spot, some times can only been seen from certain angles, sometimes actually invisible. Some of the hidden places are the same way; some easy to spot some you will only see in a guide.If you miss the orbs or diary page in the first room, there is no way to go back and you'll have to start a new game if you want the completist achievements. There is also a bug that happens sometimes where Violett will get stuck for no reason and you'll have to exit and load game to fix it. As far as I can tell from internet searches and guides I collected all the diary pages needed for the achievement, yet I did not get it.The voiceacting. I don't mind gibberish-language games, but some of the voices in this game is just plain annoying. And ofcourse the one you'll hear the most, Violett, is the most annoying of them all. The sound Violett makes when she tells you she can't do whatever action you tried to make her do, is one of the most annoying sounds ever and you feel severely punished for not clicking everything perfectly. Add to this that it's impossible to turn off the sound effects; you can only turn it down to level 1/10. All of this makes it 100% necessary to use a guide at all times, which always makes the game less fun. Violett collects pages from her uncle's diary throughout the game, but nothing is told by the game of who the uncle is, how and why he was in the same world Violett discovered.I bought this on 85% off and suffered 10 hours of frustration as I didn't want it to drag down my achievement collection % and always hoping that the game would improve. Turns out I still can't complete everything. Not worth.			"

												If you are a fan of classic point-and-click adventure games, then Violett will satisfy.  It's a traditional game with a simple structure and puzzles that are challenging without being overly frustrating.  In an era of revitalizations of classic genres and reboots of the great titles of yesterday, Violett is a combination of modern art design, and genre-traditional gamepay.  The little touches in level design and the way the story is silently told make this another entry in the recent trend of games that has been creating artistic statement in the narrative by embedding the story in the gameplay.  Violett is a lovely new entry in a series of titles that are taking gaming into a new more artistically-mature direction alongside games like Limbo, Braid and, more recently, Gone Home and The Stanley Parable.

												So I have to say that this game had everything it needed to be great! But it didn't follow through. There were some solid maps and puzzles but most of it was just nonsense. The logic in the puzzles for some of it was just not there and the ones that you could follow were too easy.NO FAST MOVE. I spent more time in this game walking then I did playing. Never fun. No Actual words in English. I am sure that if I understood the Spanish or French (not caring what it was) It would have been slightly better because the clues would have made more sense. BUT no. I don't care how lazy you are but subtitles when creatures talk would not only make things make sense but actually keep me from being bored. Sorry but there was no story here. There was a facade that wanted to be a story but really no.In the end, it was a ""this is tedious back and forth to the point where it takes no skill and isn't fun"". It is more trial and error than anything. Good thing I only paid 99 cents.  Not Recommended, if you want a real game try Broken Age. That was amazing and makes this look like trash.Positives (that the bad points ruined):Interesting dimentions to the 2d worldColorfull and RichMusic was orchistrated			"

												This was my first forray into the hidden game concept, and I loved it.  Violett has great artwork and an intrigueing storyline.  I love playing adventure games, and thought this one looked pretty.  But after I discovered it was a hidden game and that meant I had to play the game to find all the little things I was hooked.			"

												Plus for Polish team (sense of patriotism :) ) and for colourful graphics. Apart from that there isn't much to tell about this game. It's short, lacks flow of movement in certain moments, annoying controls (bad port from tablets, maybe?) and quite short with unimaginative riddles (mainly about click here or there). The story is way too simple and uninteresting.All in all, buy it only for a day of fun and cheaply. Polish team, still a few things to be learned in games production ;-)			"

												For my First Review of 2015, the first game I've passed in 2015: ViolettViolett is a very pretty game. The Backgrounds are lovely, colourful & have an Alice in Wonderland meets Honey I shrunk the kids sort of charm. It is a point and click adventure with a cute story waiting to get out.Unfortunately the story never really does get out. There is little narrative in any form of presentation, verbal or non verbal and even less direction. The titular young girl has some telekinetic powers which seem to be limited to the very specific items the creators did not feel like animating while other times you can practically reach an item you need but have to float a ladder over to it to climb up and retrieve it. Where are her mind powers there? The other abilities are only used to bypass a couple of road-block hazards which themselves are only blocking collection items. One of these skills is a floating power, kind of a limited flight, which is only used in maybe three instances and yet in the many other situations where it would be a big help in reaching some place it is somehow imposable for her to use.If this had been part platformer these abilities would have been a lot of fun to play with but as it stands they seem to be just tacked on to again cut down on animation.That said I, having studied animation myself, understand how much time and tedium can be involved in seeming simple motions so I do not blame the creators for that trick. Pros : Easy to pick up and play          Pretty to look at          Often available for next to nothing.Cons: Like a lot of point and click games, the puzzles are less about intellect and more about noticing what piece of the background is a different shade or makes the arrow become a hand.          Little story development.          A lot of very slow moving to and from-ing. Pick it up on sale if you like point and click, don't if you don't			"

												Cute little fairy-tale point-and-click with lots of character and atmosphere, plagued by lackluster design, time-wasting mechanics, and a few bugs. Definitely worth a playthrough for its charm and worth the 10 bucks for the soundtrack alone.[Story]In this game you play a disenfranchised teenage girl who gets shrunk down to bug size and teleported into a magical world ruled by an evil spider (although we only really have the game's word for it). [Puzzles/game design]The puzzles are pretty much self-contained in each room and most of them can be figured out with some logic. The ones that can't be figured out by logic can be either figured out with some patient trial-and-error, or by using the pretty well designed hint system. The puzzles are pretty straightforward and fairly simple, but they are more logical and less dumb than those of, for instance, Deponia, or Broken Age. There are some unnecessarily long animations and walking sequences that cannot be skipped and sometimes have to be repeated as part of a puzzle. This felt very much like padding and is the game's worst sin.[Bugs]The game is plagued by the occasional bug, for instance Violett sometimes simply won't enter a door you click on or interact with an object. This can be solved by a simple save and quit. I was able to play the game from beginning to end without much of a hitch, load-times are fast. I didn't mind it and since the game is clearly on an indy budget it can be forgiven.[Art design and atmosphere]The main appeal of this game is its charm. It feels like a somewhat dark fairy-tale with a good dose of humor. The art-pieces are very compelling, varied, and invoke a sense of wonder. It is well drawn and animated. The world is densely populated with a variety of cute and amusing creatures. For instance, there are a hookah smoking caterpillar and a tuxedo wearing cockroach. Throughout the world are strewn pages of ""uncle's bestiary"" which make for a compelling read and I found myself going out of my way to find and read them all, even though I usually don't have the patience to read anything, especially not when playing a game. Some puzzles feel a little like a Rube-Goldberg machine, adding to the charm. [Sound]The star of the show is the soundtrack, which is absolutely magical. The sound design (done by the composer of the music as well) is strong and really helps solidify the already charming atmosphere created by the visual art pieces and animations.[Bottom line]The game gets way more flack than it deserves. The puzzles are more logical and less mindless than those of the average point-and-click adventure. The bugs are obnoxious but not game-breaking as are the sometimes overlong animations. It has more charm and more refined humor than most point-and-clicks out there and you will be listening to the soundtrack non-stop for days. I might replay this game from the start just to take in the atmosphere again. "

												I was rather disappointed when the game went from this charming art to this glitchy and rather unappealing animation, but I decided to go through with it in any case. The game is rather frustrating, but it was enjoyable enough, though I'd suggest buying it on saleThe story was simple with a whimsical charm, and it was really just an okay game, not great, just okayThe main thing I'd genuinely love to see changed is the ending  the ending fight with the queen is frustrating and annoying, I hated it the entire time and it took me a week to do because I kept having to stop and de-stress myself before trying again. It was the worst part of the game at a point where you need to leave a good impression on the player . I couldn't enjoy the ending sequence because I was just full of frustration towards this section  "

												I'm not a huge fan of this game. I really like the style and the art, however there are puzzles that were near impossible (which is okay) but also repetitive. I don't mind spending a while trying to figure out something, but I do when it's no fun because you keep having to do and try the same things over and over again. Most of the times it also has no story and you have no idea what you're doing and why.Don't get me wrong, I generally kind of enjoyed playing - it's not a terrible game - I just wouldn't recommend buying it.
