												The game has a wonderful atmosphere aided by astonishing visuals, excellent soundtrack and a very incredible overall art style. The puzzle mechanics are unique and although they rely on one specific mechanic, the additional elements keep up the challenge and introduce new ways of thinking into every new level visited.So why the negative review? Because this particular *puzzle* game relies heavily on twitch reflexes. A puzzle game should be something you play to use your brain, not your shooter skills and hand-eye coordination. And this plagues the vast majority of the game, including each and every bonus level. Sadly, after a time (and lots and lots of resets on one level because you just missed the strict time limit) all the fun and challenge turns into nothing but pure frustration and anger, which is a clear indicator when a game fails to be a game.The main levels are worth a few bucks for the design and the utterly charming narrative that tells a funny, yet somewhat bittersweet story, but for hardcore puzzle gamers and achievement hunters I advise against buying this title.

												If you like your games to be challenging with lots of content then this one is a good one for you. I've owned it for a couple of years now and I keep coming back to it every couple of months to try beating my own score on the unlockable timed levels. Every time I come back to the game I am reminded of why I love it even though at times it can touch the nerve that induces my nerd rage. It's casual to an extent, with dynamic and beautiful art work, and while the first couple of levels ease you into the gameplay nicely, you will quickly learn why I call this game challenging. Any game I can open up and have fun with two years later is well worth the few bucks. Happy Pie Hunting.			"

												A short, fantastic 2D puzzle game where you play the protaganist P.B Winterbottom who is trying to eat all the pies he can find while chasing after the giant mystical pie of his dreams. With beautifully done artwork and a wonderful story expressed through poetry, this game is definitely worth playing! I thoroughly enjoyed the puzzles which use various time-based mechanics. The puzzles are of easy-medium difficulty with also some time and recording challenges, making it enjoyable for everyone.Pros:+ Fun storyline told through poetry+ Beautiful hand-drawn artwork+ interesting puzzles that use time-based mechanics+ Bonus shorts add extra time and recording challenges+ Controller support+ AchievementsCons:- Quite a short game- Would definitely have benefitted from workshop support for user made levelsMy Score: 7/10			"

												Warning: The Steam overlay causes frequent crashes in this game for me so I would recommend disabling it for this game.Hiding under one of the stranger titles on Steam is a rather unique puzzle game styled after silent movies.  Your goal: To collect pie.  Lots and lots of pie.  While the mechanics are easy to learn, the game quickly becomes complex when you have to coordinate the movements of multiple recorded copies of yourself which you can interact with in order to finish levels as quickly and with as few recordings as possible.While I played the majority of the game a long time ago, I just finished it up today and found it easy to pick back up and get into.  The game is very well put together and it's great fun for only $5.			"

												The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom is truly born of Braid. It's all about time manipulation puzzles. But there's none of the somber pretentiousness of Braid. This game is a bit silly, with a frenetic soundtrack of ragtime-style piano and clarinet. I like the presentation of this game.But if the presentation is a bit silly, there's no silly in the challenge. The puzzles are hard, and they appear to exist only for the sake of existing; there's no great story or adventure here, just level after level of increasingly difficult time-bending puzzles.P.B. Winterbottom's greatest achievement is achieving a price tag of $0.49 during the 2010 Steam Holiday sale. I don't imagine that, years later, people are hanging on for another big 90% off sale for this game. But if you enjoy puzzle games, this is not a bad buy.			"

THE PIE IS NOT A LIE!Short Verdict: A good puzzle game, despite its flaws. Requires you to think fast, too. Last but not least, it's cheap.Overview: The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom is basically a puzzle game in which you control Winterbottom to create and manage clones in some sort of time controlling mechanics in order to collect all pies in each level. Although it's a puzzle game in essence, you'll also need a bit of dexterity and precision in some levels.Pros: Beautiful 2D graphics with a lot of personality Great BGM, perfect for the setting of the game If I counted right, there are 50 main story levels, plus 30 challenges Most of the puzzles are smart and rewarding when you figure them out The level hints sometimes provide a slight help, but they don't spoonfeed you--they really hit the mark Even the clones characteristics and the conditions for being able to collect pies change between the 5 sets of levels, adding a lot to the puzzlesCons: Even though my computer runs modern games with no problems, Winterbottom lagged in some levels (my pc told me something about the color scheme, but I didn't try changing it) The learning curve is messy--the first set of levels is ridiculously easy, then the second quickly becomes insanely hard, and after that it finally hits the mark. Seems to me like lack of planning or of proper tutorials, and I almost threw the towel on the second set of levels. I personally hate it when a puzzle game requires ridiculous precision and perfect movements--puzzle games should be about thinking hard enough, not attempting the same thing over and over again until you just find the perfect spot and the perfect timing Some of the main levels (and quite a few challenges) are uninspired and just plain boring to play. I have to mention the very first challenge level, which is probably one of the most stupid ones and almost made me give up on all challenges. Make sure you try at the least a few of the other challenges.Bought on: Steam Store for R$ 1,99 (US$ 1.24 on the US store at the same time).Verdict: All things considered, it's a good puzzle game. Yes, it has some flaws and can be infuriating sometimes. Just keep in mind that this is NOT a zen puzzle game and you'll be required to move quickly and think fast all the time. But most of the game is fun, especially if you consider how much I've payed for it. It's also worth its full price, I think.Similar games: People call it a clone from Braid, which I haven't played, so I guess they probably have their similarities. I could also say it slightly reminds me of Toki Tori, for the puzzle solving and the ability to control time.			"

												I love puzzle games. I read somewhere this game has mechanics that are kind of like the World 4 on Braid. I saw the good rating and the good reviews, wondered how this had not caught my eye and bought it. And now I hope, this would have not have caught my eye at all.Going through a boring story and a ridiculous tutorial which wasn't needed at all is where this game begins. I solved a few puzzles, got to chapter 2, solved a few more and realized this game was only getting worse with progression. The controlling of the chracter is clumsy, the transition between everything (such as levels) is so slow as if it was put there just to test your patience through some overextended display of text and images. This game also has performance issues for my PC even though it should run just fine, I meet all the recommended requirements.Going through this game, completing it would not be fun or pleasurable for me but rather a task and a mental torture to bear through it.

The music and graphics are perfect for such a game and the gameplay is fluid.  The controls for this type of game is perfect and does not leave you frustrated by the movement of your character.  This leaves you to focus on puzzle solving only.  Great game which typically goes on sale at a great price.  Worth every penny.			"

												A cool puzzle game similar to Braid. Puzzles are tough but were never tough enough to stop me from eventually finding the solution without resorting to help. This game also utilizes time control like Braid. Here you can create clones of yourself that you can use to help solve puzzles. I wouldn't say essential, but pretty fun and taxing game.			"

												I like the puzzle aspects of the game, using clones to press buttons and flip switches and so on, but this game quickly lost my favor with its emphasis on timing-based challenges. I've played games like this before, where you had to use the cloning mechanic to have a copy of you at the right place at the right time in order to collect all the doo-dads and reach the exit door. But this game puts a damper on the fun by arbitrarily restricting how many copies you can make in each puzzle, and by requiring you to execute the solution to the puzzle in a strict target time set by the developers (i.e. the pies disappear if you don't gather them fast enough). The time-limit problem is only compounded by adding timed doors/switches into the mix. Finally, the game requires you to strike your clones to launch them at high/far pies, but once you strike them, it breaks them out of their loop, so they disappear. This means if you are trying to execute on a puzzle that requires striking a clone, and you don't pull it off, you have to set up all of your clones again. So yet another puzzle game that requires you to reset a puzzle to its start position over and over and over again when you ALREADY KNOW THE SOLUTION and are JUST TRYING TO EXECUTE IT. Irritating.Also, while I like the art / atmosphere of the levels, the constant cinematic cuts/intros are interruptive.Want to play a game that uses this exact same mechanic, but doesn't have all of the annoyances, is way more fun, and is absolutely free? Search for a browser-based game named ""Chronotron"". You're welcome.meh/10			"

												This game is an ""eh,"" in my opinion. When I first saw the trailer for the older versions of this game, I thought it was pretty cool. Using time travel and clones to solve puzzles? My money's on it! But when I got the actual game, I was given the time travel and the clones but the puzzles were just so difficult. Here's some pros and cons:Pros:- Ok controls- Great idea- Nice looking graphics- Good storyCons:- Very difficult puzzles (Once you get to the second chapter, you really need very quick reflexes.)Overall, the game is just too difficult to complete. Hell, I can't even complete the second chapter. While the idea is original, they just had to screw it up. Don't waste your money on this, just buy other puzzle platformers like Battleblock Theater.Score: 3/10			"

												Puzzle games cannot be played by me anymore, as evident from this little gem of tiny proportions. A very short piece of work that could be spent endlessly trying to figure out the puzzles (which I do not have that time) before getting frustrated or saying ""oh"" and then declaring victory and saying that the two of you were always friends. Yes, P.B. Winterbottom, let us carry on with our quest for pies. Addiction and pies. That's the story. Nothing else. Nothing more. Five little bonus stages (i think) await after five levels of varying puzzles with a slight shift in gameplay are the most enjoyable part for me.

												This is a cleaver puzzle game that has a unique art style. The whole game is great if you enjoy a good puzzle game but can be challenging at times if you don't know how to get to a certain point on each map. The main character loves pies and is so obsessed with them that he will do anything to get them. You have to navigate through each level to uncover the story of this pie theft. The music is classy. The gameplay is smooth. The entire experience is well done for a puzzle game. The thing that I found to be really hard were the extra challenges that you can do if you want to play on some more. I recommend this game to puzzle lovers and to any one ready for a cleaver challenge.			"

												This game was as harder than ice, harder than rock, harder than diamonds, harder than my winterbottom. In this title you must steal all the pies while being as much of a lying sack of PB than you can be. You moustache your face off with all of the time traveling♥♥♥♥♥♥just like in back to the future damn I want to bang that chick but marty is super homosexual. And it is sort of like back 2 the future where martys mom is all ugly and fat and married to that hunk biff, then I got confusing feelings. Then there was back 3 the future where ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ doc got a waifu that was pretty annoying and then they went on a train and then doc got ♥♥♥♥♥whipped into having several time kids and then traveled through time ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥up and then he turned into pb winterbottom. It is kind of sad how much this game reminds me of point break because you kind of play as keeanu reeves and patrick swayze and that one part where the guy throws his fbi badge into the ocean for some reason. I dont remember seeing point break actually. Just like I dont remember playing pb winterbottom and the goblet of ♥♥♥♥ but apperrantly I did play it for a long time. Does anyone actually know how to beat the first level btway because I was confused as how to make antoehr winterbottom. I was stuck with one winterbottom and it was terrible but I really appreciated the astchedeteetics of the game and the sound design of the characters. I liked the part in the game where you use the attack dog to kill people and i think at some point you had fish move out of the way with advanced ai and then at the end of the game you blow up russia, china, and everywhere that isnt america and then you find out that in fact you were also russian and at the end of the game you have to either shoot the good russian guy or the bad russian guy or yourself and then you get an ending based off that but it is super ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and it turns out that the good russian guy was actually bad too and took over the world or some♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tass ♥♥♥♥ and then you play the intro of the game again but the one dude calls you comrade and then I was like ""♥♥♥♥ this videogame"" and then you see the statue of the good guy. Oh and at the credits you see that one chick that had no character development come up out the water and then she is alive in the past or the future or something. Anyways sorry for rambling so much but overall Stranglehold was an allright game, you get to slow mo shoot guys in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ This game gets a 9/11 ( too soon but that is the joke is taht i winterbottomed my way into the future to say that joke when it is not too soon after 9/11 but it wasnt really a joke it was just the game's score)			"

I'd definitely go around stealing pies and manipulating time to get the best pie of all: one that looks like it has the lips of some 50 yearold chainsmoking hooker; And I mean both pairs.But all and all, the game is pretty fun, espeically if you're wanting a whole career change of your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ McDonalds job to swindling pies.

												This is a very good case in point about why I generally don't like puzzle games. They start with simple levels to get you used to the principles you need to use in the game. These are  relatively boring but necessary to get to the fun levels where you apply what you have learnt to solve the puzzles. However these then give way to the really frustrating levels that are difficult to solve and offer little in the way of enjoyment. This means that the actual enjoyable part of the game is a tiny minority of the game. This game is quite stylish and somewhat reminiscent of Braid, I personally find that game an anathema but if you liked it you might well like this.			"

												Winterbottom is superb little gem. One of those that can get lost if you aren't familiar with games from a few years ago. This one slipped by a lot of people, but it still is very much worth checking out. It has a vintage look that will remind one of old cartoons and films from days gone by. The in-game dialogues are done in rhyme and come off as quite likeable considering the material, much like Child of Light in comparison. The platforming and control of character is adequately precise with a DS4 controller. Visuals are basically perfect for the time periods and styles they are trying to provoke, and I personally much prefer this tone of game to Braid, another time puzzler. Gameplay here involves using clones and recording time to conventiently work your way through various contraptions and pie dreams. Altogether short but extremely well made.			"

												Whole-heartedly recommended! The game's main mechanic is recording your movements as ""clones"" and you use them (or vice versa) to score PIES. Yes, that's right, PIES. Admit it: we all want to go on a pie stealin’ frenzy from time to time. The puzzles are challenging, the story is silly and charming. At only $5, you'd be missing out if you didn't pick this up. A lot like Portal, my only beef is: it's kinda short and, as is with every puzzle game, ZERO replayability. In the end, MPBW is totally worth the fun!			"

												P.B. winterbottem is not a game for the faint of heart, nor one which should be delved into without the full understanding of its message. For its message may indeed call into question the most fundamental beliefs we hold dear in our modern capitalist society. Indeed the insightful metaphorical commentary about the conditions of the proletariat under the USSR are some of the most powerful arguments for the differing virtues of communism and socialist economic policies versus the greed driven capitalist system. Naturally the ""pie""; the object of P.B.s never ending pursuit represents wealth and stature which will never be achieved by those born into poverty. The fact that the glorious pie will never be attained highlights the tragic situation many of the working class find themselves in. Forced to work in mundane tedium until death, how many people have only their pensions to think of keeping them going? These messages may only be attained form a game this complex or even cerebral as PB.			"

												This game has charme, style, nice music and also a nice premise. Being able to made clones of yourself and basically screw with time and space is a nice idea (though only moderately well executed). Most levels are fun, but they sometimes rely more on your reaction skills than your brain capacity.  The ability to make shadow clones gets  twisted and changed slightly with every new act, so it'll stay interesting till the end. There are also extra challenges. All of that will probably take you five to six hours to complete. Too bad they didn't include a level editor.			"

												Good, but not exceptional, and pretty dang short. The time-clone mechanic isn't that original (or at least, isn't anymore, probably wasn't when this first came out either) but they do put a lot of spins on it, every chapter past the first has a gimmick or two to it to make things more challenging/varied. The difficulty curve is strange though, world 1 is pretty easy but worlds 2-5 are all about on an even plane, and it never really gets too hard. There's some platforming and some puzzling involved, especially platforming in the bonus levels where you're on a time limit. Not too intense in either direction though, it finds a good balance. There's not a lot to do though, some 50ish levels in the main game and 30 bonus ones, but none are particularly long, and I 100%'ed the entire thing pretty easily in 4 and a half hours. I wouldn't say it's a bad game though, most of the puzzles are pretty decent and there are some nice aha! moments in them. Some of the bonus puzzles are a little cruddy though, especially the ones that are just ""threw stuff in a room, go collect it all"". Wouldn't go around praising its name or anything but, if you want a solid, enjoyable enough puzzle-platformer, go for it, it's not too expensive anyhow.			"

												I beat this game awhile back, but I wanted to come back to play the bonus challenges. It's very similar to Braid, and I love the puzzles that it poses. I'm not very into speed-running, so I won't be getting all the time medals on the bonus levels. I did get the recording medals on them, which was very challenging.			"

												I can't quite put my finger on it, but something about this game failed to grab me. It has a lot of things I usually enjoy. Quirky story that doesn't take itself too seriously. Platforming (but not Super Meat Boy levels of twitch) with some clone/time travel mechanics to spice things up. An interesting art direction.But after 2 hours, I just lost interest and abandoned the game. It is cheap. And maybe it will be your cup of tea. But life is short and I have too many othe games that, after I'd sunk two hours into them, made me want to keep coming back.			"

												I had this game gathering dust on my Steam library for months, until I finally decided to actually play it start-to-finish for once. It begins slowly; with a gradual introduction to the world, the character and the mechanics, a process reminiscent of a classic tutorial (as it should be), and then after this thrust into the world it leaves you to solve increasingly convoluted puzzles.The protagonist is a suprisingly lovable one-dimensional character that has but one drive: The urge to eat all the pies he can find. The story, which is not as superficial and ""ad hoc"" as it will first seem, is presented in the form of ingenious rhyming silent-film slides, one at the beginning of every level; the art is pure eye-candy and though sometimes the monochromatic nature of the game may feel monotonous, the whole design (especially the oft animated level backgrounds) makes it worth it; and the music can be described in just one word: Superb.This game is an acquired taste: The more you play it, the more you'll like it. Once you've finished it, if you're thirsty for more, you have quite a few extra bonus levels available which you can attempt to solve as quick as possible or with as few clones as possible to get medals, respectively. This tidbit of information will come in handy, especially if you intend to unlock all the game's achievements.			"

												This game has charme, style, nice music and also a nice premise. Being able to made clones of yourself and basically screw with time and space is a nice idea (though only moderately well executed). Most levels are fun, but they sometimes rely more on your reaction skills than your brain capacity.  The ability to make shadow clones gets  twisted and changed slightly with every new act, so it'll stay interesting till the end. There are also extra challenges. All of that will probably take you five to six hours to complete. Too bad they didn't include a level editor.			"

												A great brain teaser, and quite humourous to boot! The only flaw is the main story is too short, but there's plenty of challenges to make up for it.			"

												A very underrated game, almost as good as Braid and World of Goo in my opinion.  Winterbottom's only short coming is that it's a shorter game with less variation in its mechanic. But it's one of those games that picks a specific mechanic and really explores it and takes it as far as it can go. It launched at $5 and when it's  on sale there's really no reason not to pick it up.			"

												The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom is one of the most interesting games I have ever played. It's very artistic and enjoyable. This music take me a wonder world. When you clear every stage, It is please you very much. Let's try  the mysterious adventure!			"

												Culinary quandaries never quite quashed this game's crisp quality! After Braid, what do you do with puzzle platformers? Time's been conquered, cerebral symbolism that only Blow knows bombarded the chances of others, or so it might seem! However more can play at that game, especially when you decide to go off your rocker with time and clones all in the pursuit of the pinnacle of primal desires...Pie! Yes, the great quest of Mr. Winterbottom is the pursuit of pie, regardless of the consequences of Bakersburg or spacetime, as you make your way through puzzles after a mysterious mystical pie. You duplicate yourself to satisfy your gluttony, but as you play, you must satisfy that of your clones too to proceed, much to your dismay. With the ever-increasing complexity of your pie predicaments, the game almost begins to feel a little finicky, but the solutions remain satisfying to figure out, and rarely leave you perplexed. The cream atop this curiosity? A distinct visual style and cheerful soundtrack to keep you intrigued and entertained as you try to gather every last pie and incidentally resolve other situations in Bakersburg at the same time. The game's story isn't terribly fascinating, but the writing is fairly amusing at times. If I had to guess, I think there are a few spots that suggest the origin of Mr. Winterbottom tucked away into the tale, and if correct, it works surprisingly well to explain the perpetual misadventures of Mr. Winterbottom.

												I beat this game awhile back, but I wanted to come back to play the bonus challenges. It's very similar to Braid, and I love the puzzles that it poses. I'm not very into speed-running, so I won't be getting all the time medals on the bonus levels. I did get the recording medals on them, which was very challenging.			"

												Brilliant puzzler! Like Braid, but with the story written by a twisted Dickens and with cloning in addition to time manipulation. Definitely in my Top 5 for 2010.			"

												The poshest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game you'll ever play. It's about some guy in a top hat stealing a bunch of pies via cloning puzzles which look like old movies, what's not to like?Of course, it'll take only 3 or 4 hours to finish, but that doesn't make the content any less great.			"
