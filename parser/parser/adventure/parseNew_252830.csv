												Who this game is meant for:Fans of Lone Survivor, Clock Tower, Haunting Ground and Silent Hill or survival horror in general.What bothered me: This game is too similar to Silent Hill and Lone Survivor.There are tons of references to Silent Hill. I understand being influenced by a game, but it really goes far.Even the menu sounds like the menu in Silent Hill 2.Who this game is not for:I'm not saying this is a good game or that it's not creepy, what I'm saying is that if you get annoyed by many references to other games, you will not enjoy this game. If you did not like the map layout in Silent Hill, you will not like this game.People who hate running away from enemies instead of attacking them.Also, be warned that this game is extremely similar to Lone Survivor.Although it may sound like I'm bashing the game, I do enjoy the game and I do recommend it.

												Even though I do like the game, I have encoutered several bugs, that affect the ability to finish it all together. The major issue is that some times after you reload after death, some certain key obstacles (like closed doors) are back, but the key item you need to open them is already gone. This literally made the game unfinishable for me, and damn near it's end too.Don't get me wrong - for once we got a really good horror game, that reminds me of Clock Tower series, and the performance is mostly memorable and well-executed by devs, so I would definetely recommend buying it. Just keep a separate save file, so you won't be needing to start all over again like I do.			"

												Claire is a 2D psychological survival-horror game that pulls a lot of inspiration from Silent Hill, Clock Tower, and a few other horror games of the early 2000s. I had been following the title since mid-2013, and finally gave it a play after a few patches had been delivered for the game post-release (which to the developers credit, they have been very active in responding to problems the game has via patches and being active on their steam community forums and twitter). I had played about an hour of the game last February off Desura, which was very rough at the time. I wasn't quite sure what the final product was going to end up like.Claire stars the titular character as she wakes up from a nightmare about her childhood. She is in the hospital taking care of her mother, who is sickly and bedridden. However, as she fetches coffee to keep herself awake, the hospital suddenly changes... Shifts into some form of nightmare realm. Quickly finding aid from a dog known as Anubis, they go to try and find an escape to the twisted terror they've found themselves trapped in.In Claire, you explore labyrinth-like locations full of enemies, traps, puzzles, scares, and atmosphere as you open locked doors and trigger events that advance the story. Honestly its all rather simple. Occasionally you meet a person in the labyrinth you can help with something via a side-quest, or some choice you can make or optional puzzle you can partake in. Your actions go towards what ending you'll get at game's end, of which there are six of.The gameplay is simple, but is supported by good design, an actually helpful map (surprising as I find maps are usually useless in 2D horror games like this), fantastic atmosphere, and a number of surreal and interesting moments throughout, backed by a good lighting engine and moody sound design.Monsters come in a few varieties, but none can be killed, simply ran from and hid from. And they can be determined buggers in hunting you down, bashing down doors you try to escape through, and can follow you into any room outside of save rooms. You either have to outrun them, outsmart them (like blocking a door), out-climb them (they can't climb things it seems), or hide in a closet/similar hiding place. Though some monsters don't chase you at all. One common threat is a type of monster that won't chase you, but getting near it will drain your 'sanity'.Sanity isn't for insane effects or anything, but survival in Claire. Like Clock Tower's panic feature, basically. The more loss of 'calm' and scared you become, the more you'll start taking damage, until you're panicking and taking damage for simply panicking. A big part of the game, especially later in, is managing your health and sanity and playing wisely. This is helped by the fact that like Resident Evil, the stages are large with multiple paths, allowing you to make strategic paths through the facility once you've come more familiar with its layout.Normally I build-up to my impressions of a review by talking about the elements, but to explain Claire I need to work backwards... I loved it. It's going up there as what I would list as the best 2D horror games out there, along with the likes of Lone Survivor, Clock Tower, Yume Nikki, Last Door, Ib, Witch's House, etc. Claire succeeds in making an unnerving atmosphere that actually managed to spook me on a few occasions, interesting moments in both gameplay, design, and narrative, and wrapping it all together into an enjoyable horror game package.And its with this severe love I have for the game I must mention that the game still has some problems. The developers are responding to them and still patching the game, but I need to make note of this as the time I played it (version 1.145) that I ran into a number of issues. I played the game kind of stupidly on Nightmare difficulty (the hardest difficulty) on my first playthrough of the game, and as a mention I would not suggest playing on this difficulty unless you really want a challenge and have some patience. But maybe because of this I experienced more problems, as most of what I had problems with was the sanity system, which was very unforgiving and has weird problems like certain cutscene spots draining my sanity so fast I would die during cutscenes and would actively have to heal myself to keep myself alive to read the dialogue in cutscenes. And then some minor things, like how I found the flashlight not really useful most of the time and just defaulted to the lighter, or a few areas later in the game feeling a bit too much like trial-and-error in parts.I'm sure most of my problems will be addressed with future patches again, and don't think this game is worth passing up on for this.Claire feels a bit similar to some other kinds of horror games, with the easiest comparison to make being Lone Survivor (they share a bit more in common than just being 2D games with some Silent Hill influence, though let it be known if you liked Lone Survivor, you will most likely enjoy this). However, it also manages to create its own feel and tale of horror, and the developments in both gameplay and story for the most part feel satisfying.It's a bit slow, there are a few places where navigating and where you're supposed to go can be a bit confusing. However, the levels have a fun exploration element and will usually reward you for taking time off the beaten path, with a variety of side-quest, goodies, hidden scenes and scares, and more.Speaking of which, the game manages to pack some good scares and ""WTF"" moments through its course. I found myself a bit more comfortable and less on-edge after the first area, but the game managed to put me on edge and make me feel uneasy through the beginning first hour or two, and had its moments throughout its course. Of note, some of my favorite scares are indeed off the beaten path.I might be a bit gushy, but that's because Claire surpassed my expectations and has stood better than most of the other recent horror game releases on Steam I have played. It's a quality horror title for lovers of old-school styled horror with a bit of something new, or those who have come to enjoy 2D horror games like Lone Survivor or Clock Tower. It's rough around the edges, but has the heart, good execution, and cleverness to pull off what it strives to be, and excel at it, despite the few flaws it has.A bit slow, sometimes confusing, and I would not recommend going through it blind on Nightmare difficulty like I did, but a fantastic horror game that brings a lot in from the Silent Hill and Clock Tower class of horror, while also being its own thing that will be worth it for any genre enthusiast. But maybe wait to play through it once some of the bugs are ironed out.			"

												A better Silent Hill than the last three Silent Hills. Claire takes the Corpse Party route of using old school graphics but newer gameplay design decisions, mechanics, and general feel to create a rather excellent Horror game all its own. Only where Corpse Party was going for a distinctly Eastern style of Horror, Claire instead uses the more generalized Silent Hill approach.Though it won’t win anyone over who’s a serious graphics ***** the stylized 16-bit graphics are wonderfully detailed and manage to suck you in to the atmosphere in a way you’d never think a 2D game could. Sprites are dark, apocalyptic, gruesome, and backed up by some good lighting that really plays with you trying to set off a sense of claustrophobia. It’s put against an amazing soundscape that ranges between terrifying, foreboding, soothing, and even upbeat depending on what the scene calls for in a way rarely seen outside of games with larger budgets. Gameplay is centered around exploring an almost mazelike environment (using a suspiciously Silent Hill-esque map), finding key items, and running from roaming monsters. Claire is the first 2D horror game I’ve found where running and hiding from your enemies actually works and serves as an example of how to do this for future games. Though you can’t destroy enemies you can sprint for short distances, and even perform an evasive jump to get past them. This jump isn’t overpowered and you can get yourself killed but it offers a greater deal of tactical options instead of other games that have tried this (such as Knock-Knock) where you would wind up getting stuck and simply couldn't do anything to save yourself. Enemies are surprisingly intimidating and have even spooked me a few times but the game is well designed meaning that if there is an enemy there’s a good chance there’s a hiding spot or long corridor to run from them nearby (enemies can chase you across screens) giving you a chance to survive. Without spoilers the story is somewhere between Silent Hill and something more concrete. Though it drops you in with few answers there does seem to be a greater sense of “what’s happening” as the game continues though there are some surreal encounters with other denizens. Short version of what you can learn in the first five minutes; you are Claire, your mother is in the hospital, stuff goes REALLY bad really quick. I won’t say more than that but suffice it to say it’s kept me invested and coming back.There are a handful of bugs mostly associated with how the map displays icons. But these are few, far-between, and don't really effect the game when they do happen. But worth pointing out they’re there for the sake of being fair.So all in all Claire is a fantastic game, a brilliant triumph for the slowly building trend of using old-school graphics for horror games, and a must own for any horror game fan; especially lovers of Silent Hill.

												(Note: If don’t want to read long points go pass the line)Intro: In the game you play as protagonist by the name Claire who is trying search for her comatose mother while searching for answers within the darkness about herself, however be aware you’re not alone so now let explain base off my experience why I would recommend Claire.Atmosphere/Environment: In general atmosphere is important in a horror game if the goal if not scare to at least cause a form of discomfort in terms of survival-horror which for a 2D horror game like Claire for the most part does a great job in this regard when it comes to sounds, visuals and music in general will keep you on edge throughout the game now that is not to say there are no areas of calm moments but they are far in between.  For instance areas that are calm have eerie sense of sadness, loneliness, abandonment and little hope while areas that are chaotic have intense emotions of fear, suffering, hopelessness and madness while at certain times the atmosphere takes a combination of these two (To experience fully recommend not going objective too fast and also lights out and headphones on.)Gameplay Mechanics: Another thing that the game does an excellent job in keeping tension going is by putting players in the role as Claire who is put in this nightmarish world with only defense is a dog (warns of danger), blocking doors (if possible) , running and hiding.  Now when it comes to the running and hiding aspect of the game it should be noted here that when running your energy will drain quickly so use sparingly and once enemies see you they become relentless and by breaking down doors or crawling through from certain vents so it’s up to as the player to use both cunning and understanding of the environment around you both in terms of running and hiding, but understand since they are unpredictable if player is careless they will use the environment against you or if the player tries to hide in plain sight they will draw you out.  Last thing that keeps the tension going is a balance act you would have to maintain between the protagonist’s health and sanity.  Now at first the balancing act starts off easy but as progress it will become bit more difficult terms of enemies that attack you physically and/or mentally to environmental changes that you will not expect to occur. Inventory Management: Now the game Claire to a certain degree portrays a specific type of inventory management in the form of a backpack which contains a limited amount of square space and each square space can only hold one item in each one combined with idea that items must be used wisely which provides a challenge of its own, while I like this feature there is one flaw to it which the only way Claire describes the item is by the player picking it up which results in loss of space to point where you would have to use items whether you need to or not to make room for items you need in order to complete your objective and/or side quest as you progress (suggestion: create secondary storage for items for later use or create an option where it describes the item and yes or no if the player wants to pick it up.) Map: The map in general is one those learning curve type maps that you would either love it or hate it which I love it because not only does it help navigate throughout without being completely lost which provides a challenge in itself, but also the design remind me a little bit of horror games like siren.Puzzles: Now the puzzles in Claire in general come in two different types optional which you can skip if you want to (note: recommend not skipping more variety and little more challenging then main puzzles and some connect with the story in a way) and main game puzzles that you have to complete in order to progress which both of these types of puzzles not only help with the overall pacing but provide challenge within themselves.Replay ability: Now there is replay ability in terms of not only multiple endings and achievements, but also if you’re the type of player after completing want bonus challenge Claire offers this in the form of two basic difficulty modes hard and nightmare.Overall Story: The story in Claire is a mix bag here it’s excellent in one aspect and another way it struggles fully stay up float.  Now what Claire does excellent is how the game presents itself by having Claire herself narrate in the form of text her thoughts and emotions while combined with the emotions she displayed was believable to the point I find myself caring what’s going happen to her base of the choices I made, certain sequences (memories) in Claire will occur which will allow to have idea not only what her past was like but also the reason behind her situation which is designed and set up in way that never over stays its welcome combined with items you find to put in your journal that which all together seems to use a little bit of Silent Hill formula.  Now don’t get wrong I found story interesting and I don’t expect games like Claire to hold my hand, however the story isn’t perfect I just couldn’t shake the feeling off there were certain plots arguably missing, just there to be in the game or/and seemed a bit on the rushed side which the main issue behind this is that the game Claire seems reference the individual enough to point where he is very memorable but not much to go on to actually piece together what happen to him or maybe it was just simply lost in translation with me.----------------------------------------------------------------Pros:Atmosphere/environment: Will either scare or keep you on edge.Gameplay Mechanics: Will keep tension going throughout.Inventory Management: is present in terms of space and item use.Map: Provide well balance learning curve.Replay ability: Is present in terms of multiple endings, achievements and contains two difficulty settings hard and nightmare.Overall Story: Believable story due to Claire displaying her thoughts and emotions text and body movement and/or expressions, sequences that occur (memories) that don’t over stay its welcome because of how it was designed and set up.Mix:Puzzles: come in two different types optional (which are slightly more challenging and connect with the story in a way) while main puzzles provide certain challenge and do also have a connection to story but variety is not there in my opinion.  Cons:Inventory Management doesn’t give option to store or pick item up or not.Overall Story: The story is interesting the problem is certain plots are either missing, just in there to be in the game or/and a little bit on the rushed side.Overall I enjoyed my time playing Claire will go back to explore for the alternate endings, atmosphere/environment and gameplay.  I recommend this game to anyone who is a fan or new to both the gameplay and genre. "

												I'm all for games taking inspiration from other works, as long as they use that to build on their own concepts. Silent Hill is, of course, a brilliant horror game to take inspiration from, representing such a deep well of gameplay and oddities to choose from. Claire chooses not only to take inspiration from Silent Hill but also Lone Survivor, another indie game inspired by, you guessed it, Silent Hill. So what does that leave us with?The game opens with Claire fighting off nightmares while dozing in her mom's hospital room. When she steps out for coffee, everything goes all shitworldy and she ends up running from actual nightmares, reliving several traumatic moments in her life, and trying a million busted doors. The side-scrolling gameplay is strongly reminiscent of Silent Hill games, with a huge, sprawling map of rooms you can only get into about half of. You usually have a goal you're trying to reach, but unlike Silent Hill the purpose in reaching it is never very clear. Nor is how you get there, because a great big building is really hard to navigate in 2D. It's a similar problem to Lone Survivor except way worse, because each of the three areas you scramble through is like SH3 mall-sized.Unlike the games that inspired it, however, Claire has no combat. Instead, you are expected to flee from the strange ink-blot looking monsters that roam the endless halls. Ironically this actually takes a lot of the tension out of the game, because you have a generous amount of sprint and can run directly through and past your foes. As long as you are paying the tiniest bit of attention, you can easily avoid ever being caught. This renders most of your inventory items moot, since most are for healing your health or your sanity, a system cribbed from Amnesia but without any clear purpose. And if there are no weapons or ammo or any pressing need for healing items, there's no real reason to explore, is there?I keep seeing this trend in indie games where they take heavy inspiration from a popular game but only get halfway to the same level of design. Much like Our Darker Purpose was to Binding of Isaac, Claire has all the parts of a Silent Hill game (or Lone Survivor successor) without actually making them work together. The enemies inspire no terror, the items are pointless, and the maps are confusing and sprawling without giving any reason to explore them. A disjointed story is laid over all of this about an angsty teen being an angsty teen because maybe bad things happened in her life? Whatever it is, it takes far too long to get to the point.I honestly started out pretty okay with this game because it was simple and the art is really good, but after 90 minutes I could no longer push myself to finish it. The story was going nowhere, the level design was just hallway after hallway with more and more monsters, and then I found a really cool room that killed me without warning. Literally without warning, it just suddenly popped up the pause menu, except I couldn't unpause because I was dead. Well, I can take a hint, Claire.			"

												A good 2D survival horror game, obviously inspired by the aesthetics of silent hill, and perhaps some plot elements from those games as well.There are a few cool puzzles, and side quests one can do that add to the replay value of the game, as well as three different difficulties, and a plethora of different endings. The game is fairly easy, so one can probably get through it without too much difficulty on ""hard"" (""nightmare"" may prove more of a challenge though).The severeal endings are contingent on how many side quest one chooses to do, which is nice because it gives one incentive to explore the world a bit more.The game can be completed in two hours if one were to rush though it. However for the kind of person who enjoys to explore and discover everything a game has to offer, I can see maybe 10 hours of playtime for this title.One feature I would've liked to have seen in the game is an option to play it without taking any damage, so I could go through it and enjoy the pixel enviorments at my own leisure, but that is of course a minor thing that doesn't detract from the experience at all.If the game does have a major flaw it would be that the dialouge, and story could have used some work, while I understand everything that was going on, the story could have fleshed out the characters a bit more.There is no combat in the game, and while this is an interesting mechanic, I felt it could have been handled better than it was, for example there were not enough spots to hide. The flashlight did not do much and wasn't required to beat the game, this felt like a missed opportunity gameplay wise, as I feel flashlight use could have been made more useful. To be specific maybe the flashlight could make you immune to being scared while it's in use, or perhaps it could temporarily scare off monsters?The biggest issue I have with the game is there are parts of it that seem impossible to complete unless you have a whole bunch of health items stacked up, and this is becuase of your ""sanity meter"". If one has low ""sanity"" they start taking damage, the worst part is aside from items, there isn't really a way for one to restore thier ""sanity"", or at least none I could figure out.Laslty it would be nice to have an option view all of the endings/notes one has unlocked.This game currently would garner a 3.5/5 from me, if the game fixed all of the above I would have rated it higher.Still it's a neat little indie title, worth one's money, and especially worth one's cash if bought on sale!- Celx Requin			"

												Rating 7.5/10Claire is a 2d psychological horror game very reminiscent of  Silent HIll. You play as Claire as she navigates multiple locals to complete missions and progress the overall story. You have no weapons, only a lighter/flightlight, your wits and your pet dog (Who will only warn you of nearby enemies, but I suppose that is more than my cat would do) to navigate through the nightmarish halls to out run and out smart the lurking monsters. Speaking of enemies, some will attack you physially while some will attack you psychologically, causing you to become scared. If Claire stays scared for to long she will begain to take physical damage, so in essence you have two health pools to manage. Like any survival game, you can explore and scavenge for health items, notes and batteries for your flashlight, not to mention some pretty interesting puzzles to find and solve. If you explore the right locations you will occassionally come across other survivors who can offer you side missions to do while exploring. These are not mandontory and can be skipped all together. There is replayability value in the game as there are multiple endings you can unlock based on what you do in game. Completing the story with a decent amount of exploration you can expect to finish up in 4 to 5 hours.If you enjoy survival horror I highly recommend this game. I also recommend the coffee, again.

												Lets get this out of the way now: Claire feels like a Lone Survivor clone. Of course it has its own flavor, unfortunately things that make it different also make it less enjoyable.Claire's strongest point is probably its graphical design, making you wonder what will you see next, what other gruesome things will developers come up with. And that is pretty much the only good thing I can say about this game, everything else is rather... meh.To start of, the story is so vague it is really hard to care for the main character (or the world that surrounds her). Sure, she no doubt has a tragic backstory, but every hint we get of it just feels like the same old thing we already seen before.Claire also shares a problem that Lone Survivor had (but on a much bigger and thus more confusing scale), which is how they present the world - both games show 2D side scrolling view of the world with an ability to enter rooms and corridors that lay perpendicular to your current location. This gets really confusing really fast as Claire features maps that are built to look and feel like actual mazes. It almost becomes a necessity to open the map after every step you take.Speaking of Lone Survivor, one of the biggest differences and also by far the weakest element of Claire is how they deal with enemies. In case of Claire, the only real option is to simply run, and not the ""get the hell out of here if you want to live"" kind of run, but simply moving, often even passing by them - the simple fact of running is just about enough to dodge most of them. Perhaps switching to a higher difficulty could make this a bigger challenge, but lets be honest, fundamentally it just isn’t a very fun mechanic, especially compared to Lone Survivor where you could not only run from your enemies, but also kill them, lure them away, or simply sneak pass by them.In the end I played Claire for around 3 hours before finally deciding to drop it - all because a simple thought entered my mind: ""Am I actually having fun?""6/10 "

												Decent enough indie horror walking sim game. If you own it from a bundle or something, I would say install it, it's only 500MB and it's worth trying out. For US$9, I wouldn't buy it.The check point save system really hurts the game though. Replaying the same spoooooky room a second time is just predictable and boring, which is the antithesis of horror or scary. The map also doesn't have any indicators or anything so if you get lost it can get frustrating. I probably won't finish it, but I didn't mind checking it out while some cards fell into my lap.			"

												Claire awakens from a happy dream about happy friendship bears to find herself at home in bed with shadows lurking over her. The shadows close in and you're given a choice to call for your parents, hide or get out of bed. The room is covered in pink, but marred in shadow. The only light sources come from a clock that reads 3:33 and an open window that lets in some moonlight. When the girl hops out of bed to scurry out of the room in a 2D side-scrolling fashion, she's yanked back toward the shadows that lurk over her bed.After that she's allowed to scour her darkened how looking for the brother and parents. Windows illuminate dark hallways that have shadowy birds flying through them. The screen begins to flicker, shake and glitch as each room gets darker than the next. Static on the television, the only lights pop as Claire walks by and shadowy soccer balls roll by her feet. Minutes tick by, but the next clock still reads 3:33 as well. The moon must be shrouded as no more light shines through the window's open curtains.When Claire reaches her parents room, everyone is gone, the bed is floating and her mom tells her that everything's going to be okay. That's when Claire wakes up curled in a ball on a chair inside the St. Barbara hospital pediatrics ward. There's a photo of a happy couple in the background with a different photo of a beach over it. The room is lit by a light overhead and red candle that flickers. The curtains are half open and its pitch black outside.Claire is a young blonde girl with barrettes in her hair wearing a hoody and jeans. Claire knows that she needs to stop sleeping there, because that place is getting to here. From that point Claire wanders the hospital floor. The place is pristine and nothing out of the ordinary other than she's the only person there. There are still hints that a black fog or haze watches her from just beyond the light's reach.She can run, jump and open doors to get from one area to the next. We can assume that since she's in a hospital that's the reason why she can't run fast or run a long distance without running out of breath. There are plenty of maxcell batteries and cola for her to collect marked as shinny objects here and there to catch her gaze.Several doors are locked or blocked. She can even hear the television on inside and the doors that are unlocked Claire wants to leave the inhabitants in peace. Its routine for Claire, she says its always been quiet at night. Hallway after hallway, they begin to get darker and unfriendly. After searching through a dozen hallways its safe to say that Claire is alone.There is then a sign of life, her phone rings,s he answers, but the person on the other end hangs up. She finds plenty of things to interact with, plaques, couches to curl upon and rooms that let her save any progress. Upon reaching a coffee room, Claire says that there are still a few hours before school starts and she needs to get back home. Then she says she misses sleeping in her own bed. So it seems that Claire has a conflict. Stuck in a hospital overnight that she needs to go home from. Waking up in a chair rather than a bed. She's in street clothes instead of a hospital gown.It is just an ordinary, mundane hospital. The water tastes like dirt, there is a rickety elevator that almost breaks with her in it. The elevator opens on the wrong floor. She feels that she must have pushed the wrong button. Soon the rooms become uninviting. Rust seeps out from vents. The bright lights get dim. There's a scratching sound and before she realizes, she's staring at a hospital bed with a red candle on it and a shadowy mist hovering over it.The mist slowly consumes the entire room before  Claire herself is on a table with red candles around her on the floor, shadowy figures walking around and a giant, fleshless, meaty creature hovering above her. Does it have a face? Is that a face? No is that also a face? Are those four giant teeth or four giant nails? What are those dozen shadow people around her? Claire is stuck, something is holding her down.It all comes to an end though as a barking German Shepard makes the shadow men dissipate. She knows this German Shepard, its her dog Anubis or Ani as Claire likes to say. With her faithful dog here, the bond is broken and she's free to move while the fleshless muscle creature stays clung to the ceiling.Claire realizes her phone is busted, the hospital is dark with only dim lights or red candles here and there, so she's forced to use her lighter to guide the way. This lighter never runs out of fuel and she soon finds a flashlight to light the way, but it requires Maxcell batteries.The hospital has changed completely and its in disarray. Furniture strewn about, doors have giant chains and locks around them. Some hallways are blocked off with rubble. Claire has to push things aside to get into doors. Something happened in this hospital.With her faithful dog here with her, she needs to meet the challenge to survive going room to room in a labyrinthine complex. Going through air ducts, elevators, doors and so on. She checks each closet, bathroom stall, locker and trash bag looking for items to stay alive. Lucky for her she has a map that shows where she'll be headed, what doors are locked and which ones need keys. Claire can pick a door's lock with a hairpin and enough time to do it. With each cooridoor containing plenty of doors, Claire can find herself lost with each new hallway without checking her map.Anubis growls, Claire wonders what it is, but she soon learns to recognize that when Ani growls, there's a presence with them. A shadowy figure with a white outline of a face that will charge the two of them and chase them from room to room. If she hides beyond a door, the creature will smash the glass and begin to course through the door turning it black until the being springs into the room with them. Their only resolve then is to hide in a laundry basket or closet. The creatures make static screeches to crawl up Claire's spine.Every time a shadow creature touches her it drains Claire's health and the only way she restores it is by chugging various types of cola or coffee. She also has a sanity factor and the more she sees, the crazier she can become. Depleting health or sanity mean most certain death for her.Claire's only real power is to face her fears and bait these shadow creatures through room after room until she finds a closet to hide in so the creature can walk by. This hospital is a hostile place with scarce resources. There is a limited bounty of batteries and cola so when she's out, that's it.As isolating, atmospheric and terrifying as the hospital can be, there's someone else in St. Barbara. There's another patient here that Claire will inevitably find. You get choices for Claire at key moments, but I feel they are of little consequence.The danger comes from more than these creatures and giant shadow reapers, there are a few hazards here and there, such as her own mind working against her. Claire has dark hallucinations of when she picked a dog from the pound. Her mind twists the memory into something horrifying. The dogs int heir kennels are only a pair of glowing eyes. You can begin to wonder what is her reality. Who she is and why she's stuck in this hospital.I think the bottom line here is that the game is a tense experience that gets lost in hallways.			"

												+ The atmosphere, very tense and creepy.+ The graphics, colors, effects and sprites: neat stuff.+ The story bits are interesting.+ you can hide in some furniture, even though the hiding spots are very scarce and I didn't get to 'use' that feature, it's still a nice idea.- Corridor simulator: if you like endlessy wandering in a maze with hallways all alike, opening 3 billions doors then this game is for you. In fact the whole gameplay consists of that.- Map is not accurate: some stuff don't get added to the map, like some blocked passages, monsters and shortcuts, bit by bit adding to your frustration. - Map is confusing: trying to represent a huge maze in a 2D game makes the map very confusing and odd about the placement of doors and seeing where you're heading to.- Monsters/enemies camp, waiting to mince you; but don't worry: they don't stay in the same place, they FOLLOW you through the map and through the doors.- When you're in your inventory the game isn't paused: so you're running away from a monster and trying to see on the map where you should go and meanwhile the monster is gnawing on your leg. Yay.- You pickup batteries to refill your flashlight. Except that you can totally ignore the flashlight and use a lighter that doesn't need any refuelling.?!- XBox controls are wonky: the map shortcut button showed at the beginning doesn't work. Also you can't remap the buttons.- 1/5 of the time the inventory doesn't work and you have to close it and reopen it. Annoying and ruins the immersion.- You have to manage your health a bit à la Resident evil: your health is represented in your inventory and you use candies and sodas to heal. Except that your health status isn't very explicit nor intuitive. A color code like in Resident Evil would help.- So you collect butterflies. You're not told why or what they do.Yes I barely played it but I can't stand any more of that maze combined with the incomplete map, it's very confusing and annoying. Adding to that all the controls problems and the non-pause in the inventory and map makes it unbearable. So I cannot recommend it.			"

												This game is nice! The storyline is very interesting. Don't compare this game with ""Lone Survivor"" because the game mechanic is totally different :) This has some similar game mechanic from Amnesia. You have a mental status and health status, you have to keep both stable. In this game you can't attack enemies...but you can hide and run away from them. What I missed in ""Lone Survivor"" was the sprint button and this game has it :3 The replay value is high and there are several endings you can unlock. The only downside is the level design...it feels like a maze sometimes with so many doors out there...I hope you don't get lost :) Use your map often and good Luck! Thx for reading :3			"

												This game is definitely in my new top ten for best horror games.While the graphics may not be the most high-end, most horror survival fans will agree graphics aren't what make the games so intense.What makes Claire and other great horror games like it; Outlast, Silent Hill 2, etc., great is the fact that it is immersive, the gameplay is easy to pick up, the soundtrack and audio can be described as both creepy and visceral, the story is rich and it all harkens back to the early age of horror games when they weren't abandoned or all being turned into Call of Duty/Gears of War.This game is worth the asking price and if you really want a great horror game, buy this one.

												I have yet to beat this game but thus far, there's a lot of down to it then there is up.  It's extremely difficult to navigate (a mini map would be absolutely heavenly), the puzzles are obtuse and hard to understand with little to no context at all, though there are plenty of healing items at the BEGINNING of the game there are none near the END where it seems to get the most difficult (and where I'm stuck at and may just end up starting a new game entirely).  Otherwise, the graphics are fine for a 2D side scrolling game, it certainly has a Silent Hill feel to it which may or may not appeal to many fans of the series, and thus far the storyline and horror is well done.  It's showing you things that you really need to be afraid of (mental illnesses and not random monsters in the dark).  But because of all the issues, I'm going to not recommend it; if you have the patience for it and it's your cup of tea, have at it.			"

Posted: June 5, 2015
												Honestly, I'm a little on the fence on this game, as I write this, I am not sure if I would recommend it or not. This was another small time game in the part of the horror genre that I miss dearly, and wish there are more of out there at this point. But since this type of game has been around for a while, and was more likely inspired by early Silent Hill and Lone Survivor, I would not say that it is lacking tough competitors, I've been meaning to do this for a while, so with that, let's go over the game Claire piece by piece:Gameplay: Claire's gameplay is a bit odd, sanity management can be difficult in levels where eerie things are happening, which makes things a bit more frustrating considering one. small... detail, but I will get to that in a minute, I promise you that. Claire's mechanics mean she needs a flashlight for lighting, but there have been about 2 or 3 times where I have actually needed a flash light, I'm not sure if it helps with your sanity or anything, it's just there, and the lighter works just as well. Now one problem with Claire that is similar in Lone Survivor is the map system, oh dear lord the map system. In Lone Survivor, it wasn't as bad because they slowly, and gradually give you more and more of the map to learn and get used to, and by the time you get the new stuff, the old routes are already memorized and easy to get through, sure there's a spot or two you may miss, but most of the time, it doesn't break your game flow. With Claire, however, you are set from different location to different location very often and I do not think you go to a single one twice. This means, once you no longer need the map and you know the place like the back of your hand, you're put in a completely different area and it's back to staring at the map, and it breaks immersion. It is also a tad difficult to figure out how maps made with ups and downs works in a 2D sidescroller at times, Also, not to spoil anything, but the monster at the end is the only one you are supposed to fight, you can't fight the others, but this one, you can, which can be a bit confusing when you got so used to hiding in closets and boxes. One thing that really annoyed me is that your loyal pet Anubis was only used to alert you when monsters were nearby, and to comfort you in a couple moments, why this annoys me is because due to a majority of the puzzles being confusing and vague, all I remember is really wishing Anubis could find notes for me or lead me to hints, anything. But that might just be me thinking about Mercy in Valiant Hearts, I just might have high expectations for friendly dog characters now.Story: Claire's overall story and plot twist is... Well, to not spoil it, think of 3 typical horror story plot twists, and think of the common or overused ones. Chances are, one of those three, if you guessed the ending with it, was right on the money. This does not make the story bad, though, not necessarily, it's pretty hard to think up of plot twists in horror stories at times, especially a completely original one, it's still being done, but it is difficult. I don't think that's necessarily the problem with Claire, Claire's character is pretty well defined for the short time she is given, strong willed, responsible, hard to upset, as well as other features that I will not get into just yet. I think the issue is the game gives you too many answers, in a shady game with a lot of interpretation such as this one, giving this many clear answers may not be a good thing, I'm glad they're leaving that comfort zone, but a lot of things become a lot less interesting once their mystery is gone, but not explaining enough will only annoy people and nothing else, so you have to find that sweet spot of mystery and answers, and I think Claire leans too much towards answers. Another problem is that they give a lot of small characters that are likely symbolic to Claires mindset and past, which is all well and good, but there are a lot of them, and they all usually make one impression, or depending on what you do, technically, two impressions. So some seem to not give you any information on her, and others seem like they could have done much more if given more time, and a few are downright forgettable, you can easily end up with any of the endings not interacting with every single one, just an amount depending on the ending. The game is not entirely that predictable, and doesn't give you ALL the answers, we are not certain what happened that lead to this, what the exact trigger was, or if anyone Claire used to know is still alive or not, although it is implied in one ending (Good lord this takes a lot of beating around the bush). I feel like they should have taken the Lone Survivor route, rather than about 10 characters giving you small important things to the story, and are a part of your personality and past, have 3 different types of characters that cover three different categories of the protagonist, I will tell you I can remember more about the main three illusive characters, and likely the side characters as well in Lone Survivor than the crowd in Claire. I will say one thing, though, it takes one of those crappy childhood moves in the game, and it did not go anywhere near the way I thought it was going. When they brought up an issue in the family, and violence in the family, it's incredibly unlikely you guessed which family member caused the issues when it was happening. But let's end on a lighter note on this subject before I end up spoiling the hardest to predict part of the story, I do enjoy how this game has a bit of it's own lore, Claire has her own depiction of the Carebears being her childhood enjoyment, she even has it as her ringtone for nostalgia, it must have been at least a decade that had pased and she still remembers that song, and one of the few things I remember very well in this game is the theme song to that in Claire, and good ol' sun cola.In Summary: I do recommend this game, but not for the majority If you like Lone Survivor, and the earlier Silent Hill, you'll likely like this as well, because it's a bit more of it. The game looks nice, with a lovely bit of lighting. Even with awkward maps and a lot of side tracking, you can get a bit of enjoyment off of the development of the character and her past, it is a fairly interesting one despite the obvious parts, and there actually is some unpredictability in the bits and pieces despite what I said. If you're looking for a game that has an understandable map, more memorable side characters rather than atmosphere, something with a higher replay value than maybe 4 runs through at max, more likely than not, this is not the game for you, and with it usually being 10 dollars, I'm afraid you might be able to do better. Although I don't recommend it to all, for those who do, I bet you'll enjoy it for what it gives you.Go Elks!			"

												Claire is a 2D psychological survival-horror game that pulls a lot of inspiration from Silent Hill, Clock Tower, and a few other horror games of the early 2000s. I had been following the title since mid-2013, and finally gave it a play after a few patches had been delivered for the game post-release (which to the developers credit, they have been very active in responding to problems the game has via patches and being active on their steam community forums and twitter). I had played about an hour of the game last February off Desura, which was very rough at the time. I wasn't quite sure what the final product was going to end up like.Claire stars the titular character as she wakes up from a nightmare about her childhood. She is in the hospital taking care of her mother, who is sickly and bedridden. However, as she fetches coffee to keep herself awake, the hospital suddenly changes... Shifts into some form of nightmare realm. Quickly finding aid from a dog known as Anubis, they go to try and find an escape to the twisted terror they've found themselves trapped in.In Claire, you explore labyrinth-like locations full of enemies, traps, puzzles, scares, and atmosphere as you open locked doors and trigger events that advance the story. Honestly its all rather simple. Occasionally you meet a person in the labyrinth you can help with something via a side-quest, or some choice you can make or optional puzzle you can partake in. Your actions go towards what ending you'll get at game's end, of which there are six of.The gameplay is simple, but is supported by good design, an actually helpful map (surprising as I find maps are usually useless in 2D horror games like this), fantastic atmosphere, and a number of surreal and interesting moments throughout, backed by a good lighting engine and moody sound design.Monsters come in a few varieties, but none can be killed, simply ran from and hid from. And they can be determined buggers in hunting you down, bashing down doors you try to escape through, and can follow you into any room outside of save rooms. You either have to outrun them, outsmart them (like blocking a door), out-climb them (they can't climb things it seems), or hide in a closet/similar hiding place. Though some monsters don't chase you at all. One common threat is a type of monster that won't chase you, but getting near it will drain your 'sanity'.Sanity isn't for insane effects or anything, but survival in Claire. Like Clock Tower's panic feature, basically. The more loss of 'calm' and scared you become, the more you'll start taking damage, until you're panicking and taking damage for simply panicking. A big part of the game, especially later in, is managing your health and sanity and playing wisely. This is helped by the fact that like Resident Evil, the stages are large with multiple paths, allowing you to make strategic paths through the facility once you've come more familiar with its layout.Normally I build-up to my impressions of a review by talking about the elements, but to explain Claire I need to work backwards... I loved it. It's going up there as what I would list as the best 2D horror games out there, along with the likes of Lone Survivor, Clock Tower, Yume Nikki, Last Door, Ib, Witch's House, etc. Claire succeeds in making an unnerving atmosphere that actually managed to spook me on a few occasions, interesting moments in both gameplay, design, and narrative, and wrapping it all together into an enjoyable horror game package.And its with this severe love I have for the game I must mention that the game still has some problems. The developers are responding to them and still patching the game, but I need to make note of this as the time I played it (version 1.145) that I ran into a number of issues. I played the game kind of stupidly on Nightmare difficulty (the hardest difficulty) on my first playthrough of the game, and as a mention I would not suggest playing on this difficulty unless you really want a challenge and have some patience. But maybe because of this I experienced more problems, as most of what I had problems with was the sanity system, which was very unforgiving and has weird problems like certain cutscene spots draining my sanity so fast I would die during cutscenes and would actively have to heal myself to keep myself alive to read the dialogue in cutscenes. And then some minor things, like how I found the flashlight not really useful most of the time and just defaulted to the lighter, or a few areas later in the game feeling a bit too much like trial-and-error in parts.I'm sure most of my problems will be addressed with future patches again, and don't think this game is worth passing up on for this.Claire feels a bit similar to some other kinds of horror games, with the easiest comparison to make being Lone Survivor (they share a bit more in common than just being 2D games with some Silent Hill influence, though let it be known if you liked Lone Survivor, you will most likely enjoy this). However, it also manages to create its own feel and tale of horror, and the developments in both gameplay and story for the most part feel satisfying.It's a bit slow, there are a few places where navigating and where you're supposed to go can be a bit confusing. However, the levels have a fun exploration element and will usually reward you for taking time off the beaten path, with a variety of side-quest, goodies, hidden scenes and scares, and more.Speaking of which, the game manages to pack some good scares and ""WTF"" moments through its course. I found myself a bit more comfortable and less on-edge after the first area, but the game managed to put me on edge and make me feel uneasy through the beginning first hour or two, and had its moments throughout its course. Of note, some of my favorite scares are indeed off the beaten path.I might be a bit gushy, but that's because Claire surpassed my expectations and has stood better than most of the other recent horror game releases on Steam I have played. It's a quality horror title for lovers of old-school styled horror with a bit of something new, or those who have come to enjoy 2D horror games like Lone Survivor or Clock Tower. It's rough around the edges, but has the heart, good execution, and cleverness to pull off what it strives to be, and excel at it, despite the few flaws it has.A bit slow, sometimes confusing, and I would not recommend going through it blind on Nightmare difficulty like I did, but a fantastic horror game that brings a lot in from the Silent Hill and Clock Tower class of horror, while also being its own thing that will be worth it for any genre enthusiast. But maybe wait to play through it once some of the bugs are ironed out.			"

												It's a ripoff of Silent Hill 3 as a 2D indie plataformer, but it is an intense gameplay with some scary jumps and pretty freak stuff. Not easy to play even in the ""normal"" mode. Maps are quite messy, sometimes you have no idea where you are going. I should advise that this game is really for fans of survival horror genre, do not expect anything you haven't seen in horror in general, but even not beeing a game for everyone I think it is a good one and pretty well made.

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Claire 

			Views: 112		

			Claire is a 2D horror adventure game where you are trying to figure out the why to what is happening around you. On Steam Here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/252830/ Join us at Twitter or...		

Claire is a 2d horror exploration game where you play as a girl learning about the mysteries of her life and her memories.  The atmosphereof the game is very well done.  The story is not handed to you;  you have to explore and understand what is going on.  The spooky theme of 'danger around every corner' is unsettling, but not necessarily in your face withviolence and monsters.  	The level design, as with many 2D games is mazelike;  the reusage ofsimilar hallways and doorways causes you to have to backtrack a lot.  It can add to a feeling of being lost and contribute to the atmosphere, but for me itwas too much of getting lost and try over and over again to get to the nextdestination.	There is a lot of fetch quests in this game.  Personally I feel like thegame didn't respect my time, as most of it was spent retracing steps and goingon continual missions that just prolonged the gameplay.	The atmosphere is terrific, the story is not what is expected, but enjoyable, and it has a mazelike feel that I found not to be to my taste, but if that is something you enjoy, this could be a game for you. This is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watchif you are looking for a more in-depth review.Thanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:http:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

												Claire is a unique game that plays well. The fact that you run from, rather than attack enemies, adds to the Horror of the game and the position of Claire as a character. Rather than fighting off minions, you'll be faced with dream like sequences that will test your perspective on what can even happen in a sidescroller.			"

												I am only about 3.5 hours in but so far I absolutely have enjoyed this game! It is a beautiful sprite art horror game that has sent me jumping out of my seat a few times already!! I love the throwback SNES artwork and the gameplay is brilliant so far. The navigation around the hospital was a bit tricky at first but once you get the map system it is easy and fun! My only complaint is that the ghouls sometimes make it impossible to get past them and you die without being able to do anything. Maybe I am just bad or missing a mechanic but this happened a few times when I was trying to open a locked door. Either way, I love it so far, would reccommend to anyone who enjoys indie/ 8-16 bit style and horror.			"

Posted: June 7, 2016
												You know, of the forty or so steam games I've reviewed, this is the second ""not recommended"" game I've played, the other being Outlast. I'm surprised, as I thought something like this would be right up my alley.Claire has you playing as, you guessed it, a young woman named Claire. Claire is visiting her mother in the hospital one night when things start getting really whacky. She must explore the hospital and some other areas and uncover the truth of what is going on.The game uses an attractive 2D art style and is side scrolling, much like the far superior Lone Survivor. Using a limited inventory, you must solve puzzles and avoid monsters. The inventory is almost an exact copy of the one from Amnesia: The dark Descent, right down to the health and sanity icons. The inventory sound is almost exactly like the one made in Silent Hill 2. Between that and the obvious influence of Lone Survivor, this should have been a winner.Unfortunately, a lot of what makes these games good is the execution of the atmosphere and story. Amnesia had a pretty compelling narrative, Silent Hill 2 has one of the best video game stories ever, and Lone Survivor was intriguing in its own way. This game, however, feels like a very standard and generic narrative, with obvious reflections of Claire's internal struggles and really simple writing. It doesn't have that spark that superior horror titles have, the depth that comes from the interaction with environments and unique enemies.Speaking of that, another borrowed element from Amnesia is the fact that you can't fight enemies. Instead, you must run and hide. However, this presents some problems. Much like Lone Survivor, it's incredibly easy to get lost since you're playing in a 3D map using a 2D plane. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I was looking at my map once every five or ten seconds. This is exacerbated by the sameness of the hallways. The thing is that enemies don't pause when you open your map, so when you're being chased through multiple rooms, lost and confused, it's pretty irritating. This might be remedied if the enemeis were scary in any way, but they're plain black spider things with white faces. Not very scary. And I'm not saying that good monster design is a necessity, but it certainly doesn't hurt to have something that's creepy to look at.The sanity system also annoys more than anything. There are enemies introduced about halfway through the game that don't directly attack you and instead drain your sanity, which will drain your health if it falls too low. There are several segments later on that require you to go through multiple rooms in a row with these enemies and the screen gets darker and darker the more insane you go. Stopping to heal is a bad idea since your sanity will only fall lower and lower. Again, it's more annoying than intense.There are also some side quests to go on in the form of side characters, but, to be honest, these felt like nothing more than filler. Each one is solved easily within a matter of minutes, except for maybe one near the end of the game, but even that is fine. One of them has you meet a character weirdly reminiscient of Eddy Dombrowski from Silent Hill 2 (although in this game the person is far less interesting). You go through a few rooms just next door, grab an item he wants, bring it back, and bam, done. I didn't feel that these characters really added anything either. They didn't give me more insight or understanding of the story, but maybe that's because the story is so simplistic and basic to begin with.One last thing is the sound. It's totally serviceable, but neither the effects or soundtrack stand out in any way. To me, at least.So while the game is very pretty to look at, it honestly feels like a pale imitator of far better games. I really wanted to enjoy this, as it seemed right up my alley, but alas, not every game will be a winner. It's not the worst thing in the world, but it's very mediocre, with a bland and cheap story, dull exploration (side note: this game gives you tons of abtteries for your flashlight that aren't really needed as the default lighter, which uses no resources, is more than sufficient to see with), and random and out of place side quests. If you can get it on sale and have a few hours to kill, there are worse ways to spend your time, but I'd check out other horror games first. Games like Silent Hill 2, Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Lone Survivor, and Cry of Fear (latter of which is free on Steam and it's awesome!!!!)  before spending money on this title.			"

												So much potentials are wasted!The game so frustrating due to awkward control and bad game design, I could not get through the first hour of playing.Good things abou the game:Great graphicsLoveable charactersCreepy atmosphereProblems with the game:FrustratingBugs (In some occation you can jump over an obstacles but cannot jump back out)Awkward controlNo keyboard control in inventory systemMap is too big and confusing. The map is unnecessarily big with too many rooms as ""Fillers"" just to add to play time.Transition between floors on the map is confusing and not clearly indicatedDoors located at the front are not obvious (especially in darkened room)On the map, you character is marked as glowing dot. The glow is too big, often visually obstruct doors. (it is problematic when you're being chased by monster)Visited rooms on map are marked in green. But sometimes, these markings dissappeared. Making it looks like the room hasn't been visited (I believe this is a bug)Objectives in the game is marked by circle on the map, sometimes the marking dissappeared. Making player confused and lost. (I believe this is a bug)There are many many more small problems with the game, each small problem is not a big deal on their own, but put together is enough to frustrate players. And I got a feeling this game was developed in rush and somewhat unfinished! Or not thoroughly tested before release.Rating: 6/10Only because of the pretty graphics and if you can be patience and get past the clunky game design, you may get some enjoyment out of this game. But not for me.			"

												Probably the closest thing to Silent Hill I've played, going by what everyone else is saying. Claire is an alright game. But although I enjoyed the majority of the game, I do have some problems with it. Hopefully this will be a quick read:Cons:I won't go into spoilers but honestly the games storyline is mostly a huge mess toward part 3/3 of the game (/towards the ending). The thing is that the game knows that it's storyline is confusing, and even basically says so at times. The ending clears up certain things, but there's a lot of ""wut"" in this game. The ending only clears up maybe 1/10th of the things that it should've. Things honestly become a lot less scary overtime. Especially towards the end. While the game does get more odd/creepy down the line the fear-factor will probably eventually wane for most people.Navigating can also be quite a bit of a mess at times. I must've checked my map over 100 times while playing this game for the 6-ish hours I played it for. It's not a huge-huge problem as the map system is pretty simple to use, it's just a tad bit annoying when you keep going in circles.Pros:Claire has some beautiful sprites. The whole game is very pleasant to look at. Obviously there's things that aren't nice to look at, but you get what I mean. The game is very pretty. First and foremost. The game isn't dragged out, but it's not too short either. Like Undertale the game is about 6-8 hours long. All areas are enjoyable and fun to explore.Plenty of side-quests and extra things you can do ingame. Side-quests also matter in Claire so they're 100% worth doing. Though most consist of looking for things. While there's no combat system you're not hopeless to enemies as well. There's plenty of ways to go about handling the majority of enemies who appear in the game.Anubis.While I did enjoy this game more than I didn't, Claire isn't a 10/10. Like I said, the games story can be very confusing and unmotivating at times. Most conversations you have with anybody who isn't a side-quest giving NPC are this way. I'd personally give Claire a 7.5/10. While it has replayability I doubt I'll be touching Claire again for at least a year, if anything. That's not saying it's a bad game though. It's an excelent 1-off game for when you're alone at night. That being said I personally don't think it's worth the $10 pricetag. If it goes on sale it's a nice pickup though.			"

												You often read statements (be they from game developers, reviewers, or whomever) about a new product being a ""love letter"" to a particular genre or sub-genre of game...and usually these games tend to be somewhat ""retro"" in stylings, therefore perhaps begging the more cynical to label the claim as something of an ""apology"".  Something along the lines of: ""Only one or two people made this game, ♥♥♥♥ you, we're not Valve or Gearbox and therein had a budget of precisely ♥♥♥♥-ALL, so you're gonna have to put up with the fact that this doesn't look or play anything like Bioshock Infinite.""  But herein, of course, can lay the beauty of the whole endeavour...that perhaps not ALL of us want to play games like Bioshock Infinite; certainly not ALL the time.  Nice to have a little variety in our life experiences, right?  Which is precisely where ""indie games"" come in, for those of us adventurous enough to take a chance on them.  And Claire, I'm pleased to say, is by and largely one of the good ones.    Getting back to my opening sentence, this is a game which could be readily described as a ""love letter to old-school survival horror"".  Well...sort of.  Firstly, there's the name of the lead character, who happens to wear a red jacket-y thing...a bit like a certain ""Claire Redfield"" character beloved to fans of the Resident Evil series.  Greater overall similarity, however, lies with the almost equally famous and long-running Silent Hill series, at least story-, tone- and location-wise (hospital, school, apartment); and then there's the slightly lesser-known but still quite significant Clock Tower series, which to the best of my knowledge kicked off the whole ""stealth horror"" notion of hiding in closets rather than actually FIGHTING beasties...a tradition which this game merrily follows in.      Oddly enough, though - and perhaps just a little less admirably, I'm sad to say - the game to which this arguably owes the greatest debt is a very, very RECENT one, itself a ""love letter"" to survival horror realised in crude-but-oddly-effective 2D, pixelated form.  Lone Survivor was the name of that game, and I'm kind of suspecting that THIS game may not have existed without it.  That was ALSO a shameless Silent Hill love-in, but y'know, as a huge Silent Hill fan myself, I'm really not gonna complain too bitterly about about EITHER game's existence.  I will, however, opine that Lone Survivor was at least marginally more successful than this one, and now I'll attempt to explain why...    The biggest problems with this game are, quite simply, the mapping and saving systems, neither of which I recall being so problematic in Lone Survivor.  This game faces much the same challenges mapping-wise as the earlier game - that is to say, both being two-dimensional games with confusingly three-dimensional maps - but it's a little poor how few significant locations (including, sometimes, the save points themselves) are clearly marked on the map once you've discovered them.  Expect to get lost...a lot.  The other problem herein is the monsters/evil ghosties you encounter...as they have a tendency to move about as they see fit, knocking down doors and what-have-you.  So not only are you lost, looking for the location of a save point or a puzzle which you are finally able to solve, but there may very well be monsters in the way which weren't there before!  So you try to avoid them (by awkwardly ""jumping"" over them!), maybe take some damage, maybe waste some health items, only to find you've gone the WRONG ♥♥♥♥ING WAY!  A bit unnecessarily frustrating at times, in other words.    Look, I honestly don't have many complaints beyond that - well, okay, there is the fact that the ""action"" bits don't particularly work and get way too frequent towards the end - but I'm certainly grateful that people are inspired to make games like this, and eagerly look forward to whatever the developers get up to in the future.  Suffice it to say, if you loved Lone Survivor, you're gonna like this one too, and the same probably goes for the (at least more open-minded) Silent Hill fan-addicts out there.  Just think of this as the more ""stealth""-oriented of the two super-pixelated Silent Hill ""homages"" recently unleashed upon the market, and decide if that sounds like your ""thang"".  If it does, you're unlikely to be disappointed.Verdict: 8.5/10.			"

Product received for free
												(Edited, as I finished my first playthrough of the game)Got this as a gift but I would have easily paid money for this game. People are right when they say it has the Silent Hill vibes, and there's even references to the series, but it's more than that. I'd classify the gameplay style as more... amnesia-esque. You don't fight the monsters, just run and hide. It still has it's own idenity, but these aspects are found in other horror games. But, as long as it's not a shameless copy and paste or clone, I like it when people learn what gameplay ideas work from other successful games. They took good ideas and evolved them not into something that's neccessarily better (that's all up to opinion) but something that is different.The art style is extremely refreshing, too. Rather unique in my opinion. The enemies/monsters remind me a bit of Yume Nikki, but they are still very much their own style. And the scenery is AMAZING. It works so well. The sound design, when added with it, give it a really good atmosphere that sucks you in. It's quite an immersive world. If I were to criticise one thing, it would be that it doesn't understand quite what made Silent Hill 2 (and 3, but 2 is my personal favorite) the perfect horror game. It isn't... subtle. Granted, once you get into SH2, it goes on strong, but during the beginning the atmosphere, while eerie, isn't in your face with weirdness. I feel like Claire kinda starts off a bit too... jarring. Rather than making things immediately horrifying, start off by making things just weird and scary. Add subtle things. Ease us into the nightmare. It creates better immersion, and makes it feel more ""real"".In the end though, great game. I love it. If you like survival horror that isn't all zombies, then this is definitely something to look at.			"

												So i got this gift from a friend for Xmas and after playing it a little bit, i have not much desire to go on, sorry to say.So we have this game about a girl who, after a short introduction of her childhood that had a traumatic event, is waking up next to her comatose mother and wants to get a coffee.Then all of a sudden the hospital turns to hell and she has to find her way back to her mother.That is pretty much the main story so far as i understood.Graphics:The graphics are nicely done with their 2D pixels and a lot of details to see. I enjoy it, so that is no issue.Sound:Creepy music, scary sound effects, the game has them all and i like it, good one here.Gameplay:2D sidescroller, you walk, you run, you push objects, go through doors and pick up stuff, nothing overly special, but it works. In between you meet enemies that you cannot attack and weird characters you do a task for (mostly finding an item somewhere).That is basically all i saw so far.Navigation doesn't work well, you need to check your ingame map constantly or else you get lost quicker than you can say ""What?"".Add the fact that all the corridors look alike and you don't even have any distinctive feature to let you know where you are, which makes running around and looking for something specific tedious and boring.Controls:Claire can jump, run, pick up stuff and use objects, but it would've been nice to have the option to remap the controls. Using an XBox controller, i was unable to remap the buttons and had to use the (little intuitive) default setting to work with it.Even after so many tries with the map, i cannot get a feel for the menu navigation.Otherwise the controls are responsive and your control over the character is good.Story:I didn't make it far into the game, so i cannot say much about it, but at this point i am more confused than anything else, nothing makes sense and so many questions pop up, i don't know which one to ask first.I suspect a ""It was all a nightmare"" kind of ending for this, even if i am wrong, i doN't have that much hope for the story.Conclusion:The game looks good, sounds good and makes a good first impression and then drops as quickly as a hot potato in your hands.The boring explorations of seemingly endless and repetetive corridors, the lack of action (you basically just run through or away from enemies) and very few exciting parts make this game not worthwhile to me so far.Check out a let's play of it somewhere before you decide if you want it or not.

												To hear my full thoughts on Claire, listen to my review on Game Hoard Podcast[soundcloud.com]Claire is a sidescrolling survival horror game with 16-bit-esque graphics. The horror is of the psychological variety, with you questioning what is real throughout the game. The game controls like a typical sidescroller but gameplay is firmly rooted in classic survival horror games. You have to explore, find items, solve puzzles, and avoid being killed by enemies, all while uncovering the story of the game. Along the way there are also a number of other characters to meet who present side quests and choices for you to make. Your choices, including whether or not to complete these missions, determines what kind of ending you get, of which there are many.Overall, we found the game very enjoyable in a twisted way. The game relies on building a constant sense of tension, rather than jump scares, in order to frighten players. You have no way to defend against enemies, items you need to survive are scarce, and you can only save in certain rooms which are spread out across large areas. While all of this makes the game very intense to play, it can also potentially lead to frustration since dying means a significant loss of progress.What's more frustrating though is trying to navigate sprawling 3D environments while moving in a 2D plane. Every time you enter a new room it's not clear if you are moving north, south, east, or west. Luckily, there is a map to help with this, but it's terribly inconsistent and lacking in detail. As a result, a lot of the game is spent feeling lost, which may be a good or bad thing for a survival horror game, depending on how you look at it.If you can get past these frustrations, Claire is a great survival horror game that I think fans of the genre will really enjoy.

			This is my first impressions of Claire by Hailstorm Games. Enjoy. I also posted my first impressions on steam. You can read it here -...		

Initially the game wouldn't boot with an error message saying missing executable. The generic steam solution did not work for me. Found  solution  (yeah click there to see it yourself!) on community hub courtesy of steam user ZedNo_0. In steam more Claire/Claire folder contents into the primary Claire folder. This worked for me. Also apparently the developer's are working on an update.I've played for about 40 minutes so far to get a feel for the game.Graphics look good. Sound effects and ambience also create the right atmosphere.You explore the maze like room's of a creepy hospital hospital trying to reach one objective after another while avoiding or running away from scary ghost monsters.Navigating the environment can be disorientating at first especially when you find yourself in an area with a new map for the first time. But once you get used to the map system it's pretty straight forward and that didn't really take me that long. You can use a torch but I didn't pay attention to all the tutorial explanations so I'm not what it's purpose really was. You have no means to fight the monsters. But you often have no choice but to go through rooms that they occupy whether it be by running past them and taking damage or getting around them somehow. They move faster than you. While you can run away from them, if you only move into the next room they will break down the door to get you. So they are pretty frightening lol. I think there is a strategy avoiding them e.g. luring them to a room with a closet you can hide in and waiting for them to go past. But I wasn't that advanced.The game seem's to be pretty good so far. Reminds me of Silent hill especially with the comatose woman in the hospital bed. As long as it remain challenging, entertaining and isn't too short it should well worth the price.Click here for more let’s play videos =)			"

												Claire is a very interesting take being a 2D horror game, it captures a sense of being lost and alone, mixed with a nice bit of humor. With out really know too much of what is going on you embark on an adventure into the life of a young woman named... well Claire. The game does have an issue in it's mapping system that CAN be confusing only AT TIMES, but otherwise is a very great game any fan of horror should seriously concider, if you are still curious feel free to check out my own playthrough of the game in the link below.

												I wanted to like this game. I like the retro art, the sound design (very spooky atmosphere) the little details like how your character and her dog sit and rest if you idle.I can't comment on the story because I didn't get far into it. Why am I stopping playing after one hour? Because the gameplay is frustrating, confusing and tedious. I'm not sure what they were thinking, trying to simulate a maze-like structure in a 1d (just left and right) series of corridors. It's nothing but an interminable series of corridors, confusingly laid out. Oh there's a map, but it is no help at all. Not to menion buggy, with markers either misplaced or missing.You spend your time moving left or right, opening hundreds, thousands, millions of doors, and occasionally sprinting away from a monster. And that's it. I can't emphasise how tedious and boring the corridor after corridor gets, and how confusing it is trying to navigate massive levels in that way. It completely deflated my will to continue playing.			"

												If you enjoyed Lone Survivor, you'll most likely enjoy this. Great atmosphere and moments that had me curling my toes. The only complaint I have is navigation (you'll be running in circles at times wondering where to go/what to do), and a couple of puzzles seemed impossible to figure out (no clues nearby). It can be a little text heavy at times too (I skipped some cutscenes because tl;dr) and unfortunately this made me lost with the story, so just keep it in mind if you're a reader or not. All in all, I'd say it's worth it's price though.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I enjoy the Lone Survivor (And ultimately Silent Hill) theme the game has going. But, it feels like one long waste of time. The very first real exploration of the game, the hospital, is just one long winding labyrinth of rooms and hallways peppered with the occasional shadow that you have to run a mile to find a hiding spot to escape from.The problem is, the game just doesn't give you enough for what it makes you go through. There's ostensibly a map section in the game menu, but I have yet to find a map. There's a flashlight that uses a finite source of energy, but it has no obvious purpose since visibility doesn't seem to be an issue. There's white butterflies you can collect, but I'll be damned if I can figure out what they're for.As I said, I really wanted to like this game, but it's just too frustrating and obscure for me to find playable. I don't recommend it.			"

												Claire was a great buy for me. As a fan of Silent Hill I've been scrounging the depths of the horror genre, and part of my search led me to this game. At the time it was on sale (for only a couple of dollars), and I love to support indie developers and try new things, so I decided to buy it. Definitely worth the buy! Not only was this game similar in horror aspects to Silent Hill, but even the sounds of the game, map layouts, and story were very similar and did very well for the overall feel of the game. Do not get this game if you do not enjoy puzzles, Silent Hill gameplay (extensive map checking, awkward camera angles, learning to run, etc), or sanity levels (this is a huge part of the later reaches of the game). However, if you appreciate good stories that tie into the horror aspects, a strong female protagonist, interesting NPCs, dogs (Anubis is just plain adorable!), and exploring the deep recesses of the mind then this is the game for you!I would reach to give this game a 9/10 because it fulfilled my horror buzz, the story was amazing, Claire and Anubis were wonderful, and the graphics (though not the best in the world) were quite appealing to me. The only point I would take away would be for the gameplay itself. It got quite hard at times because you can't fight the enemies and they constantly chase you through doors all the while your sanity meter drops you down to horrified in a second in certain areas and you lose the rest of your health because you are scared. It's very hard to get away, and Claire's stamina is not very good, so you get very slow very fast. The only other problem I had with it was the bug which, whenever you hit the accept button on the menu screen made you hit the accept button on the actual map as well. I would be hiding in a closet from an enemy, pull out my map on my menu, hit accept, and I would die because it would bring me out of the closet as well. Regardless of the criticisims this game is wonderful, and is definitely worth the buy for classic horror fans!			"

Posted: December 7, 2014
												   Claire is a 2D low-fi horror game that relies heavily on scenery and atmosphere, and not jumpscares or horrifying imagery. Unfortunately, due to its nature, Lone Survivor comparisons are inevitable, and I think this game has less of an impact because of that exact reason. (I have seen people stating that the horror from both of these games borrows a lot from Silent Hill, but I have yet to play those)   I enjoyed this game quite a lot, but it certainly isn't flawless, design-wise. I'll discuss important points later, and just give you a general overview of how the game works.   I'll try to give a short overview of the game. Regarding other 2D, low-pixel horror games, Lone Survivor and Home spring to my mind. This is far closer to LS than Home, but with fewer interesting mechanics, and certainly has a more streamlined story (leaving a few unanswered questions regardless).   You play as Claire, and you don't know exactly where you are, despite the familiarity of the places you visit. There's always something wrong. Your job is to piece all the memories revealed to you with the symbolism present in order to find why you're there and more important, if you deserve to leave. The narrative is well put together, it was pretty interesting to me! Visual and Audio Design   As I said, it's very low-fi, but in a good way! Just like the previous games mentioned, the game gives you an outline for how the sceneries look, and let your mind take care of the little details. Overall, I think it looks really good. Besides, it also features modern lighting effects that give this game an edge over many retro looking games.   The sound-effects are also very raw and disturbing, and it's where I find the biggest similarities with LS. There's a lot of static noise, rather than the usual screaming. However, while LS did come as a surprise to me, this didn't felt quite as unique (although, I'm not trying to take credit away from this game, only talking about my subjective perception). Both the visual and the audio design fits together very nicely, and creates the kind of disturbing and uncomfortable horror that I like. Overall mechanics   Your character has both Health and Fear, both of which can be replenished with different consumables. As excepted, enemies and disturbing places will make you more fearful, and may even decrease your health if you're on the verge of sanity. When enemies attack you, you also lose health. Scavenging for consumables is important, especially because you can not kill enemies, only run away from them. Literally. Stealth is almost inexistent, but I'll detail it later on.(1)   You have a lighter (that lights a small radius around you), and you later get a Flashlight, that consumes batteries, but it's more potent, and can also illuminate where you point with the mouse. This is a pretty cool feature, but it also carries some minor problems.(2)   Enemies can follow you through rooms by destroying doors (the first times takes a while, but after that, they're pretty fast to change rooms). When you're spotted, your best bet is to run away, and try to loose them. You can do it by changing to a room twice without them seeing you, or hide in closets while they're breaking down the door. While it works, for the most part, not being able to attack them can be frustrating, especially when you're at low HP. This leaves less room to explore as well.   Around the places, you can find Notes (written by someone close to you) that may hint at why you're there and what it is. You may also find some people, that may even be more lost that you do. Each of them brings a different perspective on life, based on their own situation. I found these to be pretty nice, and they also added some interesting bits to the game's ""message"" and narrative.   Other than that, there are also some puzzles. This are half great, half poor. Some of them simply depend on environmental clues and are fairly easy, if you pay attention. These rely on clues around that particular puzzle, and not ones that you may or may not have found 3 hours before. This makes for good pacing!   Others, are more reliant on riddles. While they were cool, they were also a bit too ambiguous. After I knew the solution, I could see it made sense, but there were also other equally valid possibilities... That was not so good. I liked the idea, but I don't think the execution was quite there.    Regardless, these puzzles are far apart, and there are not a lot. They're there to change pacing, and they do just that pretty well.   I'll try to go into some details now. 1. Saving and Map Systems   I've found some problems with these. There are safe rooms spread around the maps, where you can save. There's no other kind of checkpoints, it's all manual and only in certain rooms. This could be fine, but I didn't like it very much.   As I've mentioned, the maps are very maze-like in their construction. There are lots of locked doors, doors that only open from one side, crawlspaces, etc. While the ""blocked"" doors are marked on the map after you try to open them, it's still very messy. Each map is a bit too cluttered, which is a problem when you're trying to explore everything.  I know that being lost can be a pretty crucial part to horror, but it's hard to couple that with exploration. All the notes, people, butterflies, etc. that you collect do affect the ending, despite being optional. The endings are determined by your overall attention to detail. But I digress.   Add to this, the fact that you can't kill nor avoid enemies. And Sprinting has a cooldown (as expected). If you find an unexpected enemy, you'll simply run, and try to enter the closest door. This is a recepy to get lost in 5 seconds. The map marks visitted rooms, which is good, and you can get back to where you were, but now knowing that there's an enemy waiting for you. Later on, it's also easy to run from one enemy and bump into another, and end up 7 rooms away from where you wanted to be, with a few more collectables and low HP. After this, it's very easy to die, especially if an enemy happens to be at a door where you enter a room.    It's a bit convoluted, sorry, but this is how I felt. It got messy. And the biggest problem was to get the progress gone when you died. The safe rooms aren't too far between, but were enough for it to be frustrating when going for the collectibles, for which you need to explore every corner.   This is also tied to the fact that enemies can't be beaten, and rarely avoided without taking damage. Later on, the maps get more confusing (intentionally so, which was part awesome, part annoying), so this problem aggravates itself.   I think it's just a problem tied to making the game focus on Exploration and Tension at the same time, two almost paradoxical concepts. 2. Mouse controlled Flashlight   This is very minor, but worth noting nonetheless. The flashlight is the only thing you need the mouse to control in this game. Literally the only thing. When you're walking with the lighter only, the result is a mouse pointer on the screen. Oops, there goes immersion.    I think that it is a cool mechanic, but it would have been much better if the game featured other mouse-driven mechanics, even if they were very minor.  3. Invincible Enemies   I'll tackle this again quickly. Enemies are far scarier if you feel defenseless, certainly! However, the player should never be this defenseless, just for the fact that it hinders the gameplay, at times where the tension is low. I think that LS avoided this problem very elegantly. You were hopeless if an enemy surprised you, you were hopeless and had to run. Otherwise, you could attract them with meat, and then stealthily avoid them.   Even if not unique, Claire is well put together, and features good psych-horror! "

												   Claire is a 2D low-fi horror game that relies heavily on scenery and atmosphere, and not jumpscares or horrifying imagery. Unfortunately, due to its nature, Lone Survivor comparisons are inevitable, and I think this game has less of an impact because of that exact reason. (I have seen people stating that the horror from both of these games borrows a lot from Silent Hill, but I have yet to play those)   I enjoyed this game quite a lot, but it certainly isn't flawless, design-wise. I'll discuss important points later, and just give you a general overview of how the game works.   I'll try to give a short overview of the game. Regarding other 2D, low-pixel horror games, Lone Survivor and Home spring to my mind. This is far closer to LS than Home, but with fewer interesting mechanics, and certainly has a more streamlined story (leaving a few unanswered questions regardless).   You play as Claire, and you don't know exactly where you are, despite the familiarity of the places you visit. There's always something wrong. Your job is to piece all the memories revealed to you with the symbolism present in order to find why you're there and more important, if you deserve to leave. The narrative is well put together, it was pretty interesting to me! Visual and Audio Design   As I said, it's very low-fi, but in a good way! Just like the previous games mentioned, the game gives you an outline for how the sceneries look, and let your mind take care of the little details. Overall, I think it looks really good. Besides, it also features modern lighting effects that give this game an edge over many retro looking games.   The sound-effects are also very raw and disturbing, and it's where I find the biggest similarities with LS. There's a lot of static noise, rather than the usual screaming. However, while LS did come as a surprise to me, this didn't felt quite as unique (although, I'm not trying to take credit away from this game, only talking about my subjective perception). Both the visual and the audio design fits together very nicely, and creates the kind of disturbing and uncomfortable horror that I like. Overall mechanics   Your character has both Health and Fear, both of which can be replenished with different consumables. As excepted, enemies and disturbing places will make you more fearful, and may even decrease your health if you're on the verge of sanity. When enemies attack you, you also lose health. Scavenging for consumables is important, especially because you can not kill enemies, only run away from them. Literally. Stealth is almost inexistent, but I'll detail it later on.(1)   You have a lighter (that lights a small radius around you), and you later get a Flashlight, that consumes batteries, but it's more potent, and can also illuminate where you point with the mouse. This is a pretty cool feature, but it also carries some minor problems.(2)   Enemies can follow you through rooms by destroying doors (the first times takes a while, but after that, they're pretty fast to change rooms). When you're spotted, your best bet is to run away, and try to loose them. You can do it by changing to a room twice without them seeing you, or hide in closets while they're breaking down the door. While it works, for the most part, not being able to attack them can be frustrating, especially when you're at low HP. This leaves less room to explore as well.   Around the places, you can find Notes (written by someone close to you) that may hint at why you're there and what it is. You may also find some people, that may even be more lost that you do. Each of them brings a different perspective on life, based on their own situation. I found these to be pretty nice, and they also added some interesting bits to the game's ""message"" and narrative.   Other than that, there are also some puzzles. This are half great, half poor. Some of them simply depend on environmental clues and are fairly easy, if you pay attention. These rely on clues around that particular puzzle, and not ones that you may or may not have found 3 hours before. This makes for good pacing!   Others, are more reliant on riddles. While they were cool, they were also a bit too ambiguous. After I knew the solution, I could see it made sense, but there were also other equally valid possibilities... That was not so good. I liked the idea, but I don't think the execution was quite there.    Regardless, these puzzles are far apart, and there are not a lot. They're there to change pacing, and they do just that pretty well.   I'll try to go into some details now. 1. Saving and Map Systems   I've found some problems with these. There are safe rooms spread around the maps, where you can save. There's no other kind of checkpoints, it's all manual and only in certain rooms. This could be fine, but I didn't like it very much.   As I've mentioned, the maps are very maze-like in their construction. There are lots of locked doors, doors that only open from one side, crawlspaces, etc. While the ""blocked"" doors are marked on the map after you try to open them, it's still very messy. Each map is a bit too cluttered, which is a problem when you're trying to explore everything.  I know that being lost can be a pretty crucial part to horror, but it's hard to couple that with exploration. All the notes, people, butterflies, etc. that you collect do affect the ending, despite being optional. The endings are determined by your overall attention to detail. But I digress.

												This 2-D pixaleated horror game is about a girl named Claire who after visiting her mother one day in the hospital suddenly finds the hospital abandoned and for the most part in rubbles. She must explore the hospital in order to find out what happend. While there aren't what I would call jump scares, the hospital environment is ominous. Claire will encounter dark 'ghosts' (not sure if that's what they are) which she can only outrun. Later when she gains her companion dog he can alert her to oncoming ghosts. There are a few puzzles to complete, and a storyline begins to emerge the further you get in this ""maze"". Overall, its a really nice game, good amount of creepy, and has a good storyline. There are multiple endings depending on how you play, so play keeping that in mind!There are a couple cons that were a bit infuriating; the amount of doors you have to walk through and their confusing positions. Some of them are so close its hard to figure out where at times I am going on the map. The map is mostly useful, with a couple of time it can also be confusing like the crawlspaces and mysterious floors you land on with no maps. Also, Claire has the stamina of a moridbly obese geriatric.  She'll literally run for a second and be out of breathe. Believe me, even if I was in horrendous shape, if I saw a creepy spirit following me I would find stamina from somewhere. I'm not a huge fan of stamina in games (because I like my character to run on default), but if it has to be put in to boost up the difficulty I wish it was at least more realistic. Tl; dr Awesome simple horror game, few cons but nothing that would ruin it for me personally. Worth it!			"

												Ever want to play Silent Hill as a platformer? Enjoy getting lost in map screens? Do you like jumpscares?If the answers to any of the above are ""yes"", play this game- it's pretty cheap.This game♥♥♥♥♥♥♥with you- it has a few Hideo Kojima moments- such as one where looking at a specific item makes it appear that your computer has the blue screen of death- as well as a number of pretty well designed scares. The main enemies never stop being scary- mostly because they can kill you before you can say ""where are those hellish screams coming from?"" This game actually, legitimately, terrifies me on occasion- but mostly it makes me grind my teeth in frustration and the fear is that I'll have to replay the same hour of gameplay again because I couldn't find a save point in time.This game is limited by its eternal flowing forward and its dearth of save points- while gathering items to survive, I stumbled into the next chapter of the story (chapters which you cannot go back from), leaving me to miss out on several completion criteria- and hadn't saved in a while because there are only 2 or so save stations per level.I can already hear the cries of ""Git Gud"" resounding- and if you play this game, you're gonna need to- enemies kill you fast, track you down mercilessly, loiter outside doors without warning, your direction walking changes depending on where you're positioned in the building- the list goes on.Al in all, if there was an option for a ""eh, play it if you have time and are bored"" rating, I'd give it that. As it stands, there isn't. Wait for a steam sale to buy it.			"

												Claire looks and plays great, it is reminds me of Lone Survivor in terms of artistic direction. The only thing I want to point out is that the map and directions take a bit getting used to, the map is in a standard layout but you navigate around in a 2D platform view and doors that line either side of a room can be confusing. The puzzles were challenging and took some thinking to get through. The storyline pacing was great as well and the ending was worth playing through just to get there IMO.10/10You can check out my Let's Play of Claire:

												I enjoyed the experience and felt quite attached to the main character, if you've had similar dysfunctions then it's probably easier to sympathize with her rather than brush her off as ""whiny.""It's like Lone Survivor in a number of ways that I won't spoil because it goes beyond simply looking similar and I appreciate there being no true combat in the game, it make things tense where they might not have been because hey, you have a weapon, nothing to worry about. Dead Space comes to mind there. (calm yourselves, I enjoyed Dead Space too)If you're looking for a game that explores feelings of guilt, isolation, grief and familial anger, then you should consider getting this. It does however contain a degree of backtracking, not to mention the potential to miss certain NPCs if you don't check every single room and thus miss out on a fuller picture of the story.			"

												I bought this game about a day after the steam release.  While looking similar to Lone Survivor, I didn't dismiss it as some knock off since I try to give most horror games a chance.  Pretty interesting game.  Good amount of story to get into while not feeling conveluted or trying too hard to be 'deep'.  The main character can be somewhat relateable and immersion isn't difficult.Sound is great. Talked to their sound designer on Reddit and seemed like a cool guy (even took the time to give some tips in networking so + to the devs)   it was memorable and the sounds had a fit to the atmosphere. Seeing a television on felt like a safe area and/or dream like atmosphere.   I have some things I did not like. and it may contain some small spoilers.Not enough dog involvement. Kind of like a radio from Silent HIll in alerting the player of enemy presense. Would like to see more.Not a fan of the map.Not too much going on in the enemy area.  Most enemies are different sizes of scribbly eyes. There are the faceless creatures but ...that's about it.  Still some tough spots and they get the job done.I really think there's a lot more that can be done in this game.  But it does the job for a short side scrolling survival horror game.  Happy with the purchase and I'd say buy it now it's on sale!			"

												I would like to start off by saying, this game is great if you have some patience.There were times have I found myself stuck, of not knowing where to go. I eventually figure it out, and it's great when I do. These times are not many, but it will most likely happen time-to-time.The enimies are not very hard and you can just run by them and avoid them, I don't like this being that easy actually, it takes away from the horror aspect of the game. Don't get me wrong, this game is scarier than a lot I've played, but the eentnvirom had more horror than the enemies. The enemy design was great, but the presentations was kind of lacking.HOWEVER, this game is still great! I would reccomend this game a hundred times over! The sound design is awesome, catching the mood of panic when being chased, intense emotions when the story needed it, great suspence of what was to come. Simply put, spot on! The story is great and engaging, making you feel for the sruggles of Claire and what sheis going through. Even though the situation is fictional, you feel you can relate to how she feels and handles things, especially durring the flashbacks.The feel of this game is perfect and I love the design of it. The enviroments you explore are beautiful and well put together, making you want to go in every room and see as much of it as you can.The art style is great and has a nice touch of retro-like graphics while still staying modern. The game is fun to play even with the few complaints I had, and it is still a great experiance.			"

												Pretty great game, especially for those that liked Lone Survivor and Silent Hill, like everyone else recommending this game has said. While I definitely think survival horror fans should all try this game, there are a few things that kind of bother me that I think are worth mentioning:1. Still kinda glitchy, especially the map and inventory screens. I should be able to just hover my mouse over an item and see what it does; it doesn't always work right. Markers on the map ended up being a nightmare too. I could add one, several, or none depending on where I was, and I could never remove any. I think there are also keys or buttons you can use to throw away inventory items? I could usually just ""use"" an item to get rid of it anyway, but this stuff would have been good to know, and I don't think the game ever told me how to do it.2. Besides the narrative importance, the dog wasn't very useful for the actual game. Besides growling when enemies are nearby, I can't say I ever witnessed or was informed of anything useful they could do. I imagine it was inspired by the dog from Haunting Ground, so... why not borrow some more of that? I dunno, just having running or hiding being your only option with enemies got to feel sort of tedious.3. If you're already big on Silent Hill, this comes with the territory, but the maps can range from slightly convoluted to ""where on Earth am I or am I even still on Earth?"" It's made less painful than SH since the map loads up quickly, but you will be checking it a lot.The game definitely has its quirks, but if you like the games it was inspired by, you should be golden. Everything besides what I mentioned was either good or great. The music was all moody and sounded good enough. The graphics, which seem to be inspired by LS, manage to actually outdo it with some of the fancier lighting effects (IMO). Enemy variety is okay, but it doesn't matter too much since you just run from everything, I guess. I'd have to say that for the sake of reference, I still prefer Lone Survivor over this, but this game does a lot of cool stuff in its own right.			"

The puzzels in the game can be abit tricky but mostly you just need your brain to funktion wich mine dident do most of the times. But hey thats just me!.But i can recommend this game for its good atmosphere, the horror it gives and the great sound that takes you in to the game and really feels that there is something behind you almost evey time.

												The games art is very nice, but the monsters are extremely annoying especially since you are limited on how much you can run. I understand the concept they tried to go with having the game this way but it did not play well and ended up making be very frustrated.The saves are placed on very annoying locations, if i missed a save point and die by the time I can find it I have to start all over again. The notes in the game are silly and are pointless to read because they offer no information. The story is EXTREMELY predictable, the moment the game starts and the intro begins you can get a grasp of whats going to happen. The puzzles are really done poorly! there is no justification as to why these puzzles have to be done. Turn a knob and I get an item? what told me to do this? why would i look for this items? this is why people have notes in games to show you why an item or a puzzle needs to be done, but in this game they don't. There is a disconnect with the character and her goals of finding the truth. There is little to zero hints as to how a puzzle should be done and a lot of it can be solved by guessing or trial and error. They are also people you save in this game that kinda disappear and the character does not question this, a lot of things she does not question, she just rolls along with it.			"

												Interesting premise and pretty to look at with an  amazing intro that makes you hope for the best, but unfortunately not much else. If you want something scary better check out Lone Survivor or the free-to-play (but not on steam) The Witch's House. Now that I think about it, even Home was scarier, and nothing even happens in that game.... The only terrifying factor that Claire has going for it is the dread you feel each time you get lost in one of those ENDLESS doors and corridors having only an ...inconveniently designed map to help you out.I liked the fact that the story was open to interpretation, but even that was done poorly. The story was so open you didn't even have a reason to care or try to find out what happened. Again. Home did it better.To be fair the game had some interesting puzzles but for some reason those were the optional ones. But seriously, in a hell-like world you have a guardian dog named Anubis? WOW.

												10/10 horror game. It's got a great story, great creep and scare factor, and great difficulty scale.There is NG+ and many, MANY endings. That is, the core story remains the same, how ever more or less information along with extra scenes are provided as a result of your actions throughout the game. I got the B ending, and would definitely replay in the future for the AAA ending.There is very minor item management—that is to say I've never run out of space—and moving items around can be a bit buggy.

												You decide to play a door opening simulator.  You walk through hallway after hallway, each looking the same as the last.

												Really wanted to like this game. I was really interested by the story and atmosphere and pixel art style, but navigating the rooms and just trying to figure out how to get around literally gave me a terrible headache. The map system is broken; if it could be retooled, I'd be motivated to pick this game up again. Every time you go through a door you have to pull up the map and try to make sense of how going through said door got you to where you ended up. And let me be clear: this doesn't succeed at making you feel lost like Claire in a fun way, it's only tedious. I was considering playing through with a guide to help with the frustrating map, because I really do want to continue the story, but it's just too much of a low point to want to spend the time.			"

Shameless plug aside, Claire really does feel like a breath of fresh air on the indie Scene. The story, feel, art and the overall feel just comes together perfectly. I've played games with ten times the budget and three times the pricetag that didn't creep me out this much cough*daylight*cough.Overall the game comes together very well. Only two downsides to this game. Not able to set your own controls. I feel that is a must anymore(just my feeling). And the gameplay at times does feel a little too tunnel vision linear forced on you. Highly suggest you check it out.			"

I recommend it for the actual moment. It has a very unique soundtrack for the most part, the art is good (even though it's a tiny bit too pixelated for its own good) The monsters so far aren't very creepy to me... But the atmosphere is definitely there!Also, the devs specified that they would upgrade their map system so i suggest you wait until then so you have a better experience because otherwise you'll end up spamming that friggin' map non-stop (like i did)			"

												Before I get into this review, let me just say that I really like this game. No, seriously, I do. Rather, I really really want to like it.This is a 2D psychological horror at it's finest. At least that's the impression I got when I loaded up the game. It takes indirect inspirations from games like Lone Survivor, whilst at the same time taking direct inspiration (and even sound samples) from games like Silent Hill. The story is presented in a way that makes me really want to keep on playing. And makes me hope that I actually can keep on playing.Which brings me to why I am not recommending this game, and I will leave it that way until I can determine if this download simply is bugged (wouldn't be the first time) or if the game just really is generally this buggy. Yes, there are a lot of nitpicks that I have with this game, such as the wonky controls, the strange way the flashlight works (it's not like it doesn't make sense, but it just feels and looks awkward), and the general map set up (It's 2D, and if you expect to know where you are, you're going to need to use this map) are problems that hamper the overall game's feel.But these are ignorable, just because the story seems very interesting. No, the main problem with this game is the bugs. Holy cheese and crackers Batman, this game is incredibly easy to break. At least that's the way it feels. The first time I tried playing through this game, I ended up getting stuck, and wandering around the same areas over and over again trying to find what I needed to progress. Oddly enough, it was a door that wouldn't open for me. When I tried a second time, it was actually a puzzle that would not respond to anything that I did a little later into the game. Between that, various sound glitches, and other weird occurances, I just  found myself not wanting to play this game.The only reason I even decided to try again the second time was because it was brought up by another player in a Top 10 Horror Games of 2014 list. So with that said, I cannot say for sure that this game truly is not worth recomending. I personally cannot recommend it, but if one can't, and nine others can, I say it might be worth giving it a shot if it's on sale. I will edit this review and change the reccomendation to an immediate ""Yes"" once I've discovered that it was just a defective download. Because while this game is far from perfect even without the game breaking bugs, it's still an experiance that looks like it's worth checking out.If just to hear that familiar Silent Hill item pickup sound.

												I'd figure I would write my last review, or you know, my pseudo reviews that have absolutely nothing to do with gaming. I guess you can say I'm tired, too tired to even give a♥♥♥♥♥♥anymore. Misanthropy can no longer be my companion, nor death my lover. I have seen a lot of things in my life, too much actually. A lot of the bad♥♥♥♥♥♥has shaped me into what I am today. I'm not actually playing the victim,♥♥♥♥♥♥ with my attitude you couldn't even tell what's affecting me. You know that poker face, but you are actually dying on the inside. Every day it feels like your flesh is being rended, and nothing, not one day thing gets better. If something good does happen, I have to worry about if something horrific is going to occur. For the last four years I have been at a stand still. I go to work, to a job I hate, with a boss I hate, and people who are nothing but druggies, pedophiles and drunks. I have to worry about If today Is the day I am going to get into a fight with one of these welfare cretins and either wind up getting shot or stabbed or me killing someone out of the shear rage I have in my heart. Out of all the years I have been working, I've only met one nice person, and she still lives at the motel I work at, she works at a job where she sees death everyday, and her and her husband drown their pain in alcohol. Now this is the point where you would normally say, oh wow, you are complaining, suck it up ♥♥♥♥♥ boy, other people have it worse. I know other people have it worse, and I know that things could be worse than what I am dealing with, it's just that I am tired, and I keep trying to reiterate this point to people. I can't live in a facade that most people try to delude themselves into. It's a joke, because most people don't even think about others. For instance, you ever lose a best friend of ten plus years, over some gold digger ♥♥♥♥♥ you warned him about, than have him spread lies about you, and it wasn't the first time he has lied about you, he's been doing it the whole entire friendship. This guy lied to my mother on her deathbed saying we will always be together. Yeah, funny how these things turn out. Than others tell me to trust again, you have to give people a chance, not everyone is the same, I was optimistic a long long time ago, I would help others at a drop of a dime, I would offer any and all assistance that could be humanly possible. I was used for money, my kindness, my shoulder, and when it's all said and done, I'm alone at the end of the day. Not even my family can comfort me, I hate them. The only people who I adore most in the world are my mother and her sister, my aunt. Every other person In my family I have ever loved is dead and buried. I still live with this pain every single ♥♥♥♥ing day, losing a loved one is not easy, and people who say it gets easier are ♥♥♥♥ing liars, it hasn't gotten any easier all these years. Speaking of the rest of my family, my millionaire aunt, not the one I love, stole my house away from me, she got my senile grandfather to sign a will stating that she would be soul inheritor of the house. So I was damn near homeless last year. It's all one big joke, if I can't see the humor in it all, I don't know what I would do. I can only preserver and continue my mundane existence. Or I would say and believe this, if I didn't want to change this, but I do, and apparently antidepressants and stimulants are not going to change the chemistry of my mind. If you haven't seen someone with medication resistant depression now you have, now I'm under the supervision of a neurologist to become their monkey to experiment on. So In closing it is what it is, and if you haven't seen me in a while, it's because I took that vacation to Puerto Rico or Thailand, or at the very least possibly died do to some unknown circumstances. Read this and laugh, call me out on it, do whatever, but know this. I wish for the best for anyone who is reading this, and hope that your life isn't as filled with pain at mine was. This isn't my suicide letter, this is my letter to know that this was the day that I took the first step to changing all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that life has fed me, and if worse comes to worse or I attain that happiness, at least I tried at the end.This has been Apostle, may my love for you, and prosperity and good fortune find you in life, and my you attain your dreams. I've been overdue for a break, and this time, I think I'm going to take that vacation, I could use some sun lol. "

												Pros-Aesthetically it's really interesting and works well-Sound design is good-Story/Mystery is intriguing (full disclosure, I haven't finished it yet)-Reminds me of Silent Hill (in a good way)Cons-Art design might not work for some buyers-Navigation can be a little frustrating-Setting might be a little clicheOk, now that that's all done I can share some direct thoughts in long form. I spotted this game on sale while it was in my queue and was intrigued. Personally, I love horror games and any that draw inspiration (whether or  not they admit to it) from titles like Silent Hill are at least worth some consideration. This game bears some similarities to that series which is usually a good thing. All in all I enjoyed my time playing Claire. I really need to sit down and finish it one of these days. Perhaps once I'm finally done with 14 hour school days. If you're reading this and considering going to college don't take more than 18 credits. You're gonna have a bad time.			"

												It started out interesting, but then it became extremely repetitive and rather boring. It was easy to get lost in the game even with the map as sometimes I would go through one door and find myself in a completely different map-area and when I tried to head back through the same door to get back to where I was before, it wouldn't let me go back and it would take forever to get back to where I needed to be. The save points aren't frequent enough for my taste and it's easy to lose track of your sanity and health. I am afraid I was disappointed with this game :(			"

												Looks like a really good game. Sadly it is currently unplayable for me : can't rebind keyboard or gamepad keys. Since I use an azerty keyboard and the game presumes that you use a qwerty keyboard, it just doesn't play well at all and as I said you can't rebind the keys. No luck with a gamepad either. Just wait until the dev's fix that.I will keep my negative review, I'd just like to point out that after 2 years the games still isn't patched. The dev clearly disrespected his customers by promising a patch that never came while the game has tons of problems (can't rebind key being just one of them). So do yourself a favor and avoid this game and this dev !			"

												A lot of potential, but doesn't live up to it. This is mainly a 2D side-scrolling hallway navigation game with some survival horror elements thrown in (elements which are the only compelling part of an otherwise tedious game) and a COMPLETELY WORTHLESS ""map"". The plot and characters are so vague as to be uninvolving after the initial revelations, and the puzzle resolutions are often COMPLETELY unintuitive -- NOTHING in the game will even SUGGEST how various puzzles could be solved, so plan to rely entirely on dumb luck or a walkthrough. Especially since the map is so buggy players should NEVER consult it -- it will be wrong roughly 75% of the time.			"

												I'm glad I bought it on sale.This game isn't exactly bad but it's not the greatest either. The controls are ok, but the map doesn't really help much when you look at it. The map is an overview map and it's a side scrolling game. I'm sure you can see the issue.It's like a watered down Silent Hill but sidescrolling (I could swear most of the sounds were lifted from Silent Hill!). You wander around through rooms looking for helpful items while running away from things in the dark. If you're looking to be scared this game won't do it, unless you scare easy. The music and sounds are creepy  and can startle you when you happen on some unexpected monsters but you won't have nightmares.			"

The controls can't be remappedNaivgation is insane..you have to keep checking the map every 30 seconds to know wher eyou are and with a gamepad (which can't be remapped as I said) it means going into the inventory menu and selecting MAP.  The game supposedly will let you remap that to a button but it doesn't work.   The place is big and side scrolling view is confusing as hell.  Save points too far apart and too few.  It will be a long time between save points and sometimes it very easy to get killed (one shot and reload) and then reloading trying to remember what you have done and where you have been is difficult.  A plain old ""save anywhere you want"" is sorely needed.So far with just over an hour played it is incredibly frustrating.  I regret my purchase because it's just too annoying to play. "

												Ah, the consternation that always follow excitement. Claire looked interesting to me, blatant Lone Survivor influences (would that make Claire a homage of a homage?) and all. But the minute I started playing, something felt wrong, empty and shallow. Comparing this game to Lone Survivor or Silent Hill is in some regards somewhat laughable. To begin with, the sound design does not compare in any way to the either of the aforementioned games. What I first noticed, was the mixing of the footstep sounds that were incredibly quiet, there was barely any aural response to walking, which seems detrimental for a game about immersion and atmosphere, detrimental to the projecting of yourself onto the screen. Lifelike animation and sound (or absurd and surreal animation and sound) is vital for immersion and even more so for the immersion in a horror game, without them, you are too aware of the game being a game, and you start to lose touch with it, thereby losing the sense of danger. The light tapping of the steps are overshadowed by the ambient music, also the walking animation of the grown up Claire are naught but two blurry legs switching back and forth with a equally as frantic tapping which I assume are to be the sound of footsteps.   The tense moments fraught with danger and nonverbal screams in the beginning of Claire are boiled down to static and glitch-y “noise-scares” along the generic lines of Slender, this no longer seems to be an effective horror element these days, at least not for me. For the first time ever, I wasn't afraid whilst playing a horror game.  Despite the lack of♥♥♥♥♥♥in my pants and a relatively shallow soundscape, I trotted along, hoping for some substance or just any indication of something worthwhile in this game, something new, perhaps an idea or new way of expressing something artistically. In other words I remained moderately hopeful. The game does look gorgeously gritty and grungy, the enemy design is simplistic but scary enough, especially the way they gradually break down doors, or how they are placed so that in some rooms they are just just close enough to make that picking of a lock so much more tense. It didn't ruin the game for me, until I got stuck for the first time. Getting stuck is immensely frustrating, as we all know, you try everything in the area you're in and eventually you backtrack. And this is where Claire destroyed any sliver of hope I had left. Because when I died, even though in the latest save I had explored a lot and seen the blocked passages and the green-lit areas and all that, the red “blocked passage-indicators” disappeared when I loaded the save. Which forced me to go trough the whole area again, just to figure out where not to go. Buuut, since there is no way of getting rid of enemies in the beginning, I kept running in to these monsters while I tried to re-explore the blocked paths, and subsequently died to them, over and over again, having to re-explore trying to get unstuck, over and over again. When I finally decided backtracking wasn't the right answer, I tried taking the passage from the office in the ER, as I had done before, but to my dismay it didn't work. And this is where I quit the game, wrote this terrible “review” and decided to take a break from buying new exciting indiegames for a while.  I'll hopefully come back to Claire eventually, it does seem like a good game, and perhaps I'm just too stupid to progress in games like this unproblematically. I said the same thing about To the Moon though when I got stuck in a weird saving/loading problem in that game, but so far I haven't gotten the moxie to start that playthrough again. My bet is that Claire will sadly enough just be another game in my backlog. But by writing this I hope that somebody that has played this game can give me a reason to play it through and through, because as it stands now, I just don't feel like it.			"

												Disappointing. The lack of save points (save points exist, but they are too far and few in between), and the insta-kill monsters make this a frustrating game to play. On the plus side, the concept is interesting, and the pixel graphics grow on you. On the downside, it is not very stable - I have had a number of game crashes, especially when clicking the Exit button on the main menu, and the high difficulty makes it a not very fun game to play. All in all, not recommended.			"

												Claire is the type of horror game that evokes some kind of thought and want from its player. The game feels like a side-scrolling version of Silent Hill (especially with the sound effects), and although it isn't all too terrifying, the game makes you want to finish it. Exploration is key in this game due to its nice map system, although as a warning you might not want to explore all the areas as some of them are death traps. The health and sanity are a nice touch, but the game is unclear on how you regain sanity back (try hiding in closets). The exposition of the story however is not the best, since you might still be confused as to what is going on in the story even when you're done. I would recommend getting this game on sale so that you don't focus too much on lamenting on how much you spent on this game but rather enjoy it to its full extent. 7/10 may play again in the future.

												Having played this and finished it all I can say is it's a pretty decent game.The music is fairly ambient and do enhance the mood of the game.The gameplay is basic. I played through the game with the default controls, which consists of: A=Left, D=Right, E=Interaction F=Light/Flashlight, Shift=Run, Space=Jump, I=Inventory, N=Notes, M=Map. If the default control scheme doesn't work out for you or seem kind of unappealing, then there's the option to change the controls in the Options.The puzzles aren't too hard, there are only a couple that are just worth mentioning, the last puzzle I don't think had any explanation, or I simply must've missed it. It consisted of rotating wheels and I passed it by simply turning and hoping for the best. The other one would be the 'Kübler-Ross model' puzzle where you pick the tablets in the following order that makes up 'The Five Stages of Grief'.There are a few faults that I've experienced while playing the game. When meeting people, naturally the game would leave a mark on the map where they are. In one case it didn't happen.Another one would be where an enemy somehow hacked past through the wall and while I was on a ledge and technically out of reach from it, it still managed to hurt me.

												CRAAAAAAAAAP.I had high hopes for this game, because the setting seemed nice, the inventory screen is a tribute to Resident Evil (1), and the gameplay felt very similar to Silent Hill.But all you ever do Claire is pressing either A or D to move left or right, respectively, then press W or S to open doors. That's it. That's the whole gameplay. Not even 10 minutes in and it's already frustrating and boring to death. The graphics are also very disappointing, the sprite for the main character is huge but it's in very low resolution and has so few frames of animation, it looks terrible.			"

												Claire is a 2D Sidescrolling Psychological Horror game that, as of right now, ended up being too monotonous for me to want to finish. Centered around the titular Claire and her troubled family life, the story, while not exactly outstanding, was still interesting enough for me to try to press onward, and the atmosphere is fittingly moody and subdued for the most part (this does not apply to the very beginning of the game).The gameplay, on the other hand, is painfully tedious. It involves exploring rather large areas with little direction, mostly by walking because sprinting can be done for only a few seconds at a time. There are many empty rooms in these areas, and while I'll admit it's unrealistic to expect every room to have a function, it's also a chore to go through them all to make sure nothing is missed. Objects like posters and televisions decorate the background every now and then, but for the most part these areas are just dreary hallway after dreary hallway. It doesn't help that there are sidequests in the game that generally require finding items and taking them back to their rightful owners; after I got one to find three at once I just stopped caring.Enemies that I can only describe as silly-looking scribbles appear in set locations; these enemies cannot be fought, only fled from. They can knock down doors and give chase, which I like as an idea; however, because they are fast and can do this repeatedly, I ended up getting more irritated at losing track of my location than unnerved. Oftentimes I would escape only to end up discovering the way to proceed was back past that enemy. Hiding places exist, but they are sparse and generally not helpful. Later on, there are also human-like enemies that don't attack but instead make Claire frightened with their presence, and if she gets scared enough she starts to lose health over time. They soon start to show up in groups, sometimes one room after another, and the only way to lower Claire's fear is to either use one of the rarer restorative items or wait it out in an empty room. To say the least, the enemy interactions in this game tend to be agreeable concepts spoiled by a complete lack of counterplay, exacerbating the frustrations of exploration.I feel as if the game is marred by a lack of technical polish as well. Even with all the graphical options turned off the game never ran at a smooth, consistent FPS, and several of the menus did not respond well to controller input. Text would sometimes advance by itself without the chance for me to read it, and several lines have typos which ruin the immersion. The game does not state what an item is when trying to pick it up with a full inventory. There's no prompt when using restoratives, which caused me to accidentally use them when I had no reason to do so. There are two sources of light Claire carries, a lighter and a flashlight, but there never seems to be a reason to use the latter because the game is never that dark and it uses up batteries (which admittedly aren't used for anything else). Save points did not reliably respond to my inputs to open them. Lastly, jumping is possible, but for some reason the camera remains vertically centered on Claire as she hops, even though none of the rooms I encountered are taller than the screen nor did any of them require any height-scaling; this honestly made me nauseous.The most damning thing about Claire, however, is that it's never as scary as it wants to be. The enemies are uninspired, the few moments apparently intended to terrorize fall flat, and the fact that Claire's dog alerts her of potential dangers while simultaneously being immune to them himself takes a lot of potential dread out of her situation. Along with that, while Claire verbalizes her anxiety, her expression never changes to match it; quite frankly, I can't remember a single time when she didn't have the same dour expression on her face. Save for the scant story-related scenes I encountered, the game is, overall, incredibly dull.I managed to reach the beginning of what I assume is the third and final part of the game before deciding to give up. It's a shame, because the scene right beforehand was riveting and implied a conclusive explanation to the game's events, but the two-and-a-half hours I spent with Claire felt more like five with the content of one. Don't bother.p.s. there was an achievement called ""But Who Was Phone?"" and it made me want to mutilate myself			"

												I thought that ""Lone Survivor"" was a phenomenal game, so this one caught my attention.This games storytelling is quite different from Lone Survivor's, instead of keeping you questioning everything, this games slowly uncovers the story, and while somethings is up to intepretation, most of the story is already settled.This games strength is definitely in the tension of the storytelling. The different characters you meet, the use of young Claire's dream, and the interactive flashbacks is excellent at keeping the player excited for uncovering more.The game does bring up some really dark subjects, which I do appreciate, though, it falls short when it comes to the controls. In the length of the game it does become repetitive. It does have a creepy atmosphere, some creepy imagery and a very Lone Survivor'ish art style (which I liked so I'm not complaining). The monsters is not exactly that scary, and the hidding mechanism lacks intensity.So it really comes down to if you like the story and/or if you can sympathise with the main character. I myself were able to feel for her and while I thought that the story could use a bit more support from the puzzles and different areas, instead of only a few people hidden around the map (I loved those people interactions, though it just didn't feel like it was enough to keep my attention the whole way through), it sure was an emotional rollercoaster through the mind of our protagonist. I will recommend it to those who think that the story sounds intriguing, though don't buy it for the survival horror part of the game, since that has been done a lot better in many other titles.			"

												I'm 50/50 on this one.This game runs in the same vein as Lone Survivor, which I enjoyed up until the very end since I simply could not beat the final monster (GRRR). This and Lone Survivor also pay homage to Silent Hill down to the sound effects for picking up and using items (which I honestly can't get enough of). The main character Claire even somewhat looks like Heather from SH 3.It's easy to get lost, which makes it both a bit frustrating and compelling because there's nothing more fun than opening doors over and over again and exploring, which is also very typical of Silent Hill.What detracted from the experience was that the big reveal didn't really hit me. I really didn't get what the game was trying to convey in regards to the traumatic past that Claire was trying to forget. It was almost as if it were ticking boxes of typical ♥♥♥♥♥♥, dysfunctional childhood tropes but they didn't seem in-sync nor were they pulled off as coherently as they should have. I still don't really know what happened other than  Mom in hospital. Catatonic schizophrenia maybe? Ethan...I have no idea, her brother was drowned by her mother? Her father...left/died, I don't know. Claire killed herself. Yeah, I guess it could have been compelling if it had been told a bit more clearly, but the attempt to parse out information and keep the mystery going feel flat with me.I'd still give this a try if you liked Lone Survivor or Silent Hill 1-3, but I won't promise you'll feel very emotionally fulfilled with the awkward story-telling.
