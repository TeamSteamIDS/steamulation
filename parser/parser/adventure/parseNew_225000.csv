												If you're reading this, you have probably already tried at least one of the other Tomb Raider games, and are wondering, ""How will I react to Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles compared to the other Tomb Raider game(s) I have played?"". I will try to review Chronicles based on its quality relative to the other classic games in the series (i.e. the ones developed by Core).Compared to the first four classic games, Chronicles is fairly short and (for me) probably the easiest out of the five ""Core classics"". I enjoyed the varied settings in the game's 13 levels, and I think the developers did a great job in creating a suspenseful atmosphere despite a dated graphics engine relative to that time period of PC gaming. To support this atmosphere, there are plenty of varied puzzles (although they are nowhere near as difficult as Tomb Raider 3's puzzles), good use of ambient sound effects to set the mood, an emphasis on exploration and, for a number of levels, a fun avoidance/stealth-based mechanic where the clunky combat is non-existent.Chronicles is split into four locations and unfortunately I feel that only the first location (Rome) has that traditional tomb-raiding feel which I so dearly love. I don’t mind the occasional “modern-day” level; however I felt that Chronicles was a bit too heavy on modern-day exploration (more than half of the levels are in modern-day settings). This is a matter of taste, but one of the things I really appreciated about some of the older Tomb Raider games was getting immersed in the lore of Ancient or lost civilizations. So, while the atmosphere of Chronicles is overall still suspenseful and well-crafted, I felt that the game lacked that “epic feeling” that certain levels of previous Tomb Raider games provided (I’m looking at you, Temple Ruins of Tomb Raider 3 and St. Francis’ Folly of Tomb Raider 1).TLDR: Chronicles is a decent “classic” Tomb Raider game, despite it being relatively short and easy, and lacking a certain epic atmosphere that all 4 previous games possessed. I would only recommend it if you have played some of the other classics (i.e. 1-4) and are just looking to add to your collection for a very cheap cost ($6.99 for approximately 10 hours of gameplay). If you’re completely new to the series and are looking to start your Tomb Raider experience, start with Tomb Raider 1, or, if you can’t tolerate the outdated graphics of the Core classics, start with Tomb Raider: Legend developed by Crystal Dynamics.Just for reference, here’s how I would rate Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles relative to the other classic Tomb Raider games I have played, from best to worst:Tomb Raider 1Tomb Raider 3 ( Read my review )Tomb Raider: AnniversaryTomb Raider: LegendTomb Raider 2 ( Read my review )Tomb Raider 5Tomb Raider: UnderworldTomb Raider 4(I haven’t played Angel of Darkness)			"

												Tomb Raider Chronicles received mixed reviews and was criticized for the fact that ""it started becoming more of the same"" and I agree; both this and TR4 utilize the same game engine and TR2 and 3 utilized a similar engine, this is very easy to notice in game. Although I agree with this, I will be reviewing Chronicles as a game in its own respective right and disregard its predecessors. The game on the whole acts as a memorial tribute to Lara Croft who is presumed dead (after the events of TR4). The game is comprised of 13 levels which are split into 4 ""acts"". Each act tells a story of one of Lara's many past adventures, reminisced by her butler and past friends. Her adventures vary from her quest in search of the Philosopher's stone in Rome to infilrating a high-security tower block in New York to steal the Iris. There is a fair amount of variety in the game that stops it from getting bland and boring. The vital, important aspect that's always held up well in the Tomb Raider games are the puzzles in them; whilst the puzzles in Chronicles aren't as complex and mind-boggling as the puzzles in the previous games (especially TR4) there are still there and keeps you constantly thinking and questioning in the game.In terms of the graphics in the game, there isn't much to say, as mentioned it utilizes the same engine as TR4 and therefore looks exactly the same in terms of graphic detail. For a 2000 game, it really doesn't look that bad.Sound was another aspect of Chronicles that was criticized, with it being viewed as mediocre; I personally slightly agree with this, the sound in Chronicles doesn't exactly stand out, it is very ambient and takes the ""back seat"" for the majority of the game, only in particular flybys or boss fights that there is distinctive music. A lot of music has also been reused from The Last Revelation, which is slightly disappointing.The game itself is very short compared to the previous games, it took me only 5 hours to beat however I have played the game countless times in the past (I grew up around this game) so it may take a new player slightly longer. Is there a lot of replay value in the game? Not really, there are secrets in each level which are quite hard to find/gain access to and finding all of them will unlock some special features from the menu. However, finding all secrets would require you to play through the entire game again if you miss one as there is no level select and finding them all only unlocks concept and cinematic art, so is it really worth it?Despite the mediocre sound and shortness of the game, I would recommend this game. Is it my nostalgia recommending it? Yes and no; I believe new players will find the game engaging and puzzling from start to finish there's quite a bit of variety and challenge in the game, don't be expected to just gun the bosses down, there is some challenge involved and skill needed and I feel that makes it worthy of the £4.99 that it costs.

												In this game you play 4 different Lara's adventures: her search for the Philosopher's Stone in Rome, her hunt for the Spear of Destiny (imo, this is the best level of Chronicles), her adventure on the Black Isle (only puzzles on this one, 'cause you play with a younger Lara who doesn't use guns yet) and the final level is her infiltration on Werney Von Croy's high-tech complex to retrieve the Iris Artefact (the one you see at the beginning of The Last Revelation). Even though TR: Chronicles isn't as good as its predecessors, it still is a great game. Chronicles uses the same engine from The Last Revelation, which improved Lara's movements, making it much easier to play, but the graphics are still the same (not a bad thing, it's really good for a PS1-era game). The variety of the scenarios got my attention here: you go from the Coloseum to the deep of the ocean to the island of Lost, among others. I highly recommend this if you're a fan of the series, but if you're just starting to play the old TR games, check out TR 2 and The Last Revelation first (I know some people don't like TLR, but it was my first TR game so it has a special place in my heart). The only really bad thing is the save bug on the last minutes of the game, so make sure you don't save only on one slot and search on the internet where the bug starts to cause problems and you'll be good to go.

												Tomb Raider V: Chronicles is definitely the worst in the Classics series. Not only is the level design uninspired, very basic and just plain boring at times, the four little episodic stories are absolutely horrendous. This game feels more like something a single hobby developer put together in a week than an actually official Tomb Raider title.It does have its moments and some levels and designs aren't quite as bad and lackluster as others but overall it's a very dull, short and often times downright annoying and buggy experience that you can skip if you're not a completionist or fan of the series.On a scale of 1 to 10 I give Chronicles a 3 for trying to implement at least a few unique ideas and new gameplay mechanics that haven't been seen before in a Tomb Raider game.

												Finished it for the first time in 14 years since release :) I've never managed to come through because of the bugs in final levels. Well, my opinion is mixed. I liked the first levels (Rome) and Ireland the most. Nice scenery and story. Russian base and submarine was interesting. But the final levels in the complex were really not my style + buggy as hell. Last level (red alert!) especially. Overall i would give the game grade 7/10.			"

												Good old Tomb Raider, where difficulty and gameplay was still alive. But...Finale map was increasing BS until the end, with the finale touch: was where I got stuck because of a save bug ! SPOILER COMING-->(some lasers were not disabled after killing the second robot: had to download some savefile from internet to be able to see the ending credits...)If you are a fan of old TR, its a must to play anyway, but certainly not the best TR around			"

												TR5 is the last oldschool Tomb Raider game. It features the same visuals as Tomb Raider 4 and also includes some new moves.Chronicles tells us four stories about Lara's previous adventures (the events before The Last Revelation). The Rome is set before Tomb Raider 1 (1996), Russia is somewhere in the middle, Ireland when Lara was 16 (same age as in TR4's Cambodia levels), New York (when she decided to steal Cambodia's Iris from Von Croy).The game is somewhat notably shorter than the previous parts, but it features some variety. Rome was similar to TR2's Venice style adventures. Russian submarine was similar to TR3's modern vibe. Ireland is quite a unique experience, you could even tag it as survival horror. VCI headquarters is more similar to The Angel of Darkness concept of modern Tomb Raiding.Unlike TR4 the TR5 is completely linear, you can't go back between the levels and on top of that each time you finish a chapter (on of four) all your items are gone. On the bright side that prevents item hoarding. The game has 36 secrets. Collecting all unlocks game's concept art.TR5 has native widescreen support. There's no need to patch it.In a perfect world this should be played after finishing:- Tomb Raider (I)- Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business- Tomb Raider II- Tomb Raider II: The Golden Mask- Tomb Raider III: Adventures of Lara Croft- Tomb Raider III: The Lost Artifact- Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelation- Tomb Raider IV: Exclusive Times Level			"

												Tomb Raider: Chronicles, as it name said, was a Tomb Raider game launch for PC and PS1 with a try to explore many different Lara's adventures. But did he made it? Well, we will discover it on this review.First, i need to say: When i firstly played this game, i found it pretty good. But by the time i've played it i was way younger. Today, my opinion as changed a bit. Let's go to the topics.Graphics: This game uses the same engine from Tomb Raider 4: The Last Revelation, with a little improvement over the textures. Overall, they're pretty good to look at and does it job for a Tomb Raider game.Soundtrack: Overall, pretty forgetable. The only music i could remember was the menu music. And that's it. And i really mean it. Music is almost not present on gameplay, most of time you will only hear ambient sounds, like in the previous game. But at least i felt that in the previous title, it felt more present. The only times i heard music were during the cutscenes, but most of them were ""suspense music"" and not really catchy. Witch let me down since Tomb Raider is a game known for it's orchestred music track.Gameplay: It pretty much remained the same from the fourth title, it only added a few new moves. Lara could run, jump, climb almost everywhere, and fall down through vents while crouched and looking forward (In the old game, you could only do that if you rotated 360).Gunplay is the same from the fourth title, featuring the manual aim from the combination of Revolver + Laser Sight. But not only it. As the game tried to bring new weps, guess what...DESERT EAGLE IS BACK! Yeah! After a whole game without it, i can't express how i missed it so much. It kills enemies with one shoot, holy mackina. Finally.Also, many other new guns were introtuced, especially at the VCI levels. And in these levels, were present a stealth mode. For the very first time in a Tomb Raider game, you could only kill enemies without being detected (Because you lost you weapons at these levels). Different from other levels were you got no weps, you could at least make your way to kill all the enemies.New enemies were introduteced, as well a new level of teen Lara. Everything works fine and it's well constructed. This game is more puzzle-like than the fourth one. But if i can say something from this game is that its SHORT.It could be bigger and i will tell you why at the end of the review.Also: Secrets are back. But finding them is a pain. Because your statistcs are not per stage, but global. You can't know witch stage has a secret neither how many one level has. If this game wasn't that short, it would be a pain getting it all.I can't remember if TR 4 was like that, so i can't say anything about it.Cheats in this game are a little different from the fourth one and harder to do. But they still exist.A stage consists of getting to point A to B or completing certain tasks to do so, not many problems. There are mini bosses throught some stages and they aren't that challenging. No real boss at the end tough (Trapping him feels the same as trapping Seth), witch felt a bit empty.There are a few unlockables at this game as you find the secrets, they all had screenshoots of the next gen of Tomb Raider witch was...TRAOD. Damn, it just ain't worth when you already know the finished product.Story: Here was the weakest point of this game. At least, for me. The CANON MAIN TIMELINE of Tomb Raider pretty much remains UNTOUCHED. The only thing revealed at the end of the game, surprise, surprise, Lara is still alive. In the CANON NOT MAIN TIMELINE, pretty much nothing is explored from Lara's past, except for the young stage. But even there, not much is explored. It just feels that they put Lara's on random adventures with an excuse. And this game also has a big hole conection between him and TRAOD. Vernom was the one who discovered Lara was alive, searching for her all the days of many months. But when you start TRAOD, Lara says: ""You left me on Egypt"". HOW?! Damn. Another thing that's never explained is how Lara survived from the TR4 ending. At least in the game. In the book series, there's one book that explain how. I never read it, so i can't say anything, but it's there. Focusing on the adventures on Lara's ""chronicles"", it divided in four acts.The first one, Lara is looking for the phylosophy stone, with a little ""help"" of Pierre and Larson. The only strange thing on this chapter is the Pierre fall. How the hell did he survived it? We already knew in Tomb Raider 1 that Lara knew Larson and Pierre from a long time before, that matches. But Pierre falling to his death...What the hell?!The second one, Lara is in a russian ship looking for the spear of destiny. See what they are doing? Random stories. The only good thing at this chapter was the ship's captain. I felt bad for him at the end. Damn.The third one, is the young stage. Lara sneaks into a Winston's friend boat to uncover a secret from a cursed island. Even if the premises looks idiot, this one has the most well constructed atmosphere, mostly because of you being without your weapons, like a true adventurer.The fourth and last one was about how Lara stealed Iris from Van Croy. It was the mostly overrated stage and it was all worth it. It was so shorth tough that i felt bad when i was about to end it. Damn. Really.The Level Editor: This is where this game could've been a lot more revolutionary. You see, random stories for random levels with random enemies. Sounds like a thing you do while doing mods or maps for some game, doesn't it?The PC version got a exclusive Level Editor that allowed the players to make their own levels and even full games. If you acess a site called ""Lara's Level Base"" you will see there's a lot of levels made by players. And they are still being made until today. Why is it bad? Read again: PLAYERS.Players made the community, players made their site for their levels/new items for the engine (Witch you could add) and players made this whole ""Let's make a Tomb Raider game ourselfs"" worth.The devs couldn't see how much the community could have used this more. There was no real support for the Level Editor and after its launch, there were no patchs whatsoever. If the player base din't kept it alive, nobody would be using. But if the devs gave the right attention to it, it could've been something BIG and NEW. Nobody ever tough of making his own Tomb Raider adventures, and that would bring something new. Mostly because the engine is not hard like Unreal or Source (And not easy as Portal 2 PTI i might say) and, for its time, it was still a good engine. They missed a big oportunity here. The game was rather sort and they din't even bothered giving a extended lifetime, at least on PC. When they launched the Level Editor for free, they pretty much gave up. Because you CAN use the engine to PLAY ALL THE LEVELS made by players WITHOUT NEEDING TO OWN THE GAME!I guess for today, this is fine. But, the engine was released for free in the same day that the game came out. Jesus.I remember the purple ""Level Editor"" disk that came with my original TR 5 CD, i felt so special by having something like that at my hand and was sad to see it was free on the new. Legaly. With a manual too. Jesus, why?Overall, TR: Chronicles is the mostly forgetable Tomb Raider and the shortest of all, but it was a fun game to play...While it lasted. Getting all the secrets and playing with the Level Editor will keep youself busy more than the game itself, sadly. But it's not bad, it could've been better. They just missed a good oportunity here. Only if they gave more support to the level editor...If you want to play this game, be preapared for fun and disapointment, at the same time.PS: Why did these ""Next Gen Screens"" looked so promising back there? Damn.			"

												Let's be clear, this game is awesome, it really is, but it will be HARD to finish.Everything is fine until the last section of levels, in the high security area. I've encountered incredible amounts of bugs, making me unable to finish.In the last areas:- Lara does not aim at enemies with her weapon (she has only one in these levels by the way), needless to say this bug makes it annoying to shoot at enemy with rafle mode selected, ending up wasting ammo;- Lara got stuck in a cinematic, making her unable to get her weapon back;- Lara got stuck in the elevator area, leading to death up or down;- The first cyborg got immortal, revealing his electric arm and releasing water didn't kill him;- Basically, saving and loading in the last area is VERY bad idea, most of spots are bugged.Other than that, I really do love this game, especially the Rome area, because we get to kill giant statues. We love moving statues. And when we get to play Lara as a teenager. A terrifying set of levels, with no guns and creepy creatures.There are few ways to go past these bugs if you look around on the internet (check out Stella's website for example). But I still haven't figure out how to solve the problem with the gun automatic aim.I do recommend it though! Even if it's not as good as the other series.(The screenshots shown in the preview are wrong though, Lara is not going in Egypt in this game!)			"

												Just like The Sims, this was released in 2000, but instead of setting fire to bungalows in the suburbs by placing the couch infront of the fireplace and removing the fire alarm, you find yourself immersed in the reminicent stories from Lara's loved ones, as she remains missing (presumed dead).I was actually going to go into a massive review here but there's just not a lot to tell. The game is great. Full of culture and travel.8/10			"

												Review by xTzharkz.Tomb Raider V... Was quite of disappointment. The gameplay was better than in previous game, but the story... And glitches... At first I got so confused of what was going on. So bad cutscenes and jokes... Felt really cringe and lost, cuz I had no idea what was it about. Later on I started enjoying it a little, understood what was going on in story, but then the puzzles felt way too easy. I know I did say that in previous game review that it was way too hard but this time it was way too easy. So little improvement. Like I said the story was bad. I was hoping to know what happened with Lara after ""Tomb Raider IV"" ending. After finishing the game, I was just left with pokerface and even more questions. I don't think it deserves the name ""Tomb Raider V"" more like DLC for ""Tomb Raider IV"".There was added few new things. My favorite one was the crawling frontflip. Came really handy. Last chapter tho. Was disaster. If you do buy the game. I recommend you to save in circles. Specialy the chapter ""Red Alert"" because otherwize you might not be able to finish the game, if you do get glitched and you can't load way back.I will still recommend the game. Eventho I was left quite unhappy.Total play time - 17h. I did leave my game open on background few times, not sure if counted in. Game felt really short tho.xTzharkz [Eric]			"

												This may be the shortest of the Tomb Raider games.  It's set after Tomb Raider IV, when Lara's supposed to have died (I won't ruin the surprise, but there's a Tomb Raider VI after this one ;-)   It's chopped up into small stories, which break up the game into nice little episodes set at different times and in different locations.   The original Tomb Raiders can really drag sometimes, but this one has good pacing, an interesting story, and there's just enough variety to keep you interested.   It does have a few bugs, though, which can be a pain, but they're easily avoided if you keep a walkthrough handy.   As with all the original series TR's, level design and low poly models are really starting to show their age now, which is a shame, but it's a good member of the series, and a great trip down memory lane. Well Recommended for holiday fun.			"

												First of all, I completed this game on PS3 because on PC Lara would just spin around and around when using a controller and  K&M is not an option for me. There may be a patch to fix that but I couldn't be bothered so I bought it again on PSN.So what can I say about the game. It's good. Not as good as previous ones. Some puzzles are cheesy instead of being fun and interesting. And some of them are a bit confusing even after completing first 4 games in the series.I can see that developers started experimenting with things with some hits and misses. Horror for example, on the spooky island scared the hell out of me. I prefer adventure over horror but it was still OK. Mechanics like sniping was a blast because for the first time I could do headshots.The game is quite a bit shorter than previous ones and the reason it took me a while to complete it was some of those puzzles that made much less sense then before.If you are a fan of Tomb Raider series like me the by all means go ahead and buy it.

Product received for free
												One year later, in 2000, Core Design released Tomb Raider: Chronicles, the 5th installment in the series. Now this was probably an unexpected entry in the series, after the events in The Last Revelation. But in comparison to past games...it's a good entry in the series, but not really an improvement. I'm not saying the game is bad, though.But let's start with the story. Now for those of you who don't know the story, SPOILER ALERT!  After the events in The Last Revelation, Lara is presumed dead, crushed under the ruins of the temple inside The Great Pyramid, in Egypt. Those closest to her back in England get together to pay tribute to Lara. Her family, her butler and some of her friends, who get together at Croft Manor to talk about stories of some of her previous adventures which hadn't been covered in previous games, all narrated by Lara's butler, Winston and her friends, Charles Kane and Father Patrick. Now these stories take Lara through four different locations. Rome, in search of the Philosopher's Stone. Russia, in search of the Spear of Destiny. Ireland as Young Lara, to help dealing with demons haunting an isle's inhabitants and to New York City to infiltrate a corporation to steal a certain artifact which for some, is most likely familiar. While her friends back in England get together to pay tribute to Lara, Werner Von Croy is still in Egypt, trying to get down the pyramid in hopes of finding Lara or what's left of her. Now for gameplay, there isn't anything new, really. It's more of the same from The Last Revelation, only with very few new things. One of the new features and probably the most known one is the tightrope walking, which has the player controlling Lara moving forward on a tightrope while they try to have Lara maintaining her balance on the tightrope. If they fail to keep Lara balanced, she will fall and possibly to her instant death. You can also now roll out of crawlspaces, which saves a lot of time and effort when leaving crawlspaces.New and old weapons have also returned, aside from the good old pistols. Oldies like the shotgun, uzis, the revolver and the desert eagle return. As for the new weapons, they're the HK Gun (pssssssst it's pretty much the MP5 from Tomb Raider III but with different fire modes) and the Grappling Gun.Chronicles this time has a total of 36 secrets, which are all golden roses. Although unlike The Last Revelation, these will unlock in-game content. Get all 36 golden roses and unlock concept art and storyboards, which you can access from the Options menu.The four adventures in this game, since they aren't really that long as each only has like 3-4 levels, the game can be completed in like 7-8 hours. It's not bad, but it's a bit of a disappointment in my opinion, compared to games like TR III or The Last Revelation which take a lot longer to beat.As for graphics, there aren't any improvements, really. The graphics didn't really improve from The Last Revelation. So I can't really talk much about these.And with all that out of the way, it's time for the final score. Tomb Raider: Chronicles gets a 6/10. It's an average game. It is kinda fun. Its stories within the narrative are interesting, alright. But the game sort of lacks the tomb raiding, past the first chapter. Although it's nice to see some weapons returning, particulary the fan favorite Desert Eagle.I kinda recommend this game, though. I have to admit that I had trouble reviewing this one, cuz I really love this game. This was the first Tomb Raider game I ever played. But I tried my best to give an honest opinion. Aside from that, if you're able to, buy this game. c:			"

												I am a middle aged woman with a family now, but aside from a few Atari games in the early 80's and Super Mario Bros on Nintendo in the late 80's, Tomb Raider was really the first game that inspired awe in me, in the late 90's. I played all of the games, up to The Last Revelation, before life got in the way and I haven't played any other game since, until now :) Purchasing a new PS4 game console for my 6 YO son and becoming a fan of a lowbrow/pop surreal artist who has done some videogame fanart has inspired me to come back to the world of gaming and happily immerse myself again.Of course, I'm wanting to play many games (and have already purchased over 100 of them on sale - being an adult DOES have it's perks), but I really wanted to start where I left off, which leads me to Chronicles. I have only played for a few hours today, so I'm sure I'll want to update this review at some later date but I just wanted to give a slight review of the game from the perpective of someone with children and responsibilities and as someone who has forgotten many of the talents I garnered in the past...First of all 2 things....If you are person who hasn't played a game in over a decade, like me and you are attempting to turn your computer into a console by purchasing an XBox360 controller, so that you can really pick up where you left off... please understand that  controller support has it's limits. Chronicles purports to offer full controller support, but when I go into options and select ""joystick"" and go back into the game... All Lara does is run around in circles (can't seem to get her to stop) and pull flares! It's okay, I wanted to learn how to game with a keyboard/mouse anyway, but I really didn't want to do that on an adventure game. I just wanted to sit back, relax and enjoy the story without being so clumsy and having to try failed maneuvers over and over again. I've read that controller support is way better in some of the newer version of TR, so I can't wait to try and see.Second, incase you've forgotten! Don't wait until the end of the level for your game to be saved! I made it all the way through level 1 and was about to walk through the Bell Temple door, when I was sent off on another side mission, via a walkthrough, when I missed a jump and lost my life. 15 years ago, this would have been just frustrating, but it would have slid off of my back... but as an adult, with children to feed, a house to keep clean and a business to run... I wanted to cry and vow to never throw away another 4 hrs of my life like that again.The game is just as I remember it (so far) but I just wish I didn't have the ""you could be doing something else"" angel whispering in my ear, because that makes it so much harder to enjoy the game now. But, that's a personal fault(?) and has nothing to do with the game. I would imagine the game makers assumed that users had the time to spare. I still think the graphics are very cool and they do help me to escape a bit, but I've got to be honest, I've seen the graphics on many of the newer games I've purchased, including the newer Tomb Raider titles and I really can't wait to play them.

												So this game is all about Lara's previous adventures. Most levels taking place in a city, was waiting for the moment to actually do some city levels. The end...makes me want to play more and more, making me wanting to find out what happens next. 6/10, some levels were boring.			"

												Tomb Raider Chronicles is a great memorial to the legendary Lara Croft after the events of the last game. We learnt she wanted some of Harry Potter's Philosophers Stone, a trip on a Russian sub, flashbacking to grim Ireland to talk to the demons with a priest who treats exorcism like a tea party and she spites old Von Croy in a wheelchair in the good ol' US and A in his own company HQ! We globetrot with our favorite female icon through stories told by old friends sitting around a fireplace after the memorial, getting steadily drunker. It's a gentle and perhaps thankfully easier pick up and play title after the titanic epic of The Last Revelation and a breather from the relentless TR3, perfect for novices or those who want to breeze through the game without too much difficultly. That said, although the difficulty isn't too high, it boasts the hardest (and buggiest) final level to date; the perhaps ironically named Red Alert.Highlights for me are the Italian levels with their lovely visuals and beautiful scenery injected with some good humor from series stalwards Larson and Pierre from TR1, now a bumbling comic duo that set to try and thwart our heroine but fail horribly! The Russian levels are very tense, particularly in the Deepsea Dive and Sinking Submarine levels. Ireland does well with the grim, macabre setting to instil a creepy atmosphere (Labyrinth gets props for being eerie) and as Lara is unarmed, it adds to the drama! The final stages are very hi-tech, a huge contrast to the rest of the game act as a thrilling hi-octane conclusion!I recommend you play this after you play the first four so you get a good feel for the Core Design era before Angel of Darkness plunged it into....uh darkness. Such a shame they rushed AoD, it would have been interesting to see what future installments that could have been. But to fully live the Core Design era, start at the beginning and have yourself a TR marathon.TRC has a special place in my heart even to this day!			"

												Chronicles gets a lot of hate, and rightfully so. It's easy to see how, at the time, a fifth Tomb Raider game in five years, which added few changes could be seen as downright insulting - almost as antiquated as any of the tombs within.Replaying it now, over 15 years later, it's easy to look back with rose-tinted glasses and talk about how it follows the classic formula. Unfortunately, it follows that formula too closely, in fact, it's the most generic Tomb Raider in the franchise, and frankly, the only one I didn't look forward to replaying.4/10. "

												Going through numerically, Chronicles provided a fair bit of difficulty in initial setup. It requires a bunch of special options for windows compatibility, refuses at all to accept direct controller input, and has some graphical glitches in the menu.Still, once you get it working, it's not a bad tomb raider game. The story breaks the continuity in an interesting way, making it sort of several shorter prequels in one. This is quite interesting. It does mean the game jumps around a bit, but the stories in themselves are quite good.The levels, as usual, are very nice, and due to the nature of the many stories, this game return sto 'classic' tomb raider fashion of having lots of different environments. They all look good, but I notice they feel a little smaller than usual. Personally, I think this works well for the game.A good anthology of tomb raider shorts.			"

												The  fifth entry to the Tomb Raider series plays more like Tomb Raider Lite.Everything seems watered down and it feels like it should have been an old school expansion to the fourth game rather than a standalone title. The puzzles and levels are the easiest and most linear in the series so far and that was fun for a while but it got old in the second part of the game and along with a couple of irritating bugs it made for an underwhelming experience. Especially the bug at the end of the game that damn near stopped me from finishing the level. I was only able to complete the game because I rotated my saves.I won't spoil the ending cutscene but it was quite disappointing and that was the final nail in the coffin for me in regards to this feeling more like an expansion pack rather than a full game.I know I complained about the insane difficulty in the fourth game but this one was so easy and short it felt like a step backwards to be honest.

												After the events of The Last Revelation, it seemed that Core wouldn't make any more Tomb Raider games until the PS2 was out. However, we all just couldn't get enough of Lara Croft and thus we got Chronicles which was blatantly thrown together and boy does it really show.In terms of gameplay, it's more or less the same as the previous games but admittedly, I really liked that they gave you the ability to roll out forwards through a crawlspace instead of having to turn around just to get down and that's literally the one good thing I can say about this game. There are many badly designed levels such as Russia where half of the time you are going through corridors in a submarine and then there's two minutes of exploring in the open water. The last level of the game is heavily bugged which the only way to counter them is to not save at all in certain parts because it will screw you over if you load up the game there.Story-wise. we are given four different adventures of Lara Croft through her years but the first part they bring back Larson and Pierre from the first game which doesn't make any sense at all. This even takes place before TR1 so they made a massive plothole just from that. According to the trailer, Lara infiltrates the Russian base in 1984 which is where she would be only 16. Yeah, not buying that. Her trip to Ireland takes place in 1979 with her backpack yet she doesn't actually get that until she went to Cambodia with Von Croy in 1984 so... yeah, continuity errors everywhere. That shows how badly thought out they were for the story.Would only recommend this game if you intend to play through all the Tomb Raider games. Otherwise, not really worth the time.			"

												I wouldn't recommend this Tomb Raider game since it's linear in comparison to the previous Tomb Raider games.Though if you are into this game for the story of Lara's past life before the events of The Last Revelation and none of the first three Tomb Raider series then this game would at least show you some of her experience in various episodes. It uses the previous Inventory system as The Last Revelation so not exactly the best one.   Pros Cons   Episodic: Unique strategy of gameplay each episode. Small bugs still appear in the game and sometimes prevents to proceed further after saves.   Sounds: Still work fine and music plays out without much glitches Not really a con: Controls remain the same like the previous four games.   Settings can be adjusted before playing: 1920x1080 FMV's still shrink the screen to 640x480 I'd recommend for players new to the Tomb Raider series but also prefers games that is quite short then this is the game for them. For those who likes long games and lots of puzzles to solve around then I wouldn't recommend this game. It's at least a 6.5 / 10 for me.			"

												This game does the complete opposite of Revelation and takes a terrible turn. Chronicles focuses less on tomb raiding and more on trying to make interesting scenerios for Lara. In one level, you're stuck in a nightmare as young lara in Ireland. The trees talk, there's a ghost rider, and harpies swimming in the lakes. In another mission, you're in some hi-tech facility with mission impossible type gear trying to steal back the ""Iris"" artifact from one of your old rivals. This game is when the series started to go downhill.			"

												I understand why many people didn't really appreciate this game but I enjoyed it. It's not structured like a single complete game, instead it's more of a collection of smaller almost expansion set worthy adventures. While these adventures were short, I thought they were at least interesting and most importantly fun. The Ireland levels were particularly memorable because they were spookier than any others in the TR franchise. Each story is quick and fun, and each reveals a bit more about Lara's past and character. So I welcome this game as a worthy addition to the franchise, even if its structure isn't ideal. Unfortunately, like TR2 & 4, this game is forced into a window in Windows 8...so I won't recommend it... otherwise I would.			"

												Probably the worst in the series. It was after Last Revelation but the graphics were even worse. But that's not the worst part. The worst part is:THE SAVE STATE BUGSThese developers seem to need a crash course in state transition development. I won't go into details, but if you play this game you must continually save in staggered save slots because when you save a game and then load it again, it doesn't always load in the same state you saved it in. Neccesary enemies may not spawn, switches may not be activated any more, water may not be drained...the last level is the worst for this.Just DO NOT overwrite saves unless they are old. Cycle through every time you save so you can always go back to before a trigger problem occurs.You have been warned.			"

												Tomb Raider: Chronicles started off so promising, so well set up. The opening cutscene had me hooked. Is Lara really dead? Who knows? Winston finally gets a role other than cannon/freezer fodder, opting to recount Lara's past expeditions around the globe to Father Patrick Dunstan, after a memorial service for her is held. Meanwhile, Werner von Croy, Lara's mentor and rival, continues excavating the Temple of Horus in hopes of finding her after the events of The Last Revelation.But after the opening cutscene, I've made a stunning revelation myself: this game is utterly soulless, lazy and devoid of heart. In my reviews of Tomb Raider II and III, I made comments addressing that I found them to be more effective as expansion packs rather than sequels, but still good games. Chronicles, however, feels more like a map pack created by someone who had the Tomb Raider concept hastily explained to them in 2 minutes.There's only 13 levels this time around. To boot, a lot of them are incredibly short. The amount of puzzles has been reduced, an addition that I really loved from the Last Revelation, instead opting to return to key, switch, door and backtracking from Tomb Raiders I-III. The levels are also annoyingly easy, except for the final level, which is ridiculously hard and total change of pace from the previous 12. Here's a breakdown of the levels:1-4: Reskinned Venice levels from Tomb Raider II with a hint of the Greece levels from Tomb Raider I.5-7: Painfully unoriginal snowy Russian base and submarine levels. Cause that's never been done before.8-10: Okayish levels pretty much stolen from Shadow Man/Medievil. Seriously.11-13: Why is Lara Croft stuck in the Matrix now? Why didn't you take the blue pill?!Lara's new techniques include: tightrope walking and swinging from horizontal bars. As usual, these additions are barely noticeable as they appear about 3 times each throughout the entire game. Because the level system jumps around to different time periods, Lara's inventory is reset at the beginning of each set, which is actually a pretty good addition. Secrets have been replaced by golden roses which, upon collecting them all, unlocks an artwork menu (yay). If you miss one, you miss out, but it really doesn't matter. It's not worth it. There's also no vehicle sections either, other than a crappy underwater mission which is irritatingly short (literally 2 minutes). Not to mention that it's filled with some irritating bugs as well. Using hotkeys for medkits depletes your supply, but doesn't actually heal you half the time. Weapon hotkeys don't work anymore. A couple of times Lara just refused to draw her weapons, whether I used the draw key or equipped it from the inventory menu. Saving also screws up for a lot of people, but thankfully I never encountered this issue. The final level is ghastly in its bugginess.Plotwise, well, what plot? It's four completely random episodes thrown together. This entire game is totally unnecessary in the overarching plot from Tomb Raider through to The Angel of Darkness. The concept is good, but it's executed so poorly that it's just sad. The only connection that Chronicles has to past entries is, at the end of the game, Werner von Croy finds Lara's backpack. It would be a spoiler, but come on, we know she's still alive, and playing through this dreck really isn't worth such an equally pitiful ending.The sound is just average. I don't know what happened to Peter Connelly's great soundtrack from The Last Revelation. Most of the music is gutted, reused or remixed from previous entries. Egyptian-themed music from The Last Revelation is used, for example, in the depths of water beneath a Russian submarine. It doesn't flow and it's just freaking lazy. Voice acting is just bad all around. Stereotypical Americans, Frenchmen, and Russians flood the cutscenes, of which there are inexplicably many, consistently interrupting the little gameplay that there is. Voice volume is also far too low, leading to important dialogue, such as hints given by Zip in the final 3 levels, being missed. Oh, and the camera! My God, the camera. The fixed angles are revolting, obscuring your view and disabling the use of the look function. Meaning that, unlike in previous entries, if you wanted to return to your normal view, you just pressed look or draw weapon. Here, nope! Enjoy this beautiful tilt while you fall to your death, or this stunning pan while you get the♥♥♥♥♥♥shot out of you by  a helicopter!The game somehow looks worse than The Last Revelation. Lara's model remains unchanged from the previous year, and only a small amount of levels actually take place inside a tomb, the rest of which are cities, military bases or submarines. I'm all for variety, but it is called TOMB Raider. Why the sudden aversion to one of the core (no pun intended) elements of the game? Human models other than Lara look downright awful, especially Father Patrick's. Time Crisis on PS1 had better models than this game. The only above-standard thing about this game is the pre-rendered cutscenes, and even they aren't up to scratch with other games released in the same period.I suppose one other good point about the game is its disappointing length, which means that it's over quickly, even though it feels like an eternity. I passed Tomb Raider: Chronicles in five hours. FIVE HOURS. It's one of the most disappointing games I've ever played. And if you're afraid of missing out on some plot details, don't be. This game is worthless in every aspect.2/5.			"

												About fifteen years after finishing the 4th opus, I decided to continue. The first thing I noticed is the appearent lack of graphical improvement. However this is not critical as it is an old game. However, the background story is absolutely horrible, illogical and barely understandable. The last level was so difficult that I ran out of medics and could not complete it. A large part of the game relies on the player's ability to master the long jump to the cm, and after breaking Lara's legs for the hundredth time I had enough of it. I found the puzzles sometimes interesting, but many puzzles do not rely enough on logics but rather on ""try and fail"" until you exhaust every possible interaction with the game environment.What would you say about a game that you abandon at the last level with the bitter sensation to have wasted time?

												I love Tomb Raider saga so much. I know I'm gonna write this as if it was my first time playing, back in the early 2000's...In this game, you don't have a linear chronological timeline due the plot of the game be some memories of Lara's adventure due the """"mourning of her death"""".It has a small number of levels. However there are interesting things in this game which makes it appears on the list of my favorite Tomb Raider games.In Rome, we can see a little bit of story that fills the background story to the characters  Larson and Pierre.In Ireland, there is a feeling of nostalgia by playing Lara in her 16 years old again, like in TR4. However there are the creepiest small beings ever (in my opinion) in certain parts.In New York, we have an urban level. I really like urban levels on Tomb Raider, but in this game is even more iconic than the urban levels in TR3. Lara's black catsuit + glasses in a high tech building of Von Croy's industries it's... more than epic <3Plus we can see the Iris artifact again, even though Core Design didn't gave a good and long background story to it.I really like this game, especially the last levels.

												Chronicles was the last game to use polygonic graphics for character designs and levels as well as a follow up to Last Revelation. The fate of Lara in the last game was unclear, as in this game her friends believe that she is dead and end up recounting stories of her previous adventures. All of the game play focuses on a series of four different flashbacks, while the present day events are only shown in the FMVs. The game show cases slightly more improvements on the gameplay while the graphics are about the same. Levels are hard at times, but anyone who's played these games will know what to expect. I am a fan of origin stories so I do enjoy the concept of a game that delves into other adventures Lara had besides the adventures we already seen her in the previous games.			"

Controls were horrible, graphics weren't so good to see important details of level; so that was extremely hard to reach next levels. Jump was ridiculous as well, you have to think milimetric before jumps, because that could be ended with Lara's death or trying crossing the same path all over again.I'll try to play this again... with a gamepad. On PlayStation, first five games' controls were better. But probably that won't change my hatred to Tomb Raider: Chronicles.			"

												I'm not sure why people hate this game because i really enjoyed it. I got this game a few years ago on my dad's old ps1 and never really understood it but a few days i ago i bought it on here and almost completed it :/ i say almost because i couldn't  finish it because of some bug which stopped me and i saved it too late. I'd recommend it but save it before entering the last door where the stairs is which finishes the level and game.			"

												Much more enjoyable for than the first 3 (my 4 won't launch) for a newbie Tomb Raider player like me. This one has responsive controls.			"

												This game is so fun to play. I like that we got to adventure Lara's past and the game seems to work with no problems. This is a game you should totally play!			"

												To be honest, it's not the best part of the series, but it really is good for beginners. It's not that difficult as other parts (like TR3 and 2) and you can really casually play it, furthermore because it's not too long.If you're a fan of the classic series and haven't played it yet, than you should buy it. It's a good game.And I'd say thanks to Steam I don't need to patch it and it works perfectly fine on my Windows 7.1 PC.			"

												TR V is named ""the fall of Tomb Raider games"", but I would HIGHLY disagree. THAT happened after TR VI (Angel of Darkness) due to the developer switch (gladly, Tomb Raider: Legend fixed that...).So TR V gets a lot of hate for some whatever reason. I never really quite understood why it got the hate. I've never encountered any bugs and the story line is just amazing imo. The soundtrack is just phonomonal and it will never cease to surprise me. Tomb Raider V had such a heavy and sad tone to it- but I LOVED that about it. Tomb Raider V starts off where Tomb Raider IV left off, so I URGUE YOU TO PLAY TOMB RAIDER IV: THE LAST REVELATION BEFORE PLAYING THIS GAME. Otherwise, the story will make NO SENCE to you. So I'm going to tell you how it starts off, but if you have not played Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelations- don't worry- I will make this part unviewable unless you hover your mouse over it.Here goes- So, after Vernen leaves you in the temple, Lara is presumed dead and a memorial service is held for her- even though she is not officially dead. Winston quotes,""Let us hope she may return to us"" in the intro scene. So Lara is going incognito for most of the game (not sure if she actually shows herself or not, never finished the game) if you haven't caught on yet.Gameplay: It's almost exactly like Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelation, so if you didn't like TR IV, then don't play Chronicles unless you want to follow the storyline. It's not BAD by any means, it's just quite different if you're used to the original Tomb Raider I, II, and III games because it's based off a new game engine. Graphics: It looks amazing- the new engine for TR IV and TR V looks goregous, but it can look pretty bad mixed in with low-res textures as present in some levels. The good part about TR V is that the graphics, resolution, and many more options are changable unlike TR I, and II.Conclusion: 2nd most favorite Tomb Raider game to date. Definintely has more harder puzzles to solve, but are solvable without walkthroughs. 9/10			"

												Though it's not the best in the series, it's actually fun to play. You know, exploring a submarine and a gigantic tech-fortress ain't that ""tomb raider"" but are those also the levels I most enjoyed through the gameplay. It's kinda short and not very challenging, but it's worth a play!			"

												While the story seems to be rather shorter than the previous Tomb Raider games i played, the puzzles are still interesting as usual. The storyline is not really that interesting as its just about Lara's past adventures. But of course its not like they simply added levels from previous games. No no, they added levels in which we dont remember playing. Characters we might be familar with in some storylines (as they are told from Lara's past adventures, so which means during some people you might be familar with that is still alive). I cant remember, but i believe theres some people you are familar with in some past games. Pretty sure there is.Anyways, with that said i would as well recommend it because even though the levels seems rather shorter than the rest, it still gives off interesting puzzles opposing to having puzzles you already solved in the past.Oh also, a fair warning to all of you on the final level as it contains MANY glitches. I suggest preparing lots of saves in case if you encounter a glitch to prevent starting ALL over from beginning.			"

												As the fifth game in five years from the series, so little has been added that it's not hard to see why CORE went bust. The level design is an upgrade from previous tomb raiders, with a little more logic built in... but strange puzzles and horrible game design make this adventure a frustrating one. The last level has to be one of the toughest levels I have played (it makes Dark Souls look like a casual mobile game!). Could only recommend to the most hardcore of fans.			"

												I love this game, just as back than at least 16 years ago when I still had it on my ps1 ,The gameplay, the controls are easy to understand and quickly getting it under controlmysself I admit I do not fully follow the storyline but I think its amazing how to roam through different levels.Only part is, that I would like to have it digital remastered, mostly because my screen resolution gets messed up after playing this game. (I have the same with RCT 1, but that is a game i play on disc and not download)For what I have played is  chronicles the best TR game and the LARA I came to knew and love. for I hae played 1 and 2 also. I do hope to finish it this time without to much cheats. Hooray that internet excists now			"

												Tomb Raider: Chronicles is the fifth and last game of the classic Tomb Raider series. The game itself is not as good as previous titles and shorter in comparison, but to me that doesn’t make it bad. It took me about seven hours to play.By today’s standards the game play is extremely outdated, the controls are wonky, and the graphics are basically junk. However back in the day, it wasn’t too bad. I remember playing this as a little kid on Windows 98 and loving it. In fact the control scheme came back to me rather quickly.I would highly recommend this game for nostalgia, or if you’ve played the classic Tomb Raider series and know what to expect. Other than that, you would have to have a good appreciation for old computer games to enjoy playing this.			"

												FINALLY! IT'S OVER!I started this game many months ago, and it has taken a very long time to get through it. The game itself is as long as the other ones, but MAN it's been a long road.First let me start out with explaining myself. I did like the game in many ways, but there are so many stupid things that ruin the game. This is the first tomb raider game I have put a downvote for, and I've played the 4 first games, and liked em very much too.The first problem is the story. This feels more to me as a filler story, while the others had stories that followed Lara in a logical order, with a start, middle and end. First you are one place, then another place. As I have played the previous games I know the story well, and what the end of the previous game was. As the game is being told this way, more things start unfolding. These levels are ment to be clever, but when you spend alots of time wondering if this and that works, only to get stuck, and your time is spent just running around or dying, it's not that fun. I think it's very important to not use a walkthrough, but frankly, I used one through the entire game, cause it was boring. I just wanted to get through it.When you get bored, you start realising that the graphics haven't really improved that much, and you start annoying yourself with that aswell. ""Please let me finish this so I can continue the real story, get better graphics, and maybe a better way of playing this game.""Last thing. THE CAMERA ANGLES. O M G. It's horrible horrible HORRIBLE! I am used to weird camera angles from the previous games, but the combination of everything makes it so hard to play. What were they thinking?I'm not gonna spoil how this game ends, but I can tell you that the last few levels, especially the last one is very unforgiving in everything you do, and it feels so unfair. Lara keeps bumping into stuff because I can't ♥♥♥♥ing see where she is going because of the camera angles. I actually realised how to sprint at the last 10 minutes (worth of time) of the game, and ...believe it or not, it was a actually a HUGE reason for managing to complete the game.Also some parts of the last level was unfair in some other ways. Things that players has no way of knowing how to complete, unless they are really lucky or have tried everything that is possible to do!To end of this review. It's theoreticly a decent game, but there are some details that makes it SOO boring to play, and in the end I just wanted to complete it and never see it again.			"
