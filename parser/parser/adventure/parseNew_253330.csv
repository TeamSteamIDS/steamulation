												*Disclaimer: I am the developer of the game, so take my review worth a grain of salt*That being said, I thought it'd be helpful to use the review system to speak candidly about the game. Hopefully people find it helpful. This isn't a typical horror game. It's not about startling you with jump scares. It's about creating a tense and oppressive atmosphere that mirrors my experience with mental illness. It's not very game-y. Some may describe it as a ""walking simulator"". While it is true the main mechanics are walking, this was a deliberate design choice. The game is about disempowerment and vulnerability, which is important to creating a horror experience. To further the vulnerability, the main character has asthma. That means he can't run very far without stopping to get his breath, and we use the stamina to create tense situations.We wanted to create a focus on immersion. That's why there is no UI, hud, or traditional game mechanics. We want you to forget you are playing a game and get lost in our nightmare-scapes. It's not very long. A playthrough to one ending is between 1.5 and 2 hours. However, we have 3 different endings with unique content leading up to them, so I would recommend playing all nightmares. That will add another hour or two to your playtime.Will you like this game? That really depends on what you are looking for. If you are looking for a unique take a horror with thick atmosphere, then I think you'll love what we are offering. If you are turned off by short games or ones without a lot of challenge, then this may not be the game for you. It's tough to make a game that appeals to everyone, but I think we've created a special game that a lot of people will really love.Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy the game! :) "

												Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!“Neverending Nightmares” is one of the more aptly named titles for a game on Steam (y'know, besides ""Shannon Tweeds Attack of the Groupies""), because that is exactly what will plague you upon playing it: never-ending nightmares. This is bleak, brutal, and brief – like every good horror should be.As Thomas you wake up from a nightmare... only to realize that you're still asleep, still dreaming. And like a Freudian Dante you'll make your descent down the increasingly bizarre and menacing circles of your inner Hell searching for your Beatrice... of sorts. The world is sketched starkly and wildly in black and white (like a schizophrenic's scribblings) with the occasional accent of blood red and sickly yellow to mark manipulable objects and pretty much every childhood fear, irrational or otherwise, you still foster in your beating heart: darkness, gore, claustrophobia, self-harm, asylums, creepy porcelain-skinned, raven-haired girls, dolls... it touches on them all. ♥♥♥♥ing dolls. ♥♥♥♥ing dolls and raven-haired girls, man. Some people are afraid of heights. Some people are afraid of clowns. I'm afraid of dolls and women with black hair and fair complexions. And if you aren't, you will be.The atmosphere is thick in this one. As you progress slowly from room to room and area to area, the game will do its damnedest to put you on edge. China will crash to the floor with no prompting, birds slam into windows with suicidal intent, and shadowy figures dissipate as you draw close. Then the tension will ease off, and your guard will be lowered. That's when the game will hit you. And it will hit you relentlessly. As I've said, this will touch on all your creeping nightmares... and perhaps some new ones will blossom. How great for you! “Neverending Nightmares” utilizes its jumpscares effectively. While they are numerous, they're only as scary as the atmosphere allows and let me tell you, it abides.According to the “About This Game” section, “Neverending Nightmares” is in part inspired by a developer's own struggle with mental illness. And that absolutely comes across in the game. The jarring, not-initially-clear story, the imagined monsters... and the real ones; the soft, distorted, plinky music and “mental ward sketching” look of the art... it feels very personal. And the game benefits from it. This is a man's soul laid bare, complete with an intimate, artistic peephole into his troubled mind. It gives the game character. More importantly, it makes it that much more terrifying and tangible.“Neverending Nightmares” doesn't overstay its welcome, keeping it fresh and frightening. And with the divergent endings you'll likely get some replayability, but don't expect to revisit this one over and over as it's fairly linear. It isn't all that challenging either, though that isn't why I play horrors. I play them to have a story told to me... a story told to me by an unspeakable horror that has me bound to a chair in basement with a lone, swinging light bulb above my head. And it's on the fritz. “Neverending Nightmares” is one of the better ways to ring in a new spooktastic October.			"

												While I really enjoyed this game I do think it's good to know what you are getting into as this game is not for everybody. I've seen some reviews and comments where people complain this game is both short and has very little real game-elements. Both of which are true. So if you are looking for an action packed lengthy horror-game, this might not be the best choice for you. If you however enjoy atmosphere and an 'experiance' this is really worth picking up.Neverending Nightmares is more like games such as Dear Esther, Gone Home or even Journey. It's not really the gameplay or the length. It's all about being sucked into an experiance and the atmosphere being presented to you. It's still very different from those games however. For one this is a really disturbing exeriance, it's a horror game after all. It does have some mild puzzle solving (how to avoid some enemies). The main thing is the visual style. The art, both graphically and sound make this game and this experiance.Knowing that you are going through things in the game based on the real nightmares the developer experianced being clincally depressed also helps to better understand the game. You aren't playing it for the sake of playing it as a video-game. This is experiancing the night-terrors of another real humanbeing.Minor downpoints is that you sometimes do have to walk a lot before something new happens. I understand it's building tension, but sometimes a few less rooms would have helped. Ironically, the game might have been better if it has been slightly shorter in that sense.Your sense of 'dread' also depends on the imagery, sound effects and jump scares. You quickly learn that death doesn't really impact. Which I do find a good desission. It's not about avoiding death, it's about the atmosphere. By the end however I could predict there an enemy encounter would probably happen as a bedroom was also nearby (if you 'die'  you awake in the closest bedroom). All in all I highly recommend this game and hold it in high regard. But know it's not a game for everybody.			"

												Was very keen to try this one... (Watch out people, another long one. This one’s slightly personal).…for a few key reasons!In its description it reads “Neverending Nightmares is a psychological horror game inspired by the developer's actual battle with mental illness.”, “Nightmare worlds inspired by real life struggles with OCD and depression”. Which are all points of interest for me. I really enjoy psychology and I have had more than my fair share of mental illness myself in much of the same respects. Being someone who has also had experiences with depression and night terrors, it was almost personal to me. I had to try this game. I’ve read very mixed reviews on this. Some love it, others think that it’s not a horror, not scary or compelling enough to play because of its “Walking Simulator” qualities. Which I’d have to say is true to certain extents, there is quite a bit of walking, but the nature of this game is not the norm. This isn’t a typical horror game. I’d say this is more of an experience then a horror game. At least that is the way that it comes across to me.I was very interested to see what kind of stuff would come up in this from what it’s based on. The difficult thing with dreams and nightmares is you can show and tell someone what happened, but you can’t always bring across the emotions, how you felt and the general tone and atmosphere of the dream for that very reason. An example being that I have a phobia (or Phonophobia to be more precise), an irrational fear, which I could try to explain to someone, but ultimately they’ll never understand the real feeling of having this overwhelming fear for something even you know is absolutely ridiculous.(This is where it gets personal, skip this section if you frankly couldn’t give a rat’s♥♥♥♥♥♥)The one thing this game brought back from the back junk filed caverns of my brain was an experience I had. I would wake up (still dreaming) in my room, and the tiniest little detail would be out of place. Whatever was out of place would “clue” as to what phobia I had developed in that particular dream. If I didn’t figure it out in time, I’d be killed. By something relating to the phobia I had just developed. For example, an out of place poster on my wall that advertised Claustrophobia. I didn’t recognise it in time, a TV turned on in my room and it showed rows upon rows of beds, pairs of which that were opposite each other would slowly move toward another, then slam together face to face. Crushing the people inside. Starting from the furthest away and working its way to me I had to force myself to “wake up”. Only to wake up in my room again, a new slightly different oddity in my room, a new clue and a new phobia. This happened what felt like hundreds of times. Safe to say when I finally woke up for real I was sat on my bed examining my room for something out of place like a true maniac. That experience being what this game reminded me of. It’s not the exact same, but it definitely rang a few bells.I am beyond a pansy when it comes to scary games and I was able to play this without stopping, hiding behind something and absolutely dreading moving forward like I have with traditional horror games. It’s gory, but it’s not particularly scary. Don’t get me wrong, this game builds tension and suspense and really had me and my heart rate going at times, but I don’t play many horrors games because of how big of a baby I am. If it couldn’t get my of all people’s jimmies truly rustling, I doubt it will for you.Gameplay wise, you walk, you avoid and you run. There isn’t much to it, but where it lacks in gameplay it makes up in other aspects. The art style and use of colour is wonderful. Things that are coloured can be interacted with. A lot of things you can interest I was honestly curious as to what the significance of. Maybe they are just there for curiosities sake? Some are items you can use but most are just little things in the scene to get a closer look. The settings are interesting and at times almost labyrinth like. I was torn between feeling like it was linear and I was on the right path and feeling like I was going in circles and was completely lost. It definitely added to the game. Wasn’t at all frustrating for me. Finally, story. I’m not sure I would go as far as saying there is a story given the nature of nightmares. But you can tell there is definitely a recurring theme. Which is interesting! Made me wonder. This is definitely one of those games I would actually be interested in hearing the developer talk about. All in all (thank god it’s over, right?) this is a great little indie game. I enjoyed it!It’s an interesting experience and it’s a pretty easy 100% which is always a nice bonus!TL;DR : (Don’t blame you) You walk a lot and gameplay wise you don’t do much. But it makes up with that with a wonderful art style and an interesting theme/story. It’s an easy 100% and I think it’s definitely worth a try. Especially if you like this psychology hoop-la, like I do! "

												Neverending Nightmares, in my opinion, isn't all that great.It's got an interesting art style, the audio is good, there's a few interesting ideas... But there's not too much more for me to say. Gameplay is... Okay, if not super simple. Mainly just walking left or right, looking for an item, some enemy avoidance or running from enemies in places, going back and forth to and fro. And that'd even be okay... But the story completely lets itself down. Playing it, I knew it was going to be a game that would be made or broken by its story, and it just does not deliver. It has all this mystery, surrealism, themes, and absolutely no pay-off. I don't want to say too much, but the game has three-endings, and not the good multiple ending kind. Basically, there's no real meaning to anything as the endings suggest different potential 'answers', and with that, are the most cliche-horror answers you could think of.It's not terrible, worth it if interested, and there are some good scares (many front-loaded) and moments, but there's just not enough there, and what is there isn't backed up by a complete vision to be a worthwhile experience. Pieces of it are good and interesting, but let down by simplified, repetitive gameplay, and an uninteresting, cliched open-ended narrative.			"

												What Neverending Nightmare does right:+ Amazing black and white style,+ Tension filled sounds and monsters that really give a creepy atmosphere.+ Great concept with a storyline that will keep you unnerved and guessing.What Neverending Nightmare does wrong, and is enough of a reason to only watch it played and not buy it.- Gameplay is nothing short of slow walking.- Very little to interact with.- Painfully short, I completed the game in 1.4 hours.- A joke of a pricetag for its limited length.- Little incentive to discover alternate endings.Neverending Nightmares is a game that had a lot of potentional, and is one of those games you really want to love, until you get bored of the constant slow walking, little development in the characters and storeline, and realise the game is far too short.This is a great example of blown potential, and I wish I could get a refund.

												Dammit, I hate that I didn't enjoy this game more.  The graphics and sounds are superb, and every minute of it is genuinely creepy and nightmarish.  The problem is that it's incredibly tedious and feels pointless after a while.The ""gameplay"" is just walking (VERY slowly) through a house where, despite becoming increasingly surreal and disturbing, the scenery is too repetitive.  Oh, and occasionally trying to avoid encounters with passing creatures, which is just about my least favorite thing to do in a video game.  It just gets to be so dull.  And sadly, I think this repetition was totally intentional, a ""his nightmare is OUR nightmare"" feeling of being stuck in a desperate place and unable to escape.  It just fails at this, badly, as the game becomes unbearably boring.By the time I reached one of the endings, I was SO ready for it to be over, despite the game's short length.  I have no intention of replaying to experience the other endings, especially since they require plodding through the asylum scene again, which is the most tedious part of the game.I started out loving the game, but when boredom set in, it hit hard.  Also, it's overpriced.  A game that can be finished in a couple hours should cost 4 or 5 bucks.			"

												The greatest and most effective aspect of horror is the tension and the atmosphere, the feeling of creeping unknown terror that lurks around each corner ahead, the mysterious buzzing sounds of some vile machine sprinkled with the curious moanings of what one could only guess are tortured souls. When it comes to horror, it's hardly ever the execution of cheap scares or the appearance of the actual monster that are scary or make the experience, but the thick and heavy atmosphere and the suspense that it builds in you throughout the journey and this is exactly where Neverending Nightmares excels above and beyond everything I have come to expect from the horror genre.Neverending Nightmares tells its chilling story of endless terror in the heart of a young boy through brilliantly gritty black and white artwork that evokes a strong nostalgia in me for the works of Edward Gorey, and the influence is obviously strong both in visuals and narrative content. This mysterious story of a troubled young protagonist shows a deep connection between him and his sister, and yet he seems to be so alone, so isolated in this nightmare realm. The effects of prolonged solitude and isolation from the rest of the world can bring about these strange and hard to manage feelings of anxiety or OCD, and it creates a feeling of fear and distrust towards the few humans that are close to the inflicted. We see this fear in the protagonist and his close relationship with his sister as his visions slowly distort the image of this caring force in his life into someone who doesn't even recognize who he is.The title screen alone gives a foreboding and chilling effect as the eerie sounding notes of a piano descend peculiarly in the same way the player will descend into progressively bizarre and terrifying realms of what seems to be the characters own mind. Deeper into the hauntings of your nightmares you will journey, waking up over and over again only to find yourself in an even more terrifying nightmare than the last like some kind of harrowing metaphor for the day-to-day dealings of those who suffer from mental health issues.With each passing of these horrible nights that seem to be a dream or vision our protagonist awakens back in his bed suddenly, gasping for air and trying to put together the pieces of what he saw. Each time you awaken startled out from your slumber your environments change and the place you once called home slowly evolves into something hellish and terrifying. More and more with each damning vision your surroundings become enshrouded with antique oddities and bizzare, grotesque imagery.I'm not the biggest fan of horror, not because I get scared easily but because blood and gore never really do it for me. I was kinda exposed to a lot of violent entertainment as a kid unfortunately and saw a lot of thriller and slasher flicks and such at probably too early an age.  I became totally desensitized to shock values in horror. This game, though.. This effects me in ways I can't really explain, and wouldn't feel comfortable explaining because it really hits home with issues I've had dealing with insomnia and anxiety at a younger age although clearly not as extreme as what the developer, who states that his own real life experiences were a huge influence on the game, has been through. The point, either way, seems to be that mental health, no matter how small or severe, is a real issue that needs to be looked at more seriously especially in the gaming world.Despite the very sparse dialogue the characters are given incredible authentic personality through the emotions they portray throughout the game. The sound design is the best I've heard in a horror game and recommends you use headphones, I can see exactly why and would absolutely recommend it now as well. The effects all come at you from every direction and make you feel like footsteps accompanied by the rattling of chains are closing in behind and faint whispering can be heard as you step deeper into dark basements, the atmosphere is so thick and heavy that I find myself stopping to catch my breath and gather my thoughts.Still, after a couple playthroughs and seeing half of the endings I am left with so many question on what exactly our main character is going through. What causes him to see some of these visions, particularly of the cruel happenings between him and his sister? Which of these events are reality, and which are merely a figment of his paranoid and anxious mind? This is a story I will revisit and contemplate many times, and it's a story I'll be determined to show everyone I know with or without an interest in the subject matter of mental health. Neverending Nightmares manages to be genuinely terrifying and surpasses even the most realistic 3D horror experiences on PC simply through the usage of skin-tingling atmosphere and an art style that won't soon be forgotten.

												Neverending Nightmares feels so confident in its disturbed vision, until it comes time to actually say something.The opening is fantastically unsettling, agitated hand draw artwork clashing with splashes of unexplainable depravity in a way that’s captivating in its skill at disorienting and frightening the player. It alludes to great things in Neverending Nightmares’ future; the idea that this might be a horror game which actually means something, pulling terror from the traumatic experiences of its developer and in doing so making it apparent to others how hard it is to live with them.But despite what Neverending Nightmares wants to be, what it comes so close to being in its strongest moments, it lacks a deep enough understanding of itself to be able to fully accomplish it. Its effort is impressive and commendable, but its failure to completely reject the conventions of its less inspired horror peers caused me to feel uncertain what exactly Neverending Nightmares hoped to achieve, as well as call into question its ability to do so.Neverending Nightmares essentially works on two stages. There is the build up to a pivotal scene – slow nervous walks through dark corridors, dread hanging in the air over things hiding in the shadows – and then there is the climax of you current loop, in which you come face to face with whatever horrific abomination or memory has been haunting you. In this formula Neverending Nightmares is fairly comfortable and for a while succeeds in balancing the level of tension with due time for it to grow and dissipate, but somewhere around halfway through it introduces a third disrupting stage, that being terrifying abominations which can hunt and kill you long before you’ve made it to the next leg of your journey.I don’t wish to imply that I think death and repetition is unusual or an instant fowl for horror games in general, as when used properly it can elevate the terror by keeping you feeling vulnerable and on edge. Neverending Nightmares doesn’t fit into this genre the way many of its contemporaries do however, and through almost every aspect of its design is unprepared to have you need deal with threats in any meaningful way. Your ability to interact with the world is almost solely reserved to opening doors and occasionally picking up a key item, which leaves avoidance as your only means of moving forward when something more deadly is in your way. Except, nothing about Neverending Nightmares feels as if it was built to allow you to hide or quickly move the way you need to for this style of play to work. Its solution then is to create monsters nearly as incapable as yourself, but in doing so it disrupts the authenticity of its world and creates an awkward hurdle for you to constantly crawl over.Once the limitations of your enemies become clear, getting past them is little more than a chore. Being unable to follow you past the room they exist in means any threat is only that for as long as it takes you to walk to the next door, and in many cases enemies won’t even see you if you’re slightly higher or lower on the screen than them (though the game is 2D you can still move slightly up and down on that plane). Their necessarily predictable movement patterns serve as the final knock to any sense of place Neverending Nightmares may have had, leaving it a bundle of transparent design conventions which grind noisily against each other as the game struggles to hold onto an identity fast slipping away.By the end however it wouldn’t have mattered if Neverending Nightmares had found a way to make its mechanical insides work together, because it isn’t working toward any end worth arriving at. The scattered plot becomes more threadbare and contradictory as it goes on, fabricating confusing imagery and dialogue for the sake of actual progression. In the end it settles for tired, hastily wrapped up clichés which gave little closure and felt more bizarre and unfocused than anything Neverending Nightmares had showed me thus far. It felt like too little too late, a tame closure to a game that moments prior was assaulting me with nauseatingly continual depictions of a woman being mutilated, hung up like a slab of meat, and thrown from a window into a crumbled mess of limbs. There is a lot of messed up stuff in Neverending Nightmares, but these final scenes were the only time it really got to me, because it felt gratuitous and pointless in a way that everything else had not.I’m as much disappointed with Neverending Nightmares being a dull and uninteresting horror game, as I am with it failing to live up to its potential of being something more than just an excuse to get freaked out. With so much trashy, exploitative horror with no goal at being anything but that, Neverending Nightmares seemed to want to do something more, delving into the real psychological horror  of its developer and wrapping it up in a distinct visual style that all hinted at this being a project trying to do something different. I can’t say Neverending Nightmares didn’t try, but somehow that only caused it to fall further down the well of tired horror traditions.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. "

  Introduction                             When the developer says using headphones is a better experience in this game, they are telling the truth. Along the headphone, using a controller will help expand the experience with the rumble motors. Using headphones and a controller i had a amazing experience with this unique horror game. Throughout playing this game, I was unnerved by the creepy atmosphere the visuals and sound give help off. Although this game has such an amazing atmosphere throughout it , i did find myself getting bored with the game. It could use more puzzles or some kind of different game elements. Along with being a bit slow the puzzles are not very hard. Even though there is same pacing issue, I had zero issues when it came to any bugs. The atmosphere the game creates can hard to explain, but it is one of the stand out features for this game.   Pros                Amazing Atmosphere  Intriguing Story  Neat art style  Unique experience  It really gives you that creepy feeling     Cons               Can get repetitive  Could use more content  The few puzzles are not hard      Conclusion                                  Neverending Nightmare is an artistic look at the horror genre. It may have some pacing issues and the difficulty may be nonexistent, but the amazing atmosphere/art style fully makes up for the few issues. I wouldn't say go buy this game right now, but to wait for it to go on sale.  -HiPFiRED  If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCheck out the Original Network Groups.

												I should probably preface this by informing you that I took place in the pre-alpha testing of Neverending Nightmares as a reward for backing the game. I have been exposed to the game much longer than most people probably will. So obviously, you know that it’s a horror game, but not in the same way Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Outlast, Slender, or SCP Containment Breach are. Those use a first person perspective to create more personal jump scares and to create a more realistic atmosphere; Neverending Nightmares doesn’t have nearly as many jump scares as those do and focuses on enhancing a very foreboding atmosphere and telling a story. Neverending Nightmares has a lot more in common with Gone Home then the other titles mentioned.The story in NN can easily get confusing and requires some analysis to fully understand. Depending on which ending you get, you may be greatly disappointed in the game. I feel like only one of the endings actually has closure while the other two are much better if experienced after the first ending. The game tries to push the player to the first ending, but there is one branch that I feel could have been done much better in pushing the player in the right direction (SPOILER: it’s at the end of the asylum level. I feel like most people will probably jump off the edge just to see what happens, even if there’s a teetering animation. This is problematic because the way to the first ending is by going back into the asylum).The horror in NN mostly comes from the atmosphere and imagery; not too much from the feeling of being chased or stalked like in SCP or, Slender. If you want something like those games then you’ll probably be somewhat disappointed with NN. Not to say that NN doesn’t have jump scares but they’re placed throughout the game very sparingly like in Amnesia, or Silent Hill. Silent Hill is somewhat similar to NN, but Silent Hill had more of a puzzle focus than NN does. The puzzles in NN are pretty easy and even become easier if you can’t seem to figure it out (note, that these “hints” are designed not to break your immersion, so there will be no word box that appears; rather, something in the environment will change to lead you in the right direction). If you expect the cryptic puzzles found in Silent Hill, then you’ll probably be disappointed.From my interactions with Matt Gilgenbach, the creative director, and my many playthroughs of the game, I figured that immersion is probably the biggest priority in this game. Many things that are just looked over in other games have a reason for it to happen; for example, every time the player dies, he wakes up in a bed as if that death was just a nightmare. Other games would probably just throw a “game over” screen and have you try again—and there’s nothing wrong with that, but NN creates a narrative reason to player deaths, which boosts immersion. Immersion also works well with the way the game tells its story since attention to the game environments is expected to fully understand many of the details in the story. I feel like the game’s short length also encourages replays since it’s a lot easier to study the environments of a two-hour game than a twenty-hour one. So in conclusion, for what it is, NN is a great experience that I would recommend it to anyone who likes disturbing horror with a thought-out story, and a very distinctive art style. The game isn't really going to make you scream like other horror games, the game will give you more of an uncomfortable feeling while playing. I wouldn’t recommend it to people who generally don’t like/are getting sick of games that don’t have too many gameplay features, ie games that tend to be “artsy” like Gone Home, and Journey.			"

												Disclaimer: I took part in the Kickstarter campaign in order to get this game funded. As a result I’ve been playing the game for a good number of months in its Alpha/Beta stages, giving feedback and talking with the developers about the game.-TL;DR version-The game is a wonderfully crafted psychological horror game that builds its horror around crafting a dark and foreboding atmosphere. It also does a great job at emphasising a slower, more disturbing tone than a traditional startling tone. The game being inspired by the visions and thoughts of someone with mental illness give a very genuine and unnerving feel to everything, which as a result makes for one of the best horror games that I’ve played in recent times. Definitely worth your time if you’re a horror fan and want something that’ll truly get under your skin.-Long version-Neverending Nightmares is a psychological horror game based upon the intrusive thoughts that have plagued developer Matt Gilgenbach over the years as a result of his mental illness. You play as Thomas, a man who initially when the game begins wakes up from a nightmare. From then on the game is shaped around Thomas’ descent into his mind as he keeps waking up into new nightmares. One major factor is consistent throughout almost all of Thomas’ nightmares, the presence of a girl named Gabby. How she and Thomas are connected remains unclear until one of the games multiple endings. As a result the player is given multiple possible theories to play around and work with; is she your sister? Is she your wife? Is she just a friend? Is she an enemy? The narrative gives the player enough to work with so that they are constantly guessing up until the very end of the game. This constant questioning plays into the world of Neverending Nightmares as you are never certain of what is reality or what is simply a figment of the nightmare you are currently in. As explained earlier the game features multiple branching pathways that lead to multiple endings (3 in total). These branches change the story of the game in various unique ways making the entire motivation behind the nightmares different in each ending, as a result it is encouraged that you playthrough multiple times to acquire all the endings and experience new nightmares that can only be found on that pathway. This added replayability should give you around an hour or two extra playtime once your first playthrough is completed. The gameplay of Neverending Nightmares follows a 2D adventure format. You walk around various environments, interact with objects and explore your current nightmare in order to progress forward. If there’s one shortcoming that can be levelled against the game it’s that the gameplay itself, on an objective level, is rather basic. The formula doesn’t change too drastically from nightmare to nightmare, with only some minor puzzle solving elements being introduced when dealing with enemies. However there’s enough story and horror to help strengthen the gameplay, making you intrigued to progress further. In terms of actual control Neverending Nightmares adopts a very simple control style, with the only major functions being move, interact and sprint. This simplicity however doesn’t detract from the overall product in a major way.  The controls themselves are spot on, with the player being able to move Thomas in any which way they please, as well as being fully re-bindable. The controls also play into the horror as Thomas suffers from asthma, so he can only sprint for a short distance which requires effective management so the player isn’t left in a compromising situation. There are also other sections that play with the controls in interesting ways, however you shall have to find those out for yourself.But what’s a horror game without the horror right? Well you’ll find your needs met with Neverending Nightmares. As this is a semi-autobiographical product a lot of the horror has been drawn from real experiences and visions, which really adds to the game's atmosphere. Some of the visions and imagery you experience in Neverending Nightmares is truly disturbing, especially with the added context of it being taken from a very real place. From body mutilation to overwhelming darkness, there are multiple instances where you will be truly afraid or horrified of what may or may not be around the next turn. Often times you’ll find yourself simply walking down a hallway, however the game slowly begins to twist and bend the environment to play with you. Distant whispers, growls within the darkness, words written in blood are simply some of the tactics that start to put you on edge. From there everything only builds and continues to build, making the player wonder “When is something going to attack me?” “Where’s the next safe spot?” “What will happen if I go down these stairs?”. Often times you will have never even seen an enemy that could potentially kill you and you’re still on edge, just waiting…Waiting for the inevitable. All of this contributes into creating a horror game that understands that the best way to create fear is to let the player scare themselves. However for those who like and appreciate the more startling aspects to horror, there are still elements of that in here with some well crafted jumpscares that are never too abundant to become tiresome.One aspect of the game that can be critiqued is the brevity and challenge of the game. Neverending Nightmares isn’t the most challenging of horror games. Often times you are able to bypass enemies with relative ease once you determine their behaviour and the game is decidely linear which leads little room to get lost. As a result the game in one playthrough can be finished in around 2-3 hours, however with the added branches there is an extra hour or two of gameplay added on top. With that said, the game is much more focused on the experience than challenge. By focusing more on the experience, the team at Infinitap Games are able to create a very lean game that packs all of horror into one sleek package. As a result the horror itself is a lot more impactful rather than being bogged down by repetition or filler. How you feel on the matter however is something that should be left up to you, just be aware that the game isn’t particularly lengthy or challenging before going in. Finally the visual/audio design is superb throughout. The Edward Gorey inspired art design stands out as being something unique within the genre, it also creates a storybook-esque style that meshes well with the horrific atmosphere. The audio design is top notch with subtle flourishes of music and ambient noises that play on your mind all throughout the game. Voice acting, whilst being slightly underplayed in the story as a whole, conveys the suitable amount of emotion required to make you empathise with Thomas’ struggle and dubious of Gabby’s true intentions.All in all I can say that the money I spent on Kickstarting this game was not made in vain. Neverending Nightmares succeeds at crafting a satisfying horror experience that toys with the player in a wonderfully fresh way. The semi-autobiographical angle gives the whole game a very grounded and real atmosphere, making you see some of the worst that mental illness does to people.In my opinion, it’s one of my favourite horror games in recent memory and definitely worth a purchase for any horror fan.

												I've played both the demo and the first chunk of the beta release, and I am SO excited for the official release! Completely original in both concept and graphic design, and not only are the controls smooth but every aspect about the gameplay itself is extremely intriguing. Neverending Nightmares is very successful in delivering psychological unease visually and through atmospheric ambience, just like pixel horror games such as ""Mad Father"" and ""Witch's House"" were able to do. Would definitely recommend this game who likes more psychological horror and an interesting yet somewhat cryptic plotline over blatant jumpscares and chases in the more ""traditional"" horror games.

												If you're looking for a short, atmospheric, and creepy horror game, Neverending Nightmares will scratch that itch for you.  Each nightmare that you experience leads into the next, slowly revealing the reason that you're there in the first place.  To get the full effect of the game, it's recommended that you play with a headset and a controller as the ambient sound and rumble features are implemented.The game is short, I completed it in about an hour and a half.  There are three separate endings that you can unlock based on a few of the choices in the second half of the game.  I was unaware that I was even making choices on my playthrough as they are not obvious until they are revealed at the end.All in all, this is a good game and a fun experience.  I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys atmospheric horror with an unfolding mystery added in that explains why it's all happening.  I must say that I personally would recommend only picking it up on a sale, though, as the current $15 price tag is a bit steep for what is offered.			"

												I backed this game on Kickstarter but never played the alphas and betas when they were available because I wanted to get the full effect of the game and I was afraid that playing it in an unfinished state would ruin the experience for me. I'm glad I waited. This game is a masterpiece. It's just as much a work of art as it is a game. While creepy, gory and somewhat disturbing I'm hesitant to call this game horror (although I did yell out loud once while playing lol). I've only seen one ending so far and I'm pretty impressed with it. I can't wait to see the others. What impresses me so much is the art though. Most of the game is in black and white, with only blood, body parts and objects you can interact with in color. The run mechanics are good and there were definitely a few challenging parts. I'd recommend this game to horror fans (although I don't exactly consider this horror), platformer fans and anyone who just wants to experience a well-made game.			"

“Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her in so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer--both in waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams.” ― Bram Stoker, DraculaI've been wanting to play this game for a long while, and I've finally managed to do so, the other day. For a month, I found myself quitting each and every time when I sit before this game, even with the perfect resolve to complete it. Yesterday, I did it. In the end, it left me with mixed feelings. I certainly appreciated the art and the thought process, yet did I love the game? I think ""love"" is a big word to define this particular psychosis.The game is a survival horror adventure + walking simulation. Young Thomas is a man trapped within his own nightmares. He wakes up in an old Victorian mansion - presumably his parents' house - and starts to walk around, pacing within countless disturbing settings which supposedly represent his own subconscious. By the end of each nightmare, a new one starts, and he wakes into another nightmare, and another... and so this goes on and on. Every time that he wakes up, the nightmare seems to twist into a bit more disturbing and gory version of what he has already encountered. Themes of immense depression, guilt and decay are omnipresent. Thomas' only tie to the reality is a young woman, who seems to be his sister: Gabby or Gabriella... who constantly dies, for some reason. Symbolisms we gotta look beyond of? Hmph, I finished the game with all endings even, and I still don't know.The opening of the game is pretty disturbing and catches your attention quickly. The artwork is hand drawn, an eerie pen & ink style drawing that recalls Edward Gorey. I should state that an immense labor was put into even the art of the game. Everything is in black and white, drawn with countless dots and brush marks to work on furling shadows. Only blood and certain objects that you can interact with are presented in colors. Combined with background sounds like whispers, dragging noises, moans and whimpers; an astonishing atmosphere awaits you. Yet this atmosphere quickly loses its effect as the game continues.The dynamics of the game are pretty basic. There is a tense, lonely period weaved with suspense and scattered flashes of bad omens which makes you tiptoe; and then comes the climax of either a bad memory or a gory enough scene. This equation loops each and every time, added up with the optional presence of a monster to avoid. After a while, added with the loss of direction due to ""neverending"" display of the same environments with some new events, you start expecting what is to come and everything normalizes quickly. After the first half an hour, you get used to the dynamic and the thrill loses its effect over you. You start playing the game automated, just for the sake of finishing it in hopes of understanding the storyline.Gameplay only gives you the option of walking in a direction, rarely pick an object and change rooms via doors. Oh, and you have the option of running for a little while with the shift keys, if you are to avoid a monster. If you keep a different elevation, you are able to avoid most monsters. For others, you only need to leave the room. I completed all endings with only 4 death counts, once for each kind of monster you have to deal with and I'm not particularly good with my reflexes either. If I managed, anyone can manage to avoid monsters, endure some gory scenes and finish all endings within 3 hours if they want. That kinda diminishes the thrill of the game and with this much repetition, it gets boring quickly.We are informed that the designer of the game, Matt Gilgenbach dealt with severe depression and OCD which gave inspiration to creating this game. In my opinion, the artwork and the themes used may indicate depression, but the only indication of OCD that I've observed is the art style itself, consisting of countless hand drawn lines and dots. Whew! That is OCD if I've seen one! But the gameplay and the story has nothing to do with any of these mental conditions. So it would be hypocritical to exemplify this game to promote awareness for either depression or OCD. No, I'm not a psychologist, but I'm sufficiently trained in psychology and, I suffer from minor OCD. I also had a brief depression period 5 years back - as any individual with an above average IQ in modern society. Yet again, experience is always subjective so I cannot declare mine as the sole verdict on an artwork.On my own experience, I cannot recommend this game. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for symbolism and well-crafted atmospheres, and I certainly don't declare myself as capable to understand everything concerning human psyche, but there is no consistent story. Only details thrown around to make room for you to craft a meaningful story yourself. I've read an explanation in discussion forums, and thought ""this should be it"" long after I finished the game. Aside its success on atmosphere, this game ends up being an excuse for gore. Combined with its flawed horror dynamic, I'd say the current price is real steep for what you're getting yourself into. Then again, art IS subjective.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												Neverending Nightmares is an incredibly unique horror experience. The art creates a striking visual style all its own, and the game further sets itself apart by streamlining the experience of gameplay; it forgoes inventory systems and onscreen interface elements to present a player interaction that is focused completely on what's happening in the protagonist's nightmare world.It is not without jump scares, but they are spread judiciously throughout and well earned by the slowly built tension. Instead, the game wisely chooses to focus more on the subtle. Like a good horror movie, it plays with your expectations and eases you gradually into the terrifying. Shadowy movements in the corner of your screen and barely heard voices and sounds set the stage for the actual dangers yet to come. The game's unique and beautiful lighting system makes the darkness itself into a living entity, and it constantly shifts and pulsates around you, at times threatening to suffocate.The music and audio are exceptional. Everything from the pained rasping of the main character's asthmatic breaths to the low growls of unseen creatures lurking in the darkness serve to pull you deeper into this nightmare world. The music is simultaneously eerie, ominous and beautiful.The game features branching paths that lead to multiple endings, each of them ambiguous in their own way. The story often follows a bizarre dream (or nightmare) logic that defies rational explanation and begs replay.This is truly something to be experienced, ideally with the lights off, headphones on, and a controller with rumble.

												Neverending Nightmare is a horror adventure style game. This game was released in September 2014 on Steam.You play the role of Thomas, the idea behind the game is that you keep experiencing nightmares, but you keep waking up and going straight into another one.  Each nightmare gets worse and worse every time - and the gameplay elements in them become harder too. The game also has a pretty cool save system in that if you die, you end up waking up just a few moments before in the same nightmare. The actual gameplay is fairly simple - it almost works like a point and click adventure game, but you walk around either using WASD or a controller. As you navigate around the levels, you encounter certain objects which can be interacted with or picked up to use in someway, such as a candle. You will also face a couple of enemies which you have no way of killing, you just have to either avoid or sneak past. Graphically, Never-ending Nightmares is a 2D hand-drawn line art style. This looks really cool and really puts across the point that this is a never ending dream; all of the colours are the same every room looks identical to the last but with subtle changes. This game comes with three different endings, I haven't figured out really how to get different endings to the one I already have got, but there are guides online if you are into that sort of thing. My first run through NM took me about two hours to complete. This would of been considerably shorter if not for a few irritating moments involving sneaking past a difficult monster, but I felt this time was OK for this type of game. Like I said, there are two other endings which will make this a pretty decent length title, but others may be looking for a bit more longivity for the price this is on sale for. I didn't have any technical problems whilst playing, I did however see something which I think should be mentioned - no loading screens. I don't think games get enough credit when they implement something like that, having no loading screens at all really keeps you immersed in your surroundings and the game. My final thoughts would be to pick this game up if you are into the atmospheric horror genre of games; but don't go into it expecting fast paced action because you will be thoroughly disappointed as there is virtually no action here. But for what it is, which is a well presented horror game with an awesome looking art style, then you'll get some enjoyment out of it. Personally I think that the £10,99 is a bit steep, maybe wait for it to go for -25% off before picking it up just because of a single ending only takes 2 hours to see.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away 2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												[I backed this, just so you know.]It is very tempting to lump this into the ""walking simulator"" category. That's pretty much all you do most of the time - you're going through (largely linear) corridors and taking in the scenery. There are no puzzles. There's no inventory. It's short. The player character is slow as a snail. There's little interaction with the environment.But, there are threats and obstacles to traverse. There are branching paths and endings that range from obvious to very subtle. In fact, much of the changes in the environment (and thus the story it tells) is incredibly subtle and easy to miss. The mechanics present in each chapter are minimalistic (it's always about simply moving, really) - it is clear the entire game has been deliberately designed to have the bare minimum of interaction, to focus on the atmosphere and unraveling of the plot and setting.This is a double-edged sword. On one hand, you don't have interesting (expanded) mechanics to keep the player engaged. On the other, the game builds tension and dread almost perfectly because there is no clutter in-between the player and the spooky. Every time the player thinks the game is starting to get predictable, it throws a curveball. There are some really well done moments (no, not jumpscares, even though there are a few of those as well) that could easily fit in a Clock Tower or Silent Hill game. It would be a shame to miss those.The (objectively!) best part of the game is the sound design - it is absolutely necessary to play with headphones to get the full experience. There's plenty of dynamic changes to the BGM along with superb sound effects, even completely fine voice acting too. The credits song is practically a Yamaoka homage. Props to McGlothlin.The artstyle is also worth a mention. Everything is in black and white, except blood and interactive objects that are shaded in different colours. It feels like a cross between a child's scribbles and a newspaper caricature. There is a huge amount of detail put into scenery, and there is one nightmare that makes very good use of this style to keep you on edge. There's a surprising amount of gore and uncomfortable imagery too, making it pop out even more.All things said and done, if you like horror in general, you'll probably like this too. If you enjoy survival horror though, your mileage may vary. It's worth the couple of hours, especially if on sale.			"

												The Goreyian art style and superb audio effects make for some creepy moments, but that's really all this game has to offer- a few creepy moments. The gameplay itself is linear and repetitive, but the real crime is that those brief moments of creepiness never build to anything more- they don't add up to some chilling tale of dread, or slowly reveal an unimaginable horror- they're just isolated bits of ghastliness without any real substance behind them. This is only emphasized by the multiple endings- rather than all the clues pointing to one inevitable, undeniable terror, it's just a mix n' match of traditional horror imagery. The end doesn't come as revelation, but a sudden 'What? Is that all?'If you're really curious I'd wait until this dips to around the $3 mark, but in the meantime your pennies and yen for suspense would be better spent on Limbo or Gone Home. "

												Under no circumstance should this be recommended at its current price range of $14.99.Usually I tend to scoff at reviews which state that the game under review is lacking in any sort of ""gameplay mechanic(s).""  But, in concern to this game, I wholeheartedly agree.  There is no more to this game than walking forward; pressing two buttons on occasion (one to intereact, one to run - for the duration of one with overly-crippling asthma); and the occasional need to either hide for several seconds, walk slowly, or travel in the opposite direction.The first playthough takes roughly 45-60 minutes and to be honest leaves you not wanting to replay the game again.  Games like this rely on atmosphere and subtext to propel them past their lack of ""gameplay.""  The atmosphere is stale and relies upon filling an area with clutter and then plopping something of slight significance in, hidden amongst everything.  The subtext is bizarre, which is good for the theme of the game, but overly cryptic leaving you to make no sense of the game.The only good thing I can say about this game is that the artwork is absolutely brilliant.  I truly feel that this would have been better suited as an animated short than a game, but hey - indie games are where the money is.			"

												I usually like these sorts of Artsy games (i love stuff like Downfall, cat lady, Gone Home, Dear Esther and co.). So i figured i'd buy this cause it seemed interesting and the art seems good. the game starts out strong, but then after about 30 minutes tedium sets in. you literally walk around the same corridors (same art sets scrambled around) over and over and over for the next 1,2 Hours. The only ""gameplay"" from just walking left, right, up, down are sneaking past a couple of enemies (i think there are only 2 types). it gets pretty boring, i found myself just rushing through at the end (holding down the shift button) which resulted in me having to listen to constant wheezing of the character.so i would definately not recommend this game. watch a lets play if you're intersted instead. i feel i spent too much money on this game. 5 bucks would have been ok.this is the first review i wrote, i just had to to let ppl know what this is about.

												Horror movies very rarely seem to scare me. Horror games on the other hand when done right scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me! Neverending Nightmares is a fantastic example of a horror game done right that had me on edge throughout the entirety of my time spent playing.At it's core NN is just an exploration game. But at it's heart it is much more. NN presents a physhological horror experience of the kind I have never experienced in a game before. Let's start with the sound design. This is what builds up the experience. Ambient noices are present throughout the entire game. They help to build up the fear amazingly. Each sound is designed to absolute perfection. Everything sounds like what it should do and when put together they create a perfect tension throughout the exploration. Their is also a brilliant soundtrack featuring creepy songs such as out of tune record players that build the experience. The only issue I have with sound design is the voice acting. Some of it isn't great. Luckily there are only two characters that speak and they don't speak very often so this is a minor flaw. But it could do with some improvement. Then there's the graphics. It is the most unique choose of graphics I have seen in a game and it is a fantastic choice. The whole game is presented in a handdrawn sketch style art view. NN is a work of art in this mean. The detail the artistic has put into it is an unprecedanted masterpiece. The small details are paid close attention to. Everything from the cracks in the wall to the creepy paintings on the wall help to build up the horror experience. What about the actual horror element? Well it's definitely not for the faint hearted. There is a ""lot"" of gore. I mean a huge amount. You see things like the character chopping their own arm to pieces in excruciating detail! It is extremely disturbing. Now I am not a person that usually get's cringeworthy at gore, but this game had me cringing a few times.But the real horror comes from some of the jump scares. There are few of them compared to other horror games but they are done extremely well. They are not cheap overdone jump scares either. Each of them is well thought out and unique in it's own way. They definitely all come at a suprise. All of them really, really scared me. And as I said before I don't find myself getting scared at jump scares in films but in games it seems completely different. Maybe it's just the fact that you feel like you are actually experiencing it yourself by playing as the main character.The enemies are something of a pleasure as well. Each are very unique. You will often find yourself running from enemies during the game. And that's not because the game is making you but because you are running from your own fear. This paragraph may contain spoilers if you don't want to know about any of the enemies you will be experiencing. Now it may seem cliche to be running from a little girl carrying a knife but somehow NN seems to be able to make the experience seem new. You also have characters you have to hide from in closets or the such. A unique enemy is the blind one that you have to sneak past with making little noise. But the biggest fear I had was for childs dolls. Now that definitely sounds like the biggest cliche ever in horror. But again somehow NN makes dolls coming alive a complete new experience that scared the crap out of me! There are many more enemies as well but you can experience them for yourself.The story is mildly intriguing. It is one of the least standout parts of the games though. I don't know quite how to explain it without spoiling it though so I will just leave it at that. But it seems to get resolved rather quickly at the end of the game and then it just ends. It was a rather disappointing but suprising ending. I have seen in other reviews peoples main complete being about the length of the game. I don't see this as a bad thing. I experienced everything that the game had to offer, including getting every achievement, in just under 3 hours. I think this is a reasonable length. Anymore and I would have found myself getting bored of it. But you may think differently so you should put this into consideration.So I would definitely recommend this game. It is one of the best horror experiences I have played to date. Most things are done to perfection and it is very unique. The only thing that may put people off is the price point of £10.99. I personally think it is well worth this initial price though. I really hope people consider this game and don't put it off to play one of the bigger 3D horror experiences that have nothing on the pyschologial experience neverending nightmares presents.TheIronicGamers rating system Don't ever buy this game. Maybe consider it on a sale. An average game.A good game that should definitely be considered.A must play! "

												I just did an initial playthrough for Neverending Nightmares last night. I was one of the original Backers for this on Kickstarter, and played the initial demo they had for the fundraiser to get a feel for it. Beyond that I have skipped a lot of the videos and discussions and Alpha/Beta tests so as not to spoil the experience of the game.Now as you'll see they went with a classic pseudo Edward Gorey style of art, and this I actually like. The pen like line work is kool and the animations and overall look feel very similar to Gorey. It uses a minimalist color scheme, where interaction objects are color so you can easily spot them and know when to use them (though there is few spots to do this aside from a myriad of portraits to view, cell doors to look in and a bunch of dolls to glance at). The game only has a handful of objects to find, a candle, an axe, umm.. that's about it I think.Most of the game is walking around this large creepy house (or an asylum) just trying to find an end to the ""Nightmare"". Along the way is a bevy of imagery, creepy/dangerous creatures to avoid and a few mild jump scares.What works:Overall sound design is atmospheric and interesting/creepyArt design is solidControl of the character (uses Gamepad or keyboard)Runs at a number of resolutions, all the way to 1080pHas enhanced audio for headphones (it has a warning that it's better to play on them than speakers)Disturbing imagery without going overboard.What misses:First nightmare seems to have more creepy instances and mild jump scares than any other levelshading//lighting is too ""still"" (more on this later)Music becomes quickly monotonous and repetitiveSome areas have noticeable skips where you can tell it's jumping from the end of a hallway to a new hallway when it is supposed to be one continuous hallwayThe character has asthma, so you do get a ""Sprint"" button but you can only use it for short (1/2 a room or so ) bursts and the character makes the same whiny out of breath noises whenever you've sprinted a couple steps.No interaction with the little dialogue that is there.Obscure branching pathsaside from a few tense moments when you first encounter an enemy (and learn how to avoid it) the game is mostly walking and navigating.Where this game just misses is that it feels like everything that is there, at some point was deemed ""good enough"" instead of ""perfect"" or ""great"". This is a trend I suspect I'll see a lot with Indie games and Kickstarter projects by small studio's. With NeN the audio design is good, it has a good somber spooky vibe to the music and the kaleidoscopic of noises that come and go are suitably ""horror game"" sounding. But that's all it is.. background filler. It rarely ramps up or builds to a crescendo, doesn't try to manipulate the player aside from a simple orchestra hit when something jump-scares you. And most of the atmospheric noises are heard no matter where you are, with a few audio cues added for when you are outside or in the asylum or in a bathroom.The visual design is serviceable, but what would have made the game a lot more tense and nerve-wracking would be to make the lines creating shadows a lot less static and a lot more ""noise"". There is a slow crawl series of layers to the lines that create the obscured effect in the game, but they move slowly and from right to left and that's it. Horizontal and vertical lines, when thinking of it like a designer for a home or a useable space, are usually beneficial. vertical lines imply strength and stability. horizontal lines imply peace, calm, and relax a person. ANGLES cause tension. And squiggles or erratic lines also cause tension and unrest. If they had worked on the line work and shading a bit more, and created something that felt unsettled and ""restless"" when you are simply standing there, it would have worked wonders. I harken to playing the original Fatal Frame and how the simple detail that the view of the game was through a grainy film layer, which made every moment of every scene lack a placid stillness that felt calming, and so you were kept on edge even in moment where you were ""safe"".The use of blood around the house was good in the first nightmare, but over time there is more and more blood splatters and strips and puddles. Since there is likely about a dozen or so decals for blood, you see a lot of similar splatters, and over time they end up just feeling cartoonish and copy-paste. Any atmospheric effect it could have is lost, except when you ramp it up and see a room with a LOT of blood on the walls or floor, and by that point it has lost it's shock value.There are a lot of re-used assets. I imagine they created a lot of the objects for the game individually, then placed them around the house to create a variety of halls, rooms and areas to explore. I am not against this, except after seeing the same doll/chair/painting the 50th time. As well the fact that most of the areas you navigate are (again) static and unmoving makes it feel like "" ok here is another room like this.. just need to find the door"". In a lot of ways, stacking this idea with the fact some of the levels are maze-like and frustrating to navigate to the object you need or the end of the area, makes it feel like such a slog. I will admit during the second nightmare I was on the edge of shutting the game off out of sheer banal boredom.I guess for a nightmare, I would have expected the house/asylum/areas outside to feel more ""alive"". organic. I want a steady stream of dolls turning to watch me, of paintings slightly fading from one normal image to a creepy one. Of stuff poking into the scene just at the edges of the screen where you almost see them, but not quite. When I played the second Phantasmagoria game and you go to work and there is a simulated ""computer screen"" you can check email with and do some work activities, I loved that every little while (seemingly random), words would change to other words, hard to see but if you manage to spot it you realize it's sinister and evil. It made the simple act of reading email as the character feel disturbing and you would question your sanity. When the environment feels extremely copy paste and static, so you have a good feeling of what will happen and what to expect, it ruins the tension and takes away that feeling of being helpless that makes horror games successful.The underlying point of the game, to examine and empathize with mental health conditions, and try to evoke a sense of what it is like to have a mental illness, is really what the game was supposed to be about. I think a lot of gamers won't know to look for this or see it at all when playing the game, mostly because it is hinted at and thinly threaded into the game but not so much that it's obvious or too much (and so heavy handed). I think having the entire game be nightmares (which aren't real, and disturbing nightmares are fairly common, so not indicative of a mental disorder) actually spoils any true sense of dread. But really I am sure a lot of folk that play this will think "" well i have more disturbing dreams than this, and I am not mentally ill"". The idea is in there, within the bones of the game, but being buried enough you have to actively seek them out, and also play the game about 5-6 times to unlock and ""see"" all of the endings makes it too much work and effort to ""get"" the point of the game. When you consider the other issues and the fact the game is neither completely scary, totally creepy, or terrifyingly exciting, going through the first few nightmares again and again doesn't sound inviting. Considering every time you die or enter a new nightmare you burst awake in bed, the initial play through has a bit of ""repetition"" fatigue already. Doing it again.. not inviting.Reccomended: Horror fanatics, Ed Gorey Fans, anyone skilled with reading into subtext/iconography in a game.This is not a ""jump scare"" game. Buy it cheap.			"

												A fresh take on a genre that has been struggling for years. The game is more of an experience than a challenge but still very fun and scary. The music makes you feel very uneasy doing its job right. It does work on the idea of dreaming very well also but never over does it.I hope to see more games like this that try to work horror games into this day.			"

												It's just walking down corridors and occasionally you either trigger a short cutscene and keep going, or you trigger a short cutscene and get to walk down even more corridors. The corridors are full of recycled art in what I'm guessing was a failed attempt to show some sort of weird, incredibly slow progression, but all it actually does is make me frustrated, if I could even feel frustration instead of the dull plod of ennui sucking out my will to live.The handful of jump scares in the half hour I played are so few and far between that I could feel myself falling asleep. For the first time ever in a horror game, I had to stop playing not because I was too scared (I'm a total lightweight with horror), but because the game was so boring I had to go take a nap.			"

												You know how sometimes in movies and TV shows, they have these sequences where the main character gets up and everything's a little bit off? They go around and stranger and stranger things happen, and then a big shocking thing happens and they wake up? Neverending Nightmares is an entire game built around that concept. And if that doesn't sound like much of a game to you, well, you'd be right.The game opens with your sister dying and you waking up. You lead your character through a darkened, monochromatic house in search of... nothing, really. You proceed through the unsettling halls because nothing would happen if you didn't. Eventually you'll find your sister again, and something horrible will happen to one of you, and then you'll wake up again. The cycle continues throughout the game, with the environments becoming steadily darker and more unfamiliar. This part admittedly works really well, forming a genuinely tense atmosphere. The gorgeous art and animation sets the tone perfectly, and you never really feel completely safe, even after you divine the flow of the game. Neverending Nightmares does a fantastic job of mimicking actual nightmares, at least in terms of aesthetic.The problem is that there really is no more game to it than that. You'll come across enemies from time to time, but all you can do is hide from them and then scamper past once their backs are turned. There are no puzzles aside from permutations of ""find candle to enter dark room"" roadblocks. Exploration won't gain you anything aside from some slightly different scenery, as all paths still lead to the same inevitable conclusions. And that's the true killer of Neverending Nightmares, that everything about it is inevitable. Each nightmare is the same hell of wandering dark halls and weathering jumpscares and shambling monsters. Your reward for navigating the gauntlet is some terrible shock scene and a sudden awakening into the next.It's one of those games that seems to do exactly what it set out to do. Neverending Nightmares does indeed trap you in a seemingly never-ending cycle of wandering halls and avoiding monsters. It just does it in a far more tedious and uninteresting way than your own mind would.			"

												Knowing where the subject matter of this game came from is paramount to getting the most out of it. The developer used it as a vehicle to portray his bouts with OCD and depression, as well as recurring nightmares of his own.The art style and sound design combine for a truly effective atmosphere that proved scarier than I had expected from simply glancing at the screenshots. If you're looking for something a little different in the genre, this is a good place to start.

												Here are my problems with this ""game"": 1) Gameplay is virtually non-existant. As a player, my only contribution to this game was holding down the forward key and occasionally tapping enter. There were two points in the whole game where I needed a moment's thought to figure out how to get around a challenge (and it did not require more than a moment's thought). Furthermore, the designer has said that the gameplay is informed by the fact that he wanted to channel his experiences with depression and OCD - he wanted to make even simple tasks like walking a challenge. The problem is that ""making it hard to walk"" is not a very creative way to channel those experiences - and as a result NN can be extremely tedious. I refuse to believe that there is no way around the creative impasse of making the game feel slow or oppressive and making it boring (the no.1 sin for any form of entertainment). 2) Character - as mentioned above, the creator of this game intended it to be a manifestation of the ""real horror"" of OCD and depression. I can appreciate why this must be important to him, but the game really makes no effort whatsoever to get the player to invest in the character. The fact that I control Thomas does not ""put me in his shoes."" If I do not feel invested in the character, his emotions and experiences, unfortunately, really don't mean that much to me. Despite the beautiful art direction, NN is really, really lazy and ineffective at doing something that seems fundamental to what it is trying to do. Lastly, I have to say that this ""game"" is over-priced. I finished the story for the first time in less than two hours. And with the other endings, I reckon NN really doesn't have more than an extra hour or so's worth of content (though I may be wrong about this - I did not bother to explore the other endings because, as I mentioned above, I did not feel remotely invested in the character or story). This game looks beautiful. The art direction has remarkable attention to detail. But the gameplay and writing are just so, so lazy and ineffective. I'm sorry, but I regret giving the devs any money for this. It's an overrated and over-priced piece of beautiful-looking crap.EDIT:  I played this in my room, in the dark, with headphones, in the early hours of the morning. I did everything I could to give this game the biggest leg-up possible.			"

												Intense & Suspenseful.Two words that describe Neverending Nightmares perfectly.From beginning you starting feel this dread, pressure on your nerves, and that is sign of wonderful work with atmosphere. Music add up a lot, with creepy sounds and weird noises here and there. And lastly visual design of game itself, helps to create unique experience. White, black a red is probably most common color palette, but it works absolutely great with this hand drawn style.Story overall ... i just say, you just want to know more, you want explore further, despite this unsettling feeling inside you. You want to know what is happening, and mostly you want know is this just a dream, and when this dream turns into horrific reality.Even though i like this game a lot, i have few problems with it.I kinda dont like - quite a lot - Lunatic Asylum sequence. When we were in the house, there was something more to atmosphere. When we reach asylum, at least for me it went downhill. Those no arm freaks, wasn't scary just annoying, and they massively slows down, already slow pace of a game.Second thing is, i felt gameplay is a bit stretched for this story, and it just add to pacing problems i already had, so i wasn't really happy about it.Nonetheless I explored everything possible thru this game, every ending, every vein, and i had this scary fun time with Neverending Nightmares last night.I don´t LOVE this game, i just LIKE this game, and I have to say it was nice gaming experience.Grade: BP.S. At this point i am pretty excited for next game from these guys.			"

												It's a story of an apparently asthmatic guy with some mental issues. I don't mind his inability to run through a whole room without nearly dying of asphyxia, it actually fits the genre, makes him more helpless, and makes you plan your movements better, without just running through the whole game.I'd say it's a well balanced game. Good amount of jumpscares, good amount of doors (you can explore but can't get seriously lost), and nice style overall.Fairly short game, too. I finished all the achievements in 2.8 hours.			"

												This is a VERY SHORT game so if you feel the asking price is too much then pass this one, it takes a little over 2 hours and 30 minutes to get everything out of the game. It is a very short but sweet surprise.PROS -Very refreshing art style that makes for a great atmosphereNot very scary but has a nice psychological scare to itCONS -Just a tad too short, but the game is based of the creators nightmares so I'd expect it to be this lengthThe bits with escaping the enemies feel very lazy with no thoughtA nice bitter sweet game to break away from everything else.Final PERSONAL Verdict - 7/10 A breath of fresh air due to it's art style, but nothing that shines as innovative.

												Neverending Nightmares is a game that draws you in with its artstyle but almost immediately dissapoints you with repetitive, annoying enemies, short length, lack luster story and gameplay. It's definately not worth the 15 dollar price tag. The developers claim it was based off thier battle with mental illness but all I see is a game filled with the same horror game tropes you've seen ten thousand times before. Even with the horror tropes I would of given this game a thumbs up if it even had a slither of interesting or fun gameplay but the gameplay only constists of walking down hallways and the occasional shifting to the side a little to avoid a monster like you are trying to avoid people in a cramped elevator. If you want a similar game to this that is actually decent and cheaper I'd recommend Year Walk.			"

												As much as I enjoyed the art style and the creepy melodies, the game is just too much of a walking simulator - passages are seeming neverending and the protagonist, Mr Pajama, would struggle to keep up with an earthworm.  Sure, it's building up atmosphere, but it's just goes on too long.  I found myself trying to pace the running so that Mr PJ would go just a little faster, but then mistiming and the character having to stop for a breather (sadly, this was clearly pre-salbutamol).  It's just so very slow and contrary to what many have said, there *are* cheapo jumpscares (the bear, the grabbing hand without spoiling too much).The story was enjoyable to wonder about, but honestly, the thought of backtracking to find the other endings just didn't appeal.

												Despite everyone having seemingly mixed feelings on this game- I'm giving it a solid thumbs up. Neverending Nightmares does exactly what it says on the tin. That feeling of being trapped... unable to run, loss of breath, darkness closing in. Am I lost? Is someone following me? What's around this next corner.... Oh, I'm falling. Am I awake? This game perfectly captures all of the feelings of being helplessly trapped in an unpleasant slumber. People have criticised a number of things this game has to offer- and thinking through to actual nightmares knocks these points down one by one. ""He doesn't run fast enough/for long enough!"" - That feeling of being chased by the monster in your dream. You run for what seems like an eternity, and yet only travel a few feet, will you get through the door in time? ""The corridors go on and on and on, it's like a walking simulator!"" - Being lost... Trapped in an unfamiliar and eerie environment.... everywhere looks the same, will you ever escape?  ""These enemies aren't scary/have stupid mechanisms"" - Sometimes the scariest things of all are the simpler ones. Distorted visions from every day life. The chaser. The follower. The listener. The scraper. The patroller. Each is unpredictable in it's own way on first encounter.Going past all of this- I'll be honest. People like me are the prime audience for a game like this. I am a scaredy cat. I had to get a small amount of help from my boyfriend on one of the parts that was just too creepy for me.... and the rest, I completed by myself. This game had tension, some well placed jumpscares, and a strange broken up story that didn't fit well together- but what does that sound like? A nightmare. I'd also like to praise this game for the artwork- this game must have had countless hours spent on the artwork alone. It's an interesting scratchy style but those extra details really make the game. Splashes of colour for notable objects. I wasn't a MASSIVE fan of the character design, it looked a little goofy to me compared to the complexity of some of the rest of the artwork in game. Another point I should make is how considerate the dev was for helping to achieve the branching story paths- continuing from a level where the story branches places you EXACTLY where you need to be to go about following other paths. You do not have to replay the entire level, let alone the entire game (Which is something some of the negative reviews seemed to think was the case?) In other words, you complete the whole game, and then you can gather up all the extra endings within another half hour or so, by easily being plonked in the right place. How kind :)All that said, I recall buying this game on sale. The current price for this game is £10.99 and I'm afraid despite such massive praise from myself I would place the value at somewhere around the £5 mark if you're waiting for the sales. The artwork is surely worth full price- again, beautiful and stunning game that absolutely captures the points and feelings it wants to get across.... but the length and complexity of the game is where it falls short.7.5/10, Achievements were a nice bonus :)			"

												This game is more of an atmospheric horror than a 'jump-scare' horror. There are, maybe, two or three jumpscares. It's slow-paced and repetitive, which, I think, work really well for the game. You pay close attention to all these tiny details, like blinking and shadows, and all the paintings convey all these interesting thoughts. The game makes you wonder ""Why is this here?"", ""What's going on?"", ""What does this mean?"". I spent more time wondering about the enviroments and the events than being afraid, and I'm still trying to connect the dots of the game. One thing you're going to notice is that almost all the reviews have a short playthrough time, me included. There isn't a lot to play through. The game is very short. This helps the game stay suspenseful. If you're looking for a game to sink 100's of hours in, this isn't the game for you. You'll want to replay it to acheive all possible endings,  but the replaying time isn't long. The short playthrough time creates a tense feeling for the whole game. It should be added that there are absolutely no loading screens in the game, so you never have any release or rest from the tension.The game is also very heavy with symbolism. The paintings, the art, the ages, the enemies, the colors, they all seem to have unique meaning. I found myself sitting in rooms, staring at the windows or the pictures, or hiding from enemies to observe them, trying to figure out what it meant, how it reflected the character.The art style is somehow simple and complex. The characters look cartoonish, as does the enviroment, but it still has great detail. A lot of effort went into the design, as everything is hand drawn. Items that you can interact with are colored, like the bronze doorhandles, which is an interesting mechanic that helps negate confusion. As for the horror elements, I really didn't find the game scary, but there is a LOT of gore. As previously stated, the enviroment is monochromatic, consisting of just black and white. One exeption to this is the blood, which is red. And, oh boy, there is a lot of red. It's similar to 'The Human Centipede 2' in this way, where in that movie, only the blood had color. This causes the blood to stick out and have a drastic impact on the player. I don't want to spoil anything, but as the game goes on, the amount of blood increases, and you get this feeling of dread, like you don't want to go on, but you want to find the cause. This gives me a tense feeling, but not a scared feeling. Gore has never been a scare factor for me, but it might be for you. Tl;Dr: I wholeheartedly reccomend this game. It's packed with symbolism. It's short, but tense all the way through. It looks beautifuly frightening and sounds amazing. It's not terribly scary, but it's quite immersive. "

												It takes a lot for me to bother to write a negative review on Steam.  I think I've done it twice in the last year (both for games that were huge disappointments and nowhere near the level that word of mouth made them out to be [Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons and Strider (2014)]).  This will be my third.I really wanted to like this game; after not being a big fan of Retro/Grade, I decided to give this title a shot for a variety of reasons: the unique artstyle, it's a different genre from his last game, and most importantly, it's ""based"" off his experience with depression and OCD.  Having experienced both of those illnesses first-hand, I was hoping I could find something to relate to here, something that made me feel like somebody else knew what some of it felt like.Instead I was treated to a repetitive game with very little gameplay and very little substance.  What little gameplay exists is moving the character from A to B and ""investigating"" the rooms along the way.  However, the ""investigating"" consists of looking at pictures or looking at creepy doll faces, for the most part.  Every once in awhile, something interesting will be there for you to examine, but the actual gameplay leaves much to be desired in the vein of exploration and story.  Further holding the gameplay back is the character's glacial walking speed -- and when you use the sprint button you quickly find out that the character must have the worlds worst case of asthma.  I know that this was done to prevent someone from just running through the game, but it hurts more than it helps, especially when you're feeling like you've seen the same hallway 37023 times and you just kind of find out what happens next.From a horror perspective, there were a couple jump scares and a few kind of creepy moments that had me a little on edge, but nothing along the lines of instilling terror into my very soul.  There was a bit in one of the last branches I played through that had my heart racing a little, but again, nothing to really set it apart or make it worthwhile as far as I'm concerned.The game does have some good points, even if they're few and far between, but they aren't enough to leave me feeling good about recommending this to anyone.  I thought the voice acting was pretty well done and the artstyle and animation is unique when the looming ""darkness"" isn't obscuring things.  Other than that, I can't say much else.One of my friends recently played through this after backing the Kickstarter campaign because he was a huge fan of the developer's other game Retro/Grade.  He left disappointed as well and said to me that he thought the game would've been better as an animated short or something along those lines.  I can't help but think that this would've been the perfect medium for the story the developer wanted to tell as the most interesting parts of the game are the cutscenes that occurs between some of the chapters.Overall, I found this game to be a waste of my time.  My OCD did kick in and I made sure I played the entire game and completed 100% of what it had to offer before writing my review... but I cannot in good conscience sit idly by and let people jump into this without so much as a warning.  This is probably the worst game I've played to completion in 2014 and I really feel like I would've been better off spending my money on something else.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Infinitap Games Publishers: Infinitap Games Initial release: Sept 2014Genre: Adventure, Horror#Worth/NotWorth: #NotWorth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationI'm not entirely sure what exactly to say about this one. - there are multiple endings - they contradict each other...That isn't a spoiler. Well, its more of a suggestion.. I guess, hear me out will ya. What I mean to say is that going through multiple times though I stopped very early in my second, is not recommended. Just go for it and take the ending you do get.However, that's if you ignore the rest of what I'm going to say. Now the real review beginsThis game is not fun. It does create a slightly displeasing environment to be in but as the preamble on the store page suggests, this is about depression. Now I know that is a touchy subject and before you attack me, I have had my bout with depression. I've taken anti depressants and gone to therapy. So without to much pretension I feel I'm capable of commenting on the subject with some clarity and sensitivity.It seems to me that everything here represents some facet of depression while maintaining an over the top hyperbole that goes beyond a simple euphemism. Such as the fact the character walks so very.. very.. slowly and is constantly out of breath. To which I'd say this is more allegory to the crushing weight of the world and simply existing being so overbearing it's difficult to just move you body alone. And narratively speaking this comes across well. But mechanically, we may be reading the same book but we are not on the same page. This goes further into the having to repeat rooms (it does checkpoint nice, as the title would suggest you tend to have waking nightmares) because of the monsters that kill you instantly and in ways that are not super pleasant to look at all the time. Why are these monsters are there? Well, it seems the developer wanted it to be open ended as a design choice. I have my story, my ending, my interpretation and that's what I'm sticking with. I do not recommend going back in or really even the first time. I should mention it's “Not Recommended” because I feel that anything over what 'you the reader' thinks, lets use the idiom, 'a drop in the bucket' is just not worth it at an hour and a half of mediocre content. Now back to the depression aspect. I don't feel as though this represents MY OWN experience with depression. Its was far more mundane then anything this extravagant. It was more like, why bother getting out of bed, why bother changing/cleaning my clothes, no one would notice. Then you sort of stare blankly at things and watch other people live their lives wondering how they ignored how pointless things were, couldn't they see it? Were they living in a bubble?! And it went on like that for awhile. It still creeps in once and awhile. But I digress. Perhaps I'm way off base and this person did have an experience much closer to what is depicted here. But all that said, this isn't worth the time or money in my own very humble opinion.Follow my curation for more "

												Neverending Nightmares is one of the good psychological horror games that I'd played before. It came with minimalist art-style blend with decent eerie scoring (it will be better when used headphones) made this game have a good look & atmospheric.  There is no games before since Alien Isolation or Outlast that made me scared & freak out while playing because of jump scares, and the good one is it came from a minimalist graphics art.Anyway, this game criticized because lack of gameplay, multiple loop with same asset or walking simulator. Its true, but its a world of dream right. Back in 1999, when I'd played an obscure avant-garde games entitled LSD: Dream Emulator at my old playstation. Its a sureallist games about dream and have a walking simulator gameplay. So, there is no problem for me about lack of gameplay for this game. Because Neverending Nightmares have ""something"" beside its gameplay.			"

												Neverending Nightmares is an artsy 2D horror game. At the beginning in this game I was very impressed with the art style but after a while I notice that there is almost no interaction in this game which is quite a shame. The most interaction you get is opening doors. You can walk, run, open doors, look at stuff sometimes and that's all about it.I don't know if this is intended but the MC will get exhausted very quickly and it sounds like he is having asthma all the time which is getting quite annoying especially in a game where you have to run a lot. The scary events are ok but I mostly got scared by the loud sounds which I find it a little cheap.I recommend to play this game with the controller. The rumble feature does helps a lot in certain situations. What I find good in this game is that there are 3 different endings and you can choose to play the unlocked nightmares after you beating the game which makes it less tedious to get the other endings. The monster design is also nice and creepy.This game is definitely not worth the full price imo but buying this game at sale events would be a good idea if you don't mind walking around most of the time.

												What a nightmare my friends of horror. First it seems pathless like a dream until you wake up again and again. You will finally see that you have to go deeper in that nighmare to explore everything the game has to offer. After you finished once you have to play further and you will find new enemys and areas (and achievements). I really enjoyed Neverending Nighmares, the gameplay makes fun, the artwork is lovely detailed, music and sound-effects are really awesome and they are playing an important role, but... you will see what i mean. Horror adventurer will truly enjoy it there, have fun to wake up from neverending nightmares... again... and again.... and again....			"

												★★☆☆☆ - ""Average at best, Id give it a miss"" PROS:- Visually stunning art style- The sound is terrific, using the recommended preset for my headphones worked a treat and definitely adds suspense.- Multiple endings depending on how you playCONS:- I fail to see where the two other endings originate from and at what part of the story.- Gameplay is made up of walking, opening doors, interacting with as limited objects as possible, learning walking patterns of a few enemies and pretty much working out how to run and avoid your character having an asthma attack.- The plot is as boring as the gameplay.- Whilst it was scary at first with creepy noises and jump scares, you soon become very bored and can't wait til its over. A short game could have quite easily been shorter due to lots of pointless fluff.- You run and your characters breathing goes unrealistically out of control, it gets annoying fast and detracts from immersion.VERDICT? A part of me wants to experience the two other endings but gameplay is so boring that I will probably won't, thats the games downfall unfortunately.			"

												The nightmare is escalating in its terrifying apparition, not endless, but increasingly nightmarish. There's an amount of degradation to every awakening, where things turn gradually worse. To our despair, not even our bed is what it seems to be, in its comforting, homely tension-breaking, turning into a dark, cobwebbed, bloody mess, but in a weird way, still home, still tension-breaking, still a relief. And in short, this – this awareness of nothing having real consequences, much like Bioshock Infinite: a short animation or cutscene depicting your revival/death followed by reanimation –, along with a slew of other things, is what made this game the not so poignant or interesting experience I expected, considering the visual style and premise. On the visual style, when zoomed out, and the pixelated low-quality of what's in front of you is not so blatant, it looks rather quaint. The salient reds and colors signifying interactivity is a rather interesting concept, albeit mainly wasted on Kickstarter portraits really serving only to satisfy those backers, and wasting the players time. Generally, the way they construct the different rooms, the scene design, one could call it, was fairly generic. Elaborately: the conveniently dead-eyed dolls all facing the players point of view (this motif in particular, is not scary in overabundance), the flash of the lightning with the dead-looking sister appearing behind you, gutted animals in the forest, portraits blinking, the faceless manikins, generic pleads for God written in blood, these are all generic design-decisions seen in most lowest common denominator horror movies, and it's simply squandering an interesting premise and art-style that could have brought so much more to the table. Although it wasn't all bad, it was interesting to see the dismembered limbs scattered about, thereafter seeing the pile of dismembered bodies, giving it the credence it needed, beyond the surrealistic nature of dreams. The level design of endlessly walking through the same corridor, but with a new texture, a new coat of paint, does not excuse it being the same corridor being traversed. I found it incredibly dull and uncreative, it's simply frustrating to be going over the same thing more than once, when in reality it served no purpose. Purposelessness in games is the ultimate disdainful choice a game-creator can make, forcing a player to needlessly – in terms of narrative – do the same thing, and to not give any sort of satisfactory reason or reward for it can really not be in a game, especially not one this short and lacking in substance. There was a sense of enjoyment to every new room explored, but they were seldom seen, and often ultimately pointless. It's immensely disappointing that a game with this much style and potential didn't actually arouse any profound thoughts, or any interesting thoughts at all: springing up from neither art-direction nor narrative, where the chance of creative ideas often resided. Enemies were introduced in an interesting way, at least the one we come across in the asylum, it was foreshadowed in a fairly obvious jump scare, although still cleverly adumbrated and its function within the game shown by visual design, not by some redundant tutorial pop-up. The gouged out eyes of these adversaries were here the sign of them operating with sound, not vision, such as the other enemy. Furthermore, the AI, rigid as it was, broke the tension by being, well. . . rigid. The encounters you have with these seem more like a puzzle than a fearful enemy capable of horrid acts. It was pattern-solving, not an avoidance of possibilities that could actually spark fear in a person. Lastly, characters that seem aloof, disinterested, without any signs of distress, do they not bring down the agency of the game? If there is no discernible sense of fear or urgency in the person we play, why are we to fear or tense up to what is going on? It's all too static, unbending, and it needs flexibility pertaining to the reactions of the character we play. Not only to see the urgency of agency, but for the empathy and connection one feels with this character. I stress this because without it I feel this emptiness to the whole experience, it's a common theme in many of these lower budget indiegames, and it's understandable, but it's detrimental to this player-game connection that I feel is crucial in a third-person horror game, because how else are we to immerse ourself into this world, when we don't have the simpleness of attaining that connection to the game that a first-person game easily brings (since it removes the “middleman”). I have no idea if I actually enjoyed this game, a huge part of me didn't, it felt the scares were cheap mostly due to clichés seen in all types of horror. The art-style was creative but nothing else. The narrative was bare-bones and the resolution seemed shallow and predictable. There is nothing in me that wants to re-live this game, I didn't fall in love with any concept or visual, it was just this experience devoid of real substance. It was okay, in the most mundane and frustrating way possible, because it could have been more, but was left unexplored.			"

												Really really enjoying this game. when you play you can either take it as a straight psychological horror, an art game or you can do as I have and question the meaning behind it. whatever way you play you will find something about this gme that will appeal to you.The art style reminds me of when I was a kid and you would mostly see the style in books such as Alices adventures in Wonderland or the little vampire etc. it serves to take you back to your childhood and the horror is rather more intense as a result.I recommend that you check this game out.

												This game is beautifully done. From the atmosphere to the background sounds, everything is spot on. You literally feel every ounce of dread the character goes through with every step he takes; with not knowing what's going to happen next. The Alien FX is a nice touch too, even though the character rarely uses the candle, but I guess that's what makes it special. The black/white against the blood red is very effective and pleasing to the eye. The auto save feature is very nice as well, it's almost like they knew where you were going to die. From the creepy dolls following you, to the crazy hatchet murderer chasing you, this game is sure to keep you on your toes. For the best experience I would suggest turning the lights off, put your headphones on and let the Alien FX glow blood red.			"

												One of those games proving that a good story can make a better horror atmosphere than majority of AAA games. The game is straightforward, following almost endless hallways as you progress deeper and deeper into the nightmare. You can choose a certain chapter of the game if you do not wish to replay it all, to see all 3 endings which are one of the most heart-wrenching endings I have seen in a while. The grotesques fits perfectly and it is just enough to make it dreadful, but not too much to make it cheesy. There is very little of the muscal score, but effects are done masterfully to deepen the feel of horror. As for the story? I cannot write without spoiling it or ruining the mood. Sufficient to say: this is a must have game for all people who consider themselves lovers of the horror genre.			"

												A horror story about being a boy with asthma. Creepy with a touch of gory (and a lot of Gorey). A walking simulator; the game's extremely short length works in its favor as the ""gameplay"" will feel more and more tedious the longer one plays. Nonetheless the creepy atmosphere made successful by the beautifully detailed art, use of darkness and color, and ambient background soundtrack allow this game to provide an uncommon horror experience.It's a shame that the interaction is so minimal. Portraits, for example, are disappointing and meaningless; the majority of which hold no relevance to the game's story.* One cannot help but see lost opportunity to delve deeper into the protagonist's psyche and further expand his backstory, as well as that of his sister, such as through the use of written notes or diary entries, though such would destroy the silent narrative that may have been intended by the developer. However, having unlocked all of the endings and viewing the Final Descent ending, the narrative is perfect, and it's possible that any extra written dialogue would have taken away from the mystery of the conclusion.Though the atmosphere is what's considered the highlight of the game, the true highlight is the art. The imagery is delightfully creepy and impressively detailed.*Because they were Kickstarter rewards.			"

												Neverending Nightmares is a psychological horror game from Infinitap Games. Let’s get rocking.The GoodFirstly, two things in this game are top notch: the music and the atmosphere. Those are in order, by the way. Music edges out atmosphere for the top spot for reasons that I’ll talk more about in a second. But, seriously, the music in Neverending Nightmares is great. The menu music is creepy, the music in game is creepy, and don’t get me started on the use of bass. Spot on.The artwork is reminiscent of an old Halloween book you might find at your parents’ place. It gives it a retro feel, but also a storybook feel with strong “You’re stuck in Hell for all eternity” overtones. A job well done.The BadThe atmosphere at the beginning of the game is phenomenal. Sadly, you can actually watch as the atmosphere plays as the story of the game becomes unintentionally disjointed and confusing and the gameplay itself becomes repetitive.Whoever does the voice acting for the player character has the most annoyingly whiny voice I’ve heard in years. Every time he talks, you’ll want to beat him up and take his lunch money.The MehThe story, as I mentioned above, quickly becomes disjointed and damned near impossible to figure out what’s actually going on. Maybe that’s how the devs intended it to be, but I can’t understand how that’s possible.You can “sprint” in manner of speaking. Your character starts to gasp and wheeze in less than a second. Whenever this guy wakes up, he needs to go see a doctor and get that♥♥♥♥♥♥handled.There are multiple endings, but, the game gets so monotonous I doubt you could be bothered to play through it and see them all. One and done, I say. Verdict: NayIf you can get this game for next to nothing or free, sure, it’s worth a playthrough if only for how great the game starts out. If you’re planning on paying full price or anywhere near that for this game, don’t bother. There are better horror games for you to spend your money on.			"

												While it’s a very short game it’s still an adventure experience worth checking out if nothing else than to try something unique. The controls are pretty simple in that you move with the arrow keys, sprint with the shift key (a very limited run as Thomas has asthma), and interact with the world using the enter key. If there are two things that I didn’t like about Neverending Nightmares, it’s that the game was way too short and the endings left too many questions. The latter I can forgive as everything is built around dreaming. And anyone who remembers any dreams that they’ve had know that they can be jumbled messes that make little (if any) sense. And the former is due to the fact that I enjoyed the game so much that I wanted more. Yes, by the end of the day I left feeling a bit depressed and unnerved but that’s exactly how psychological horror works.http://www.kickstartadventure.com/home/neverending-nightmares-reviewed/ "

												The main standout of Neverending Nightmares is the visuals and they look wonderful, but the game itself amounts to little more than walking left or right, which could be good if the scares made you wary of direction you were going in.All of the spooky stuff is pretty front loaded while the creatures have little variety so once you've seen each area's baddie once then that's about it. Naturally, you're supposed to play this game for its narrative which is perfectly fine, but the endings are really nothing more than usual horror ""it was a dream"" cliches or just generally feel pretty disconnected from the buildup.Neverending Nightmares would be a pretty rad picture book because as a game, there's not much going on.

I didn't like that the story wasn't too long, but then again, I waited for it to end faster. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes horror type games and aren't afraid of a few ""jumpscares"".Another interesting fact is that this game's designer, Matt Gilgenbach, tried and could actually put feeling of hopelessness and bleakness into the game, because he, himself is struggling with OCD[en.wikipedia.org] and depression[en.wikipedia.org], for what I'll give another ★.

In somnis veritasIn dreams, truth.After more than two years dreaming of playing Neverending Nightmares boiled down to less than 4 hours of lackluster gameplay, I found Neverending Nightmares an impossible game to just recommend without a handful of 'howevers'.Thomas is alone. You guide him through supposedly scarring imagery and haunting monsters towards answers that speak more about himself than the world he conjured. Thomas, it seems, is a tad bit out of his mind and, in turn, tries to drag you into the depths with him.The problems? To summarize, this game is very western. Most (if not all) the horror elements are classic in white people western mainstream horror culture; this game sports but is not limited to:• Your usual white woman with straight black hair;• Dolls;• Asylums;• Abandoned victorian architecture;• Westernized paintings hanging from wallpapered walls;• A graveyard full of ""Johns"" and the like and, as far as I saw, one Japanese name... Sakura;• Sourceless random laughter and crying (voiced by women because why men?);• The Holy Bible;• Blonde bloke and• Striped pajamas.These things, by themselves, are by no means a problem. However, consider: eastern games played on Steam essentially boil down to half-explicit graphic novels and MMOs. When people drill constant western horror imagery into our heads trough movies, games, books and the like, it gets very very hard to even be bother by it because most of us, westerns, are exposed to nothing else.Western horror swims in a pool if its own pee, and Neverending Nightmares, in all its fantastic visuals, potential and unease, is no exception; it strips itself of its pants and decides to add some pee to the poo pile.I am not a tough cookie. I did get startled a couple of times, but that was that. Neverending Nightmares didn't leave me speechless because I was shocked or horrified, it left me speechless because I just couldn't take in that was all it was.Deus, Deus meus, respice in me: quare me dereliquisti?O God, my God, look upon me. Why have you forsaken me?*Neverending Nightmare's level design is weak. A few sections of the levels are just gorgeous and ingenious and fantastically crafted and detailed; most of it is the same thing you saw a few minutes ago. That gets boring, that gets annoying, that gets confusing, that gets frustrating. That's saying plenty, since the game is so short.Salva me ex ore leonis: et a cornibus unicornium humilitatem meam.Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my humility from the horns of the single-horned beast.**There are a few strong reasons why I still recommend Neverending Nightmares despite its several weak points:• It is visually gorgeous;• It leaves more questions than answers and the possibility to speculate rather than impose;• Voice acting, soundtrack and sounds, despite generic, are well done and even better with a headset;• What it promises, it delivers;• It has full controller support;• It has achievements;• It has trading cards and• Most people will not be bothered by the fact they will be fed their usual diet.TL;DR: Neverending Nightmares is another horror game that barely saves itself from being just that by having a pretty face and an open mind about what it chooses to showcase.*Psalm 21:2**Psalm 21:22			"

												Im telling you, this is worth every single cent. It is short, unfortunately, which is a huge con. But the immersion, the atmosphere made me like the horror genre in which i never did! I LOVED this game and I have been trying to find similar horror games to it, but alas, with no luck.Its brilliant. Just buy it. Its also based on real experiences. So buy it.			"

												A horror game in which you play in a world suffused by a strange art style, and some horrible things, we guess. Every nightmare has a resolution, but leads to you merely waking up in your bed again. When will the nightmare end? Who knows...

												It's simply not worth it at $15. There's not enough content. The game is intentionally repetitive to a point where it becomes boring very quickly. The ONLY mechanic that exists in the game is movement. It's just a really basic narrative that you walk through and occasionally feel a little creeped out by. This game is worth $5 max.			"

												Really good game. The experience is amazing and knowing that it was made of a ""reflection"" of the creator, it makes you think what he was put through. Sound effects are awesome so if you play with headphones and really high volume, you'll get the best of it.The only thing I'm sad is that I finished it in less than 90min. BUT we still have the option to choose the ""chapter"" to get different endings somehow.If you are looking for a realistic and horror story, I would recommend it for sure ! If you are more into play a horror game for the jumpscares and the duration of the game, you might think about it again because it is too short.			"

												I've made it close to the end of the second nightmare, and this game definitely lives up to what I was hoping it would be. I backed it on Kickstarter, but not at a high enough tier to play the beta, so I went in fresh when it released.It's an awesome horror game, which has fairly simple gameplay, but an extreemly disturbing atmosphere. It has a lot of good jumpy scares, but also gets unnerving without them because of the level design and the extremely well done sound. Definitely wear headphones when you play, as it makes it much more immersive.If you like the horror genre, I definitely recommend this.			"

												""Neverending Nightmares"" is a pretty unusual and unic game. It represents mental state of the creator of this game who suffers from OMC syndrome. Every night he has terrible nightmares, he can't sleep and breathe properly and that is FOR REAL. It's actually pretty grim stuff. Makes you think how your mental health is important.In any case, this game literally puts you into the head of a person with serious mental issues. The music, graphics and the atmosphere of the game are really creepy. That, plus several well-placed jump-scares, make up the horror part of the game. The strory (if you are brave enough to call it a story) is absurd, but that's kinda the point.The gameplay is kinda repetitive, (mostly it's avoiding the monsters), but requires some thinking. Besides, you can beat the game in a couple of hours, so you won't be able to get bored.So that's it. I do recommend ""Neverending Nightmares"". Worth checking out, but this game is little bit overpriced, considering small amount of gameplay, so I advise to get it on sale.			"

												When I first heard about this game, I was pretty excited to play it. I love a good horror game! But this game wasn't exactly scary as much as strange and a little bit disturbing.  If you are looking for any sort of story, I would not recommend this game. This game is basically one long walking simulator, only your character walks about as fast as a turtle (You do have the option to sprint, but your character can only sprint for about 5 seconds before doubling over to catch his breath.)So, If you're looking for a walking simulator that never seems to end (even though the average play time is only about 2 hours, it feels much longer) with some disturbing/confusing imagery mixed in, then this is the game for you!

												Neverending Nightmares is more of a maze-puzzle game with a scary setup than a horror game. Although, if you're suceptible enough and play at night you WILL have nightmares:Pros:- OUTSTANDING sounds effects. Please use your headphones if you play it- Great concept and tons of new things to discover- Good ""story"", if you make sense out of it- Multiple endingsCons:- Painfully long. It could easily be half as long to get anywhere and you wouldn't miss a thing- It can be boring to do the same thing over and over again if you fail to remember what to do some times- You character makes One noise when he's tired and you will hear it A LOT, gets a bit odd really quickly- Graphis aren't meant for this kind of game, although it works letting you know what to use or where to goIt's a must if you like atmospheric bizarre games if you get it on a sale, I wouldn't buy it for retail price but if you have the money, then go for it. Just make sure to play it at night, graphics are nowhere near being enough to scare anybody during the day			"

												Art style is excellent, the music is good.But the gameplay...it's just so empty. You can't interact with almost anything if not key items, and the game itself is, as it has already been defined by many, only a ""walking simulator"". The game was nowhere near being a horror game. It never scared me except for maybe one or two jumpscares. Adding blood doesn't make a game horror (as Space Funeral teaches us).Now, about the story I can only say it was way too short. It wasn't bad, only...short. It felt like it was missing something.I felt like this game was just pretentious.			"

												The game relies on scripted jumpscares and splattered blood and gore to create fear. The game also contains a lot in the way of negative exploration space: dead ends that punish you for exploring because there's nothing in that direction. These are made worse by a character that walks very slowly and can only run for a moment or two before slumping over, wheezing. The monsters in the game provide nothing new in the way of gameplay innovation. The three enemies can be defeated by, in order:- wait in the closet until the enemy goes by- walk, don't run, next to the enemy- walk/run away from that enemy until they disappearSpoilers: it indeed is all a dream! Sure, there's a bit of extra story there, but if the idea of playing a character through a nightmare landscape with no consequences doesn't appeal to you, you probably won't like this game either.Alternatively, one could play Fran Bow for a similar artstyle and horror aesthetic with a story that's much more ambitious. Indeed, the horror of that game relies on atmosphere building and body horror, rather than the overused tropes of jumpscares and blood splatter.			"

												9/10I’m always looking for games, books, shows, etc. that get me in the Halloween spirit, and it is one of the reasons I backed Neverending Nightmares.  It has an amazing art style, and the atmosphere reminds me of reading Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark when I was a kid.  There are some issues where it gets repetitive; mainly the 4th level where the pacing slows down too much and there needs to be more artwork and/or animations to add to the story.  However, the slow points are ultimately overshadowed by the imagination, creepiness, and unexpected events throughout the rest of the game. "

												I backed this thing on Kickstarter (the $15 tier) and speaking for myself I don't regret it as it was a solid experience and am glad to see that it got made. HOWEVER, speaking for everyone else, be warned that this is a VERY short game. that 1-point-some hours you see there? That was just from one playthrough of this game. From what it looks like there are branching paths leading to other endings (which I suspected since dying at several points led me back to completely different areas), but otherwise in addition to its shortness it is also a very simple game. You can walk, run, and interact, and what interaction there is is minimal and pretty much spelled out for you. Does it have color? Chances are you can either look at it or pick it up (for the most part you can only look at things, which consist of paintings of people we never meet or objects like a bloody meat grinder or a bloody sink with a few teeth, or most anything else with blood). The only real interactive objects you'll find in the game are doors, candles and occasionally an axe (sadly the only use you have for this is to break down a barricaded stairway, no combat for you!).There are no actual puzzles to speak of. Mostly it's dodging the game's grotesque display of enemies, however few there are. One enemy is big, dumb and ugly, patrols back and forth and is bypassed by hiding in cabinets rented out from Amnesia as they clumsily stumble by while you walk over to the next cabinet. The other enemy can be annoying, a blind zombie-type thing with enhanced senses in every other area. Unless you are very far away from them, if they sense you, you can't outrun them. It's a matter of walking around them or using distraction tactics (actually only one time you get to take advantage of this) to bypass them when bypassing them otherwise proves impossible. The other kind of enemy is... RUUUUUUN! Axe-wielding crazy, but not just ANY kind of axe-wielding crazy. I won't spoil that bit. So the game basically consists of navigating pseudo-labyrinthine environments, some areas with more than one doorway (some leading to just dead end rooms), the environments changing on a whim (well, this is dream logic after all), and admiring the beautiful, pastoral scenery (as confusing as it may look sometimes it's still very linear and not too hard to find your way around). But seriously though, the aesthetics are the game's strong suit, and I'm sure anyone playing wouldn't disagree with that. It's not just the pen-and-ink style but the details and the way they're drawn. Darkness and shadows are conveyed by pen scratches that get increasingly thicker and layered on one another the darker it gets. Color contrasts, though used in an obvious way (whether to tell you which items you can interact with or to tell you BLUUUGGGGHHHD!) look really neat. And the environments in general, with all sorts of creepy objects and decay piled on top of one another and a series of questionable-looking paintings, add up to a real looker of a game that doesn't require a high-end computer to admire. The game's story is... uncertain. Like I said, there seems to be multiple endings, and until you reach one such ending throughout the whole game the only thing you can seem to ascertain is you play as someone who's murdered your sister supposedly and are continually haunted by layers on layers of nightmares about this and other terrible, gory things (when your character rips out a vein from your own arm before ""waking up"" was the one moment I cringed, but then I was reminded of Riki-Oh and relaxed again). Jumping from variations of what is seemingly your home, a large house in the 18th-19th century, to a psych ward, with repeating visual motifs, from dolls, toy soldiers, paintings of people unknown, and, well, stuff you'd find in a psych ward/hospital around the time period (like a tincture of opium and a bottle of cocaine/alcohol mixture! I think this fellow could use some of that here). One picture that seemed ""off"" is at the very beginning, a portrait you can examine of someone in what looks like a 1970s swinger get-up. It made me question when this game REALLY took place through the whole game from that point on despite their being no other indications besides that. Voice acting, what little there is of it, is adequate, if not extraordinary. The actor for the protagonist does frightened, confused and occasionally grieving OK, and the voice actor for your sister (remember, nightmare land, you're gonna jump around a lot) is given more than a few things to do and pulls off most of those decently as well. Overall though, there's not much to take away from the story besides this mise en abyme of gory, dark and monstrous imagery that relates seemingly to the death of your sister, until, as I said, the very ending, where the dev's attempt to recreate the actual anxiety of OCD and not the Hollywood/common societal definition of it comes into play (at least the ending I got, though I don't doubt the other endings get the same message across).They say a horror game's best asset is its sound, and it's no more true here. This has some of the best use of positional sound in an indie horror game I've played, so there are more scares focused on the sounds of approaching footsteps and other noises from the distance reaching ever closer and less from jumpscares (there are a couple of orchestral stingers meets monster-thingy flying across your point of view, none of which I found effective - when Monsieur Axe Murderer started appearing out of nowhere is when I freaked out the most), which is definitely a good thing. The soundtrack is noteworthy too, and while not the best dark ambient I've heard it still works well here. There's your usual droney rumblings and creepy voices to synths that sound like Tangerine Dream gone to hell toward the end.So besides the high price to length ratio (or short length to price ratio, I don't know my ratios), what's the biggest problem with this game? I'd say the fact that a lot of the horror depicted here is too familiar and relies heavily on gore for its atmosphere. Blood stains, blood pools, blood blood blood... and the gallons only increase as you move along. Creepy-looking dolls, some with heads with cracks on them, and empty eye sockets? You get those. A decrepit insane asylum with creepy abandoned wheelchairs and general lack of proper sanitation? Check. A dark, spooky gothic mansion? Checkeroo. Speaking of blood, you also get repeated phrases written in scraggly letters on the walls in blood, from ""WAKE UP"" to ""Everything is a lie"" and other insightful comments. Dead bodies can be found, sometimes even of other species, and they're not dead in the nice way either! So, look, I am unsure of what the dev's actual headspace was when suffering from OCD at its worst. He mentioned that it's often violent and suicidal thoughts. There are moments in the game where a dream ends by you killing yourself, or discovering the dead body of your sister, and those moments are by far the most potent (the vein ripping from earlier I mentioned...). And I admit, despite the use of some overused horror imagery they are done well for the most part. I was expecting it to change up a bit more as I was going, but what we got is still sufficient. And while violent imagery and suicide I can understand being something he'd be suffering from, where some of the more... banal things really part of it? The wheelchairs, dolls and stuff? He has mentioned using elements of other horror games as an inspiration, perhaps to fill in the gaps, you know, Silent Hill, Amnesia, what you'd expect, and these influences definitely stick out, for better or worse. But, despite whatever cliches it may fall back on, the anxiety that its title would suggest, is successfully conceived and I do recommend this to horror fans, again with the caveat that it is SHORT. During a Steam sale though, I'd say this is an insta-buy, no doubt.			"

												""Neverending Nightmares"" is a game that has a lot to offer for some but will fall entirely flat for others.It is at its core a game about mental illness.  Not the hackneyed, insufficient portrayal seen in most media of ""insanity"" as a flat stereotype.  This is about mental illnesses as they really are.  This means that those who will most appreciate it are those with a mental illness of their own, or who are well-acquainted with someone with it. The unusual art style, reminiscent of the work of artist Edward Gorey but with a more sinister bent, lends a uniqueness to the game.  Alternatingly subtle and very unsubtle creepy images saturate it, creating a tense feeling.  Do yourself a favor--play it when everything else around you is quiet, with the lights off.  It won't make you screech in horror and have nightmares, but it will make you nervous and tense the whole time.  The gameplay is really virtually nonexistant.  You wander through various unsettling areas (gore is abundant and you may find its impact diminishes over time, though this was mostly not the case for me) and the only challenges in most cases are ""where do I go next?""  But even more mazelike areas are fairly linear, so when it doubt, just wander everywhere and you will eventually find your way.  There are one or two areas where you must navigate around an enemy which might sometimes be tricky, but overall, the point of this game is not to be challenging.  The multiple endings add some replay value and it is not a matter of meeting a lot of fiddly criteria to end up on the correct path--most are contingent on a spare few different actions.  I won't spoil any details but I will say that they might keep you wondering what REALLY happened.In conclusion, ""Neverending Nightmares"" is definitely worth playing for anyone who appreciates a different sort of horror game, but will have vastly more to offer to those with a thorough understanding of mental illness in its many forms.

The art style is interesting and atmospheric, but that doesn't carry it.It did not live up to my expectations. It was far too short, the gameplay was too simple and nothing unique (no puzzles, only three predictable enemy types, and any point-and-click adventure elements are soely in the chunk used in the demo), and it just didn't keep my attention.

												The art style is very impressive and the game has a nice creepy vibe to it. I have high praise for how the game looks, feels and even plays. That being said, I do have a beef. I wish the main character would move a little faster on staircases. This may seem like an odd complaint but hear me out. There are ALOT of staircases in this game and the main character moves SO slow on them! It's not that you are even being chased and that's where the tension is coming from, the staircases consistently seem to be the safest places in the game, nothing ever happens on them, it just takes SO long for him to get down them and there are SO many! Yes, what I am saying is that by the end of the game what I feared most was the STAIRS! In a game that has a baby monster, an escaped psych patient, a machete wielding girl, spooky dolls, creepy music and well done atmosphere, there was nothing that sent a chill up my spine like coming upon ANOTHER flight.Again though this is really a tiny beef its a nice creepy game at a reasonable price with multiple endings.8/10 Would learn to fear stairs all over again.

												This game is not your 6+ hour average title. This is more of a story rather than a game, so if you like story you should be decently satisfied with its dark overtones. The game has three different endings too so it has replay value along with achievements. The drawn look of the game really adds to unique atmosphere, like an haunted house game but with a darker setting throughout. Music in the game is very well done, always changing to the perfect moment within the story, along with the well done voices this game has a really solid atmosphere for a horror game.      At the end of the game i was happy to see that they had a website for people who needed help with mental conditions, having friends and being one of those people made me feel like they cared for people who go through those experiences. Overall, a great experience with a memorable good story.			"

												Well: the art and style in the game is very, very original, detailed and well done - being a comics reader sinc childhood, i was captured immediately.but the game itself, even by the standards of the ""walking simulator"" genre, is very boring and too much diluted.it's the classic indie game that is based on a nice idea, but the realization isn't deep enough to stretch it to the minimum of 2-3 hours lenght.at 1h30mins i was completely, utterly, totally bored by the endless sequence of useless corridors, by the sound , that is well realized, but it's just a sequence of ""ting, bong, ccchh"" from the start until the end.in the end, for the story it stryfes to narrate, it should last 1hour maximum. there just is not enough story , nor gameplay, to stretch it to the actual 2-3hours the developers chose to make it last. couldn't bother to play again for hours to see the other 2 endings, i just saw them in youtube in 5mins, and that says a lot.

												Alright, this is quite a painfull review for me because i did have high expectations for this game, it starts off brilliant, good pacing, interesting visuals, an iteresting level of gore and the soundtrack, god it does grate on your nerves and achieves both a sense of unease and oppression like i have seldom seen before, but sadly, soon the game spirals into it's own repetitiveness, i can understand the setting and context but it soon ceased to be pacing to be just plain boring, and seriously, how many dead women are you going to drop out of the sky? one is unnerving, two might be trying too hard and by the third i'm more worried about getting an umbrella than actually afraid			"

												I played the whole game on one playthrough, I couldn't stop playing. After I had the first ending, I kept wanting more. This is sure a short game, but it's worth the experience. The joke about this game is that it is a walking simulator. Well, It is true that the thing you do the most IS walking. You feel like you enter the mind of someone, or something... the differents path... everything seems alike but is quite different and it seems like an endless maze. After the secon ending, I started feeling bad about the game. I even felt sad and desoriented, I had goosebumps, enven though if there aren't jumpscares.This is possibly one of the best horror experience I had in a long time, and I worth every dime I put in this game. It is an experience, and I think that everyone liking psychological horror should play this game. Seriously			"

Do Not recommend for people who:-suffer from similar nightmares or moods. It'd probably worsen your case-love horror stories: this game is too light for you-hate inexplicit endings or storylines-get bored/impatient easily-are short for money and value play time/money ratio-expect heavy interaction or novelty in gameplay mechanics (this game is rather innovative in other areas. As for mechanics.. it's only mostly walking and sometimes hiding)Recommend for people who:-just want to experience what it's like to struggle with unending nightmares, psychological disorders or emotional trauma (not all people with depression/OCD experience this kind of nightmares though)-don't care for scary but are drawn to disturbing-are empaths, and allow themselves to immerse in a game and can easily feel and explore in first-person POV, so that they might still feel the thrills all over them in a non-action-packed and slow-moving game-highly value the art and atmosphere creation side of a game, appreciate details and artistic intention-have a few bucks to spare or got it in bundleI consider myself sensitive and easily influenced by atmospheres, so I was pretty into it and.. scared for the first half, disturbed for the latter half. Most people aren't though. Most get used to the atmosphere and are no longer scared after a few minutes.P.S. The sound effects are just as awesome as the art! had to mention it			"

												Honestly, as someone who has played a good number of horror games (including point and clicks and walking simulators) I find Neverending Nightmare to truly just be boring. I enjoy a game that does not spoon feed you lore and story (such as Dark Souls or Layers of Fear) but this story is either underdeveloped or so intentionally misleading and vague that I'm left without the slightest inkling of what is going on or what/why I am doing what I am doing. This game truly is a Neverending Nightmare (that was a little harsh but I like the play on words).			"

												Neverending Nightmares is a short -gasp- game where you make your way through a series of dreams. The artstyle is -pant, pant, pant- impressive and there's a few moments that are genuinely disturbing. Unfortunately, -wheeze- the game has the same failings of many other horror games, one in particular being that the game devolves into a rudimentary game of stealth: memorizing enemy patterns and working out the acceptable path. There's also, hold on a minute -gasp, gasp, cough, cough- ok I think I'm ok -pant, pant, pant, wheeze, passes out-			"

												I'll be honest, here. I did -not- enjoy this game.The cons were, of course. The atmosphere and perfect sound design. This game even comes with a special headset-only mode to really make you question your sanity. Mix this in with an interesting art design and you have a good start.However, I find myself not scared. But bored. The game is filled with many rooms, about sixty percent of those pointless. I had many mockery names popping up in my head as I entered room after eventless room. Eventually hoping to find that ONE room to bring me to the next set of rooms.. These names were names such as Walking simulator. Room simulator. Didn't-I-Just-Enter-This-Room-A-Second-Ago Simulator.The game has three endings, strung together in a few paths that you can take through your playthrough. I did not find myself eager enough to replay this, thus I've decided to watch the other two endings on youtube. I assumed that what I had gotten was the ''Good ending''. But, interestingly enough. I found the bad ending so much more interesting, and to an extent, the scariest part of this whole game. I understand that pacing is an obvious thing to have in horror games, but this was simply: Hey! You ♥♥♥♥ed up! Now let's show you what we've had a kickstarter for!			"

												Had this one downloaded sitting in my library for over a month now, I finally decided to play it, only to find an amazing horror game with a ton of personality. Genuinely scary, horrific scenes of blood and gore, terrifying monsters and ghouls, a beautiful noir art style, a twisted sadistic plot which has alternate conclusions and not one bug encountered in my 3 hour playthrough. What more could you ask for?My experience with this game was extremely enjoyable and I'm proud to support such creative developers. Grab this one whenever you get the chance, it's worth it.			"

The graphics fit the atmosphere and sounds perfectly (in my opinion).Also, the game was rather short sadly, but there are aperantly more endings (3 in total, i've only got one of the 3).. The story was well told, but i mean, its SUPER short and the gameplay itself was rather dull. All you did was walk around opening doors, and its very linear. You cannot really ""explore"" the area, wich i didnt like.My rating? I give it a 7/10.			"

												This game oozes creepy atmosphere. It's not fast-paced and at 1.5-2 hours for a playthough, it's not long (though there are multiple endings you can go back and explore), but it kept me on edge the whole time. There are a few jump scares but the horror mostly comes in the form of a feeling of dread and a sense of mild disorientation. The sound design is top-notch and the hand-drawn graphics are well-suited to the gameplay.I'm partial to games that are exactly as long as they need to be and don't overstay their welcome, so the short play time really didn't bother me, but if you measure the value of a game in dollars per hour of play, this might not be the game for you at full price. It's the gaming equivalent of an art-house film -- not for everyone, but a treat for those who appreciate seeing a game try something different.			"

												The only problem that I have with this game is that the nightmare ends all too soon. Whilst I was under no illusions that this game would in fact offer Neverending Nightmares as is suggested by the title, I was still dissapointed to realise just how quickly the game would run it's course. The game only lasts around 4 hours, including a replay of the alternative sections which aren't accessible in the first play through, and for the better part of £11, I felt the price was quite steep for the limited play time. Having said all of the above, the games style and gameplay really did win me over and the use of colour shading and shadows really does make this game. I am recommending this game as I really did enjoy the experience, but would recommend using some caution if buying it at full price.			"

												The one thing that really stuck out the most about this game (for me) was the sound. Both music and effects alike were so well done that I was blown away at certain moments. The pacing and timing was spot on, creating a really exciting and creepy atmosphere. Of course the game in general was a fun experience (and creepy), but I don't think it would have been the same without the well crafted music and sounds. One thing to note, the game is short. I personally think the price tag is a little high but this is completely subjective. The game is certainly worth playing.

Graphic imagery and art style keep your attention throughout the game. I genuinely can't think of a single thing this game didn't do to inspire dread, fear and create the possibility for genuine nightmares of my own. In a genre bursting with cheap and tacky scares this game for me is an example of what it means to deliver a genuinely terryfing horror experience.  "

The sound is well layered and clear.  It's true that it's not a long game, and it's not like a horror-survival game - it's an interactive story.  Assuming you're not expecting a different type of game, I highly recommend Neverending Nightmares.			"

												Games pretty spooky man, slow paced with a strong atmosphere and a lot of solid scares that feel genuine and not just cheap monster closet/jump scares. The art design is excellent, the enemies are scary and while they are pretty much puzzles rather than enemies they still managed to make you nervous. Main flaws are the voice acting (mitigated by the fact that there is not a lot of talking), one or two 'puzzles' (i.e. enemies to get by) that are a bit trial and error and short length (there is replayability though). Over all a solid pick for the Halloween season.			"

												Asthma Simulator 2014In all seriousness though, this was an alright game. A few creepy and tense moments along with a few jumps. It's not a fantastic game, and can be rather slow at times, especially given how slow you're forced to move because of the main character's asthma, and the game itself feels somewhat repetative and stretched, without much substance at times. There's also not much replayability, though thankfully the developers made it easy to go back to the branching paths and explore the other option and to get to the three different endings.That being said, I love the art style and the sound design throughout the game (though the voice acting at times could be better). The story itself is sort of eh. I suppose the three endings could be considered and connected to all be 'canon', or each one tells a different story and ending based off the same introduction, but otherwise it's nothing very noteworthy.So, all in all, this is a 6/10 game. Above average, but not great, and not really worth $15. Get it during a big sale like I did, and you might enjoy if you're fine with slower paced creepy games.			"

Audio also puts so much into the atmosphere and gaming experience, especially with headphones but it's nothing remarkable. Scary moments occur during the entire game and they are really various. The big problem is that the majority of the game is just walking. Moreover, the price isn't equal to the time a common player spends on this title because you can complete this game in 100% in about 2 hours.

Doesn't really have screamers but it does have surprirses. Game's roughly 2 hours if you want to see all three endings and get through all branching paths (there's two paths to one ending but you need to get to its chapter by two different ways for an achievement).Bad things are: Your character moves rather slow even if environment is bright. Despite character's appearance he can't run more than 3 meters without having to stop and catch breath. There's a lot of dead end rooms. It wouldn't be bad if character was a little faster. "

												Neverending Nightmares is a 2D side-scrolling horror exploration game, from the developer Infinitop Games, with a really minimalistic pencil drawn monochrome painting-like graphics with color-highlighted useable objects. It's based on Tommy, a pre-teenager aged boys subconscious nightmare. There are 3 possible outcomes, which is bassically depends on whether you turn left or right at defined points in the game. Recommended playing at night, because the tension and jumpscares are much more effective that way, but no matter when you play it, it's gonna give you the goosebumps anyway. It has 4 achievements, and 3 card drops, which can be obtained within no more than 210 minutes of gameplay, so outmaxing the game takes aprox. 3Hrs 30 min, and because of the said fact, only recommended at a highly discounted price on Steam, or buying it from a 3rd party reseller, where i got the game from for 2 EURos, and at that price i must say was worth it, but absolutely not for the full 15 EUR price tag. 80/100			"

												I really enjoyed Neverending Nightmares.  The Edward Gorey inspired artwork is perfect (perfect emulation of Gorey's works and perfect for the gameplay style).  The soundscape builds anxiety and reminds me of the terror of hearing something but not knowing what or where it is.  As far as the story, you get out of it what you want.  You can look for deep hidden meanings in the artwork/paintings, level design, monsters, and brief dialogue or you can just enjoy it as a true Nightmare without context and dreamlike. It doesn't beat you over the head with plot.  (I truly just wanted to experience the world because of the artwork.  I wasn't demanding a deep complicated storyline - which is there.)The only thing I wanted that the game didn't provide would have been more subtle changes in the backgrounds (shadows move/objects change or fall etc.). There were a few, but I want more.  I like looking at the screen and thinking Did I just see that? There are parts of the game where the mechanics may frustrate people. Thomas doesn't run for long at all (which makes sense, ever had those dreams where you try to punch but can't? I attribute his slowness to things like that)  In this game, getting killed doesn't set you back far at all so trying to avoid death again is easy in that aspect.I recommend this game (if it is on sale).  It's a short playthough if you want to just get one ending.  It has some really creepy moments. I'd probably buy a sequel to it if they made one.			"

I attribute his slowness to things like that)  In this game, getting killed doesn't set you back far at all so trying to avoid death again is easy in that aspect.I recommend this game (if it is on sale).  It's a short playthough if you want to just get one ending.  It has some really creepy moments. I'd probably buy a sequel to it if they made one.			"

												I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the game and the soundtrack.  It was the changes of music that really made me get goosebumps!  ^^  It's not an extremely challenging game and it can drag on a bit but I think that's the point, you start to becme agitated which makes the scary breathing or jumpscares more effective.Ps.  It's super easy to get all of the 4 achievements if you're into that sort of thing!  ^^			"

												Quite simply put, this game excells in its atmosphere and in terms of subtlety, an aspect that is lacking in most games nowadays, especially horror titles. There is very little jump scares involved in the game and the few that are involved in ways that fit the atmosphere of the game. The imagery is frightening (and gets pretty disturbing at points), the subject matter gets incredibly dark, the audio presentation is amazing, and the story manages to be abstracxt enough to get your own interpretation, yet clear enough so that you can be entertained by what you are seeing. It is a game that rewards thought, which is a rare aspect of stories in games.There are only a few complaints I have, the first being that, while the art style is well drawn and adds to the atmosphere, I found there to be a slight bit of eye strain due to the amounts of small lines of various different monochrome shades that represent the darkness, which tends to just look incredibly awful in motion, which is even worse due to the flickering when the screen moves, so you may want to pass on this if you have especially sensitive eyes.The other being that the game is kind of simplistic gameplay wise, and you spend most of the time just walking left or right, while occasionally trying to figure out how to slip by an enemy, which is in a rather simplistic way each time. The game is also light on content and can be beaten in about 4 hours, although it can be a bit longer if you take your time. Overall though, I highly reccomend this game. It really knows how to handle horror and atmosphere incredibly well and is one of the most underrated games of 2014.Full Review Here http://www.gamefaqs.com/PC/730261-neverending-nightmares/reviews/160582 "

												This game is really more of an experience than a game.It's not the usual puzzle/point and click/survival horror game that most people might expect from the title.It's not even very storydriven and dosen't follow a ordinary pacing that one might expect from a horrorgame. The atmosphere that the game delivers is really creepy and eerie almost throughout the whole game and it will for sure keep you on your toes more than once. I get the feeling this was an active choice the developers made for the gamedesign and it was in my opinion genius.I really recommend that you read the ""about this game"" segment for a better understanding of what they were shooting for. There are times this game is tedious, there are times when you just want it to end so you can go on with your life. These are thoughts that are occuring daily of countless people dealing with depression and OCD, however they can't choose when they've had enough. Everything in this game and I mean even the little things are things that remind me of my struggle I had as a teenager. If you get through this game then maybe, you'll understand what it's like to be caught in your own nightmare just a little better. If you want a game to keep you busy for days then this one isn't the way to go. Do you want to improve your understanding of mental illness then this game will provide it more so than anything I've come across before in my life. 10/10			"

												I truly enjoyed the art on this game. Sadly, the story was mediocre and the game play abysmal. Baddies are limited to one type per level, and avoiding them requires you master such difficult skills as: Wait until it goes away, hide in wardrobe, wait for it to pass, exit. This might work in a game like Outlast, where there is little certainty as to the patrol patterns, but as this is a side scroller, it has all the nuance of a brick. The only real scares are jarring, but stilted. Every level is about 3x longer than it has any right to be, as well as being incredibly monotonous. You mostly traverse the same hallways on repeat.D/D- game. Would not recommend.			"

Bizarre, eerie, unsettling, creepy, macabre, demented, weird, sinister, deranged, morbid, gruesome, horrific, psychotic, traumatic, insane, disturbing, gory...Did I miss anything? Neverending Nightmares isn't scary like Outlast or Amnesia, but it does have its fair share of jumpscares (good, not cheap) and lots of clever little horror details like a hand falling from a covered body on a gurney, or a doll blinking after your character walks by. Most of these details happened so quickly that sometimes I wasn't sure if I actually saw what I thought I saw, which just made the game all the more unsettling.The game story has a ""branching pathways"" system, meaning the choices you make in game can unlock various different nightmares with three different game endings, adding to the replayability factor. PROS:Art Style: Brilliant!Music: Somber, adds to the creepiness.SFX/Ambiance: Excellent. There is a headphone setting in the audio options which really adds to the already immersive quality of the game.CONS:Stamina: Asthmatic (of course if your character could outrun everything, the game wouldn't be very challenging)TLDR: Overall, a unique horror game, not very long, but long enough. I highly recommend this one!			"

												An interesting game that looks into mental illness through a horror lense. The game's story is fairly vague in an effective way, letting you piece together it's nightmarish narrative by yourself. The horror elements are quite effective, and it rarely uses the same trick more than a couple of times to scare you. The sound design and art design are the real meat and potatoes of this game's positive side, as they stand out among all other aspects. The stills of this game don't do it justice, the way the Sharpee-like style animates is much more effective in motion.The game is over quick, with a few branching paths to make you reinvestigate it, but overall it's definitely worth a playthrough or two.

												This is a game that does a very good job of scaring you through atmosphere alone. The environment your in can change suddenly, your mostly alone throughout your journey, and if you play with headphones you have a constant feeling of dread as to wonder though the levels.This game succeeds in having no combat, mainly because you character isn't really healthy looking, he has asthma(weezes as he runs) and the enemies are all better than him in some way.This game also isn't for the squimish, if you don't like the idea of briefly seeing a hand enter a meat grinder or the various ways you find corpses and blood, then this game may not be for you.This game is also somewhat short, but offers three different endings.So if you like short, atmosphiric, gory, non-combat stealth games then go ahead and give this game a try.

												It's hard to categorise this game. To start, I know the author doesn't like this term, but the game IS a walking simulator. You walk from A to B, past a few things, over and over and over. Maybe you will collect an item, maybe not.The thing that carries this game is the art style, and if it wasn't for that, I wouldn't play it. It is not scary in anyway, nor gruesome, at least to me, and you are basically holding down buttons and occasionally pressing a button to get through the story.This would have been ok at around £2.99, but the price being asked is frankly insane. I have read the author's post on this game about having mental issues, but the biggest mental issue I see here is the price.I cannot recommend this game at this price point.			"

												(Steam didn't record my playtime while offline. A single ending took me about 2-3 hours to achieve.) I found myself tentative to recommend this at first, as it's a very slow burner that can prove irritating during some of its clumsy chase sequences, but digging deeper and giving it time to sink in has left me with a positive overall impression. It's thoroughly dark and depressing, with no coherent central plot until you start to read into things, and legitimately frightening. The art style is fantastic, though animations are clunky. There are a few different endings to discover, but none of them will take more than a few hours to get to. There's not a lot of game here for full price, but it's solid fare for horror fans.What makes it more interesting is knowing the context behind its development. Created from a dark place, it's an expression of depression and other psychological issues the developer was suffering from at the time. Taken with that in mind, it becomes a deeply personal exploration of someone's troubled mind, and offers an unsettling view of illness that's eye-opening.			"

												Well, first things first: yes, it spooked me. Is it worth of 14,99€? Nope. You see my playtime? That's how much it took me to beat the game with one of the three endings. It's a really short game, and I'm not really into playing it two times again to try to figure out how to get the other endings, since the story isn't very rich in my opinion. The game mostly is just about walking around, but this isn't a bad case since the enviroments are creepy and constant feeling of threat is in presence. Also the soundtrack/ambience is well done and keep you on the edge. Even though it succeeds in what there is to offer, I still have to say 14,99€ price tag is way too much asked. It's worth of picking up if you see it on sale tho.Tldr: If you aren't into replaying, the game is too short for its normal price tag, even though it manages to be spooky.			"

It is by no means a bad game, just way too short for the asking price. Although there are jumpscares galore, none of them are the scream in your face type that you'll find in other games.

												You know, nothing tastes quite as bad as bad horror. I bought this game expecting a psychological trip, like, the mind games of Amnesia The Dark Descent, or the experience of emotional tension beside all the survival horror like Silent Hill 2, but instead what I found in Neverending Nightmares is simply every trick we've already seen in the horror genre (be it movie, novel, or video game) amplified with buckets of blood and dark ambient noises to make your time playing this as experientially unpleasant as possible. I understand that in order to be scary, an artist needs to show you something to break comfort zones and unnerve you into paying attention, but here the designers seemed to just overload you with everything that tempts you NOT to pay attention: Good God, I mean, you see some of the most overtly disturbing sights and sounds I've ever found in a game here, all in that Edward Gorey-esque art style, for no insightful meaning other than to promote awareness for mental illness-- as made evident from a message in the credits. While I can see how there are people out there that can enjoy this -- be it for the sociopolitical issue of mental health awareness or the jump-out scares that will surely spawn some funny Let's Play videos-- I cannot recommend this simply due to how uncreative and tasteless the creators' sense of ""horror"" is. To me, Neverending Nightmares is hardly any different than a very drawn-out version of those mazes where the Exorcist face pops up.			"

												I played this at PAX about a year ago and was blown away by the art style, sound design, and core concept (using horror as an expression of mental illness). Playing the full game now, I was not disappointed. Neverending Nightmares is relentlessly intense, packed to the brim with subtle scares and leaves you with a feeling of twisted curiosity and deep thinking that most horror games simply don't achieve. This game serves as a testament to focus in a game being crucial to its success (the only controls in this game are movement and an interact key), and with this unwavering dedication to a horror experience it ends up being one of the greatest horror games I've played not just in recent memory, but that I've ever played. It's simply a must play for anyone who loves the horror genre or gaming experiences in general.			"

												Neverending Nightmares does a fine job of capturing the shifting scenery and helpless dread of nightmares, and it does so with only a handful of actual monsters -- the real horror comes from the gorgeous, Edward Gorey-esque artwork and the rich audio, which work together to mount a terrifying tension.  The ending levels are quite different depending on which path you choose, making it worthwhile to achieve all three endings.I do have a few minor complaints.  For $14 I expected the game to be at least 5-6 hours, and I would have liked to have seen more environmental variation and more object interaction.  Additionally, I would have preferred a little more meat on the narrative.  I do understand that all of this would have been quite a tall order for such a beautifully hand-drawn (and atmosphere-focused) indie as Neverending Nightmares.  As it is, the game is a terrific bit of interactive horror and I would love to see Gilgenbach do another, perhaps longer and more involved, game in the same style.			"

												I appreciate the fact that someone made this. The art and audio are great, but the pacing is far, far too slow to evoke anything but boredom and punctuated by brief jump scares. I get a sense of dread when I feel like I could run into something terrible at any moment. When the answer to ""what's around that corner?"" is ""nothin'"" 95% of the time, the dread breaks down a little.I can see what they were going for -- I've had night terrors where I wandered through endless houses that felt familiar, but in those nightmares I've never thought to myself ""this is a really long stairway"" or ""yeah, you are a real scary blood dude"". I played 45 minutes, read that it was an hour and a half long, and despaired that I was only halfway through. Don't think I'll be coming back to finish.			"

												Neverending Nightmares is a hard game to give a less-than-glowing review to, considering that the guy who put it together apparently crammed a lot of his personal experience with very, very bad mental states into it. Eventually all the symbolism clicks into place, all the confused narrative suddenly becomes coherent, and you immediately gain a whole hell of a lot empathy for our poor impotent protagonist. Unfortunately, along the way to that glorious, agonizing trio of endings you have to put up with the game itself, and that's not nearly as enjoyable a prospect as I'd hoped.In NN, you play a man named Thomas who wakes up with a start in his bed, only to find as he explores his home that all is not well. The decor is decidedly morbid, the furniture dusty and broken, the house itself in a dangerous state of disrepair. You walk the familiar halls, and then you notice the blood. Drips and drabs, usually, but in places great spatters, and then you see the meat, hear the crying, and then you find Gabbie, except she's dead, a knife in her belly in a clear suicide, but that's not right, you did it, you stabbed her, but that's not right, she's fine, Gabbie's not dAnd then you wake up, and you get out of bed. But as you explore your home you find that all is not well.The concept here is fantastic, and it's executed wonderfully when you first set out. The artwork is the most obvious strength; pretty much every inch of design is dripping with Edward Gorey influence, and who better to illustrate dismembered children than the master? Just as critical is the sound work. While perhaps not so unearthly and unsettling as the audio in the Silent Hill series, NN's whispers and screams can definitely get under one's skin from time to time. I strongly recommend playing with a good set of headphones in the dark, as maintaining atmosphere is critical to enjoying the game... which is sadly something it's really bad at helping you along with.As good as the artwork may be, the fine people at Infinitap really, really wanted to hammer home a sense of obsessive-compulsive disorder to go along with the suicidal depression themes. Faithful to that goal, the artwork is recycled to an excruciating degree. The first time you see a maimed toy soldier or cracked doll girl staring at you with dead eyes, you can appreciate it. The hundredth time it happens in a single hour of game play, you're filtering it out. The same goes for the ghastly portraiture, the spider webs, the blood spatters, the intestines... For a good portion of the game, you feel less like you're wandering through a carefully crafted diorama of mental anguish and more like you're stuck in some random number generator's attempt at gore-horror. Eventually the repetition gets the desired effect across, and I applaud the intent here, but until it actually works you're simply annoyed by it all.Other fumbles are less easily blamed on design philosophy. The gameplay takes a massive chunk out of any sense of immersion for a few reasons. First off, your controls are extremely simple: you can walk around, run for short lengths of time, or examine objects. With such a bare bones control set, the game tries to make you feel like you're actually playing something the only way it knows how: through really bad stealth action. 90% of the game is spent simply traveling further and further into horrible places, but every now and then monsters are thrown at you, and you must bypass them using terribly unoriginal stealth tricks, such as hiding in a closet or timing your movement so you never get close enough to notice. Used in moderation, adversaries could have greatly improved the general sense of anxiety you're supposed to be feeling, but instead they just make you remember that you're playing a video game and this is yet another obstacle to bypass.Examining your environment is even worse. Any time you find an object you can look closer at, it'll be colored, unlike the all black-and-white background of everything else. Doing so really accomplishes nothing; usually you just see more spookily arranged dolls, unsettling bits of meat, or horribly murdered loved ones, and all of those get caught up in your repetition filter real fast. Every now and then they throw in a sassy jump scare, but those don't contribute too much in the end. On top of that, the game suffers a bit from overzealous Kickstarter Love. Donators who gave above a certain threshold got to have their faces immortalized in game, in the form of large portraits you come across every so often. Initially, I thought these characters would be story-related in some way, family members that were influential on the developer's life or key villains to be discovered down the line. Nope. They're just a bunch of very nice people who gave a lot of money to this man to make a game. And that's fine, that's all well and good, but it tears you even further out of the sense of immersion, and by that point you're noticing the awkward animations, and you're sick of the protagonist's pitiful endurance for running, and you're wondering why you're even playing.It took me much longer to finish Neverending Nightmares than I expected it to, simply because it sapped my motivation hard about halfway through. Upon beating it, I only dug up the remaining endings out of some sense of obligation to do so before reviewing it, and I am extremely grateful I did so, even if I needed the help of a walkthrough to find any of the other endings. When all is said and done, NN is a hell of a narrative that gets the sense of a man's agony across quite well, but its many flaws can't be ignored. A stunning last act can win over an ugly crowd, but only until they stop afterwards and think about all the complaints they had along the way and all the pieces that never quite fit. I applaud Infinitap Games for putting this together, and I know a good number of people who might eventually appreciate playing this, but in the end I just can't say the experience added up to a good game.

												Best indie horror game ever. Disturbing and terrifying that will make you go insane. The hand-drawn artwork makes this game unique and the sound effect is excellent. It is best to play with headphones. Expect that your character will be slow (not recommended to use sprint often, you'll find out why) and you'll get bored at some parts as you explore around the house and open every doors that is full of twist because the scenes are changing till you reach the ending.

												Neverending Nightmares manages to be scary without relying too much on jump scares, like many other games do. Instead, thanks to the great visuals and clever pacing, it creates a disquieting atmosphere which will keep you genuinely tense and frightened.From looking at a simple screenshot, some might think they don't look like much, but in motion and during gameplay, coupled with the great audio, they really shine. Personally, even just the way the game creates the effect of darkness is quite clever and scary.At first sight, there's not too much interaction, but there are actually multiple endings and branching paths to find.It's definitely a must play if you like original horror games.

												You may be looking at the trailer for ""Neverending Nightmares"" and wondering if it will scare you.  You might be accustomed to games like ""Amnesia"" or ""Outlast"" terrifying you, and wondering how can a little indie project with a hand-drawn art style be as terrifying as larger budget horror titles you may have played. Well, I'm here to tell you that this game will horrify you in ways you never thought possible.  The ""Edward Gorey"" Styled Imagery will shake you to the bone in ways that no first-person horror experience ever could.  You will look at the world in darker shades after experiencing it.  The multiple endings will serve to confuse/disturb/fascinate you.  You will be analyzing and interpreting this events of this game long after you finish holding a controller.  And you will know just how scary interactive gaming can be. I was lucky enough to play this game before release.  It has been 12 hours since I put the game down...and I am still shaken.  This is one of those games that sticks with you long after you put it down.  This game will give you Neverending Nightmares.

												Neverending Nightmares is a refreshing psychological horror game. At first the artwork looks a bit rough and childlike, but in the end that's exactly what made the game so chilling. I also enjoyed the balance between gradual tension building and creative jump scares.Considering that there's nothing much you can do in this game other than walk around (and avoid a few monsters), the game is surprisingly entertaining. I got to the end credits pretty much at the point I felt that the game had started repeating itself. It takes a couple of hours to play through the game, but the story branches and there's some replay value.If you enjoy your creepypastas and don't mind the rustic charm of simple home baked games, you might want to grab this when it's on sale.

												Full disclosure to start with: I was a Kickstarter backer for this game.Let me also get this out of the way: I'm not really a horror game fan.  I'm fascinated by the idea of horror games (as the fact that I have a number of horror games on my playlist will attest), but often lack the guts to actually install and play the silly things (as the fact that most of those same games have 0 playtime on them will attest).Given that, it was with a bit of apprehension that I loaded up the game this evening.  But I went all in for the experience.  The lights were out, the headphones were on, and I dived in.And I got to say that I enjoyed it.Neverending Nightmares tells the story of young Thomas, an asthmatic young man whom awakes from a nightmare in which his murders his younger sister, Gabriella.  As the name implies, that is not going to the last time that Thomas wakes up in this game.  Most of the game is spent wandering through a handful of environments, while the tension slowly builds around you.  I’m sure there will be people who decry this as “yet another walking simulator,” as Thomas cannot run for long before having to stop to catch his breath.  This exploration is punctuated by a handful of enemies, and a number of jump scares (I think all but one actually made me jump).  The enemies themselves act more as barriers than as active hunters (with a pretty notable exception), but nothing too aggravating to overcome.  The real draw here is the tense atmosphere.The tension is brought in large part by some amazing sound design.  The ambient soundtrack kept me on edge pretty much the entire time.  The enemy tells were also nerve-racking…and while not sound design, I wanted to give a shout out to some great use of controller vibration, using it to as another cue for the enemy’s footsteps.  Even the sound of poor Thomas gasping and wheezing to catch his breath after a full sprint was well done.  It made me feel bad for the poor kid, and I actually stopped sprinting as much because I didn’t want to hear it anymore!In the end, Neverending Nightmares is a short game.  I finished my first play through in an hour and a half.  There are a couple a sequences that I missed and intend to go back and play through, but all told I’ll be surprised if a full complete takes more than 2 hours (Update: it took me 2.5 hours to get all endings/branches).  In the past, that has been a major hang up for me.  In this case of Nightmares, however, I don’t mind at all.  I feel that I got my full-pledge value out of what I played.  It's a tight experience that delivers it's narritive and atmosphere, and then ends before it overstays it welcome. And I wouldn’t be surprised if Neverending Nightmares becomes a Halloween tradition for me.I also feel that the story behind the game is an important one.  The game is the director’s way of trying to express what it was like for him to suffer from depression and OCD.  But don’t worry, this isn’t a “game with a message” where you are beaten over the head with it.  It did cause me to consider what it must be like to suffer from mental illness when, after I played the game, I discovered that some of the more gory/horrific sequences in the game were inspired by intrusive thoughts the director had suffered from (I didn't even know about intrusive thoughts before then, if I am being painfully honest).  If you google 'Neverending Nightmares,' you will get linked to some articles where the director tells his story and his reasons behind the game in more detail than my lame attempt here.  It is well worth looking up.All told, I don't regret throwing my money behind Neverending Nightmares at all.  If you like horror games, pick it up.Update:I managed to reach all the endings.  According to Steam, this took me about 2.5 hours (on timer on Steam said 2, another said 3, so I'll spilt the difference).  I should note that, after I played through blind the first time, I used a guide to find the other two endings, so if you are keen on finding out those for yourself, it might take long.			"

												A games goal is create emotion, and Neverending Nightmares does a great job of that. Where other games may focus on feelings of triumph and accomplishment, Neverending Nightmares is about horror in a very creepy and personal way. It is unsettling. The type of game oyu want to play in the dark, and after you are done you want to run and get your friends to try it out.			"

												Neverending Nightmares delivers a really unsettling and creepy game. I love the black and white style, with coloured objects or splotches of blood. The art style is reminiscent of Edward Gorey, which I conisder a high compliment.While the game is a bit on the short side, it does have multiple endings. In addition to chapter selection, the game also allows you to see which paths are still left to unlock. For achievement hunters, this is especially handy.I wouldn't necessarily recommend buying this for the full price. For a short, relatively linear game, I don't believe it's worth $16. If you can get it during an inevitable Steam sale, however, I definitely think it's worth at least one play through.			"

												Not the most fun horror game out there but it is nonetheless interesting. It's basically a game revolved around experiencing ones psychological horrors. The nightmares become much more deeper and darker as you progress through. Creepy yet disturbing imagery will pop out throughout as you progress through the nightmares.Some can easily dismiss this game because of it's gameplay but rather it's the unique atmosphere and horror experience that makes this game quite fascinating. You can feel the creators struggle, sometimes you just want to wake up from a long sinister nightmare.I also go this game when it was around $5, so I'm not really complaining about price, but I do recommend getting it when it's on sale.

												Not great, but a pretty decent horror romp. The actual scares get very repetitive towards the end as you go through the same rooms and encounter the same enemies over and over and over again. Locations and enemies are unfortunately fairly stock: creepy old mansion, run down asylum, mutilated inmates, living dolls, etc... A few times the enemies actually managed to frighten me, but they were mostly predictable. This game is a fine example of why repetition can ruin horror. All that being said, the audio and visual design save this game from being completely mediocre. The sound in the game reminded me very much of Eternal Darkness, setting the mood of a rapidly shifting nightmare scape very effectively. And the hand drawn, line heavy art style is fantastic. Overall, I'd say it's worth your time, but try to pick it up during a sale.			"

												So far, I have only made it to one ending of the game. For the most part, the game doesn't rely on cheap jump scares for it's scare factor. The game itself makes you question what the heck is going on. As you journey through the game there are branching pathways that lead to different endings and different kinds of scares. The atmosphere and the sound design is what really got to me. I was constantly freaked out or even paniced, because of the events happening. This game isn't for everyone. It is a little slow, considering you're walking through it. There is a ""sprint"" but it's more like walking fast, and it doesn't take long for the character to run out of breath. The best way to enjoy the game is put on some headphones, turn up the volume, and see where your creepy journey takes you. I did get this a part of a bundle for pretty cheap. Honestly, I'd say $15 is a little bit too much for the game. Took me 2 hours for one ending. There is replay value if you want to find all endings. If you like horror games, I'd say give this one a shot. Thanks for reading! :)			"

												Um... yeah. It's not a good sign when I've only been playing the game half an hour and i'm already bored.The developer did a pretty good job building the atmosphere, but it feels like all it's used for is jump scares. The most I can say is at least it isn't one of those fricking flash games where you click on this thing five times, this thing once, once on the first thing, and then are rewarded with a really cheap jumpscare.Game play is excruciatingly repetitive. It is a clever gimmick that instead of ""dying"" you wake up, and it was utilized well during the first bit of gameplay, where you wander around an empty house waking up every time you see something particularly horrifying. I also love the black and white color scheme, with interactable objects having different colors to them. This was a godsend, and I didn't have to wander around smashing the interact button in front of everything that looks slightly unique.Trouble was, this is a walking simulator in the worst sense of the word. And I like walking simulators! But whereas in, say, Gone Home you are walking through a house that's loaded down with secrets and personality and notes and Bikini Kill and Le Tigre tapes, in this game you are just walking. Periodically jogging for a bit. Hiding in plain sight for a moment. Followed by more walking. There aren't notes. There are barely any other people. Even when the game did something I thought was really neat (introducing the girl with black hair from the trailer/game icon as your sister by showing a picture of you with her, then telling you her name by showing your character react to her tombstone, which reads ""beloved sister"") it goes and ruins it by having the character wake up and immediately have a conversation with his sister about how she is his sister.And I get where the game is coming from, I do. It's about mental illness. Mental illness is all about repetition, whether it's the good kind of repetition like stimming or the bad kind, like chronic unwanted thoughts. But when that's all there is to the game... life is just too short, you know?			"

												I feel like this game might have done better as a short animation. The art style is really interesting to look at and lends itself well to the creepy atmosphere. The pen style drawing look makes the world around you far more unsettling. The music and sound is a great compliment as well and there were plenty of times I found myself on edge just from the noises around me, even when there was nothing actually happening. The entire set up should have lent itself to a fantastic horror game except it's missing the game part.There really was nothing to the gameplay here. Every so often you could look at a picture or the face of ever deteriorating dolls, but there wasn't much to interact with. Sometimes monsters would show up that you would have to avoid, but they were all pretty standard and as far as I could tell there was no real penalty for death if you screwed up.  All of them were simple to figure out and were very easy to deal with making them very non threatening. There were one or two times the game did something interesting with each individual creature, but it only ever happened once and then never again.Pretty much the meat of the game was walking slowly down hallways looking at artwork that you couldn't interact with. To make it worse a lot of the same visuals were used over and over and over again. The same creepy dolls the same creepy pictures the same unsettling blood splatters. What started out as unnerving quickly became dull and in some cases kind of funny because of how overused it was.Finally the story was a little... meh. It was nothing special to begin with then add on to that the main characters seeming disinterest in everything going on around him just made the world feel even more lifeless. With the exception of some of the ""cutscenes"" seperating the parts of the game you feel like you're controlling a paper doll. Dead body falling from the sky? Not a flinch. Seeing people hanging from the ceiling? Not even an eyetwitch. He just doesn't feel like a character let alone someone I should be concerned/interested in.This game obviously had a lot of heart and love put into it. It shows in the style, the atmosphere, in the sound design and how smooth the gameplay is when it does happen. It unfortunatly just doesn't have enough to hold it up as a game and definatly not enough to justify the price of it.I've only gotten one ending so far (the bad one I think) but I just don't think there was enough to keep me invested to try and get the other two. The first playthrough only took me 2 hours with me taking my time/looking hard at background scenery and out of that probably only about 20-30 min was spent on actual gameplay outside of walking forward.

												Play as Thomas, the man who can only sprint for 6 seconds before completely running out of breath and panting like crazy on this linear adventure called ""Neverending Corridors"" as you traverse the same corridors over and over as you try to build stamina to overcome asthma, also featuring a fun game of tag with your sister who has perfectly functional lungs who mocks you for your disabilities, but Thomas never gives up and shows his sister that he can indeed catch up to her, it's very heartwarming.This could have been a 20~30 minute corridor marathon but it was meant to be an experience where you truly relate to the character and his chronic asthma, and because of his disabilities it actually takes two to three times longer to beat, I approve this game as an educative game to raise awareness about the struggles of asthma and how it completely changes life for the people who suffer it, asthma is a really scary thing indeed.

												Firstly I will state that I was a Kickstarter backer for this game, so you may think me biased if you wish.Neverending Nightmares is more of an 'experience' rather than a game (in fairness it does say that in the game description). As many other reviews have already mentioned, it is mostly walking around with very little gameplay, however (depending on your taste) I found this to be very enjoyable. I would also state it's more of a creepy game rather than a scary one. It depends heavily on atmosphere, but I found myself too detached from the main character, Thomas, to really find myself immersed. It had moments where I would find myself feeling rather tense, and it did have a few jump scares (effective and nicely done), but I never found myself feeling genuinely scared.The storyline is confusing and varied, but I found that very fitting. After all, how often do dreams make sense?The price is a little steep for what is essentially an interactive short, but I would recommend getting the game when it's on sale.  "

												Now I don't recommend this game at its retail price, I never recommend anything at retail, but I did find the game enjoyable.  the first few dreams are rather bothersome, but when you get to the different endings it was a good amount of fun.  It's easy to %100 with only 4 achievements, and has a clear good, neutral, and bad ending.  The main reason I would go against this game is that you spend way too much time walking, and run out of breath much too quickly.  On top of that this isn't a game to go into expecting a good scare, because it really only relies on the creepy atmosphere, and some bizarre looking enemies.Now I know it has not gone on sale for anything less than $6 (not including Humble Bundle), but wait if you have $5 to blow go for it when it does drop.

												I would recommend Neverending Nightmares at a discount if you are disappointed by short play-throughs. I, personally, don't care for game+ type of scenarios or running through alternate endings and such which might be something to consider also. With that said I beat the game in 92 minutes and I can say that my overall experience was pretty good.On the plus side, the sound is notably magnificent. I really like how the directional queues in the audio contributed to the overall awareness of your impending doom. It goes without saying that sound plays a major role in any scary game or game that wants to immerse you. Equally noteworthy is the art style. You may or may not like the hand-drawn aesthetic, but I like it, though it is worth noting the entire game is rendered this way. There are also a lot of explorable areas along the way to take in the detail if you're in the mood to appreciate the labor that has been put into the artwork.What I didn't like was the repetition. You will get winded after the first 30 minutes when, despite the inclusion of a few evil creatures, you realize the mechanics are a bit shallow. You look at things that have color, you push the shift key to run from creatures, and you try not to walk into the possessed inmates. That is the challenge in a nut shell, though it shouldn't take away from the real goal of delivering an enjoyable story which you can read all about in the game's description (it is pretty accurate).Neverending Nightmares is a trip, no doubt about it. The game would be a great way to kill an hour or two if not indulged upon in short bites. Check it out some time.Check out my profile for screenshots of scenes that disturbed me the most!			"

												So I got this game in a bundle for 2 buck approximately and I gotta say it's good for that price. The atmosphere it evokes is just fantastic and the music and sounds are quite haunting. As regards the gameplay on the other hand... well I felt it was just walking to and fro and avoiding enemies, and you cannot even run all the time because the dude gets tired and starts gasping every 5 seconds. That simply put me off . It kinda let me down a bit because it started pretty well. I've just finished one of the game's endings though.In short, I wouldn't pay 15 dollars for a game like this, I'd probably buy something like Amensia which allows you to interact a lot more.. but if you can pay a buck or two for it, then go ahead and get it. 5/10			"

												Stylistically, this game is great. The art style is amazing and the sound is well done. While not the most scary game, the atmosphere is pretty creepy. While it has a few jump scares, the game doesn't depend on them. This is a game you must play with headphones at night. That said, the whole package is really underwhelming. There's no combat in the game and the most you do is dodge the few predictable enemies in each section. If you manage to make a mistake, you restart in a room just before the one you died in. The enemy system is unchallenging and annoying, and rather than help the game, it makes it tedious.The game itself is incredibly short, and you can finish the first playthrough in less than one hour and a half. This isn't even rushing through the game, but exploring and examining the locations. Even getting through all the game routes, it'll be hard to go over three hours. I would be able to forgive this if it wasn't for the game biggest mistake: it's really repetitive. The first hour of the game is, as I said before, creepy and atmospheric. Then the game starts recycling assets and themes and the whole experience falls on its face. In the end you'll get one of three endings, and I'm sad to say, they're just disappointing (short, straightforward and not even clever). There's no reason for a game so short to be this repetitive and saying that it was intended to be that way is a terrible excuse. I mention that the game has a nice style to it, but there are games that do it much better, and for the current price ($15) it isn't really worth getting it.			"

												It saddens me to say, this game is flat out boring.I was a backer of this game on Kickstarter, back in Sept. 2013, and the demo hooked me. I had several of my friends play the demo and they all backed as well.The only good thing about this game is the sound design, and maybe the art style at times.The story is whatever, the exploration is non-existent, there is no reason to do anything besides just keep holding down D or A to whatever destination you are going to. The monsters are boring and are just annoying obstacles you have to stop and wait to dodge. The extra rooms have absoultely nothing in them, no Lore journals, no scary spectacle, absolutely no reason to want to explore this game around. You constantly just want a change of the repetative sceneary, which happens very rarely. The art style is great, it was one of the reason I backed it, but when its the same assests reused over and over again, it gets stale very quickly.The most annoying part is how slow your character moves. Not only do they make you walk down the same hallways over and over, but you cant run more than five seconds or the character starts to slow down and pant very annoyingly. Its as if they want us to ""take in"" the game atmosphere by forcing us to slowly waddle through the game. After everything, I am very disappointed in this game. No, I dont regret backing this. It was a great idea and a great demo, but it failed to live up to what it could have been. I wanted so bad for this game to KILL in sales, because the main developers is an awesome guy.Unfortunately, this game does not deliver in any aspect, and I wish the best to the man who made this game.

												Boy am I disappointed. An interesting idea, but over-hyped and over-long. For a game with such a basic art style (not a criticism) the repetitive hallways quickly become a chore when the lack of context for anything really starts to show. It's also extremely padded, despite some reviews saying it's a 90-120 minute game. I love games like Gone Home and Dear Esther, tagged ""walking simulators"" but I have to say avoid this. Wish I'd waited for a more generous sale price before trying.			"

												I played Neverending Nightmares the second it was available to download.  There's both good and bad about this game.  However I feel like ultimately the good outweighs the bad.  The concept of this game is completely original in my opinion.  The style, artwork, music, sound effects, and plot are great.  However the only thing bad is the game is extremely short.  I finished the game in less than 3 hours.  There are 3 very different endings however so you'll have to play through it a few times to get them all.  Also the price obviously is steep for a game that you can beat in a short amount of time.			"

												I kickstarted this game, and can't recommend it. I was really excited when I saw the art style and the demo. But the demo was good as a demo, not 1.5 hours of game play. Nothing happens in this game. the story is very weak, and the game play can only be described as plodding. Also the price tag is ridiculous. I understand they didn't want to make it less expensive than what kickstarter backers had to pay, but in that case, make the game better or longer or something. The creator argued that good gameplay trumps game length, and I would agree if the gameplay was solid. But in this game it is not. As others have stated, maybe buy this during the Steam Sales, but otherwise you money can be better spent elsewhere.			"

												While the game has many flaws, I liked the game.The game had fantastic asthetic and sound design. The game was tense and effective at delivering the representation of mental insanity.While many complained that the game was too short, I think the game was bit too long. Or at least there were some parts of the game was repeated too many times. The insane asylum, the part you NEED to repeat in order to get other ending, is way too long for no reason IMO. Not only that, the character can't run for too long and game punishes you for running at the wrong times. If you do not like short games, I do not recommend this game. If you are interested in interesting unique take on psychological horror, you should try it.			"

												Unsettling, horrifying, ambiguous, and tragic. All the best qualities of a great horror game. I would highly recommend all 3 branching paths as the main enemy changes up and some paths are harder than others. The spine-chilling soundscape had me in a sweat more than the actual difficulty of the game, which is another sign of a great horror game. I've got thoughts about the story bubbling up in my head now, but that's up to you to discover by yourself and come to your own conclusions. The level design tends to twist on itself, repeating and restructuring, a bit like the Inception of nightmares where you're not sure if you're going the right way but you never get lost. It's a short but intense experience rather than drawn out filler where tension is lost, which I think works best for the genre.			"

												Neverending Nightmares may be a short experience - taking around two hours to finish - but the paper and ink art style and oppressive atmosphere has combined into a very innovative and interesting game. More reminiscent of Limbo than any of the more conventional horror games I've played, the game creates a dark world with only one objective: keep walking.Though the third person perspective means that it can't do jump scares as well as most horror games, it nonetheless managed to create a feeling of dread throughout the game by focusing more in the psychological part of the horror genre. The slow building gameplay helps contribute to the dark and introverted feel of the game; though I found it wonderfully refreshing, not all gamers may enjoy what is essentially wandering around a dismal world for half an hour.Though it suffers from a few minor glitches with the lighting, it never really got in the way of gameplay and the branch-off levels add to the otherwise short game. It gets a little repetitive by the end, and the short environments show its indie background, but it's ultimately worth playing and is infinitely preferable to games like Dead Space which overly rely on jump scares.

												I've rarely seen a game start off so stellar, then nosedive. and then suddenly be over before it barely got underway. The first half is the most eerie gaming experience I've ever had—despite the abstract artstyle—to the point where I had to shut it off and calm myself down after just 5 minutes. The atmosphere is so well done that the game is worth recommending. Just. The game then changes locale and suddenly swaps out atmosphere for tedious, repetitive scenarios where all you do is elude zombie-type creatures, while you rely mostly on trial-and-error and the frustratingly slow pace of your character, who is exhausted after 5 seconds of sprinting. And then the game is suddenly over— after maybe 1 hour of play. The few interactive items in the game that seemed like maybe pieces to a puzzle, or a secret to unravel (mostly framed portraits) appear to be just things for you to pointlessly look at.To be honest I felt cheated paying what is the equivalent of $17 for this. Grab it during Summer Sale if it's there for like $5 just to experience the remarkably well done opening act, but this game feels like the developer(s) got lazy in a hurry.			"

												I was a backer to the game. The idea seemed quite interesting at the time, but it didn't turn out well. There is/was no horror - some gore and attempts at jump scares. The plot... well, I'm not really sure there is a plot. Apparently there are different endings, but I have no clue how to obtain them. I'm being told I made choices at some point during the game, but I have no idea when, where or how.The entire game felt dull, very walking-simulator. I understand this game is supposed to be reflective or symbolic of mental illness, which I can relate to, but if there is some kind of message being communicated, it is completely lost on me. It is extremely short, but I have to say if it was significantly longer with no other changes, I probably would never finish it simply out of boredom.The pros of the game are the music and the art. The art is very unique and engaging. Some areas of the sounds get annoying at times (your character gets winded from running 10 feet and huffs as if they were a 50-year smoker) but it does communicate the atmosphere well.I wouldn't overall recommend it, but I also wouldn't write it off. If you are a overall fan of this style/genre, it's good to kill a couple hours at a cheap price.			"

												Edit: I heard this game cost 100K to produce. For those of you that own the game, is this shocking?Ok I have a lot to say about this game. I like these creepy indie titles - this reminded me of Knock-Knock so I was all about it. Basically, you just roam around a series of rooms trying to find the right way (ultimately this game is quite linear path-wise). Can't find the right way? No problem, just manage to die and the game will start you very close to where you messed up (I was actually thankful for this mechanic many times because I certainly didn't want to repeat the random journey I just took). You roam around until you hopefully find a point where some bizarre little story moment takes place. This is seriously just a series of random nightmares, which leaves little for story room. Nothing *really* makes sense here (I mean we can theorize, but who knows). The art is top notch except a few little glitches (why does a light go on when you turn down a perpendicular hallway? Or why does the shading glitch out when you go through a door? -I look past most of this, but just for noting). Honestly, having the blood being actual color red with everything else black-and-white has also been done a million times before. It was cool the first couple times, but is now just cliche. The music and ambience is certainly creepy, and I am sure is awesome with headphones (I played with a group most of the time). My main problem lies in that there was nothing to figure out. No strategy or puzzle or game really. To be straight I am totally fine if it is just an experience, but this really wasn't that (I love Dear Esther, Gone Home, etc.). I played through to one ending, and only encountered two 'enemy' types that were both lame and frustrating. They were both stock 'walking  towers' that seem to have been added so it had a 'game' element. The running mechanic was also funny because that freakin' kid cannot even run half the length of the screen without weezing for his life lol.Ultimately, I wanted to feel connected to this game - it sure seems like a lot of love and care was put into building it. The whole time I just found myself wandering aimlessly around a house trying to find trigger points for the next cutscene. I think this title is worth $5 but not much more. I may play through to see one more ending, but I will certainly not get 10 or 15 hours (for $10 [on sale]) out of this.			"

												I was drawn to this game initially because of the very unique and interesting art style and the promise of dreamlike logic and storytelling. And, Ironically while I did indeed get both of those things I got nothing else. The gameplay is nearly non existent except for avoiding some very easy to avoid enemies (which is sad considering that the enemies are visually well designed and scary/disturbing) and walking from empty room to empty room which becomes exasperating as you learn that all of the rooms are basically copied and pasted over and over and over again. Puzzles are nearly non-existent and unless you have severe brain damage chances are you wont have to think very hard about any of them. Storyline is probably one of the weakest in any horror game I have played which was dissapointing considering I went through the trouble of getting all the endings because I thought that they may have all been connected only to find that they were not. The game starts with this whole little sister motif that could have been interesting only to derail into completely unrealated stuff about your wife depending on how you played the game and then no matter what ending your going for it just sort of ends suddenly with a ending that had zero build up.  It even comes complete with a ""IT WUS ALL A DREAM!!!"" ending which made me slightly angry at the laziness of it all. I dont get why this game is rated so highly, its not deep or well written, its not a good horror game, and its boring besides a couple choice moments.			"

												Well.. Why do I not recommend this game?TL;DR: It is too expensive for the amound of time spent, mostly walking in one Direction with the occasional change of direction. And it isn't scary. At all.I have played it trough once, and I guess I will play the other endings too, sometime.First, the positive aspects:I like the gamestyle, it is something different.But what kept me playing was the question, whats going on.The Sound and Athmosphere were also really great. The game rarely scared me, but I was often on edge: ""What happens next"", ""If I go there I bet something tries to jump trough the window"", and so on. But only for the first 20minutes or so. Then the Cons shoiwed.Cons:The ""monsters"" - They really don't add a lot to the game, they seemed more like a puzzle to me than a scare, because they really arent scary. They are really, really dumb.The Level Design. Soooo much to walk around! If I had not been hooked by ""whats going on here"" I would have quit.Because at least 60% of the game consisted of walking ""Right"". 30% have been walking ""Up"", ""Down"" and ""Left"". the last 10% where interacting with things, mostly Paintings I still dont get the hang of, what they added to the game, I really have no clue,Not certain if positive or negative: I was almost never really scared. At the beginning there was a lot of anticipation and some really nice scares, building up atmosphere. But after that, it felt as if nothing was happening anymore. And I am one fellow who is easily scared. It took me ages to play trough Amnesia, not having finished a Machine for Pigs yet...But this.. well.. at least I did not had to take a break because I have been scared to death.Wait for the game until it is in a Humblebundle or similar.

												Ok, so there you have the first analisis I wrote about the game the first time I finished it, and at the end my final impressions.First impressions:This has to be a joke. Ok, so the art is great, it's very atmospheric and it has some really creepy moments. But you simply can't sell at this price a game that you can complete in an hour. Yes, it has alternate endings, but it means that you are going to have to play the whole game again, a game that is already very repetitive, only to watch another ending but without any new playable experiences.The game has literally three different kind of hazards and like another three puzzles and that is it.And let me tell you, what is up with that part with the boy in the woods? it seem only there to annoy the player, the boy can't run for more than like five seconds and even running he is incredibly slow, and they make you run through an endless wood chasing your sister.And by the way, all that thing that the developers have been telling about the game being  based on the real experiences of someone who have experienced mental illness, so convenient that his condition involve a mental hospital, a creepy house, and all the oldest horror clichés.Shame on you Infinitap Games.Final impressions: Ok, so now I've completed the hundred per cent and played through all of what the game has to offer, you can check my profile to see that it's true, and that I have spent only three hours to accomplish this, considering that I have had to play to some segments more than once.Here is my conclusion, the game is extremely short and the sceneries and situations are used again and again. Many times, there is not even anything to do, only walk through hallways and hallways, entering rooms that have nothing inside and wait for the jump scares to appear. The game has a few really good moments, but really keep you waiting for more to come, something that gives sense to the whole experience that never comes. The game suffers from a lack of content, especially considering the price. I feel very disappointed, because this game had huge possibilities.			"

												Here is what Neverending Nightmares does well :- Exceptional art style, I love the look of this game- Excellent sound track- Intrigue. I was very curious to learn more about what's going on- AtmosphereHere is what Neverending Nightmares does not do well :- No story or character development at all. This was extremely disappointing- Levels unraveling like on an assembly line making them tediously long and repetitive- Encounters with enemies are trivial at best, they're there just to give a tiny bit amount of a challenge, nothing more- I wasn't motivated in the least to find the different paths to the branching nightmares, the character walks way too slow- OverpricedThe potential was there for a great game. If it had more content, real challenges, a well thought out story, it would be a hit, but this was a huge disappointment for me.I was curious about this game, the art really got my attention, but it fails on everything else. 5$ price would be alright, but not more. Major let down!			"

												I'd LIKE to be able to recommend this game, given the story behind its development, but at the end of the day, the game has to stand on its own merits and I don't think this one does. It's very short, but feels long and drawn-out because the gameplay is both simple and repetitive. There are a few good scares, but if you've watched the trailer, you've pretty much seen them already. In short, the concept feels under-developed and the product feels more like a proof of concept than an actual game, particularly for the pricepoint. In my opinion, give it a whirl - it won't make more than 80min out of your life, but wait until it's at least half off.			"

												Not impressed for the price.  The art style of Edward Gorey incorperated into the game was amazing... it did a good job of setting an atmosphere... beyond that, not much else to say.  You're not really solving a mystery or finding clues, it just seems like a random assortment of common fears: babies, dolls, bears (??), isolation, heavy breathing creepos...etc.  Mazes of sorts for each level drag out gameplay way longer than it has to be.  Not in a scary way of being lost, just kind of boring way of ""guhh are we there yet, Thomas??"".  The different endings was a plus, but there wasn't much of a narrative of what was actually happening. I didn't get any achievements for getting said endings OR completing the ""veins"" in which the endings appear.  I can't even get the achievements for this superslow ink-venture. I am dissapointed to say the least. There are some seriously fun parts in this game that are pretty creative... just maybe not full price worthy.  Wait till this one is on sale, folks.			"

												Gosh darn this game is boring. for the first few minutes its sort of creepy but once you get past the first part (about 3 mins) everything becomes tedious and the atmosphere becomes vapid. Each level is Way too long and stretched out that walking right, which is the only objective, becomes a huge chore. This game is just crossing a hallway with the same two hazards ten times for each level. The whole shtick could have been done well if it was a $1 30 minute game but instead its a incredibly boring 2 hour long trudge to a really anticlimactic ending.			"

												I've unfortunately got to give this a thumbs down.I wanted to like this. I saw it on Kickstarter originally and thought to support it but gave it a pass. The art style is wonderful - kind of a Gorey / Gloom vibe to it. The music is good to adequate. The actual gameplay... well, for the most part, there isn't any. OK, sure, occasionally you'll have to run. Rarely. And you've got awful running ability, being tired out after 6 seconds to stop and rest. And part of my playtime was not realizing a certain enemy couldn't be run from... you're supposed to be quiet, so can't run. But that's it.OK, so what do you have? Unfortunately, you just walk. Slowly. And walk some more. And walk again. The few places you go are resused over and over, so even seeing what you see is not worth it. There's some scary stuff. Mostly it's a lot of gross out material, like showing different roadkill and saying, ""Yup, that's road kill!"" Or a doll with 25 different scary facial features each time. There is no game. If you boiled it down to what you can see the first time and interact with you got maybe a half hour of content. But playing takes hours that seems tedious to wait for the pay off... and there's nothing. No explanation, nothing over the top scary, nothing. And then credits roll.I got this on a huge sale, but I wouldn't pay that price even. This is a free Flash game at best. At the end you'll ask yourself why you spent the time. Don't pay for it on top of that. The art was great. The idea was great. If this was an animated 20 minute short you might watch it and even pay a few bucks. The developer obviously worked on it a lot. It's just not a game.			"

												Edward Gorey.One of my favorite artists.  His dark, gothic style of cartooning has delighted the Victorian in people for years.  Now Neverending Nightmares takes his style and makes a game out of it, and just like Goreys style, in this game there are no good endings.  The controls are basic and functional and don't get in the way of the game... The art, which is THE reason to play this game doesn't quite ring true to Gorey but is very effective in getting the hopless sense of fear and desperation out of the game and into the player.  Only black and white is allowed in the pallette, with occasional visits from other colors... particulary red.  A simple mask of blakc lines over the front of the screen gives the omnipresent drearyness  a real sense of depression.  When a color does pop up the players eyes are immediatly drawn to it.The music fits very well, sound samples are played repeatedly with changes in frequency giving the body of the song rather than pitches or notes.  Whether is a twisted lullaby, or the screams of a lunatic in an asylum every part of this game screams at the player ""Doom!  Death!  Hoplessness! Despair!"" while using a the voice of a soft whisper.If you love dark things, Victorian novels, or are a fan of E. Gorey, you will be delightfully entertained ( and possibly pushed toward suicide ) by this game.			"

												God this was boring as hell!This game is more like a walking simulator than anything else. Problem is, almost no story is told all along. No need to say that this should be the key element of these kind of games. Instead the devs just relied on terribly obnoxious and uninspired game mechanics... After only 30 minutes, I stopped caring about anything that was happening and this became a chore I indulged myself in, because I knew this was a very short experience and I was wondering how this would end (really not very good either). If it wasn't for the interesting artstyle and the pretty alright sound design, I would have stopped right away.Total waste of potential. And considering the asking price of 15 bucks, it's hard to not feel a little bit ripped off.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but it fell far from my expectations.

Also I got to an ENDING AFTER about an HOUR and a HALF which in my opinion is abosutely NOT WORTH the price. There are multiple endings but I just really didn't care to play again. I ended up watching them on youtube and I think they are not worth trying to find them / replaying the game because of them. I waited for this game more than a year, but ended up massively dissapointed. I even kind of wish I could get my money back... sigh.Buy at own risk			"

												I briefly watched a stream by SCXCR of RiverCityGamer (woo hoo, shamelessly self-promotion), and got immediately inspired to purchase the game, especially at the ever inticing 10% off sale.  I sat through the game with a pair of stereo headphones on and I have to say, the two things I immediately loved were the graphics style and the sound design.  I also enjoyed the fact that I'm playing a horror game where I actually feel fairly helpless, forcing me to figure out how each obstacle works and how I can avoid them, as well as be prepared to run the moment I 'hear' something coming.The only major thing that can hinder the experience is the fact that it felt too short.  There isn't a lot of variety and the game is pretty linear but does give you branching paths near the end which can change up the narrative.  Then again, I didn't expect much for a game that is suppose to represent Matt's personal demons, but other than that, I did genuinely enjoy this game. "

												I'll never understand why people think you must finish a game to know you don't like it, but since I've now gone back and slogged my way to a couple endings, here's a new review:If you want to call it expression, I'm there with you.If you want to call it art, well that's all subjective so go ahead.If you want to call it a story, I'm a bit puzzled as it certainly follows no story structure I've ever encountered.If you want to call it a game...well, technically I suppose.But don't call it too short, because there's no possible way repeatedly trudging across familiar but not quite the same screens gets any more entertaining the longer you do it.

												Disclaimer: I know the developer, and am a fan of his work. That said, what's most compelling about the game to me is that it mirrors his own experiences with mental illness:I am channeling very specific imagery from intrusive thoughts that I've suffered from because of my OCD. Intrusive thoughts are these crazy thoughts that your mind comes up with for the sole purpose of upsetting you. In my case, I've struggled with thoughts of violent self-harm. I've actually re-created some of my visions in the game like pulling the vein out of my arm or tearing out an arm bone.What's powerful about games is that they give us the opportunity to experience things we normally can't. And in this case, it's not the result of a group of people sitting around a table thinking, ""What'll scare the player? Hey, and who's ordering pizza?"", but Matt Gilgenbach's interpreting some of what he's actually gone through.			"

												First things first, as you can tell from the screenshots this game is beautiful. It uses an Edward Gorey art style and for the most part it looks great in motion. Too bad that this game is an absolute chore to play. I really hope you like walking left or right, because that is what the gameplay of this game consists of. You will also walk SLOWLY. If you choose to use the run button you will propel yourself forward slightly faster for about 10 seconds before your severely asthmatic character runs out of breathe.So it's a ""walking simulator"". That’s fine, I loved Gone Home and I think games can push the envelope and focus on narrative instead of puzzles and combat. But games in the “walking” genre rely on detailed and interesting environments to make up for their lack of traditional gameplay content. Unfortunately the environments in Neverending Nightmare are made up of a few rooms recycled over and over again and are mostly devoid of anything meaningful to interact with.  This combined with the slow traversal speed makes this game tedious to play.Ultimately this game doesn’t benefit from being interactive and can’t recommend it. "

												I really wanted to like this game. I really did. And I tried my best to fully immerse myself in its dark atmosphere, playing with headphones, taking it slowly and all. It worked well for a few minutes, but then...the game ended. After less than two hours, it was over. And the ending was abrupt, weak and somewhat inconsistent. There are multiple endings, yes, but they are simply determined by which path you (blindly) choose in the last few sections, there are no big puzzles or significant choices to make during the course of the game. And seeing all of the three endings doesn't really make things better. They make everything confusing and nonsensical at first, they become clearer after putting a bit of thought into them, but still you are left with a sense of something missing.Neverending Nightmares is not an awful experience to endure, on the contrary it is filled with undeniable inspiration, but as it is it's a totally rushed and incomplete work. And that saddens me a lot, because it's a terrible waste to see a title with such a beautiful, deeply unsetting visual design and so much narrative potential fail to deliver something up to the expectations. It would have taken so little to make this game really beautiful and worth playing that I really cannot condone the way it's been presented. And it's just a terrible pity. I'm giving my thumb down with the highest reclutance this time, but I have to.			"

												Pros: The music is pretty good, and there were about two points during the entire experience where I thought the scares/images were effectiveCons: Sadly, aside from those two particular times I found all the rest of it to be dull, cliche set dressings on what were essentially empty rooms and hallways. Seriously, 90% of this game is walking down empty hallways that become more and more cluttered with either gore or eyeless dolls. There are other scary things out there, developer! Gore and dolls can be scary, but you kind of drowned the game in them to the point where they no longer have meaning. The plot consists of a few 5-10 second long spoken bits which includes the endings. I get that the developer wanted to leave things ambiguous and let the player draw their own conclusions, but the fact that there is no lore to collect and no narrative whatsoever means the player has literally no reason to move through the game. I wish the developers had put the same amount of effort into making a gripping narrative or lore notes to collect (they're a horror game staple for a reason) or any reason at all to drive players to continue pushing their character down those hallways as they did dressing up the endless, empty rooms with an insane level of detail (sadly most of which is same-y gore and dolls).This game would be hard to recommend as a free flash game. When I finished it and got all the endings I just felt like I had wasted an afternoon and a few bucks.			"

												This game starts out promising. With a fantastic art style and great ambient soundtrack it sucks you in, immerses you in its nightmare horror setting. But soon you realize there isn't much else there.The gameplay basically boils down to blindly walking through spooky rooms and corridors until you reach the end of the nightmare and you wake up in a new slightly different nightmare consisting of more rooms and corridors. Occasionally you meet one of several different types of enemies, each requiring a different strategy to get past, be it hiding in a closet, sneaking past or just running away. Once you figure out how they're easy to avoid. Most rooms are just empty though. The backgrounds look nice and detailed but only very rarely is there something you can actually interact with, and usually it just means a close up view of the object. Every now and then a loud noise will try to startle you, together with spooky or disturbing imagery. It tries to scare you, but personally I was never scared or even startled.Like this it continues for the 1-2 hours it takes to beat, and to be honest it's way too long for how little of interest actually happens. By the end my thumb was tired from having to constantly hold right on the left thumb-stick. That's what you'll be doing 90% of the time, just walking to the right.There is a vague story. A girl died and haunts your dreams. The game drip feeds you some bits and pices of the story throughout the game but mostly leaves you with no story developement until your reach the very end of the game where you might find out what really happened, or not, based on a couple of branching paths in the game. Fortunately there is a ""nightmare select"" menu so you can go back to these branches and choose a different path if you wish.Bottom line, it's a game with a nice art style, good sountrack and atmosphere. But it fails in the gameplay and story department. It might be worth getting at a discout but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												Neverending Nightmares has a remarkable art style that can pull off both unsettling and innocent, but a great art style doesn't make a great game, and particularly not a great ""horror"" game. The game does have a foreboding atmosphere, I suppose, but at a certain point in the first half hour of play, you develop a rhythm to the game play. Your character has asthma, so can run in only EXTREMELY short bursts. This is not developed or particularly meaningful in a story context, so it honestly feels like a ploy by the developer to make you uncomfortable. You don't want to run ever because what if you need it when an enemy appears??It's an interesting premise, and it works well....for 10 minutes. After that point you know when the ""horror"" will appear. You are no longer engrossed in the atmosphere and the grotesque art. You are simply walking. And that walking lasts a LONG time. It feels as if the developer believed that uncertainty as to the incoming danger would last throughout the whole 2-3 hour experience. It does not, and as a result, the tediousness of walking and never running just bothered me, quite frankly. Was the art phenomenal? Yes! Was the game enjoyable? I suppose for a bit. Do I recommend it? Unfortunately not; it just doesn't do enough of interest to me to recommend.			"

I can feel the love that the creators have put in Neverending Nightmares, it could be a nice, solid indie horror game. It is a little disturbing in the begining, but it gets frustratingly slow and boring.Maybe it's just not my cup of tea, i realy don't know.			"

												This game should be called Neverending Jump Scares and Walking. Seriously, all you do in this game is walk, very slowly I might add, and trigger jump scares. The devs added the capability to run but your character can't run more than 10 sec so I guess he's asthmatic.This game is clearly a personal message from the dev on something happening in his life but that's all it should be, a message, write in a journal and don't make games dude. This is hardly a game but more of a short story and it's not told very well either. I'm glad I got this in a Humble Bundle because I'd be furious if I spent $15 bucks on this. Actually, I'd be upset spending $5.Good:-Artwork is fantastic! I really loved the pen and ink feel. The black and white set a very good creepy tone and matched well with the story and setting.-Music and audio matched up well with everything and felt original for horror music.-I enjoyed the creature interactions and really liked killing my character off just to see what happens.Bad:-At times the artwork was so overwhelming with so many lines especially in the forest. There was nothing creepy about the forest walking scene because I was so frustrated at how long it took to get through WAY TOO MUCH WALKING and how busy the artwork was.-Boring story. I get the story, I understand it, it was just boring. The characters weren't interesting and the endings were dull.-TOO MUCH WALKING! Unless I can get something added to the story or some intersting scenes from walking away from the main objective then don't let me walk there. Out of all the cells you could peek into, only one did anything, and that was a very predictable jump scare. If exploration doesn't do anything then stop letting us explore. As a player I expect to find something when I go somewhere, but in this game you don't see anything unless you go towards the main objectives. It's like having a game where the very last room out of 100 has a boss fight but the game lets you enter all other rooms 1-99 but they are empty. What's the point?TL;DRI'd give the game a 4 out of 10. It's not something I'd reccomend to anybody unless they simply like original stories regardless of quality.			"

												Full disclosure: I was Kickstarter backer. I'm going to remain as unbiased as possible during this review, but it's more likely that not that I'll have a LITTLE bit more buy-in than others and this might taint my opinion. I originally backed this project because I loved the art style as well as the commitment towards building something that didn't rely completely on jumpscares (I'm looking at you, Amnesia, Outlast, etc.). I'm seeing a lot of people saying that the ambience ""doesn't build to anything"". That it's too short and too linear. While I'll say that they're completely correct, it was the journey, not the destination. I thoroughly enjoyed the art style as it's used to great effect. As someone who grew up with ""In a Dark, Dark Room"", this nailed the look. The added frosting was the sound direction, which is nothing short of amazing. Pants turn to gasps. Gasps turn to wheezing. Wheezing gives way to helplessness. Music sets the tone of neverending dread. Some could argue that the cost doesn't justify the experience, but I disagree. I believe my Kickstarter funds went towards the exact game that was delivered. I don't regret backing this project one bit. I could complain about using the ""psych ward"" cliche as a means to deliver narrative, or that there was no real skill involved with beating the game, but that's not the purpose of the game. It's not here to make you reevaluate your life; it's here to be a nice, scary haunted house. A short ride that reminds you why you like scary things to begin with.It's good. Is it $15 good? I would say so, but I'm a lone voice. If you're looking for the next Amnesia, or you're looking for something you can play over and over again for long durations, move along. If you're looking for a nice experience of dread and can part with your $15, you could certainly do much worse.			"

												Stylized, creepy and short and MUST be played with both headphones and a game pad with vibration.  Missing either of the latter two will cause you to lose a good 50% of the atmosphere.  Great for Edward Gorey fans.The game's strengths lie in atmosphere, sound setup and visual style, all of which are very strong.  It also does some rather clever things with checkpoints in a way that is not clear until you've gotten more familiar with the game.  It's weaknesses lie in the limited experiences offered.  The game could have been more, and one enemy in particular adds an obnoxious game mechanic which is initially clever and then very tedious.  It also fails to provide any really satisfying endings.  Finally, it's got very little replayability as once you've gotten all the endings there's little reason to return except after a long abscence after you've forgotten the pitfalls.Your enjoyment of Neverinding Nightmares will largely depend on what you look for in a horror game.  Thankfully Slendy -- who showed up in the demo -- is removed from the final version.If you're the kind of person who enjoys being creeped out, this does a pretty good job.  This isn't a game played for depth, but it does an excellent job with providing a unique experience your first time through.  If the art style doesn't do much for you, chances are the rest of the game won't.  If you enjoy Creepypasta however, this might be up your alley.Warning for those squeamish about blood and gore: some paths are pretty nasty from an imagery standpoint.Is it worth the price tag?  Depends on how much you value atmosphere.  I don't regret purchasing it, but others might not be as satisfied.  It's definitely something to get if you enjoy Edward Gorey stuff.  I would advise AGAINST looking at a Let's Play of it until after you've experienced most of what it has to offer as it will basically spoil the entire experience.			"

												Neverending Nightmares isn't so much a game, as it is an odd bit of art.  The stylized graphics and Victorian setting charmed me from the get-go.  For the past two years at PAX, this game has managed to catch my eye, even through the massive sensory overload brought on by the myriad of other games screaming for attention.  Suffice to say, it has been on my radar for a while.Did it live up to my expectations?  Mostly.  The real strength of the game is its ambiance.  It absolutely must be played alone in a dark room, headphones cranked, with controller vibrations enabled.  The creepy music and sound effects blend smoothly with the visuals, first creating a sense of unease, which gradually ramps up to dread with a dash of ""oh holy ♥♥♥♥ing hell that's disgusting.""  The jump scares are definitely a big part of it, but far-between enough that they don't lose their effectiveness.  But back to my original point--it's really not much of a game.  I'm not sure what I was expecting.  Having played the demo, I suppose I thought it was going to be a puzzler.  Explore hallway, find candle.  Explore dark hallway, find axe.  Open blocked path, continue.  And on, and on.  I was kind of hoping for a horror-themed Myst.  Instead, you will spend the vast majority of your playtime creeping slowly through a (more or less) linear path, building tension for the next gruesome cutscene.   Objects that you can interact with are sparse, which is disappointing in such richly detailed environments.  It made it all the more confusing when there were special ""interactable"" gold-framed portraits scattered throughout the game.  It took me a while to realize that these weren't some sort of puzzle element, but rather rewards for people who contributed a certain amount to the kickstarter.In short, this is interactive artwork, depicting a spiraling descent into madness inspired by the developer's own struggle with mental illness.  As a game, it's not exactly what I had thought it would be, but it was an enjoyable way to spend a few hours.			"

												My first exposure to this game was a Let's Play by Lotus Prince.  At first glance, this game could easily be dismissed as not scary.  It certaintly doesn't look like a lot of the modern horror games.Do not let quick impressions fool you, this game is a wonderfully creepy, scary and just disturbing game.This is definetly a game to play with headphones if you can, the sound design is amazing.  Not only is there a mix of unsettling music, there is also plenty of background sounds that really start to get to you the longer you play.This is also a game to play in big chunks, the more breaks you take, the more the atmosphere is broken.  If possible, try and play through to a finished path in one sitting.I've currently gotten all three endings and I won't share any of the details here.One of the strengths of this game is there is very little to interact with.  Too often horror games have you working on finding puzzle clues or weapons or health items.  This game you are limited what you can interact with.  The lack of busy work really helps draw you into the surroundings, and you'll find things in areas you thought weren't scary yet, slowly starting to disturb you greatly.It also makes what you CAN interact with, and see more clearly, have that much more impact.Yes, there are a few moments of jump scares, but this game is a lot more about the nature of being trapped in this nightmare, where you keep thinking you're waking up and escaping, and you're not.Yes, I was one of the late backers after this game was fully funded and started to play when the Beta was available.  That doesn't make my review or praise for this game any less.  Hell it was seeing the Let's Play that made me want to help be a backer and be a part of this game.This game has many moments where the sudden disturbing imagery made me turn away, though nothing in the realm of going too far.  Honestly some moments in this game reminded me of nightmares I've had myself, which only added to how emersed I was.Also, do not seek a strategy guide, you'll figure out all the branches eventually.  Let youself find them alone, it's a much better story that way.It took me a few times through some areas to figure out how to get the different branch, which helped the game feel very worth the price.If you like to be scared by more than gore and things jumping out at you, this is game is definetly worth a try.

												Great atmosphere, music, artistic design, etc. If you are a fan of horror, indie games, artistic games, and just want to try something new. You really owe it to yourself to get this game. I'm going to do a little bit of spoiling from here on out, so stop reading if that sort of thing makes you mad.Ok, hopefully those who don't mind spoiling are still reading at this point. I was originally going to complain a little about this game, at ~$15 it became more expensive than going to a movie. One of the things I appreciate most about video games is from a time vs. money investment usually they make up for their higher price. A first run through of this game took me about 90 minutes. Making this slightly more expensive than a movie. But then as I looked around the menus I discovered there are multiple endings and paths you can take. Giving the game some replayability and making it now worth more than a movie. I'm not sure if you could see the multiple paths before you beat the game the first time (I didn't check) hence the spoiler notice before. So yeah, all in all a really good little game. I'm excited to see what else the team comes up with.-Bors			"

												I enjoyed playing this game for the first time.  I intentionally avoided playing the betas, but I did play the kickstarter demo.I found this game very interesting as it it clearly focused on the creep and scare factor.  There were only a few spots that took some some more serious ""gamer attention"" to get past.  I actually enjoyed how when I made it past a part, it was not going to have to be repeated if I failed the next.There are some very thoughtful aspects to the game.  It was rather calculated in making the player feel safe at certain stages of play only to turn it upside later for a scare.  I feel there was a lot of effort on this aspect as there are plenty of ""walk through parts"" which were part of building suspense.The art style is what drew me to the game initially, as it is not a naturally scary style in the first place.  Hence it is a real challenge to make it scary.   However, I will say that the musical score is absolutely spot on and adds a tremendous amount to the game.My main con for the game is that it could be longer.I would recommend this game.  In fact I have, but unfortunately it was too scary for all of them.			"

Posted: September 29, 2014
												Let me get the general ruling out of the way first: this is a great game from a new and promising voice in the indie horror game scene. It tries new things and often does things by its own rules, and it does this effectively, while also following in the footsteps of tried and true horror classics. It's not for everyone, but fans of personal, artistic, exploratory games as well as fans of atmospheric horror games (as opposed to action/survival-based horror) should buy, enjoy, and support it.That said, the game is not without its flaws, and a number of them have to do with pacing.Hallways sometimes seem to go on a touch too long without much happening. It's a strange feeling, getting *bored* by a horror game. Luckily, several times I thought maybe I was started to get bored, something terrifically terrifying would happen and put my♥♥♥♥♥right back on the edge of my seat where it belonged. Perhaps these moments would not have been as effective without the moments of calm, but I feel that the game would have been *more*, not less, effective if a few of the rooms or hallways would have been cut.That's not to say that all of the ""pointless"" rooms should be cut. It's kind of wonderful to be walking down what seems like a cookie-cutter hallway, enter a side-room, and find some new, unexpected, grotesque scene that, while serving no clear ludic function, ramps up the chills significantly and sinisterly.By the end of the game, though, the player will likely become a little desensitized to blood and guts intended to convey scenes of horror. At the beginning, the bright sight of red blood against the beautifully pencilled black and white is a shock and reminds us that not all is well in this mansion. By the end of the game, there seems to be more red than white at times, and it becomes just another part of the macabre scenery.Don't get me wrong, though; throughout the game, the gore is often used to wonderful effect, throwing guts in our face when we least expect it. While I'm not usually a fan of cheap jump-scares, this game does have a few, and they don't at all feel cheap. In fact, I think each and every one was greatly executed.The art, overall, is quite nice. The way the seemingly-hand-drawn shadows scribbled their way over the light is a very cool effect and works well in the nightmarish context. The set-pieces and enemies in particular have frightening designs, especially as the game descends deeper into madness. One enemy, though, just wasn't particularly scary or fun to deal with. Luckily it doesn't show up very often, but a few of its behaviors seemed to be a bit out of place with the rest of the games. While another, later enemy hit the sense of adolescent terror just right, this one was more obnoxious and almost silly. Other than the one, though, the enemies overall were extremely effective from both a gameplay and horror perspective.The sound design and music are quite lovely, if you can call it that... aside from a few background ambience that sounds like someone doing an impression of a tortured Droopy Dog. I appreciated the way the music would evolve over the course of the different nightmares and a ""new"" nightmare's beginning would be indicated by a shift in the music as much as the narrative.The endings (the two of three that I've played, at least), while narratively intriguing in their own rights, seem to happen just a tad too quickly and feel like they lack the weight I think they deserve. With this kind of short game I don't feel necessarily like *closure* is what's needed, but the credits seemed to start rolling quite quickly and suddenly, as if someone came into a movie theatre after the last words had been spoken and hurried the audience out so they could make room for the next group or something. That said, I like that the endings don't necessarily agree with each other. They all come from the same background, but come to different conclusions of varying depth that indicate what's **really** going on here, and I think that was a smart and cool decision.Overall, there's a lot to praise in this game. It's at its best when it embraces nightmarish weirdness to try to throw the player off track, changing placement of rooms and playing with expectations. The lead developer, Matt Gilgenbach, has referenced *Metal Gear Solid* and *Silent Hill* as influences, and in this way they both shine through, but without becoming overbearing. If there's an ultimate takeaway, it should be that this game is a unique experience that I highly recommend. Also, supporting this game means supporting future titles from the developer, and personally I'm *very* excited to see what Gilgenbach and Infinitap does next.			"

												Make no mistake; this is a psychologycal horror game in the truest sense - It's a game that through it's main gameplay loop (an endless awakening into another nightmare) explores the developer's daily struggles of OCD as well as intrusive thoughts. It's all presented in an Edward Gorey-like artstyle, that also brings to mind the works of Edgar Allan Poe. Even more intriguing than it's artstyle is the absolutely fantastic sound design which consantly keeps the player tense for the horrors to come. Is this the scariest horror game I've ever played? Well, no. But like the best games in the psychological horror genre it focuses on being thoroughly unsettling throughout - a feeling that intensifies upon reflecting on the real life mental struggles that inspired it. Common complaints target the game's short length and the lack of player interaction - but to me these miss the point. The game should be judged by the emotional journey it takes the player through, not by some commercial formula of ""X hours of gameplay for Y amount of money"". To me this is a great game, and the few complaints I do have - i.e. some of the character animations, lip-syncing - are likely to be addressed through updates, and don't detract from the raw human emotion and pain conveyed through the experience. Two thumbs up.			"

It may be a little...abstract in the story but overall the game is definately worth a playthrough.The atmosphere is spot-on, leaving me at the edge of my seat nearly the entire game. It reminded me of my first playthrough of Silent Hill 2. The music is great and the visuals are unique and very cool. The color scheme makes the things in color just pop out at you. Some may argue that the game is short but, if you want all the endings (which, having gotten all 3, i recommend getting them all for the story) it'll take around 3 hours, but it was an amazing 3 hours I spent feeling tense and scared.

												This game is the definition of style over substance. I was really looking forward to playing this game, and the creater seems like he really worked hard and wanted to make something people loved, but sadly there is just nothing here.  I feel bad for him because based on his Kickstarter updates, he comes off as very insecure about his work and this probably wont help.The game consists of walking around aimlessly, usually around the same area many times until the game decides to let you advance. The environment changes the more you walk around and eventually a staircase opens up to let you to the next area. The idea being you're losing your grip on reality I'm assuming, but it's just horribly boring and not scary at all. Other than it's awesome pen and paper art style it has nothing to offer. If you want a scary game where you walk around play Outlast if you want a game that has a unique style without sacraficing gameplay then play Limbo.			"

												I knew i wanted this game the minute i saw it, the art style was amazeing and i knew by reading the description that it would be a game that wasnt really a game so much as a experience you can guide the main character thru and thus be completley emursed in his never ending nightmare. The soundtrack is also so spooky and strange yet so haunting that i couldnt stop listining to it. After completing the game with all possible endings ive played it a bunch more times after that to simply take it all in again. I would reccomend this to anyone who loves the macabre and who doesnt care about the fact theres no way to kill the things that stalk you, you have to look the horror in the face and at times walk almost hand in hand with it.

												Don't get me wrong... The game is not bad. It has unique style as you can see. It just... isn't as scary as I hope when I saw the promotional video; a few jump scare, too few and too easy puzzles (seriously. I'm NOT smart when I say it's easy it really is.) There is no twist in the storyline where, I think, should be... Put it bluntly, It's too blunt. Again, not a bad game to spend time with in one lazy day. Just... if asked about a horror game, I'll have pointed in other direction.			"

												I know this game is called ""neverending nightmares"" but god do these nightmares get repetitive quickly. I absolutely loved the art style and the tension it builds in the first 10 minutes of the game. But at 1,5 hours, this game is an hour too long. It's all style and no substance.			"

												I was drawn towards this game due to its somewhat unique art style and minimal UI but met mostly disappointment. It's a cliché horror narrative in the form of a pretty dull and linear exploration game punctuated with immersion breaking ""quick, hide in the wardrobe!"" and ""walk slowly past the monster"" events. Oh, and jumpscares, of course. Details:

												Ugh, I do wish there were other options besides ""Yes"" and ""No"".  Cuz this game would get a ""probably not"" from me.This game is decent, but it's just not good enough for me to recommend it to people.  I'm not going to bother going over what the game is about since you can see it from the trailers and description in Steam.So the pros:* Very interesting art style.  I actually thought it was very neat.* Some pretty effective freak-out moments (this will also be in the cons; it'll be explained)* Interesting progression.* Pretty interesting base story, though the reveal was a bit anti climactic.Cons* Repetitive.  I get it's supposed to be, but it started to get to me a little bit because of the next point* Thomas is the most out of shape, slowest person ever.   He has two modes.  Walk (where he walks slowly) and ""Run"" (where he looks like he's running but he's walking at slightly faster than our normal walking speed).  Not only that, but if you ""run"" even just one step, Thomas starts breathing heavily.  Look at your bedroom right now.  Imagine running from one side to the other.  Thomas will take 5x longer than you and he'll be out of breath.  This is what makes it repetitive.  Because you have to go through very similar rooms over and over you want to get thru them fast if there's nothing interesting in them.  But he walks so slowly and gets out of breath so quickly it gets annoying.* Not only that, but apparently running even just one step is like the loudest thing ever.  Like I'm running in a long hallway because it's a long hallway and all of the sudden I hear a noise and the blind crazy dudes come running out of no where and pounces on me to kill me.  Great.  The way this SHOULD be done is if you run and the crazy dude is on screen at all they should make a noise and run in your direction.  If you stop, they should stop and look around unless you're with in a certain distance from them.  But no, they can not be anywhere on screen and if you run a single step, they'll come a'runnin'.* There was one part of the game where it was actually impossible.  I died about 15x because they blocked off the entire hallway except one small area.  They had a blind crazy man patrol the area.  He started where it was blocked off and ended where it was blocked off.  After about 15 deaths, the guy finally spawned in the place where I think he was supposed to (he wasn't patrolling the bottleneck anymore).* The big babies were fairly absurd.  In Amnesia and Outlast if you try to hide while the guy is right next to you, they obviously know where you are and will grab you.  In this game, you can jump into a cabinet while the guy is right next to you and they'll get confused.  Really?* Many of the scares are of the ""jump scare"" persuasion.  That means sudden image accompanied by a loud noise.  Yes, it makes you jump, but IMO it's a very cheap way of getting a scare.			"

												If you're thinking about buying this game, stop it right now and find something else. I'm going to go into full spoiler detail here so if you for some reason still want this 'game' then stop reading and understand it's your own fault for making such a poor choice with you money.Now spoiler alert, the game is walking to te end of a hallway several times in which if you see a door above you don't wory that's either an empty room or just a checkpoint room. Now you might ask what do you need checkpoints for? The insta kill enemies (which there are only three kinds of) which are all just a slight variation on the oh so amazing gameplay stratgey of walking around them slowly. I say walking because the dev team decieded to not just remove the run feature but cripple it to the point that I would suggest just never using it. There's no punishment for not running either, it's just how long you want to waste walking through halls with nothing to see. Also any 'scares' the team added were something you were thinking about an hour before they did it. Oh look some windows I hope nothing appears while I'm walki-Oh hello jumpscare good to see you again FOR EVERY SINGLE WINDOW I WALK PAST. The story is nill, you get the impression your sister died when you were young and you're stricken with grief because you promised to keep her safe and that makes you crazy or whatever so you're locked up in a looney bin. I can't stress this enough that there is no game here, the first minute of gameplay is repeated without change until you finish the game. I've played games free flash games with more anything really. Also I'm sorry but the visual style isn't nearly as cool as they thought it was, it turns any scene into a laughable mess.TL;DR This isn't a game, and you shouldn't waste your money on it. "

												waste of time. All you do is walk right for hours through repetitive levels. I wouldnt mind this if they actually showed us something interesting, but they really didn't. Just a bunch of spooky dolls and the occasional easily outsmarted enemy. The only thing the game had going for it was its mood. No good gameplay mechanics, and no good story content. The environments really weren't that interesting. They should have either made it a much shorter game, or added more content to the levels.			"

First playthrough time: 2 hoursAll endings play time: 3.5 hours totalMajor Pros:Great sound and musicMultiple endings and story paths allow for replayability and story map easily lets you hop to the part you want to playGood use of some traditional horror themes and restricted vision levelsMinor Pros:Interesting art and color useagePleasant eerie elements background elements give the place a haunted feel, but could've been used more""Jump scares"" not overusedMajor Cons:90% of the time you don't need to go in any of the rooms other than the one at the end of the hallwaySome early monsters feel repetitive while others make it feel like an action game (later monsters were much better)A fair amount of the game is walking through uninteractive sceneryMinor Cons:The color-bordered pleasant pictures on the walls detract from the creepy atmosphereStory is a little unclear and might leave player feeling like they still have questionsI found the game very interesting and really liked the art. The different levels and parts of the story, especially with the different endings, were very enjoyable. My favorite level is probably when the dolls start coming to life because I felt it gave the player the right amount of anticipation when traveling between rooms. I think the game struggled a little with ""empty rooms"" where the player is just trying to get to the next hallway. While ""empty space"" is necessary so the player doesn't always expect something to happen in every room, I think there was perhaps a little too much here and it can draw the player out of the horror feel if nothing's happening. Never the less I enjoyed the game and played through all 4 story paths for the 3 different endings.			"

												The game is fun and creepy. You play with goose bumps the whole time. You have to have patience and a sense of adventure for the journey this game will take you through. I died so many different ways its definately worth buying.I never knew black and white art could be so captivating. I love the art and the music makes it come alive. Playing with headphones on is a must and gives you the total experince of this game.I find most horror games to be overly gory so much that it starts to not be so significant. With this game the mood and atmosphere is progressive to where you finally have to stop look around and take it all in at each phase. It is true horror the way it pulls you in deeper and deeper with feelings of delusion, and the sense of being trapped in a Never Ending Nightmare.			"

												This is an interesting game that provides some chilling moments during play.  The story of Thomas Smith, while simple, pretty much makes you think a little, maybe even make your own conspiracy theories.  Both the atmosphere and the sounds give you a chill, and I'm impressed that the game manages to spook you without the use of the over-used jump scare.  There are a few problems, though.  You can finish one of the story modes in no time, I say about 45 minutes to a hour tops, so you might complete the whole game, if not collect all four achievements, with 4-5 hours.  Also, whatever enemies there are in the game aren't the scariest things ever.  You can easily get past them with the most obvious way possible.  Only thing that could make getting past the enemies more obvious was to put in neon signs, and the ones that chase you will give you at least a little bit of a problem.  That being said though, the reason why people play horror games is to get scared, and in that regard, I think it does a good job.  If you're looking for cheap jump scares, like most indie horror games do unfortunately, then this is not the game for you.  Otherwise, this is a game worth experiencing, though the length might effect how much it's worth.			"

												This game is extremely atmospheric. While the graphical style is very interesting, what moved me most was the extremely creepy (and intensifying) music as well as the excellent sound assets. However, there is something you definitely need to know: The game is short. Even with branching paths the game only takes a few hours to finish. And it must be said that there is relatively little replayability once all the branches have been unlocked and all the levels played. In light of that, the price point might be an issue for you, so you might want to wait for a sale if you don't mind the wait. However, it's less of an issue if you think of it like a movie in the cinema. A couple hours worth of entertainment for a few bucks, but I can certainly understand if you want to wait for the DVD release to keep the metaphor going. If you pick it up, though, make sure to get the full cinematic experience: Darkened room and headphones. Use a gamepad with rumble if you have it for smoother controls and more feedback. Overall a very enjoyable if short ride.			"

												For horror fans who want something besides typical jumpscares. I'm sure those familiar with atmospheric horror games, like Silent Hill will find shared ground with Neverending Nightmares.Neverending Nightmares is about the mind of Thomas and his love for his sister, Gabrielle. In nightmares, or as I'd call this more a night-terror, people who are close to us tend to take the brute of the darkness. This ""Edward Gorey"" styled game is all about immersing yourself inside this bleak nightmare and the sound makes a huge part of that, so headphones is recommended (and turn off the lights and play it by yourself for more intense effects). As the nightmare continues, you make choices that can alter where the horror takes you. For better or worse, the choice is yours to make. And don't worry, if you thought that nothing was after you in this game, you are sorely mistaken. I won't divulge exactly WHAT is coming for you, but use your imagination. But I do warn the faint of heart, there are cringing moments and disturbing scenes, not quite on par with Saw, but gets close with its self mutliations and morbid topics like suicide.If you're not paranoid, jumpy, tense, nervous when playing this game, you're probably playing it wrong or it's not your cup of tea.Now that those remarks are done. My thoughts. I must say wait for a sale on this game, in my opinion, for as little content as there is in this, it's not worth the $15 price tag. Cut off $5 and I think that would be reasonable. The game offers very little as far as replayability, so if you like your Amnesia custom stories, might want to look elsewhere. I've spent almost 90-120 minutes on this game and I've completed everything. Granted, I've been a little spoiled and I was playing it wrong for much of that time. Which is why I say to savor this and play it like you WANT to be scared. Creeping along dark hallways with nothing but a candle to keep you away from the shadows and unerving sounds makes a very tense and slow moving pace. Afraid that if you run, you might run into something you won't be able to escape or hear coming over your own breathing and footsteps. This game sets a great atmosphere for those willing to take the steps and immerse themselves into it. If you feel like you're lost, just keep walking. The labyrinth of the mind is very easy to get turned around in, so just keep pressing on and you'll head in the right direction in this game.Closing remarks, the game is great for those willing to dive into the atmosphere. For those requiring more action and jumpscares, look elsewhere. Bring the price to $10 and I'd definitely recommend buying it. Perhaps if they added in some other endings, this game could have some more replayability.			"

												I'd be very surprised if you can get through this game without jumping a few times. The art is fantastic and I'd say the game's imagery is the whole point of the game. Don't expect an action/adventure. IMO the principal objective of the game is to reveal and perhaps approach the dark thoughts/feelings hiding in our waking/sleeping lives.Playing has been a good experience.			"

												The subconscious can be a truly dark and frightening place and Neverending Nightmares propels this notion to the forefront. You play as Thomas, seemingly forever stuck in a perpetual nightmare/sleep state. He dreams in black and white, he dreams of death and murder. Creepy broken dolls lay strewn within the walls of his home. He dreams of monochrome tombstones and blood stained asylum walls. But...is he really dreaming? The game forces us to accept dread, fear and vulnerability. Thomas cannot wield weapons, he can't fight. All he (or you) can do is survive. The gameplay mechanics are very straighforward. Directions, sprint and an interact button. That is all. But do not take this simplicity for inadequacy. The game is very unsettling. The scares are very well crafted and will make you think before making your next move. There are equal parts subtle and obvious scares. Neverending Nightmares is an exercise in psychological horror, throwing you in between worlds and catching you off guard in the process. Cheap jumscares are a thing of the past and Neverending Nightmare gets my vote for progressive horror gaming.If you're looking for a different kind of horror, the kind of horror that is deep rooted within your subconscious, then this is the game for you. My only regret? Not playing this in online mode, so now I have no achievements. But that's ok because in my opinion Neverending Nightmare has a high replay value and three different endings to keep you entertained (and afraid).If you'd like to see my take on this brilliant game, go here :

												A solid, creepy horror game. The art style is distinctly inspired by Edward Gorey, and works well for the Victorian era home and asylums the player character must chart a sometimes uncertain, often dreamlike, though mostly linear path through. Some minor branching is present, though I have not explored the alternates. The sound design is excellent, with competent voice acting, the ambient sound, effects, and music do wonders for instilling a creepy vibe throughout the experience. Gameplay is fairly shallow, with the player rarely having to do more than continue walking in a single direction, continuing on in spite of the sometimes suffocating atmosphere of dread.Enjoyed the game, but your mileage may vary.

												The game is based on great premises and with a beautiful art direction, but the final product is more pretentious than original. The gradual descent into madness of the main charachter is sometimes terrifying, but more often quite boring, and the few elements of gameplay are a bit too primitive and very repetitive. Not for everyone, definitely not for me.			"

												Evening Everyone,I got this game long ago, and I gave it a shot today. I don't regret it - except for the nightmare-inducing creepy-spooky-scary parts. :DSo. The control is good and easy, you only have to either walk on or sprint for a limited time.Graphically I found it artistic and very expressive! I love how the horrific parts are colourful and intense, not to mention that this gray-scaled black-and-white graphics make you feel nervous and uneasy right from the beginning.This game is creepy as hell, if this is what OCD and depression feels like, then I guess the creators nailed it right! I suffered in depression not once in my life and it does feel like a neverending nightmare sometimes....Storywise the game is... vague. It's up to you what to believe about Thomas and Gabrielle. :)In a nutshell: if you're a horror fan, buy it immediately! If you're a light-spirited like myself, but wanna give a shot to the horror genre, this game is for you. :)			"

												2/101. Despite what people say, this game is first and for most a ""walking simulator"".2. There is no horror in this game. If there is any, this game ends up killing any tension by making you walk in circles non-stop.3. There are random religionreferences in this game. Nothing against the creator and I'm sure theres alot of symbolism which I didn't understand, but, lets be serious, RELIGION and HORROR do not mix.I'm pretty sure that the game maker had good intentions behind this game, but personally I don't think its fun. Thus, my reccomendation is that at $15 DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It is mostly a worthless peice of crap for that price.			"

												The game is fun and creepy. You play with goose bumps the whole time. You have to have patience and a sense of adventure for the journey this game will take you through. I died so many different ways its definately worth buying.I never knew black and white art could be so captivating. I love the art and the music makes it come alive. Playing with headphones on is a must and gives you the total experince of this game.I find most horror games to be overly gory so much that it starts to not be so significant. With this game the mood and atmosphere is progressive to where you finally have to stop look around and take it all in at each phase. It is true horror the way it pulls you in deeper and deeper with feelings of delusion, and the sense of being trapped in a Never Ending Nightmare.			"

												Enjoyed the atmosphere in this game. It's not all about jump scares, (not saying there aren't any!) it's the overall mood around the game that makes it feel so special. You have this constant feeling of what could happen at any given moment, and you don't know when it's going occur. My only dissapointment with this game was how quick it went by. I'm aware there are multiple endings, but I couldn't help to feel that there was more I was expecting right when I had encountered an ending. It felt like I was only playing a demo. I still have two more ending to complete, but if it's anything that'd be really exciting would be an update filled with more nightmares to explore. All in all, I really enjoyed this game. It's not your typical horror game. Gameplay isn't groundbreaking, but the artwork is breathtaking! It's worth giving a try, just note that it goes quick, so maybe do it in increments.			"

												I was one of the Kickstarter backers for this game, having fallen in love with the initial concept and the teaser trailer. A psychological horror game inspired by the experiences of a man suffering from his own very personal, genuine psychological horror? Count me in. As both a lover of horror and as someone who is fascinated by what makes other people tick, this game seemed a sure-fire hit (to me).Does is succeed? Sort of. I'm giving this a thumbs-up because I feel emotionally attached to it as both a backer and a horror enthusiast, but I can't say I wasn't a bit let down. There is very little gameplay to speak of - minor stealth sections are fine, but they grow repetitive quickly. I don't want to write this off as a walking simulator, because 1) I hate that term, and 2) I love walking simulators (Dear Esther, to me, is a stunning work of art). However, there just isn't all that much to this game. Keep walking right. Look at another portrait. Go into another empty room. Wake up in a different bed. Walk right again. Meh.The best part is the atmosphere. The soundscape is truly stunning. Play this game with headphones, please. I've haven't heard audio this precise and well-designed since the original Thief games. And the visual style is simply gorgeous.I love thte idea of multiple endings, but slogging through the same corridors three times again to find them all was too much.Buy it, play once for the phenomenal atmosphere and a few good scares, but don't expect too much from it.

												I havent gotten to the last ending yet (tried two times and got fed up, lol) but I've basically played most of it.This game, has EXCELLENT atmosphere. Its subtly creeepy, so little so that you can actually play this alone in the house, but at the same time, so much so that you'd wish someone was hugging you while you played.  While there are jumpscares scattered, its not very much and most of the times, the thing to suffice spooking you would be the atmosphere. Which may get old after a while.The storyline on the other hand.From the start, you don't learn much about what the eff is going on. All you know is that your Thomas, and your supposed to just walk walk walk. and find out things. It does sort of draw you in, but I should say that the two endings I've experienced so far were quite a let down. They were effective, short, and they made sense, but, it still was a letdown.Gameplay itself is repetitive, you're just walking and there are a set number of ""enemies"" which you mostly avoid in two ways. Setting of scenes mostly follow the nightmare you happen to be playing. It's sort of otherwordly, but not otherwordly enough such that you'd be staring at the art with awe. (Im guessing Silent Hill would be where the art makes you stare like woah wtf) But the cutscenes really make yu go woah wtf (because seriously... wtf is going on) and some of the scenes (related to the jumpscares) do make you go WTF as well.Would I reccomend you to buy it? When it's on sale. But for a 'cash strapped' 18 year old, do I regret my purchase? nope.			"

												This is an interesting game that provides some chilling moments during play.  The story of Thomas Smith, while simple, pretty much makes you think a little, maybe even make your own conspiracy theories.  Both the atmosphere and the sounds give you a chill, and I'm impressed that the game manages to spook you without the use of the over-used jump scare.  There are a few problems, though.  You can finish one of the story modes in no time, I say about 45 minutes to a hour tops, so you might complete the whole game, if not collect all four achievements, with 4-5 hours.  Also, whatever enemies there are in the game aren't the scariest things ever.  You can easily get past them with the most obvious way possible.  Only thing that could make getting past the enemies more obvious was to put in neon signs, and the ones that chase you will give you at least a little bit of a problem.  That being said though, the reason why people play horror games is to get scared, and in that regard, I think it does a good job.  If you're looking for cheap jump scares, like most indie horror games do unfortunately, then this is not the game for you.  Otherwise, this is a game worth experiencing, though the length might effect how much it's worth.			"

												Very short game, it has multiple endings, with the paths leading up to them being different, so I would reccomend going back through after beating it the first time.  Besides the length of the game, the artystlye, themes, and all around spookyness are done pretty well.  As for the downsides, it seems as though you walk through many of the same hallways over and over, just for extra padding for the game.  Also, the gameplay is very minimal, with the game being more akin to a walking simulator.  Still, if you're looking for a short spooky adventure that will make you think a little aterwards, then pllay dis' game.			"

												Love it! Much like my own nightmares and dreams. I was attracted to this game because of the dev's personal backstory of depression and OCD and the fact he based this game on those experiences. There's a meaning, a purpose and a real feeling of purpose for the game when you realize that. This is a game that you need to pay close attention to detail with. Every picture, photo, object, tells a bit of a story along the way. It's not about running through it as fast as you can. Take your time, relax, and let yourself get involved, keeping in mind the creator has based the story and images on his own personal dreams and issues. Thats the key! If you jump into the game expecting to run and gun and fight monsters you will miss the entire meat of the game.			"

												the spookiest thing about this game is the price. the gameplay is slow and plodding, the popscares completely predictable, the monsters easily escapable (except for a few places where they seem to be glitched and unpassable) and the overall feeling is of a newgrounds flash game that got a little big for its britches. now there are indeed some rather nifty lighting effects and shaders, but overall i would say its not worth the money. 2/10, get if its on a really really good sale or bundle.

												I really wanted to enjoy this game, but sadly the repetitive and predictable structure killed it for me.You never get the sensation of feeling helpless, because you figure out the way the game works within the first 20 minutes or so. After that you are pretty much never caught off guard.If you should be able to get it for a couple of bucks - sure, spend the hour it takes to play it through diving into the atmospheric sound and interesting graphic style. But don't expect to get an actual shiver running down your back.			"

												Disclaimer: I was a Kickstarter backer and followed the game's development closely. Perhaps I expected too much. I know from the post-release emails begging for good reviews that this isn't what developer Matt Gilgenbach (who clearly tried really hard and cares deeply about the game, to his credit) wants to see, but I feel it's my duty to provide an honest review to combat the frankly ridiculous amount of hype.As others have said, this barely qualifies as a game for starters. I'm not against ""experiences"" and ""digital novels"" (I enjoyed Dear Esther, even), but this just doesn't feel like anything. I even disagree with the positive comments about there being decent tension and creepiness - it's a disappointing mess of cliches: creepy dolls? Check. Random dead stuff? Check. Horror movie-style insane asylum? Check. And seriously, for a game allegedly about mental illness, was that last one really in the best taste?The story is practically non-existent. Just when I thought it might be getting started, it ended. I honestly had to check to make sure it wasn't some weird bug. It really feels like the devs ran out of time.The thing that piqued my interest in this game though, the sole reason I backed it, was that it's supposed to be about mental illness. As someone with a long history of mental illness myself, I was excited to see a more believable, more intelligent treatment of the subject. Boy was I disappointed. In all honesty, I see nothing relating to mental illness in this game besides the lazy cliches you find in pretty much every horror title (see above).As far as I'm concerned, the art direction is about the only thing this game gets right. As others have said, the black and white, hand-drawn style is fantastic. But there's no way it's worth anything close to the asking price.Sorry, Matt. I really, really wanted to like Neverending Nightmares, but it just doesn't deliver. I don't regret backing it, but I can't recommend it either.			"

												I'm very disappointed that I have come to the decision to not recommend this game. I tried to justify a recommendation so many times through my playthrough, but in the end, I simply cannot.I would like to start with the positive qualities of this game. The sound design is amazing and the graphics and animations are very unique and interesting. It succeeds in creating an intense and terrifying atmosphere despite its story book artstyle.I was absolutely in love with this game for the first thirty minutes, however, the experience got bogged down by bad design choices and over indulgence.  There are two enemies of a horror games, boredom and frustration, and unfortunately, this is exactly the two flavors that remain in my mouth after my playthrough.  The game makes a hard turn from disturbing imagery to challenging puzzles, which was a bad choice.  In each stage, there is a unique type of monster that blocks your way, unfortunately, it is only one kind of monster.  This game would have benefitted greatly from adding one or two more types of hazards and each environment. However, it is the puzzle design that I found so frustrating.  A good puzzle game will teach you the tools necessary for you to solve the puzzle and then throw a curveball. In a good puzzle game, the player should be constantly flipping between the feelings of the puzzle being easy and the puzzle being impossible. But this is not what happens in Neverending Nightmares. Instead, it turns into a pixel hunt, where you are trying to find the little trick to each puzzle by peering through the  murky sketches. An example of this:  one puzzle requires you to step on a piece of glass in order to draw out the monster, but up until that point, the game has taught you that stepping on glass always results in being killed.  I had to resort to watching YouTube Walkthroughs, and the Youtubers frustration cemented in my mind that this design was flawed.  In a horror game like this, you should only be dying when the game decides it's important for the story. But, there is a mixture of scripted deaths which push forward the narrative and cheap deaths from failing to avoid an enemy that led to confusion and, eventually, took the atmosphere and horror out of the game.Furthermore, the game is relatively short. My first and only playthrough ended up being roughly 1 hour and 40 minutes but there was probably 45 minutes of content. A little bit more restraint in the level design and the number of rooms and encounters would have greatly helped tighten it up.  I found myself throwing my arms up and asking the game what it wanted me to do.  There are multiple paths and endings, but I will not be going back to explore them.  "

												The style is (IMO) a beautiful homage to one of my favorite artists Edward Gorey. I was extremely excited to play this, and enjoyed.....The first hour of it. It become repetitive very quickly and I never got a sense that I was actually making progress. Does this game end? I have to admit that I didn't finish it because, well, I got bored. And why your character is an ashmatic kid who can't run for more than 5 seconds without sounding like he's about to pass-out is beyond me but it sure added to my quickly declining interest. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend this unless you have money to get rid of.			"

												Really struggled to complete this once, nevermind for all 3 multiple endings (which, once you've experienced them, you feel a little cheated).The protaginist walks PAINFULLY SLOWLY, and although you can run, he has the stamina of a 85-year old asthmatic. I seemed to spend the majority of my time listening to him wheeze and struggle to breathe.The majority of the game is simply walking/jogging through endless corridors, entering dead-end rooms with no interaction, or, on the slim chance something can be interacted with, it just seems pointless and not story related. Very very repetitive.Good points - sound is excellent and haunting, and some of the enemies really do terrify you. Did enjoy entering and leaving the same room at times and everything had changed (although this isn't common) - reminded me of Silent Hill.  As a sufferer of OCD, I really coulnd't find any similarities from my experiences in this at all, which is a shame, as it was the main selling point for me.			"

												First of all, i must say, i hate all ""horror"" including things. Movies, games, even books. But in this game, it was not the horror that captivated me. If the game's work of art was 3D, probably i'd not play it. Choosing 2D and charcoal drawing as a style gave us a perfect world for a mental illness. And making coloured only important objects or blood didn't spoil the atmosphere. If you did pay attention, our hero can't run too much and can hardly walk, because he has asthma. He is getting tired quickly and has to catch his breath. This situation makes the game even more groovy. At some point, you can easily say this game is a walking simulator, but walking is the game's ""a must"" part and with asthma it shouldn't count as a walking simulator. I really enjoyed it (actually it shuddered me :) .If you like psychological stories, don't miss this game when the next grand sale era come. (Price is a little high for a 3 hours game i guess.)Different game, you should try...			"

												Very disappointed with never-ending nightmares. The atmospheric build up managed to easily cross the line from a slow burn to intensely boring. I usually have very good patience for walking simulators and non-combat games but this pushed that way too far. And even when the game does get going, all you have to look forward to are monster encounters that rely on extremely simple stealth mechanics. Then the encounters get harder and harder, as if the developer forgot they weren’t making a Platform game. Nothing kills a horror game faster than obvious game mechanics and dying over and over and over.     Worst of all, there are no new ideas here besides the art-style. Hunted house, creepy asylum, scary little girls. It’s like someone took a book of incredibly lazy horror tropes and made a game out of it. It even has the bald creepy baby heads all over the place, like it copied it’s homework from Alice: Madness Returns. The story is told just vaguely enough that my curiosity didn’t even kick in. if there’s some twist at the end of this game I can’t be bothered to find out because the rest of it doesn’t drop any clues.

												I beat it last night. It's not very good. The art style and audio are fantastic, but everything else falls flat. It's almost similar to PT in the way that you walk down the same corridors and they change slightly every time. The problem is that instead of atmospheric horror that ♥♥♥♥s with you, Neverending Nigtmares has three different enemy types thaat you just have to sneak past with the same method everytime. Once you know how to get past the enemy, it's simple. It's not a scary game at all, squandering its potential by having to sneak past the same monsters room after room. Overall it's pretty boring, and not worth the $13. I beat the game in about 80 minutes, and though there is multiple endings, I don't feel compelled to go back and see what they are. "

												Well now I'm quite disturbed. I was one of the kickstarter backers for this (the pitch reminded me very much of the Cat Lady, another favorite horror game of mine), and I think its very well done. There's a steady sense of unease throughout, that ramps up as the game goes by. There are also a few startles, placed a suitable distance apart, such that they're not overdone. The art and music is suitably atmospheric, and the mechanics, while simple, do their job. My only complaint is that my frequent use of the shift key once caused my sticky keys prompt to come up during a very intense moment, causing me to shout ""no I do not want to turn on sticky keys!"" at my computer, while feeling rather distressed. Err yeah I'm off to not sleep now. Goodnight!			"

												I played through Neverending Nightmares for the first time last night. My Steam record says I played it for 1.7 hours (I didn't take a break). So, indeed, the game is rather on the short side. Still, it managed to capture me and I was focused on the nightmares 100% all the time. The gameplay is simplistic: Walk around with WASD/Analog stick, interact with Space/A button, sprint with Shift/B button. There is no actual puzzle solving, the focus is set on exploration and finding your way around. As the character is weak, he is unable to fight and has to flee/hide from enemies. Also, he can sprint only for a short time, eventually stopping to get some air - fleeing has to be well planned. This gameplay ""limitation"" reminded me a lot of the original Silent Hill games, where protagonists got worse at combat and having to breathe after running around for a long time.The presentation is rather unique. I believe most of the nightmares are supposed to take place in a castle of the 19. century, and the hand-drawn sketchy art style helps you time travelling into this nightmare world of the past. Lots of details help you navigate through the castle, but also disorientate you on purpose, by shifting corridors and rooms and replacing wall paintings, wardrobes and such. While the game starts almost fully black & white with a minor amount of colored objects (those you can interact with), the amount of disturbing elements (blood, body parts) increases in time. The pacing in this buildup has been done really well, in my opinion. There are jump scare moments, but they are anything but cheap, they rather support the already uneasy atmosphere. The character and enemy design is convincing enough, though I wish there were more of both kinds.As stated already, I recognize a lot of inspiration taken from the Silent Hill series - such as the character entering holes and staircases going deep down multiple times, but there are more examples. Neverending Nightmares is a great way of telling nightmare stories. While it doesn't involve much action and interaction, the scariness comes from your imagination, as you start to recognize how this believable world slowly turns into a true nightmare!I would recommend the game to people who don't put their focus on action/combat, but rather atmosphere and exploration. If uncertain about this, maybe wait for the game to go on sale!			"

												Some games are thrill rides.  Some games are merry-go-rounds.  This game is a dark ride.  It doesn't try to be anything else; it completely surrounds you with its atmosphere and takes you to another world, and like the best dark rides, that other world will haunt you long after you get off.I would put this game firmly in the ""art game"" category, and so immediately some people are going to be turned off.  It's not a terribly long or challenging game.  It will only take a few hours to play through it, and it won't take much longer to get all the endings.  There are enemies and it is possible to die, but the enemy encounters are very simplistically set up and the penalty for dying is a relatively tiny slap on the wrist.  There aren't any puzzles, and the game holds its cards very close to its chest in regards to story.However, this game isn't about that.  It was designed entirely around the experience of playing it, and it is an experience that you're not going to forget any time soon.  The hand-drawn graphics are striking, the music and sound design are excellent, and some of the unsettling, disturbing, and violent (and oh, man, this game is violent) imagery will probably haunt me for the rest of my life.  It's paced very well to maintain a constant, rising tension, and the short length ensures it doesn't overstay its welcome.  The controls and interface are incredibly simple.  You move with the cursor keys or WASD, there's an interact button and a run button.  And that's it.  There's no inventory, no puzzles to solve, no health or resources to manage; you just walk around and look, progressing further and further along the linear path ahead of you.  What is truly remarkable is despite how simplistic it is, and how little challenge the game offers, the accessibility still doesn't come at the cost of atmosphere, which is amazing and suffocating at times.  The major theme throughout the whole game is mental illness, which, despite the scariness and the gore, doesn't feel exploitative at all.  It's approached in an very understated and tasteful way, and I think anyone who has ever had some kind of mental illness will immediately be able to connect with the player character, Thomas.If I had to make any real criticisms about the game, I would say that the endings come a bit abruptly and I would have liked to see more variety in the enemies.Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend you buy this game, especially if you're looking for a good horror game for Halloween.  It's a stunning, unique, and simply horrifying little game that, despite its brief length, you'll be thinking about long after you step away from your computer.  And besides, we need more quality horror titles like this; so play it and support the tiny indie studio that made it!			"

												okay, I'm going to stop screwing around and actually review this because it grabbed my attention and firmly held it in a headlock until completion.Neverending Nightmares is what would happen if Shel Silverstein and Guillermo Del Toro collaborated on a collection of fairy tales and poems for adults and someone made a game out of it.  This was a wonderful title and it's a great one to start out with if you wanna get into horror gaming.  The storybook illustrations, the tense atmosphere, the gritty and foreboding environments, even some of the enemies you encounter, just. . . everything. . . it's great.  EVEN THE SOUNDTRACK is keeping you on edge with it's whispers and deep tones as you make your way around the twisted dreamscape.  The developers put honest-to-God effort into this and I couldn't be more satisfied.  The price is a bit steep, especially for the short length of it, but if you've got the scratch and are curious enough, BUY IT.10/10 would wake up in a cold sweat after pulling the vein out of my arm again			"

												I'm sorry, but this is one of the most boring and uninspired horror games I've ever played. In the hour and a half it took to get through the game I kept hoping for Anything mildly interesting to happen, but in the end I just felt like I had wasted my time.You play through a series of nightmares that all consist of walking through corridor upon corridor in such groundbreaking and refreshing settings as ~an old, abandoned house~, ~a psychiatric hospital~, and ~a graveyard~. I expected there to be some absurdity, maybe some surreal looking areas - these are nightmares after all - but there was hardly any to be found.Occassionally you will come across monsters that you have to get past to get to the next boring corridor. Some you need to hide from, some are blind but will attack if they hear you, etc. Pretty standard horror game mechanics, nothing new here either.Now, I could live with the boring gameplay and paint-by-the-numbers horror elements if only the game had an interesting story to tell, but even the story is about as trite and clichéd as they come. In the description it says the game was inspired by the creator's struggles with depression and OCD, but I didn't see anything that gave me any insight into what it was like to deal with that.I say this as someone who's struggling with mental illness myself, and am a little dissapointed that you'd use that as a selling point for something that only ever comes across as yet another horror story about some guy fighting monsters in a surreal alternate world because of a traumatic family incident. It never feels personal at all, it just falls flat.Also, apparently the game has multiple endnings, but it gives you no reason to want to replay it, so I don't know what the point of that even is. If you want to play a game where it feels like you're fighting mentall illness, play Knock Knock. If you want to play a game with a similar quirky children's book style, play Fran Bow. Both are much better horror games.			"

There are only 8 levels but each one is unique and has its own theme. There are 3 endings in total and im sure all are as good as the one i just got. Highly recomend this for all you horror lovers. It is well worth the price.			"

												Contains a mix of both jump scares and an oppressive, brooding atmosphere with the fear of what may come or what something might do.  Sound in particular is very well done, namely with headphones on.  The game isn't unforgiving for not figuring out things right away and has a shallow learning curve that makes it easy to get into and figure out puzzles as the game progresses.  Will be at this for a bit finding the branching path for the different endings.			"

												Neverending Nightmars seems to derive horror from ever-presant dread rather than shock. There are some jump scares but they are few and far between. Areas are large and exploration requires a fair amount of endurance. This combinded with an increasingly oppressive atmosphere really create a kind of horror that you don't often see in games. I rarely felt frightened, more disquieted. It's a slow burn that builds up over time as you feel more and more out of control, a feeling aided by the modest control set.I will say, for people who dislike a ""less is more"" design philosphy, Neverending Nightmares can leave something to be desired. In spite of how quickly the game can be completed, there are segmets that seem to stretch endlessly. Combined with the reuse of art assets this can break the tension and create dull moments. A player expecing more direct engagement or variety could be disappointed.That said, I feel like these are intentional design choice. The game is crafted to express the thoughts and experiences of the lead developer's struggles with mental illness, specifically depression and OCD. Much of the explorative gameplay feels as though it pushes you to look at everything and leave no path unobserved. For my part, this evenually left me somewhat inured to the shock value of the esclating horrors while me general unease persisted. It was a very interesting experience and left me with plenty to mull over after the game's conclution. Regardless of any shortcomings, I feel that the style and vision expressed in Neverending Nightmares makes for a completely worthwhile experience.			"

												having just had a few moments to start the game my review will be brief. first some disclosure. i did back the game on kickstarter after trying the demo. however i didnt back enough to get alpha/beta acess so im not as spoiled on the game as some others may be. i will say this game isnt for anyone if youre looking for a challenge or even scary monsters or lots of jumpscares. this isnt the game for that. the game is atmospheric  with the audio and visuals presented to you in a way to try to unnerve you. the back grouds becoming worse in their conditions as you progress. some i have seen have complained about the characters movement speed and i know this will sound like a flimsy excuse. but if you stop to think about it. the character is in a nightmare and in nightmares you barely ever move as you would for real. i also dont know about many of you but if im in a strange envrionment where i feel threatend im not going to run like the wind and draw attention if i knock something over. the asthma aspect is something i find intersting and i like theres a limit.  i also find some of the images ive seen on my own playthrough so far and  LPS ive watched make me reach for that body part in sympathy. now whats not to like about this game? as ive said its not for everyone. like in a nightmare ive seen some places loop for a bit and start to mesh together but i dont think it detracts from the game unless by the time you reach the end of the first part of the asylum youre already bored or frustrated.  which i can see some people being.second the lack of jumpscares challenges or alot  of monsters. these may be common complaints from players coming into the game looking for something to scare them  most of them having played games like outlast or five nights at freddies or amnesia. honestly those games dont appeal to me where this one did. i like the fact that theres no challenge and instead of being frustrated or being jumpscared or chased for the hundredth time i can get myself immersed in the world the creator made. all in all i would reccomend giving the game a shot or watching an lp of it i can understand some saying the $15 price tag is a bit much and if youre hesitant wait until a sale. i believe this creator has some potential and would love to see him make one more before passing judgement on his abilities. i see this game as more of a window into the suffering of someone whose had dark thoughts and nightmares and how probably during those times he never felt it would get better.

												A lot of people think that Kool-Aid Jammers are just for kids, but I disagree. They're my particular favorite when it comes to pouched drinks, on top of others like Capri Sun. While they may not be as healthy as the others (but then, none of them are particularly healthy, really), I've found that Kool-Aid Jammers have a stronger flavor than the other brands, and don't have that watered down feeling that some of the others have. My personal favorite flavor is Cherry, and it's usually the only flavor I buy - there used to be a Cherry Limeade flavor that was better, but they seem to have stopped selling those. Kool-Aid Jammers might not be the best drink you could get, but they're good, fast drinks for when you want something with a stronger taste than water but want something more hydrating than a soda, with the convenience of a pouch meaning you don't have to take a lot of time away from your game to grab one.The reason I'm talking about Kool-Aid Jammers instead of Neverending Nightmares is two-fold; not only did my Kool-Aid Jammer outlast the game, but I also found it more interesting. Nevending Nightmares is a game that puts up a nice face in terms of atmosphere and art and sound design, but quickly falls apart when you actually play it. The game is, as the title implies, about a character experiencing neverending nightmares. You wake up in your bed, walk through one of three environments, and at the end something kills you and you wake up in the next nightmare. This goes on for about one hour (for a game called Neverending Nightmares, it sure does end pretty quickly), and then the game ends. Every now and then it'll bring in mechanics familiar to horror game fans, like a monster that you have to hide in a closet to avoid or an enemy that you can't sprint by, but these are few and far between and the enemies are so basic that it doesn't even feel like an effort to avoid them, let alone anything that might make you feel nervous around them. The only reason I even know what they do when they catch you is because each of them do it at least once in the scripted next-level death. The art style is unique, and the audio is well-designed to boost the atmosphere (though the special ""headphones"" sound option it encourages you to use seemed more like it was meant for bad headphones than ones more suited for gaming, and on my Gamescom 780 it just pushed all the sound to the front speakers of the headphones instead of giving a good surround experience), but so much of your time spent in the game is spent just walking past almost identical rooms over and over until you finally stumble upon the thing that kills you, and it's just not very entertaining. I'm not saying I want some PewDiePie youtube fodder game full of jump scares, but it's just hard to stay invested in a game with this little substance. There are apparently three additional levels that I missed leading to two different endings (though I have no idea what I did to ""choose"" the path I ended up on, since there isn't really anything in terms of dialogue or obvious story), but after seeing how long and tedious the final nightmare in my branch was I really just didn't care enough to see the others. I really wanted to like this game, but in the end I just found it extremely repetitive, and while some games make good use of down time to build up the atmosphere for a payoff, this game just feels like nothing but down time, leading to an unsatisfying conclusion that just leaves you wondering what the point was. Neverending Nightmares currently costs $15. A 10-count box of Cherry Kool-Aid Jammers costs $1.88. You can do the math yourself.			"

												Took a bit over an hour to get a first ending, about the same to see the others after that, with level/nightmare select and a guide.I'm torn about this one.I love the subject matter, I love that it is a very personnal project. Lots of cool ideas. Love the graphics. The audio is awesome. But I ended up liking the whole a lot less than I hoped I would.As a game it fails for me. Except jump scares (ok, there's a couple of nice ones) it wasn't scary to me. Creepy? Sure. The audio is the element working best at being oppressive and unnerving. Having no clear goal is a problem, that leaves exploration. But the levels are so empty that it wasn't fulfilling. There are no puzzles per say, you just progress in a rather straight line and double back when you find a dead (no pun intended) end. There are very few interactive elements, and a lot of those a rather bland, like many family portraits that are never of any use or reference to anything as far as I can tell. There are a couple of ennemies to dodge or run from, and if you die to them you'll restart in a nearby bed and do it again, or maybe it'll be one of the few story related ones and it'll make the 'story' 'progress' which inside of a level is basically redoing close to the same thing, but with slightly more messed up decoration and little less light.I do get the link to depression. Helplessness, repetition, little control over things.. As a statement I can appreciate it. As a game, it is just that: repetition. Maybe having my own battles with depression makes all of this a bit more mundane to me, I don't know.It is also just too slow for me.. Between wondering what could be the next jump scare and the slooooooooooow walking pace of the character, I found my mind drifting away, bored. Single elements, graphically, are really well done, but with so much repetition in tone, it becomes too samey to be scary to me.So. Is it good? Not really. Is it bad? Not really, either !! It is a cool thing expressing Matt's experiences, but I don't think it is a great game as is. I do wish for such things to exist, and I did pledge towards Matt's second title's KS (and would again if a 2nd attempt is made). If you're reading this still, you're probably curious and open enough to want to give it a shot, and to such people I would absolutely recommend a try. If you found this almost at random and are looking for a game-game, this is a harder sell to say the least, unless you're really easily unsettled and scared by disturbing imagery.			"

												This game so desparately wants to be P.T. It sets you up in an endless loop slowlly navigating the same hallways over and over again, with variations each time. Unlike P.T. you will feel no sense of physical danger or terror. I think worst decision the game made was to have an actual script. If the designers had left it for you to figure out what was going on or what had happened, then it would have been far more gripping from the beginning. To top it off they chose this ridiculous and obnoxious visual design that will actually hurt your eyes.TL;DR: P.T. wanna-be that fails to delivery even fundamental aspects of horror.			"

												This game had a lot of things about it which I thought were very good but I can't bring myself to recommend it as over all it was rather boring. The art style is nice with the dark, detailed, hand drawn style but the over use of bright red blood negated the impact for me as it made it seem overly childish. The music and sound effects are excellent especially they way the sound effect subtly herald the approach of an enemy. The music together with the visuals create a great atmosphere that reminded me of the good silent hill games in places. The story is disappointing it starts of with mysterious hints as to what is going on but never really develops. I suppose they had to keep it vague to get it to fit in with each of the different endings but it just felt like it was going nowhere then suddenly an ending happened. The main problem is that this game mostly involves slowly walking through very similar corridors until something happens causing you to wake up and repeat the process. howlongtobeat.com suggested this game would take 1.5 – 2 hours to complete so I started this game with the intention of playing the whole game in one session but after an hour or so I was too bored to carry on. On another occasion after dying and waking up I took a wrong turn and inadvertently started heading off in the wrong direction, because the levels are so repetitive I did not realise this until I had got all the way back to the very beginning of the section. I guess the repeated similar environments were supposed to give the impression of being trapped and heighten the sense of horror but in the end it was just boring.			"

												This game is short, but it has greater impact than many other horror and scare games that last much longer.  Neverending Nightmares grabs you right from the beginning: there is no tutorial that overstays its welcome; a control guide; or even an hour-long opening sequence before you dive in.  Instead, the game begins immediately, and without any GUI to distance you from the action, you being your neverending nightmare...The graphics and atmosphere are very unique, and the hand-drawn nature of the game really helps establish a surreal setting that only increases in horror and intrigue as you progress.  The audio is integral to the experience, and pulls you in even further to this cacophony of mind-bending, psychological distortion of an adventure.Having said that, the length is bad not because it's too short, but that it feels like there's so much more story and setting to explore.  The game doesn't overstay its welcome, but it doesn't really stay for dinner either.			"

												This 2D walk 'em up is a product of love, care and attention to the mentally disturbed and horror. When I say I horror I really mean dramatic tension except that tension isn't a steam tag. It does have a few hours of gameplay if you are a completionist, but only 90mins if you want to just get through the game. Best played at night with a gamepad. Will you love this game or think it is OK? I think you should be able to tell from the screenshots I got this game for $10 from Kickstarter and I think that is fair, but I am only a casual lover of horror.			"

												Usually the topic of this game is my thing but this game makes so much mistakes that i cant recommend this. There are no collectibles about the characters, backgroundstory (diary entries, thoughts, patient files etc.), no puzzles, just walking or running through similar looking backgrounds. What i really liked were the screams of the main protagonist when he dies.Too much wasted potential in here.			"

												Tedious, frusterating, poorly balanced and overall, not fun.In terms of good points I'll say the creator has a excellent art style and made sufficently horrifying. Unfortunently thats where the good points end.You know how most games have distingushing features in their levels and streamline the design so that the player knows where they are in the level design and don't constantly wander back and forth wondering if they're going the right way towards the next object that will progress the plot? Well, this game doesnt, and because of the constant reused assets I kept wondering whether I was going the right way or whether I had inadvertantly backtracked and needed to reverse my course.In itself that would only be a moderate annoyance, but theres also the issue that the levels have way to much *nothing* in them. Out of the time I spent in the first area, I estimate only about 10% had an event in it, either a scare or a monster or something to do, the rest just being padding going from one room to another.And when stuff does happen, its not well balanced. In the second area, I wound up having to get from one scene to another without being caught by zombies, but there was no way to tell where the zombies were in the screen other than trial and error, there was no way to lose the zombies if they did spot me due to how slow my character ran, and even if I did know where they were sneaking around them was nearly impossible due to how small the areas were, so I would constantly get caught, die, get sent back to the last checkpoint, repeat ad nausium.Honestly, this is one of the worst indie games I have bought and played. I cannot recommend it to anyone except horror junkies who've played everything else.			"

												This game falls in the category of UNIQUE GAMES. There are similar ones, but not with the artwork and atmosphere this one creates. If it wasnt for the artwork style I would give this game a 1/10, but just because of this I give it a 3/10. Pros:Graphic style +2Immersive creepy atmosphere +1Cons:Priced at $14.99 (waaaaaaaaat?) this one should be around $4.99Repetitive ad nauseumWalking simulator TO THE EXTREME (for many areas just hold the D button non stop)Minimal interactionStory tries to make the player interested on it, but fails because of how repetitive and tedious the gameplay is. Around 2 hours to 100% it. Seriously, it gets so repetitive that there was point where I thought the game was a roguelike, procedurally generating rooms and corridors that in fact would never end ...... get it? .... N.E.V.E.R. E.N.D ....ing nightmares. Still you are welcome to experience it and try it if its part of a bundle or if it gets super cheap.			"

												Just like the protagonist of the game couldn't wait to wake up, I could not wait until the game would finally come to an end.While the art style is nice, all the movements are clunky, not to mention that splattering red paint all over a fully black and white game is not scary, it's just cheap. Neither are shock-value jumpscares. The scariest thing that happened to me in the game was the ambience cutting out in one of the rooms.I understand the concept that recursive nightmares are supposed to be terrifying, but someone didn't really think this idea through, since it gets incredibly boring after a while.Not to mention the worst nightmares in the game were the stairs, which were not only pointless and unnecessary but also incredibly slow.

												To echo what all the other reviews have said, this game is surprisingly atmospheric. It is the poster child for doing a lot with a little, and the modest visual potray depth and darkness (not to mentions claustriphobia and mania) in ways I never would have imagined such a simple style could.It does what Outlast and similar titles fails to do, and keeps you on the edge of your seat and engaged/terrified, without overwhelming or frustrating you. It never turns the horror spicket off, but it paces itself when constructing its atmosphere of horror and oppression. It comes highly reccomended for anyone who is looking for the next gem in the ""indie ressurgence"" of horror.			"

												A great soundtrack with really well built sound effects.A beautiful creepy art style in tone with the theme.Gameplay is quite dry. This is a walking simulator in all its splendor.The whole story is rather short (90') but that is actually a good thing because it gets a bit repetitive around the end. Character movement is quite slow, which adds to the theme, but does add a feeling of slowness that will bother the action fan.Recommended to those who want an artistic, scary, disturbing experience diving into a suffering mind.

												I DONT RECOMEND PLAYING THIS ALONE. PLAY WITH FREINDS ITS A LOT MORE FUN THAT WAYthe length is a bit of a dissapointment for £10 as well as questionable framerate drops. 90 minutes on first playthroughthe monsters are scary untill you know thier patrol patterns then they are reasonably easy to get past.the atmosphere is great for what little time it has to develop which is an echievement in itself since pacing seems to be a religios taboo to modern horror games. so i have to applaude them on that. dread is a strong feeling in the game which makes it more than your average screemer fest.if you were waiting for this game since the demo then buy it, i think it is overpriced at the moment though. i would recomned playing this game at night with freinds while drunk, theres enough disturbing gore to make yourself and everyone around you vomit (if your all drunk, belive me it does happen)if you want a small horror game to gnaw on then either play this or five nights at freddys, if you want to play a great horror game play amniesia DD or ride to hell retribution (seroisly its in the steam horror list lol). either way bring freinds to watch!

												I found it very straight forward and short [78 minutes on my first playthrough].There are a few endings that vary depending on what seemed like not-very-visible 'choices' in the second half of the game.I was disappointed with the level of fear I felt too, it was not as scary as other horror games that I've played.Hoever the art style is exceptionally unique and the character animations are pretty good. I like the idea of playing with guilt and horror tropes [subverting expectionations and all that jazz] but this also failed to capitalise on that, with a very quick cut ending that could have been expanded upon.The music is a bit consistently loud too in my opinion, it damaged the tension felt on the whole.Note: I backed the game on Kickstarter and had played a demo at PAX Prime 2013.

												Neverending Nightmares isn't your typical horror game. It doesn't rely on jumpscares or even the fear of a jumpscare; instead it build's a creepy and disturbing atmosphere through sound design and the effective shaded 2D art-style, which makes blood really stand out. The game follows Thomas, a man seemly stuck in a world of his own making and your task is to somehow escape. The game plays off imagery of depression and suicide to build a world where we, as the player, are not only afraid but also sympathise with Thomas' plight. The story thread about Gabby is contradictory and often leaves you wondering who this women/girl actually is, with different areas of the game offering different explaination.My one complaint is that a lot of the same enemies and enviroments are used far too often and the game is FAR too short (i completed the beta in about an hour). But I would still recommend for horror fans!			"

												I haven't beaten the game yet, so no spoilers really, but I gotta say that, so far, this thing is pretty masterfully done. These guys understand that the cornerstones of horror are isolationism, helplessness, and heavy atmosphere. It does all of them quite well. There are times, however, where certain monsters are used a bit too much and they can slow down and even break the experience. Once you get past those little parts though, there's PLENTY of good stuff. These parts with too many monsters number maybe.... one or two? I don't know what else is in store for me but in about 2 hours of gameplay, I've come away with a very satisfactory horror experience.			"

												This game is really good but unfortunately, $13.50 SGD of price makes me wonder if it is justified. I finished the game as well as to find all the endings, all in 3 hours (It was meant to be 2 on mine but it was actually 3 hours because I started from the middle of the game itself sometimes). Would I recommend it? With some hesistation, yes. Wait for a discount would be better.Nevertheless, the game brings out a different horror genre itself. Other games scares you with well planned jump scares. This game however, makes you uncomfortable to the core and adds mental stress to you at times, which should be a psychological horror genre game. The atmosphere can be pretty scary and freaky too.The art style of this game is inspired/ originated from Edward Gorey, which gives a distinct style as if everything is drawn out with ink. The intensity of black horizontal lines are the marks of bright and dark areas. The game has only black and white unless there are objects that you can interact with or there is blood (red).The level design is great and because of the art and colour style, the players do understand what can be interacted without the help of a tutorial though the enemies do take time to figure about on how to avoid them.The sounds are really aiding with the atmosphere as well. It's distorted, the music is weird and is out of place and makes you more uncomfortable. If you play the game, be sure to wear a headphone. They have made it so that the experience is more immerse with headphones.This game is an unforgettable experience and I would give it 3.8/5			"

												This is a game that I have been waiting quite a while for, and had extremely high expectations for while following the developer up to release. I feel that it hit every goal that I hoped for and expected it to.It's not a game that focuses on cheesy jump-scares and 10-15 mins of constant fear. It's a game that offers a glimpse into the underside of our humanity and makes you feel like you're being torn from the inside out. The themes are powerful, and leave you thinking through the game and long after it's over. The art style is unique and well done. The soundtrack is ominous and goes quite well with the atmosphere that the user is placed in.A couple things that I did not like a about it though, that the hallways were a bit repetitive at times, and that the replay value is a bit lacking.It's not the type of game that gives you a shallow terror that ultimately leaves you feeling unsatisfied. It brings you to the edge of your seat, but also gives you time to process information and build up a feeling of dread and angst. A quality that quite a few games are lacking now.In my opinion, this game is well worth $15.00.			"

												While the aesthetic and sound design is fantastic, Neverending Nightmares is flawed. The use of colour is excellent and I have a weakness for eerie whispers. Later in the game the sparse and occasional blood spatters begin to become the usual décor which loses the promise it once had of violence and horrors.As for the pacing, we play as a sickly child who can run for about 5 seconds before he must take a break to wheeze desperately and collect himself. When he isn't breathlessly fumbling along, he staggers at a snails pace. The enemies and threats this game provides feel no more forboding than a slightly deformed picture of a kitten. Interacting with them does not cause fear, but rather it brings the already slow pace to a crawl.I found myself wanting it to be over but it kept dragging on. The jump scares were predictable and over all it was an unsurprising and tedious experience. I respect the personal nature of this game, and I think it's absolutely awesome for the devolper to use the medium for expression, but as a game, I don't recommend it. Or maybe I'm just jaded and hard to please.			"

												Gameplay: very weak. There are basic running and hiding mechanics and a few other simple things, but nothing that immerses you in the scariness.Visuals: good. I dig the art style, but throughout the game the art pieces are re-used heavily. I stopped being impressed after the first twenty minutes or so.Story: weak. Maybe it's because the story bits are so few and far between, but the story didn't interest me. It stayed mysterious, but it didn't make me care much about the characters or what was going on.			"

												This game so far has been able to not only creep me out, but immerse me into such an amazing story! I love this game, I have been recording my playthrough of it, and videos will be up (not a promotion)! This game captures the essence of horror with sound and subtlety rather than just going into anticipation of big, scary monsters. This game is definitely worth getting!			"

												Only about 80 minutes long, but a fun 80 minutes that was creepy but not overly stressful scary. Good atmosphere, but no real story to speak of. Lots of creepy imagery, but the biggest challenge will be to maintain your patience with the long, somewhat repetative hallways.

												One of the coolest games I've played in awhile. Animation style is awesome. Very creepy and suspenseful. Sound is amazing through headphones.

												This is an interesting game in that it's not as much about the story, or even the abject horror, as it is about conveying certain emotions.  Matt Gilgenbach, the creator of Neverending Nightmares, suffers from depression and OCD, and this game exists to help convey what that is like.  The player will experience anxiety, dread, and general discomfort.  Of course that is because there are jump scares and monsters that are trying to kill him, but the point is the feelings that are transmitted.  The visuals are inspired by Edward Gorey, and of course incredibly disturbing, and the sound will keep the player on edge at all times, especially with headphones.Neverending Nightmares does have a story, but it's disjointed and intentionally vague.  There are three endings, but none of them are canon.  You can try to put the pieces together to create a cohesive whole, but it's like having 450 pieces of a 500-piece jigsaw puzzle. Connections can be made, but you won't necessarily get the whole picture, and that's the point.  Clinical depression is not a rational thing.  There is not always a reason for people to feel depressed, except that their brains tell them so.  Be aware of this when you are trying to interpret the story.The game is also heavy on symbolism, from the enemies to dream tropes that are lying around, like blood, teeth, and even the player's own slow running speed.  While the entire game, if you go for all of the endings and branching paths, will probably end up taking less than 2.5 hours, I would still argue that it is worth the purchase for the unique experience it provides, as well as for its part in helping spread awareness of OCD and clinical depression.  This game is great, and I highly recommend it.			"

												Very simple game to play.  The use of black and white as the main colors and the hand drawn look works very well for this title and the whole dream aspect of it.  Jumped a few times playing this and you HAVE to play this with a headset on and turned up to fully appreciate the ambient noises and soundtrack that is both simplistic and makes you feel uneasy when it wants you to.  I consider this a MUST buy for all my friends.			"

												Neverending Nightmares is a horror adventure game thats 2D and all hand drawn but will you want to play it ? In Neverending Nightmares you play as Thomas who is unable to wake up from nightmares. Everything leads into a new nightmare.So how is this game ? Its quite good honestly. The game was made by a person who suffered from mental illness. So ill try to explain how the game is played. You walk around in a 2D enviroment and you walk from door to door till you go deeper into the nightmare and once the nightmare wraps up you have the ability to go back and replay them and try to get a diffrent ending and theres three of them. The game also throws a few enemies to the mix and all of them act diffrent. The game is quite suspensfull and sometimes frighting to say the least. But the game has a few issues as well. A confusing layout which is hard to tell where youve been and where you are. The game is incredibly short only under an hour if you only plan to get one ending. Neverending Nightmares is also quite pretty to look at and it really has outstanding sound effects too, i highly suggest you play in the dark with headphones. Overall Nevenending nightmares is an excellent horror game for fans of the genre and i suggest everyone to pick this game up just to see how awfull it is to have a nightmare let alone never to wake up from one. I give Neverending Nightmares a 7.5/10			"

												A horror adventure with focus on atmosphere and emotions. No puzzles, not really challenging. But when you put on your headphones and if you let yourself drag into the darkness, sadness, hatefullness and bloodyness of this game you will enjoy a short but intense experience.And be aware: This game contains some really drastic graphical violence. (not joking!)Matt Gilgenbach, the maker of this game, wrote on his blog about his goals with this game: ""As you may know, Neverending Nightmares has many goals besides to just scare the pants off of people. Expressing the feelings of mental illness is important to me because:    I’d like to promote a greater understanding of mental illness, which will hopefully remove some of the stigma associated with it.    I’d like to reach out to those who are currently suffering and show them they are not alone because I think there are a lot of commonalities between my experience and everyone who has mental illness.""- http://www.infinitapgames.com/2014/09/04/a-heartwarming-story-about-neverending-nightmares/- http://www.infinitapgames.com/ "

YouTube™ Video: Neverending Nightmares (Alpha 0.1 Build 8466) 

			Views: 1,095		

			Jon & Cunny review the first alpha build of Neverending Nightmares. Cunny swears a lot.. Neverending Nightmares is horror game from Matt Gilgenbach & Infinitap Games.		

If a game can make you jump in broad daylight then you know you're onto something special. Some of the jump scares reminded me of the first time I played the original 'Resident Eveil' remember the time the rabid dogs jumped throught the window for the first time? I got to the gym and I'm a kickboxer in RL, but this is a game even I would not like to play, at night, alone and with headphones on. There is no cure for natural fear. Did I also mention how cool the art style is? - Recommended!			"

												The game is like a slow decend into your own madness...I did know it was possible to do a proper horror game with such simple 2D graphics but somehow they pulled it off!  The gameplay is pretty simple, you just walk around and explore while being scared s***less, it is more about the atmosphere than anything else. Of course I have not finished it yet and it does get a bit repetitive in one part but overall, it is everything I had hoped it would be. It really makes you question your own sanity: did that doll`s eyes just move? Did the wallpaper on behind me suddenly change? If you are interested in atmospheric horror game, you owe it to your self to try this one! "

I'm a horror fanatic; headsets, lights off, volume up kinda deal.  This game was a nice quick good scare.  The art work in this game is great and delievers a spine chilling vibe.  The creator of this game had the inspiration from personal experiences with depression and OCD and that definitely becomes viable in this game.  There are very frew jump scares as the game relies more on it's heavy and dark atmosphere to deliver the scare.  The story is a mystery, there's three different outcomes and definitely gets you thinking.  IF IT'S ON SALE and you're looking for a quick spook, go ahead and grab this.			"

												NN is not scary. It's imagery repeats itself ad nauseam, the enemies aren't scary and are easy to avoid, you can figure out the story in 10 minutes, and the game doesn't last long. There are 3 different endings and a couple of different paths to take. I have only completed one ending, but have no desire to see the others. I would not recommend this game to anyone looking for anything scary. The game commits the ultimate horror sin of creating what by all rights should be a great atmosphere, but taking to long to get around to it. This does not lead to tension as the music and imagery is repeated.			"

												I decided to buy this game after seeing a gameplay video of it on youtube.Pros: Very creepy. I have always thought the 2D hand-drawn style that this game adds such a spooky element. Unique and nostalgic. It reminded me of the scary children's books that I used to read as a kid.The game doesn't rely too much on cheap jump scares, but rather sets up an errie atmosphere through the music and setting. Although it can be repetitive at some times, the overall creepiness of the game keeps your heart pounding.Cons: It should cost $4.99, $9.99 MAX. $15 is pretty steep. The player moves very slow while moving up and down the stairs, which tested my patience. There are some rooms that are pointless to enter and only waste time.Overall, I would recommend this game. Play it with a friend, It gives a good scare.			"

												This is not just some old horror with cheap scares and cliche antagonists. This is an artist's expression, the developer's impression of their own first-hand experiences with OCD and depression. It will have you on edge, heart in your throat and begging for an end. But you can't stop.The art style is very bleak, with few colours (usually on interative objects) and reminiscent of a childerens' picture book, which reflects well with the game's story and message. The gameplay is very basic, almost being an interactive story, but with the occasional challenge when you come accross one of the game's few 'enemies'.That is all I shall reveal, if you are looking for a horror experience that looks futher than cheap cliches, this game is for you. Give it a go!			"

												I must admit it took me some time on deciding if I would reccomend this game or not but the crucial question to ask yourself is how much are you willing to pay for something a little different.THE GOODYou should know that this game is certainly not  a ""must play"" but I do give credit where credit is due. The penciled in artstyle with highlights of color is certainly interesting and is something I really enjoyed seeing compared to so many dull, grey, 3D horror games. The images in the backgrounds are also very well done with plenty of both overtly horrific images as well as many subtly disturbing images. There are also a few jump scares sprinkled throughout for good measure but they are spaced far enough apart that they dont become tedious. I should also mention the sound design is really quite supurb. When using headphones you can hear plenty of slight noises such as whispers or footsteps that increase the dramatic tension. Last of all the price is fairly reasonable. I was able to buy this game during a winter sale for $6.75 USD which is less than I've paid for much worse games.THE BADThe biggest complaint you will find from myself and others is the lack of player agency (walking simulator is in the tags for a good reason). The actual gameplay largely consists of only walking forward and avoiding enemies and even when avoiding enemies it's a simplistic affair as you will likely only die a couple of times before recognizing a pattern in the enemy behavior. Another major issue is that the game manages to be both short (about 2 hours for 100 percent completion) and yet tedious. You'll see many recycled hallways that you'll have to run through with the shortest invisible stamina bar in the world. While this repetitive nature does help the game feel more like an actual nightmare that you cannot escape from it does lose its charm fairly quickly.CONCLUSIONIf you have a few extra dollars in your steam wallet and want to try a different but short horror game give Neverending Nightmares a try! For anyone that is looking to get the best for their money this one may be worth a pass.			"

												If you're expecting a thrilling, challenge-ridden horror game.. Well then this isn't the game for you. This is one of my favorite purchases on Steam. The atmosphere and small details were constantly changing. I especially like the story and the creator-protagonist connection. I felt like I had a small personal connection with the creator instead of playing some mindless jump-scare horror game. I would definitely recommend it.			"

												Not much to say, you wander through locations and sometimes try to find paths around wandering things that are out to kill you or run from them. You get the first ending after only about an hour or two depending on how slow you take it and your skill level. There's four total endings, most of which are just what doorways you go through.I recommend it. There's nothing in terms of mechanics other than walking and running, and there are three real jump scares by my count other than when you get killed. Its actually the fact that they really accomplished the feel of being in a nightmare that makes me like it. Playing it, I actually remembered nightmares that I've had throughout my life and probably haven't remembered since waking up on the day after I had them. Scared me more than a video game has since the first time I played Fatal Frame 2, and I don't know how long its been since I've seen a horror movie as scary. Don't pay more than $8 for it, wait until there's a sale. There's not enough here for above that price. The game actually tells you to play it with headphones, and trust me when I say it isn't for cheap jump scares but instead for more immersion. Play with the lights off and alone too, with a vibrating controller if you have it.			"

												I started off enjoying this game, but the incredibly repetitive monsters that were once scary quickly become just straight annoying. The plot began as if there was a puzzle that you could piece together, but after a while I realized that none of the puzzle pieces were made to fit each other. I finally pulled through to the ending (One of three different endings) and oh my god, I was angry. The ending I had gotten was pathetic, it was hardly an ending and far, far too open. The scribble like shadows become increasingly annoying and unattracive. I respect that it was inspired by the creators depression, and how he was trying to portray it to feel like that, but the game is just not fun. And while you can argue that it succeds as a work of art (I dissagree, but each to their own) the game is just straight out not enjoyable for me at all.  In short, Started out fun, quickly became an eyesore and repetitive, ending was tried too hard to be open ended and up for discussion.			"

												At first it seems like it takes after Lone Survivor,  but Neverending Nightmares has more in common with Dear Esther.  There's very little gaming to do.  All you do is march down long hallways, listen to the moody music, look at the creepy imagery, and eventually you get to the end.  Some may even compare it to Amnesia: The Dark Descent, but that game had plenty of things for the player to do.  It wasn't just a forced march down dark hallways; you had goals, and the monsters were actively chasing you!Having little to do gamewise isn't necessarily a bad thing.  To The Moon was very much like this, but what set that game apart from this one is the story.  To The Moon, Lone Survivor, and Amnesia all have a complete story to uncover at the end.  Neverending Nightmares does not.  It leaves you with a bunch of confusing pieces of a story with no resolution--yet another game that thinks being vague is the same as being profound.  (I'm looking at you, Braid!)All you do is march down long hallways, open doors, march down more long hallways, and at the end of the march is a jump-scare.  These jump-scares are effective, but after the fourth time, it becomes routine.  Oh yes, and dolls are creepy.  We get it.  Dolls *are* creepy.Neverending Nightmares feels like it was built around its soundtrack.  The levels are ridiculously long just to make you absorb the music.  The ambient horror music makes this game, and it does a very good job creating atmosphere.  The art style is especially memorable.  I've never seen a game look like this, and it adds a lot to the creep factor.Steam won't let me give this a neutral rating, but it deserves one.  I didn't hate this game, as it did a very good job creating atmosphere and jump-scaring me more than once, but I found the delivery more tedious than scary, and the 3 payoffs at the end do not provide a satisfying resolution to all that marching.

												Oh the ambiance. The suspense that this game creates is unreal. While the actual jump scares it provides are trivial things that happen, it's enough to get you heart to skip a beat, or maybe even three or four at times! But that's not what this game is truly about. This isn't a jump scare game at the heart of it, it's a game that creates this world of just insane creepiness that keeps you looking around the room every few minutes (especially with headphones!!!) and keeps you on the edge of your seat, and tricks you often with fake jump scares that aren't even really scares at all, it's just your mind being so freaked out it scared itself. That's what this game does, it creates such an ambiance that it doesn't even need to scare you, it just has to let you scare yourself. Great game, love it.			"

												First things first: Why does Thomas run SO SLOW? He runs short of breath with a 5 second sprint. I know there isn't much chasing in this game, but how slow the protagonist really frustrated me, especially in my second play through. I have asthma irl and even I don't wheeze like that after a few seconds of casual jogging. I am on the fence about recommending this game. For the original price of $15, I'd say wait for a sale. It's a well done game as far as atmosphere and music. I really like how they adapt the sounds for headphone wears.I like the style of the art, even if the blood effects look way too red and cheap - like they were pasted on after the fact. The story... well- I played through two endings so far. I like it, and I like how you can try to piece things together yourself. However the game feels much too repetitive.  I would of liked a lot more interactions with items in rooms. Most rooms were empty and dead ends, with simply nothing to do in them.The style is great, like I said. It's unique and we all need more Devs that explore different styles. For me though, the game doesn't draw me in. I wanted more from this game, but it just feels unfinished over all.I would still recommend it to other fans of the horror genre, especially those starved for something different than the usual FPS/crafting survival/zombie etc etc game.

The game is genuinely scary, especially when wearing headphones. It is incredibly short though. It only took me 90 mins to finish. I did only get one of the 3 possible endings but I didn't feel like I needed to play through again two more times to see those.

												All in all, I think this game is a good starting point if you want to get into horror games. I mean that as a compliment.I wouldn't say that this game is necessarily bad. It's got a pretty good atmosphere and decent jumpscares. The artwork's great (they even make it easy to spot landmarks so that you don't get lost, even though pretty much everything's in black and white), and the voice acting is pretty good, as well. Each section of the game pretty much has its own unique set of monsters with the exception of one or two, and that gives a pretty good variety. It's short enough to show a friend to just play through really quickly - I got all of the paths in 3 hours.A lot of the time, I wasn't really that scared, which is sort of bad news for a horror game. While the atmosphere is pretty scary at first, it sort of fades once you actually get to see each of the monsters - the mystery sort of disappears, and it's really easy to learn how to deal with them pretty quickly. I think the main problem with this game is that it's just a ton of walking with only a small handful of scattered monsters or jumpscares in relatively few places. I don't want to make a joke like ""Walking Simulator 2015"" or anything like that, but that did make this game pretty boring. Like I said, if you want to get into horror games, this is a good place to start, but not for $15.			"

												I backed this game, and actually really liked the developer, but can't sugest this specific title to anyone else.It's beutiful, one of the best looking indie titles out there in my opinion, but there's not much else to call home about. Neverending nightmares is short, cliche, and most of the game is spent wandering through empty rooms with pictures of kickstarter backers on the wall. What's there to scare you is nothing you havent seen before in games like these, Giant babies, dudes with their eyes gouged out, a creepy girl. There's 2 genuine scares, great, clever moments, but bland outside of that.The whole thing can be finished in an hour and a half, and though there's multiple endings, but I cant bring myself to the tedium of wandering through empty rooms again to find them.

												Asthma Simulator 2014. Seriously, someone please get the main character an inhaler!If you are expecting jump-scare style horror, ala Slender Man or Five Nights at Freddies you will probably be disappoint. Neverending Nightmares is an atmospheric horror in the artistic style of Edward Gorey and the story-telling of Edgar Allen Poe that delves into psychological terror with mood, eerie music and sounds, disturbing images, and a storyline that takes you into the depths of madness. It is simple gameplay but if you allow yourself to get immersed it is far more than a ""Walking Simulator"" as some claim it to be.The downside is that it is only 2-4 hours of gameplay if you want to go through each of the five paths to different endings (which I highly recommend to get a better idea what is truly transpiring in the story).8/10 Would get my intestines eaten by a faceless broken doll again.

												     ""Neverending Nighmares"" is a lovingly-crafted madness simulator.      Infinitap Studios strikes a forceful, gut-liquifying chord on their first foray into horror game-making. If you were to throw in a Cthulhu or two, the forum fanboys would be slavering. As it is, however, there's no eldritch forces pulling the strings in ""Neverending Nightmares"", only the fevered coding of a man who has experienced madness and sorrow without relief.      The mind behind this game, here we'll only call him Matt G., openly concedes that this game directly ties to the horror and pain in his own exeperinces with mental illness.  As such, gameplay is a constant drip of tense anxiety with each corridor, cupboard and cutscene and it never lets you off the hook. It's a constantly-dripping mindkcuf and it's GOOD.     I won't lie, ""Neverending Nightmares"" isn't for everyone. There's no escapism here.There's no HUD, no upgradable weapons, no unlockable weapons. No teamspeak.      In ""Neverending Nightmares"", you get a terrified young man in pyjamas, waking again in a gaslit bedroom after another nightmare. You won't get any points, but you will get to ride in a tortured mind and get to crawl around in his skin for a while - and that's something you don't see in a game too much.  You don't know a man until you've walked in his shoes and I take it that's kind of the whole point of this game.     Thanks to Matt G. and his dev team at Infinitap Games.  I don't know him, but I know where he's coming from. If nothing else, keep watching this studio.  They're swinging big, they're swinging hard, and their technique is flawless.    If you have the scratch and want to take a chance on ""Neverending Nightmares"", well...DO IT. If you don't like it, uninstall and take the refund. But I'm keeping mine and I'll be firing it back up right after I hug my wife and kid and let them know I love them more than anything. Good times,Doc Meow-30-			"

The Protag can't run for more than a few seconds before he gets winded and has to take a break, and also walks slow, which I find to be very frustrating. Admittedly, that was probably intentional, but it feels like there's a lot of empty rooms to pass through.			"

												★★★★☆☆☆☆☆☆ 4/10In short: Waking up, opening door and suffering from asthma simulator. People who like waking up (me included), opening doors (not my favourite thing to do to be honest) and those who suffer from asthma - please do not feel offended. I really enjoyed the unique art style and soundtrack though. Would recommend as part of a bundle, but screaming 14.99 euros for it is a little bit too much imho.  "

												This game is for jump scare feeling.So very few text to learn a bit of story.No map, it easily lost and don't know where you are.Yes, my play time is very short. From some fail and continue.(with unreasonable new scarier scene).I feel more boring from aimlessly walking+running foreword.(behind that is the fatty waiting to hunt you or the still background)If you are skilled with hide and seek.(the only thing you can)You may play this game more enjoy than me.

												Note: I bought this game on sale.Even though I haven't played it much at the time of posting this, I must say this is a great game; at least check it out. The graphics and music fit perfectly with the overall atmosphere of the game. It's a game that'll keep you on the edge and make you question when to stop playing it (since it is creepy) while also you compelling to you keep playing and see what happens. Pretty suspenseful. You do get the sense of walking in circles at times, though.			"

It is correct to say that it is better with headphones and in the dark in that, it has a spooky factor that is enhanced in those ways.

												So.. I got this game from bundle and I must say that it interested me a lot at the beginning. Jumpscares, atmosphere, music etc. I used to play it on late evenings with my headphones. Unfortunetly, when it came to asylum level it makes me so bored that I fall asleep. No more interesting jumpscares and such... just avoiding these blind creeps. I dont really get it - it seemed to be really good horror from the beginning. I am not a fan of games like that so I won't say if I recommend it or not. But for me it was huge disapointment,			"

There is no ""feelings"" when playing this game, i don't feel connected to it. it is very bland and short, i understand it is a continuous loop of nightmares but there is no fear because things are reused in the games design, maps, decorations, monsters, when you reuse these things people start to become desensitized really quickly. the art was really nice and it was a refreshing take on someones vision, but the game truly fell short.

It's decidedly creepy in places.It's a fairly shallow experience, where you basically walk through the levels until the end. I had seen that there are 2 other routes I could have taken to get to the end but the desire to do so wasn't there.The art style of this game is beautiful in places, bad in others.

The graphics are not so bad but there are 3 cutscenes I think most viewers will be sickened by.So if you are weak to bloody animations I wouldn't recommend it.the game overall is really terrifying and overall a nightmare like the games title.but I will say the game is definately better then a game that crashes all the time.So it gets a 7.9/10 over all its a pretty good game,recommend it if your into horror			"

												     ""Neverending Nighmares"" is a lovingly-crafted madness simulator.      Infinitap Studios strikes a forceful, gut-liquifying chord on their first foray into horror game-making. If you were to throw in a Cthulhu or two, the forum fanboys would be slavering. As it is, however, there's no eldritch forces pulling the strings in ""Neverending Nightmares"", only the fevered coding of a man who has experienced madness and sorrow without relief.      The mind behind this game, here we'll only call him Matt G., openly concedes that this game directly ties to the horror and pain in his own exeperinces with mental illness.  As such, gameplay is a constant drip of tense anxiety with each corridor, cupboard and cutscene and it never lets you off the hook. It's a constantly-dripping mindkcuf and it's GOOD.     I won't lie, ""Neverending Nightmares"" isn't for everyone. There's no escapism here.There's no HUD, no upgradable weapons, no unlockable weapons. No teamspeak.      In ""Neverending Nightmares"", you get a terrified young man in pyjamas, waking again in a gaslit bedroom after another nightmare. You won't get any points, but you will get to ride in a tortured mind and get to crawl around in his skin for a while - and that's something you don't see in a game too much.  You don't know a man until you've walked in his shoes and I take it that's kind of the whole point of this game.     Thanks to Matt G. and his dev team at Infinitap Games.  I don't know him, but I know where he's coming from. If nothing else, keep watching this studio.  They're swinging big, they're swinging hard, and their technique is flawless.    If you have the scratch and want to take a chance on ""Neverending Nightmares"", well...DO IT. If you don't like it, uninstall and take the refund. But I'm keeping mine and I'll be firing it back up right after I hug my wife and kid and let them know I love them more than anything. Good times,Doc Meow-30-			"

												Neverending Nightmares is a fun little horror game. It kind of looks like a storybook in its art style, which works pretty well. The game is genuinely scary, especially when wearing headphones. It is incredibly short though. It only took me 90 mins to finish. I did only get one of the 3 possible endings but I didn't feel like I needed to play through again two more times to see those. I paid $7.50 for it, if you really like horror games that's a good price, otherwise wait for a better deal.			"

Worth getting if you're in need of some Halloween chills, but ONLY if you can get it at a significant discount. For my part -- there appear to be three alternate endings, but nothing in the world could get me to walk through this again right now. Maybe next Halloween.			"

You just get the feeling you neeed to get away from what's chasing you. As Markiplier did, you constantly play green light red light with the monsters. Generally, was it worth the humble bundle price I payed for it? (I'm not ashamed to say I got a very large discount) Hell yes it is. If it's really cheap, pick up this game. But if it's not on sale, and still has that 15 dollar asking price? Wait for a sale.			"

												Neverending Nightmares may not be some ground breaking game, but it's certaintly not a bad one.It has it's moments when it comes to the ""horror"" aspect. Nothing too terryfing, just lovely instances from time to time that can make your heart skip a beat. But it's not really the kind of horror that's trying to be stressful, and make a player panic every other minute. It's strenght is more in the story, creepiness of the enviroment, overall confusion and mystery. The art style of the game is nice. It's simplistic yet creppy, and fits the atmosphere perfectly.There is a thing that not everyone may like and it's the gameplay itself. It is very simple. You won't find any puzzles to solve, items to carry around, brain teasers which would seem unsolvable only to make you feel like an idiot when you finally figure them out (or look for the answer on the internet). None of that.You also can't fight enemies, which is fine, but running away from them or avoiding them is also very easy to do.You basically walk around all the time which may feel a little boring after a while. Thankfully levels, and the game itself, aren't too long, and the enviroment changes so it's not that big of a deal.So if you don't mind all that, you know that hunger for answers will keep you going and you want to play a nice little horror game, then Neveredning Nightmares is a great recomendation.

												This game was *great!* It thoroughly delivered on the scares. The jump scares were effective; even when I was expecting one to pop up, it still managed to get a yelp out of me. The atmosphere was great; the art style and music really helped add a feeling of dread. The sound effects got very repetitive towards the end, though; the one of the woman crying started driving me crazy. The psychology behind it was also great! Like the creator, I live with mental illness and I identified with a lot of the emotion and struggle behind it. There aren't many puzzles and the gameplay is minimal, but it's more about the atmosphere than about the gameplay with a game like this in my opinion. All in all, though, this game delivered on the scares, and that's what I bought it for. 7/10.			"

Its pros include:+ Good horror atmosphere+ Theme of the game, focused on nightmares and depression+ Original graphics+ Good music+ Nonconvential gameplay+ Several endings – at first I was trying to figure out, how the three endings fit together (had my own theory), but the developer explained in some discussion that these are in fact three separate storiesOften criticized is the game's length. I think the game is ok the way it is, but I would welcome some more content in the future (DLC, sequel, …), since I enjoyed the ride (or the walk to be more specific).			"

I think I may have been♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥if I bought it for a full price, since its a little short and needs multiple playthroughs for all endings. But since I bought it during steam sales it was totally worth it.If you're OK with the fact that this is ""not really"" a game, und you're into experimental stuff, then I'd recommend it for you guys out there. Anyhow, I'd wait for a steam sale before buying it for the full price. The standard price is a little overpriced, as  the full experience is rather quite short			"

												Neverending Nightmares is a short little game, but I would definitely recommend that any horror fan take the time to play through it. The one thing that I would strongly caution people of, is that there are parts of the game that are deeply unsettling particularly to anyone dealing with depression or self-harm issues, as some of the cutscenes and visuals strike pretty close to home in those areas. That being said, it's worth taking the time for.The storyline is good, a simple premise that is told in an interesting way, while being relatively easy to follow. The cutscenes are informative, but not overly long and they don't distract the player from the game too much.The gameplay itself is simple, and therefore easy enough to pick up, meaning you can jump right into the game itself without any lengthy tuturials, which is great. There aren't very many controls as the actions of your character are limited, but this simply fuels your desire not to run into any enemies, which is good since you really have no way to combat them. I tend to find that in horror titles, enemies that you can't fight have a higher psychological toll on the player and are therefore more effective generally speaking.The thing that I love most about this game is the artwork. The visual style of the game is incredibly unique and despite not being a terrifying style in and of itself, it's used in a way that adds to the atmosphere very well. The predominantly black and white color scheme is accented perfectly with just the items of importance being colored, which is a nice way to guide the player through the game without specifically telling them what to do. It also makes for some of the most visually appealing blood I've ever seen in a video game, just because the red on the black and white makes such a shark contrast.The one issue that I really had with the game was how slow the gameplay was in certain areas. As someone that doesn't have the best sense of direction, I had a tough time through some of the levels in regards to knowing where to go. I couldn't remember where I had been which made knowing which way to go difficult, and it became a bit tedious trying to figure it out when the character moves so slowly (though the slow movement speed does add suspense in a few places.) I also became annoyed only being able to use the run function for short distances, but it was a minor inconvenience.All in all, I would rate this game very highly and would feel good suggesting it to just about anyone.

												A great little indie horror game here! Not a ton of content but there is 4 different endings so the replay value is high. Mostly this is a walking sim with a ton of atmosphere but the way it is put together & it's story being open to your personal interpretation gives it a unique feel among similar games. I'm not gonna BS you, the game is short & lacks any type of real gameplay (i.e. no way to fight back against enemies, not much interaction with the enviroment) so if you're looking for horror game with action this not for you. On the other hand if you're looking for a unique horror experience & not adverse to more of an experience than a game this may be for you. IMO the only real con about this game is the price, I feel that $15 is a little steep for what it offers but if you can get it on sale I highly recommend this game.			"

												Recommended if on Sale. Very small game for the large price tag.A very short little foray into horror (like 1-2 hours), Neverending Nightmares definitely gets the adrenaline flowing, but leaves you hanging without a real punchy climax or a decent amount of context for what the game is about. There are 3 endings to get, but overall, you might want to sit this one out, lest it go on sale. It's price tag is ridiculous for what you get in the end, which stinks because this game is genuinely spooky at times.			"

												This game is a landmark in creating awareness in an epidemic which plagues many people in the world today: asthma. The developer has asthma himself, and by the end of the game, you will know what it feels like to walk a mile in his shoes. It brought me closer to my girlfriend who has asthma as well, and now I make sure to keep her spare inhaler with me at all times in case zombies or living dolls attack.			"

												This game is not for everyone, but for those it IS for - horror fans with a penchant for the disturbed and a slow burn to keep you on edge, rather than the gore  and jump scares that permeate modern horror - it will resonate within your psyche for a while. If you like fast-paced action, obvious story, open-world exploration, or your sanity, please move on, because you will find none of that here. However, for what this game is - an atmospheric horror game with an ambiguous story open to interpretation - it's fantastic. The game is short. There are 4 possible endings, and as of this review, I've completed 2 of them with only 2.4 hours on record, and even then there were a few times when I left the keyboard for a few minutes or would intentionally do something stupid just to see what would happen. Your first playthrough will only take about two hours (maybe less), then you can use a waypoint-like system to revisit earlier chapters to get to the other endings. I'm estimating 4-5 hours for completion of all 4 endings (assuming you use a spoiler-free guide to know where the branching points are, like I did).The game is very linear. But that's not always a bad thing. Not every game needs to be an open-world Bethesda behemoth. Linear works great for this game. It's high tension, and it manages to encourage exploration while still discouraging you from getting too far off the intended path. I won't explain how - because spoilers - but that's a tough act to balance, and this game does it without breaking the atmosphere.The art is, put simply, evocative. It holds multiple layers of detail. There were countless times when I took a closer look at a scene or a room I'd walked through before and realized the nuances I hadn't consciously observed prior, but at some level I know I witnessed them unconsciously and they added to the overall atmosphere.Don't even get me started on the soundtrack. Oh my god the soundtrack. I want the soundtrack as a standalone purchase for my horror-themed events. It's amazing background ambience, and it's superbly mixed with haunting sound effects to deliver an experience like none other, especially through headphones (the game highly recommends headphones and utilizes a special audio mixer for that immersive experience).

												TL:DR: this game is an expensive flash gameThe game has an interesting concept, but fails to make any relevant progress. It tries to become a survival horror, but takes shortcuts that make it feel more like a flash game than a full product. The best comparison is with P.T. which uses a similar idea: revisiting the same small area with minor changes at every iteration. Unfortunately, the game has you go into several rooms with no real progression. Each time you make a startling discovery or die, and end up in your bed. but the time to reach that climax is slow, stagnant, with an abrupt change. It lacks crescendo. There is a bare-bones stealth area where you hide in a closet while a grotesque baby-faced grunt shakes it. This mechanic is poorly developed, as you only have two directions to flee, and it is a matter of waiting until they are off-screen. I played one session and did not return, because only 1/5 of the game is actually content, and relies heavily on jump scares and exploration of mostly static environments. Items that you do examine are paintings with no interest or plot progression, as if they were added for either showing off artistic skills or lengthening gameplay. "

												Asthma Simulator 2015.Seriously tho. I play every game about mental illnesses i can get my hands on and own piles of books about them, but the most nightmarish and disturbing thing about this game was the choice between moving at a snail's pace or running for 5 seconds and then stop and wheeze. It began really good, then everything repeated more or less eternally, while you struggle to move on...I can see, that this was a point the author may actually wanted to make, but it just turned out to be tedious, while it offered very little to make up for it. If it ends up in a bundle, i would recommend to try it out, but for 15 Euros (or 7 Euros for which I got it in the humble store) it isn't worth it in my opinion.			"

												This is a wonderful and eerie game.Its art style is thoughtfully curated, and reminiscent of Edward Gorey macabre illustrations.It's not a game about fighting, or running away from enemies, but one about an increasing sense of discomfort and tension. A deep sensation of wrongness ebbs from it, while you play, thanks to the maze of similar rooms creating confusion and preventing you from ever feel safe, and the masterfully crafted sound effects and music accompanying your actions.The most important aspects of this game are its atmosphere and its tone, and those are certainly excellent.If you let yourself immerse in this weird unsettling world of nightmares and weird dreams you are going to love it.

												Neverending Nightmares is an interesting, though short game. As someone who regularly seeks out horror in all its forms, I must say that this game really got under my skin. It felt visceral and even disturbing at times. I would recommend only looking up guides or playthroughs after your first playthrough if you desire to see the other paths. While the additional paths themselves don't seem to provide much more in the way of information, they do all contribute their own little bit to the overall mystery and narrative. If you are a fan of horror, and of walking, I would heartily recommend this.			"

												This game was *great!* It thoroughly delivered on the scares. The jump scares were effective; even when I was expecting one to pop up, it still managed to get a yelp out of me. The atmosphere was great; the art style and music really helped add a feeling of dread. The sound effects got very repetitive towards the end, though; the one of the woman crying started driving me crazy. The psychology behind it was also great! Like the creator, I live with mental illness and I identified with a lot of the emotion and struggle behind it. There aren't many puzzles and the gameplay is minimal, but it's more about the atmosphere than about the gameplay with a game like this in my opinion. All in all, though, this game delivered on the scares, and that's what I bought it for. 7/10.			"

												This is such a bizarre, f**ked up horror game. I really don't know what to think of it. What I do know is that it has STYLE like no other. Amazing art style (it's mostly black and white with splashes of color for effect) and absolutely AMAZING sound direction (seriously, play it with headphones and turn on their headphone mode in the sound settings).This game will leave you confused, stressed, distraught, and at many times all around disgusted. It's definitely not for everyone (I remind you, it's extremely f**ked up), but it knows what it wants to be and it pulls no punches. If that's something you can get behind, this is definitely worth checking out. One of my favorite games of 2015.			"

												This is a surprisingly great game for such a simple thing. I can say, in all honesty, this game is making me nervous. I can also honestly say, I've never played anything like it....in terms of the gradual build of fear and tension is quite remarkable. I've played a few horro games....and most go for the usual ""made you jump"" scares. A few do what this one does. The game is based on the developers personal dealings with (one particular kind of) mental illness. This makes the game even more fascinating and horrible ....In a good way? Good for us. You will be sure it wasn't good for him. I wouldn't have imagined that a bunch of somewhat squiggly line drawings (well done though) would wind up getting under my skin. He uses the art style to impressive effect. If you're looking for something different, something disturbing ,that plays mind tricks as well as throwing in the sudden scary images and weirdness, this game is the one.I forgot to add, headphones are a must.Edit: ------I occassionaly feel the urge to stop playing because it really unnerves me that this poor guy was dealing with this level of madness. ON THE OTHER HAND.....I don't like it when mental ""illness"" (they have to come up with a better term) is always portrayed as sopmething horrifying and violent. You see on the newsw how they make blanket statements concerning some terrible incident , lilke a school shooting, in which mentally ill is used with extreme negativity....as if there's only one kind of mental illness . And that it always ends in violence and death. I have someone inmy family who is bipolar. Yeah, he can get pretty out there....liek a person on speed or something. But, he doesn'thurt other people. Sadly, he hurts himself. So, there's that. Inthis fellows case, I believe he suffered from breaks from reality due to schizophrenia. They are the specific type of mental illness that can evolve into violence. This isk because the person is so disconnected from the real world and normal thinking, that they could very well hurt others believing they were a threat....or that they're demonic or some other thing. People with depression are more likely to hurt themselves. Autistic kids can turn violent as they get older. I don't know enough to tell you why. My point is, there are many different diagnosis that fall under the same umbrella.....and that's really not helpful in any way.			"

												This game is very disturbing in every way that it intends to be. The enemy designs are very chilling and seeing any of them made my heart race. The atmosphere was amazing and I always felt alone and scared. The music was nightmarish at times, it definitely compliments the great atmosphere. The only thing about this game is that it's more of an artistic represintation of the developers battle with insanity than an actual game. I have no problem with it, I loved this game, but those who are looking for a more interactive experince may be let down. The game isn't very long, either. If you don't see yourself happy with about two hours of game time for the price then you may want to pass this up. At least until it's on sale, in which case I highly recommend you get it. Neverending Nightmares was a fantastic experience, and it has been one of the few horror games that I have finished and didn't stop thinking about it. The way the game is presented is fantastic and I would love to something else from the creator of this game. TL;DR Fantastic horror experience with a rich atmosphere and chilling designs that is well worth your money, just so long as you don't mind the small length of the game(about 2 hours). 8/10			"

												This is not just some old horror with cheap scares and cliche antagonists. This is an artist's expression, the developer's impression of their own first-hand experiences with OCD and depression. It will have you on edge, heart in your throat and begging for an end. But you can't stop.The art style is very bleak, with few colours (usually on interative objects) and reminiscent of a childerens' picture book, which reflects well with the game's story and message. The gameplay is very basic, almost being an interactive story, but with the occasional challenge when you come accross one of the game's few 'enemies'.That is all I shall reveal, if you are looking for a horror experience that looks futher than cheap cliches, this game is for you. Give it a go!			"

												I don't find this game to be very entertaining. It's pretty slow and repetitive. The mechanics are simple, so once you get them figured out you just... keep moving forward. The Protag can't run for more than a few seconds before he gets winded and has to take a break, and also walks slow, which I find to be very frustrating. Admittedly, that was probably intentional, but it feels like there's a lot of empty rooms to pass through.			"

												I've wanted to play Neverending Nightmares for quite some time, and now that I have I can say that I really enjoyed it.The first thing that drew me in was the art style, it's a little different to a lot of what's out there, especially within the genre. The art style is also very fitting for the game and its subject matter. Then the story itself was intriguing to me, as someone fascinated with dreams and nightmares who experiences a lot of both the premise meant the game was bound to interest me.Yes, the game is rather short, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. I often enjoy short games, they can be just the thing when you fancy playing something but have other things going on. It also keeps the game from being repetitive, in order to make this game longer a lot of new creatures and endings would have needed to be added, by which point the plot would run the risk of getting stretched too thin. I feel like Neverending Nightmares strikes the perfect balance for those who don't mind if a game is short.As far as how scary this game is, that'd depend on what gets to you, for instance, for a person afraid of dolls a large portion of this game would be very creepy. For me there were other things that would creep me out, I'm afraid of the dark and stairs make me very uneasy. They have covered a lot of based and there were a couple of bits where I jumped (although I'm admittedly easily startled).Lastly, I'd say that while I definitely recommend this game to people who don't mind a short psychological horror experience that isn't action-oriented, if you are sensitive to imagery or references to suicide or self harm then this game will likely not be for you, so basically, player discretion is advised.

												As gaming matures so does it’s themes. In recent years there has been a slew of more or less interactive games about mental illnesses, perhaps the most discussed being Depression Quest. Neverending Nightmares is also said to be based on the developers own experience living with ocd and depression, but where Depression Quest was a choose-your-own-adventure text based game this time we have a proper adventure game. Or what at first glance looks like a proper game. Yes there is a character to control and progress to be made but don’t be fooled to think there is much more gameplay here. The whole game consists of walking endless corridors, sometimes opening doors or clumsily trying to avoid a few monsters. The striking art style is admirable, in still pictures it resembles some crude underground comic from yesteryear and in motion the facial expressions and body language of the main character helps transfer a feeling of utter despair and terror as you blindly navigate the endless corridors. But here also lies it’s main problem - sure the atmosphere is there but it’s not used to tell the gamer anything, the story is non-existent until the very end. While I can sympathise with the design decision to keep with the theme of a looping, never ending nightmare it also takes away the incentive to keep playing as you are not given any reason to do so. In the end it was an empty experience more filled with boredom than horror.			"

												NEN is an interesting game. I backed this on Kickstarter because the creator had an interesting idea I wanted to see flourish into a game. I purchased this and didn't immediately play it but I did save the game for my 2014 Extra-Life charity stream. I played through, and beat, the game in about 1.5 hours. Those 1.5 hours weren't exceptionally difficult nor were they thought provoking. The only reason the things in the game meant anything to me was because I Kickstarted the game and knew that the game creator focused the game around his own anxieties and fears. This doesn't really come through in the game if you don't know those things.I hate to base a review around the price of a game but I don't know...this is a coin toss for me. I'm going to not recommend this game. All you do is walk left or right...there aren't any puzzles, there isn't any dialogue, the scares are telegraphed and not especially scary (subjective, I know), and the short nature of the game make it really hard to recommend. If you want to pick it up I would say get it as cheap as possible. Your mileage may vary but I felt this was a huge letdown.			"

												This game doesn't strike me as a game under the usual terms (minus the few super annoying bits). The entire thing is crafted by someone who is personally connected to it and it shows. It won't be for everyone. I feel like it is a strong experience, not even just as a game. This is what art is, game aside. It is a well thought through project and almost each aspect definately agonized over. The visuals are stunningly different, stark and constantly changing. It feel monotonous and confusing as you play like the feelings trying to be shown by the character. The lack of colouration makes the crosshatching and pops of colour really work and the layers of marks for darkness give darkness something more than blank black, almost character. I'd love to see the assets for this game turned into a comic.Where this game does fall down is in execution of interactivity. I 100%ed this game in like 4 hours, despite the character walking so slowly and being almost incapable of running. The Ai in the game is also very rudimentary and movement is stilted and weird.   DO NOT PLAY WITHOUT HEADPHONES AND BE READY FOR USE OF BINAURAL BEATSit will make you feel weird and sink into the game more, it made me uncomfortable which was the creators desired effect. I may have liked a warning as to what the ""special headphone mix"" was though.One last thing this is the first game I've played that made use of the lighting effects on my alienware and it was sweet.

												A dreamlike exploration of living with mental illness, Neverending Nightmares gets a lot of mileage out of a rather constrained setting. Even before the branching plotlines and multiple endings, the game's trio of primary settings offer more than enough dread to deal with.Despite its admitted inspiration in struggles with OCD and depression, Neverending Nightmares opts for a more metaphorical take on its subject matter than anything literal. The game looks at what such struggles feel like, or felt like for the creator at least, through the lens of horror rather than attempting to recount the experience directly. The bulk of the game involves waking up to an eerie, foreboding environment that only slightly changes with each return to supposed consciousness. Every wakeup is followed by a new attempt to find a way out of these increasingly imposing scenarios, searching each area for new tools to progress and usually ending in an unexpectedly horrible way. As things progress, human-but-not-quite creatures join the environment in trying to stop you, but never quite to the point of being a showdown. Even though this realm is apparently your own mind, you have no real power here.The game's monochrome visual style is striking and memorable, with some interesting techniques used to add gloom and otherwise obfuscate areas when necessary. The only color that comes into play is red, which is used selectively but liberally for gore when warranted. The soundtrack is subtle, but haunting, and what few sounds the handful of enemies make when you encounter them are enough on their own to make it clear they should be avoided.Neverending Nightmares does a great job of managing difficulty as well. Puzzles often rely on a bit of wandering at first to trigger certain appearances, but don't feel overly drawn out. Enemies are easy enough to avoid in most cases, with later encounters taking a bit more strategy, and the consequences for failure feel justified but horrifying. As things increase in difficulty and complexity, levels offer checkpoints to keep repetition down.The multiple endings aren't overly numerous, and I liked how it wasn't entirely clear which one, if any of them, was the ""real"" ending. As you finish the game, a level map unlocks, showing threads between what you've cleared thus far and making it easier to figure out where you should be looking for alternate choices to enable different progress. All in all, this is one neat little horror package, and the connection it has to the developer's personal experience makes it that much more worthwhile.Here's a little peek at what you're in for, if you're curious:

												A game which I wished would never end. Unfortunately, it did. But despite the shortness, even when playing all possible endings of this game, I enjoyed every single minute of it. The atmosphere in this game was really breathtaking, depressed and even made me anxious from time to time.Drawing style what this game has, is fitting on the story really well. In different visuals this game would have been totally different and I think it would have made the game worse. I enjoyed it!			"

												Small and quite scary, and at time very disturbing game - good entertainment and controller support makes it perfect for playing tucked under the blanket on the sofa on a dark stormy night. Some of the walking in hallways does get a bit long-winded and they could have shortened this down or made it a bit more interesting. This is made up for by the level of detail all over the place, scary paintings, creepy dolls and so on.Expect to play about 4 hours exploring every possible place. "

												I think this was the best 3rd or 4th best horror game in my opinion ever! When I first saw the trailer it looked like such a good game. It made me want to play it XD. It looked like the game was based of a book with that type of style. When I started playing I fell in love with the main character quickly. Some parts scared me and some parts got me grossed out and that's how a horror game is good. :3			"

												Don’t let the hand-drawn look of this game fool you (though this was one of the things that first brought this game to my attention), for it is profoundly disturbing and deeply psychological.  There is the stark contrast of black and white throughout, often offset by traces of blood and certain other colors for objects that you can interact with.  Perhaps interact isn’t the proper word to use here; more like ‘look’ at, as this game doesn’t utilize an inventory system and there are no collectibles of any kind to pick up along the way.  Also, it’s extremely short and likely won’t take you more than 30 – 45 min. to complete, though there are a few different endings of sorts, and branching pathways leading up to said endings for you to discover, which adds replay value.  The length is the only gripe I can envision people having with Unending Nightmares, especially when considering the $15 price tag, so you may want to get it when it’s on sale. Some may find the lack of objectives/puzzle elements and an inventory system as something to complain about, but I personally found those aspects of this game to be something of a breath of fresh air that in no way seems to detract from the allure of this game.  The psychological aspect of Unending Nightmares harkens back to the earlier days of Silent Hill; its often disjointed plot progression does make sense (at least a little bit) in the end, but regardless of what you may think about that, you’ll be left feeling the same sense of confusion/fear/loss that the protagonist (Thomas) suffers through, which are emotions too few games horror games elicit in the player. And lastly, let’s not forget about one of the most important (arguably THE most important) aspect of any horror game – the sound. The sound design of Unending Nightmares is, in a word, remarkable; vastly more balanced and disturbing than I would have expected from an indie horror game. The effects and ambience are truly haunting and will stay with you long after you finish playing the game. The snatches of speech throughout are also nice and the voice acting is decent despite the brief nature of these moments in the game.I definitely recommend that you give this game a chance, and even if you can’t get it on sale, all the aforementioned aspects work so well together that you won’t regret paying full price.  Definitely a gem in a flagging genre that is increasingly becoming riddled with games that developers have put little effort into making a compelling experience in the way they once were.			"

I like the art choice and the ambient noises really make this game come alive. The once in a while scare from an unexpected shadow or two and the sight of your sister hanging coupled with the discovered of your dead body. The Never Ending Nightmare may not be a long game, but it will be a fun one.

												Excellent art, with such find attention to detail and nuance.  Although I found the art style immediately compelling, I was a little concerned that it would prevent me from getting creeped out.  That was a foolish concern, the game does a gret job of building tension and dread, and providing some satisfying creepiness.  I had the computer hooked up to the television so my partner could watch as I played, and there was one moment were we both actually shouted and jumped out of our seats,  one of the jumps scares got us so good.  (Though note, there are very few jump scares in the game, it most relies on atmosphere, story, and sound for it's scares.)Apparently there are several story branches, and it looks like you do get some differences in game play at a certain point toward the end of the game.  So it may offer some replay value for those of you who like to see all the different endings.			"

The only bad part is that i think this game is bit too expensive, because i played this game through in like 2 hours + some hours to get all endings.But the game itself is great, i liked Amnesia: The Dark Descent and i was sure im gonna like this also, and i did! <:			"

												I don't find this game to be very entertaining. It's pretty slow and repetitive. The mechanics are simple, so once you get them figured out you just... keep moving forward. The Protag can't run for more than a few seconds before he gets winded and has to take a break, and also walks slow, which I find to be very frustrating. Admittedly, that was probably intentional, but it feels like there's a lot of empty rooms to pass through.			"

												NEN is an interesting game. I backed this on Kickstarter because the creator had an interesting idea I wanted to see flourish into a game. I purchased this and didn't immediately play it but I did save the game for my 2014 Extra-Life charity stream. I played through, and beat, the game in about 1.5 hours. Those 1.5 hours weren't exceptionally difficult nor were they thought provoking. The only reason the things in the game meant anything to me was because I Kickstarted the game and knew that the game creator focused the game around his own anxieties and fears. This doesn't really come through in the game if you don't know those things.I hate to base a review around the price of a game but I don't know...this is a coin toss for me. I'm going to not recommend this game. All you do is walk left or right...there aren't any puzzles, there isn't any dialogue, the scares are telegraphed and not especially scary (subjective, I know), and the short nature of the game make it really hard to recommend. If you want to pick it up I would say get it as cheap as possible. Your mileage may vary but I felt this was a huge letdown.			"

												I've wanted to play Neverending Nightmares for quite some time, and now that I have I can say that I really enjoyed it.The first thing that drew me in was the art style, it's a little different to a lot of what's out there, especially within the genre. The art style is also very fitting for the game and its subject matter. Then the story itself was intriguing to me, as someone fascinated with dreams and nightmares who experiences a lot of both the premise meant the game was bound to interest me.Yes, the game is rather short, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. I often enjoy short games, they can be just the thing when you fancy playing something but have other things going on. It also keeps the game from being repetitive, in order to make this game longer a lot of new creatures and endings would have needed to be added, by which point the plot would run the risk of getting stretched too thin. I feel like Neverending Nightmares strikes the perfect balance for those who don't mind if a game is short.As far as how scary this game is, that'd depend on what gets to you, for instance, for a person afraid of dolls a large portion of this game would be very creepy. For me there were other things that would creep me out, I'm afraid of the dark and stairs make me very uneasy. They have covered a lot of based and there were a couple of bits where I jumped (although I'm admittedly easily startled).Lastly, I'd say that while I definitely recommend this game to people who don't mind a short psychological horror experience that isn't action-oriented, if you are sensitive to imagery or references to suicide or self harm then this game will likely not be for you, so basically, player discretion is advised.

The cryptic storyline makes you draw your own conclusions and even question what really happened.Your character walks slowly and can't run for long, which adds to your vulnerability. You can't kill enemies, just avoid them. You run through a series of doors and rooms in repeating waking nightmares.The hand drawn art style is unique, detailed and looks great. There is plenty of disturbing imagery, a few jump scares, and some subtle creepy moments. When it's on sale, I can easily recommend it to other fans of the genre!			"

												Neverending Nightmares exceded my expectations! It's both thoughtful and fun. The atmosphere is wonderful (it feels as though you're stuck in an Edward Gorey drawing) and terrifying, and reminiscent of so many classic ghost stories. The controls are simple and the game is easy to play, but the structure of the narrative makes it never get boring, Also, the sound is incredible and adds so much to the experience as a whole.			"

												Pros:-Very Atmospheric.-Has a very interesting graphic design.-Some what great story.-Choices.-Great choice of soundtrack which adds some creepyness in the game.-Nice lighting system to represent the darkness.Cons:-The sprinting system, while you will be sprinting you're still going to be the slowest character in the game and constantly run out of breath for every 5 seconds which can be frustrating.-Lack of things to do within so many rooms in the game, mostly just explore and look around.-Lack of backstory and explanation to different endings within the game.-Can get really boring if you get lost on one of the chapters and then you start walking circles.I would recommend this game to anyone who is afraid of the dark, play this with headphones in the dark in the middle of the night for the best horror experience.

												NEN is an interesting game. I backed this on Kickstarter because the creator had an interesting idea I wanted to see flourish into a game. I purchased this and didn't immediately play it but I did save the game for my 2014 Extra-Life charity stream. I played through, and beat, the game in about 1.5 hours. Those 1.5 hours weren't exceptionally difficult nor were they thought provoking. The only reason the things in the game meant anything to me was because I Kickstarted the game and knew that the game creator focused the game around his own anxieties and fears. This doesn't really come through in the game if you don't know those things.I hate to base a review around the price of a game but I don't know...this is a coin toss for me. I'm going to not recommend this game. All you do is walk left or right...there aren't any puzzles, there isn't any dialogue, the scares are telegraphed and not especially scary (subjective, I know), and the short nature of the game make it really hard to recommend. If you want to pick it up I would say get it as cheap as possible. Your mileage may vary but I felt this was a huge letdown.			"

												As gaming matures so does it’s themes. In recent years there has been a slew of more or less interactive games about mental illnesses, perhaps the most discussed being Depression Quest. Neverending Nightmares is also said to be based on the developers own experience living with ocd and depression, but where Depression Quest was a choose-your-own-adventure text based game this time we have a proper adventure game. Or what at first glance looks like a proper game. Yes there is a character to control and progress to be made but don’t be fooled to think there is much more gameplay here. The whole game consists of walking endless corridors, sometimes opening doors or clumsily trying to avoid a few monsters. The striking art style is admirable, in still pictures it resembles some crude underground comic from yesteryear and in motion the facial expressions and body language of the main character helps transfer a feeling of utter despair and terror as you blindly navigate the endless corridors. But here also lies it’s main problem - sure the atmosphere is there but it’s not used to tell the gamer anything, the story is non-existent until the very end. While I can sympathise with the design decision to keep with the theme of a looping, never ending nightmare it also takes away the incentive to keep playing as you are not given any reason to do so. In the end it was an empty experience more filled with boredom than horror.			"

												★★★★☆☆☆☆☆☆ 4/10In short: Waking up, opening door and suffering from asthma simulator. People who like waking up (me included), opening doors (not my favourite thing to do to be honest) and those who suffer from asthma - please do not feel offended. I really enjoyed the unique art style and soundtrack though. Would recommend as part of a bundle, but screaming 14.99 euros for it is a little bit too much imho.  "

												A dreamlike exploration of living with mental illness, Neverending Nightmares gets a lot of mileage out of a rather constrained setting. Even before the branching plotlines and multiple endings, the game's trio of primary settings offer more than enough dread to deal with.Despite its admitted inspiration in struggles with OCD and depression, Neverending Nightmares opts for a more metaphorical take on its subject matter than anything literal. The game looks at what such struggles feel like, or felt like for the creator at least, through the lens of horror rather than attempting to recount the experience directly. The bulk of the game involves waking up to an eerie, foreboding environment that only slightly changes with each return to supposed consciousness. Every wakeup is followed by a new attempt to find a way out of these increasingly imposing scenarios, searching each area for new tools to progress and usually ending in an unexpectedly horrible way. As things progress, human-but-not-quite creatures join the environment in trying to stop you, but never quite to the point of being a showdown. Even though this realm is apparently your own mind, you have no real power here.The game's monochrome visual style is striking and memorable, with some interesting techniques used to add gloom and otherwise obfuscate areas when necessary. The only color that comes into play is red, which is used selectively but liberally for gore when warranted. The soundtrack is subtle, but haunting, and what few sounds the handful of enemies make when you encounter them are enough on their own to make it clear they should be avoided.Neverending Nightmares does a great job of managing difficulty as well. Puzzles often rely on a bit of wandering at first to trigger certain appearances, but don't feel overly drawn out. Enemies are easy enough to avoid in most cases, with later encounters taking a bit more strategy, and the consequences for failure feel justified but horrifying. As things increase in difficulty and complexity, levels offer checkpoints to keep repetition down.The multiple endings aren't overly numerous, and I liked how it wasn't entirely clear which one, if any of them, was the ""real"" ending. As you finish the game, a level map unlocks, showing threads between what you've cleared thus far and making it easier to figure out where you should be looking for alternate choices to enable different progress. All in all, this is one neat little horror package, and the connection it has to the developer's personal experience makes it that much more worthwhile.Here's a little peek at what you're in for, if you're curious:

												Neverending Nightmares may not be some ground breaking game, but it's certaintly not a bad one.It has it's moments when it comes to the ""horror"" aspect. Nothing too terryfing, just lovely instances from time to time that can make your heart skip a beat. But it's not really the kind of horror that's trying to be stressful, and make a player panic every other minute. It's strenght is more in the story, creepiness of the enviroment, overall confusion and mystery. The art style of the game is nice. It's simplistic yet creppy, and fits the atmosphere perfectly.There is a thing that not everyone may like and it's the gameplay itself. It is very simple. You won't find any puzzles to solve, items to carry around, brain teasers which would seem unsolvable only to make you feel like an idiot when you finally figure them out (or look for the answer on the internet). None of that.You also can't fight enemies, which is fine, but running away from them or avoiding them is also very easy to do.You basically walk around all the time which may feel a little boring after a while. Thankfully levels, and the game itself, aren't too long, and the enviroment changes so it's not that big of a deal.So if you don't mind all that, you know that hunger for answers will keep you going and you want to play a nice little horror game, then Neveredning Nightmares is a great recomendation.

												Excellent art, with such find attention to detail and nuance.  Although I found the art style immediately compelling, I was a little concerned that it would prevent me from getting creeped out.  That was a foolish concern, the game does a gret job of building tension and dread, and providing some satisfying creepiness.  I had the computer hooked up to the television so my partner could watch as I played, and there was one moment were we both actually shouted and jumped out of our seats,  one of the jumps scares got us so good.  (Though note, there are very few jump scares in the game, it most relies on atmosphere, story, and sound for it's scares.)Apparently there are several story branches, and it looks like you do get some differences in game play at a certain point toward the end of the game.  So it may offer some replay value for those of you who like to see all the different endings.			"

The pencil graphics are fantastic and are able to represent this game amazingly. I would recommend to the person who is bored of normal horror games such as FNAF and Amnesia. It will scare you, annoy you, and make you feel for the creator of this game all at the same time. BTW, little girls in white dresses STILL are not ok to go near...			"
