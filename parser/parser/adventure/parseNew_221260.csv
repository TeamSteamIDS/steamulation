												Little Inferno is one strange beast of a game. Upon startup, the game immediately presents nothing but a fireplace, and tasks players with simply burning the few letters they have with them. Immediately afterward, a catalog is sent, and the rest of the game is spent purchasing items and setting them aflame, watching the strange animations each item has. My first reaction, upon realizing what the game had in store for me, was ""They made a whole game out of this?""The humorous thing about this game, though, is that it WANTS you to feel that way. In fact, it encourages it by making you wait long, painful periods of time - upwards of a couple minutes - for your new kindling to arrive. And yet, for whatever reason, I found myself enjoying the experience. It was strangely appealing, setting things ablaze, and I wanted to see what would come of my neighbor, who continuously sent me letters. So I kept playing for 3 hours straight.In the end, the game throws a massive twist on you. I don't want to spoil too much, but let's just say that I was completely thrown for a loop and felt like quite a fool for having spent such a long time playing the game. This isn't a criticism to Little Inferno; rather, this is the highest praise the game could achieve, because it is exactly what the developers sought to accomplish.A couple of days after playing Little Inferno, I can't help but reflect on it fondly and reminisce. A remarkable work of satire, I truly believe this game will be remembered for all time as one of the most humorously self-aware experiences this medium has ever created. Well done, Tomorrow Corp.

												I beat this game in 3 hours. It's an amazing game. When I bought it with the Humble Bundle, I expected it to be this lame indie game about burning stuff. Imagine my surprise when I realized that I beat the game in one session 3 hours later. The visuals are amazing. The cracking sound of burning embers is so relaxing. It was so relaxing just watching the fire and hearing the flames spread.Furthermore, the story is captivating. I excitedly opened each envelope and laughed and cried along with the characters. The  ending was amazing. I really felt the characters.My only complaint is that it gets a bit repetitive towards the end. By then, I caught myself buying random stuff and burning them immediately, haha. However, the combos prevented this, and it was extremely fun trying out different things.Visuals: 10/10 - Amazing dynamic flamesSound: 9/10 - Amazing sound of burning embersStory: 10/10 - Captivating storyGameplay: 8/10 - Fun, but a bit repetitive. I'm not sure if the replay value is good.-------------------Overall: 9/10I heartily and warmly recommend this game.			"

												It's very polished, the music is incredible, and it looks lovely. The item descriptions are full of snide and sometimes sinister remarks. The general atmosphere of the game is a blend of frenetic happiness with dark undertones, and it conveys that really well.Otherwise... I mean I get that it's satirising consumer culture, mobile games with micro-transactions, and entertainment addiction... But in the end all you're doing is burning things, collecting coins, and burning more things. You're doing the things you're supposed to be laughing at.As for the story being told, it never really resolves into anything that makes much sense; instead it's happy to drop hints here and there and pull at your heartstrings without substance.What little gameplay is there is pretty refined - the burning effects and physics are fun to toy with.I think ""toy"" is more fitting for this than ""game.""Overall, I still recommend it because it's so well put together. And really, I want that soundtrack.			"

												Fireplace simulator 2013 is more than just a sandbox game. The base storyline is in a world full of what seem to be orphans, the planet is getting colder, and to keep warm the “Tomorrow Corporation” (Also the name of the developers) make an entertainment fireplace for all the boys and girls. The story continues as you play more into the game.The base gameplay is clicking to create fire, and buying this from a catalogue to burn them. Unfortunately, you have to wait real time in order for the toys or electronics or whatever to arrive. This mechanic in the game is a massive downside, because some items in the later catalogues take a full 2 minutes. I see that the Dev’s wanted to make the game last longer but it's an annoying amount of time. Not long enough to alt tab and do something else, but long enough for the player to be annoyed. This time can be finished but using stamps, which can be collected by burning certain combos of objects. The list and what items required are online so this can be figured out easily. The gold coins you use to buy the objects to burn, are earned by, you guessed it, burning things. Its almost impossible to go broke in this game, with profiting from burning most things, and random spiders coming down and providing $ from their burnt corpses. Burning combos, at first, seem to be the only objective. After a little bit of time someone in the next room sends you a letter, befriending you. Her and “The weatherman” start to produce a legitimate storyline, making the game more appealing, drawing the player to play more. After grinding out the combos the player is handed a combo that is very easy to do, implying said player has a good memory. After that combo is completed a whole new world and story is added to the mix. The story is added in gradually but soon becomes the full focus. Its not only a well told story, but it's also a grasping one. The graphics of the game fit the game alright, but the music in-game make the world around you feel so much darker and lonely, suiting the game perfectly. Little inferno does some things right. The sound and music is amazingThe story is one of the best i have ever seen out of an indie gameThe combos, are witty and require some thinking, making it more immersiveThe fireplace looks good, and get to annoying to look atThe objects you burn are rather comical The ability to toss burning objects around your fireplace is good fun.Little inferno does some things wrong too. The lack of achievements and playing cards make the game a time killer, lowering their audience The story although great, is slow to get started. The repetitive nature could leave some players bored after an hour or twoThe combos are both hard and easy at the same time, depending on the player’s skillThe combos are really easy to look up shortening the game time and lowering the funLittle inferno, although a compelling story and a good time killer, isn't really worth the $10.99(CAD). With the lack of achievements and playing cards, it seems almost like a narrative interactive book, then a game. The price aside, i think people who love a great story, or even just wanting a few hours to go buy, should pick up this game. If it's ever on sale, get it. This is the weatherman, signing off. We’re all going to be okay.			"

												This game has literally no right to be good. But it is! It is incredible. I have now finished it about 5 times on different platforms. This playthrough I sat through and completed the entire game in one single sitting which took me about 3 and a half hours. Honestly one of my favourite games ever made.So what is the premise of little inferno? Well you burn stuff. It's that simple. Burn everything you get given then buy more stuff to burn. So that sounds boring?! The real fun comes from making combos. Burning the right items together gives you a combo. You get a hint for each of these combos and then you have to work it out yourself. What really builds this game though is the story. There a few different characters that build together a story throughout the game. They communicate to you only through 1 way, letters. Except somehow the developers seem to find a way to make you relate to these characters and gets them to convey a very wide range of emotion. The story is unique and really keeps you attached throughout the game.The style of the game is incredible. What I mean by this is the graphics and the soundtrack. They both fit together perfectly. The graphics are cartoon like and everything is stylized incredibly well to fit the theme. The soundtrack is a mixture of tracks that are upbeat and slow and always convey the emotion of the scene. The main theme is great and they even have a nice little sing a long video at the start with a catchy but scary song (you'll know what I mean when you see it). It is definitely something I would be willing to listen to outside of the game. So theres not really much more I can say about little inferno. The concept of the game is simple and sounds boring and terrible. But somehow it is incredibly fun. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone! TheIronicGamers rating system Don't ever buy this game. Maybe consider it on a sale. An average game.A good game that should definitely be considered.A must play! "

												At first I thought this game was going to be some sort of quick five minute ""oh look at how pretty we can make the fire look"" experiance, but they really make it into something  much more. I loved the combo system this game has that rewards you for thinking out of the box, I was tempted to use a walkthrough to get them all, but I stuck at it and worked out the short riddles you get as clues. Its well worth the little money that is being asked, you will get plenty of hours worth of fun, the only downside is I don't see there being any replay value once you get to the end.			"

												Somewhere uncomfortably wedged in between hilarious and deeply disturbing is this game.What will you do the first time you light a bus full of school children on fire, hearing their screams before it explodes?Will you laugh?Will it shock you?Will it scare you?Or will you glare mindlessly into the warm orange abyss, and feel nothing at all?Is this game about the dangers of over-consumption and runaway-consumerism, leading to a post-apocalyptic society where children are asked to burn their toys in a desperate attempt to stay warm to survive?Is this game about corporate and government wrongdoing, having milked an entire society dry of all it's resources until the CEOs and top officials flee the planet, leaving the glazed-eyed slack-jawed starving populace to their fate of an eternal nuclear winter?Is this game a metaphor for the player's wasted life? Like your character who burns all of his toys in the fireplace, is the player burning his life away playing video games, staring into the warm glow of his computer monitor while the real world behind him goes unnoticed, unlived?Is there any escape offered by burning down your house, the prison that keeps you inside, or is it even worse out there in the unknown?Playing this game won't give you any answers, but it will let you ask the question.

												This game seems to be a reference to our throwaway society.You start with a catalog of items which you can buy and burn in your fireplace, they will delivered to you in time from 5 seconds to 2+ minutes. They cost virtual money and you can earn money for burning them. The whole game contains 7 catalogs à 20 items which you have to unlock by burn more and create combination. (Sushi + Pufferfish)Combinations can create funny effects in your fireplace. Between your burning fun you will get letters from your neighbor and other people. This is meant as story and is kinda interesting if you interprete it correct.As further you go as crazier the items will be.

PROS:+ nice feel & ending of the story+ relaxing gameplay+ awesome visual effects+ morbid humor+ ideal game for pyromaniacsCONS:- not much replayability- slightly repetitive item burning- a couple of item combinations do not really fit their namesComment:""What is this game???"" ... that is what I asked myself multiple times when playing. At first it seemed like the game is just one of those free desktop destroying apps - a nice way to relax but without any real substance. But while minimalistic there is a story, which I found really sweet and cool. Each combo is a name, which must be analyzed as to what items it could contain. While trying some combos got repetitive and there is not much replayability I can for sure recommend this game to anyone wishing to relax (no achievement or point hunting here!). Also a must have to all the pyromaniacs out there!			"

												A fun and casual game despite a very Seinfeldian ""about nothing"" premise. You buy toys, you burn toys, and then you buy more toys. You burn them in combos to earn extra coin. The commentary and light story along the way are very well done. The graphics are cute and fit the game well. It was a fun short game.

												Little Inferno has you burn up tonnes of junk in your new Little Inferno Furnace Burning Machiine of Fun (I forgot the real name).This game is an absolute pleasure. I completed it in 3 hours, the main story, with around 85% of the combo achievements completed in that time, and did so in an entire sitting.The story is dark and lilting, infrequent but unsettling and very enjoyable. The mechanics of the fire, and the burning of the toys, and the combinations of the items for the Combo achieves were awesome fun to work out and play around with.My only criticism is the game is way too expensive. £12 retail for this incredibly short game is far too much. For this type of game I'd expect to pay around £5. Get it on sale, definitely. It's really great fun. But, for £12 I would expect replayability, which this game does not provide.But, for a one playthrough, you'll have a great time.Nilesy			"

												If Little Inferno was content to be merely a game about sticking a variety of different objects into a fireplace and watching them burn until reduced to ash, it would still be recommendable, as it's full of fun and inventive items to play with. However, the game goes beyond it's surface premise, offering up a critique of its very own genre and a potentially thought provoking story set in an often unsettling and sometimes outright scary world.As the world gets colder and colder, The Tomorrow Corporation releases the Little Inferno Entertainment Fireplace, which you are a brand new owner of. In order to combat the frigid temperatures outside, you'll spend your days throwing everything from credit cards to televisions to robots (and much, much weirder things) into your fireplace. As you burn, unlocking new items from the 7 different catalogs, you'll interact with others through letters where most of the story is told.While there are a large amount of items to unlock, and subsequently turn to ash, as well as “Combo” puzzles to solve, most of the focus of Little Inferno is on the setting and story. A story that, whether by authorial intent or not, is often vague and never very upfront with its intentions. This implicit style of storytelling allows the player to glean however much or little from the game as they want. Is the game really just about burning cool stuff? Or is it using an environmental message as a vessel to tell a deeper metaphorical tale? It's really up to you and how far you want dig into the game.If that idea turns you off, and $10 seems too steep a price to satiate your inner pyromaniac, this may not be the game for you. For everyone else, whether for its impressive fire effects, its haunting soundtrack, or its intriguing story, Little Inferno is a game likely to stick with you well after you finish it.			"

												Little Inferno is a charming one.If you had any previous experience with World of Goo, you should know exactly what to expect out of this little piece's flavor and aesthetics. For many small games, there is a point where, for the sake of keeping up with the challenges the gameplay introduces, the player's mind effectively strips away the colorful facade of it, revealing the core mechanics to be yet another twist on an ages old arcade, which it is perceived as from there on. Here, that's hardly the case.Then again, the complexity of Little Inferno's gameplay is somewhere between that of Clicker Heroes and a bubble wrap simulator. Yet, given how deeply satisfying the look and feel of this trivial process proves, and how the occasional story shards keep popping up at just the right moments, this simplicity manages to give birth to some mesmerizing immersion.The visuals are freakishly grotesque and disarmingly adorable at the same time, and the beautiful soundtrack contributes overwhelming emotionality to the process. Invest in it just a bit, click away the build-up, and you find yourself at the story's climax, gasping for every little final detail like a revelation.Little Inferno is a cozy place to be. The flames will consume you whole. But that's okay.			"

												I'd had this game sitting in my library for a long time.  I just beat this game the first time I played it in 3h26m.  I didn't realize it was a game you could beat before playing it.  I had started playing it because I was frustrated by so many Steam games I'd been trying all day having stupid problems and I just wanted to burn things.  I got that satisfaction at first, then realized there was actual gameplay when I started being time-limited and currency-limited.  It went from there and I beat it.  It was a decent way to spend 3h26m.  I recommend it if you like relentlessly burning everything.It doesn't have any of the stupid problems those other games I was trying all day had.  The resolution is correct.  The input latency is fine.  The UI is intuitive.  There's no consolitis.  You can continuously burn things for quite a long time before you start feeling limited in any way, and when you start feeling limited, you develop a strategy to feel less limited, which worked for me.I was seriously angry about other things when I started playing.  I was yelling ""BURN IN RIGHTEOUS FIRE!"" and other such stuff.  Now I am calm and relaxed.  FeelsGoodMan.			"

												This delightful, little, and simplistic game perfectly appeals to the inner pyromaniac in me.Graphics are well done..Music and audio are appropriate and nicely ambient..Combo names may not always align well with the items burned..there may not be a lot of replayability...but...who are you kidding.. if you get this game..it's just because you want to watch the world burn(but without the arson charges and prison time) "

												From one of the makers of World of Goo comes Little Inferno, a game about setting toys on fire just to watch them burn. As a new recipient of the Little Inferno Entertainment Fireplace, along with Tomorrow Corporation’s plethora of catalogs, it’s up to you to stoke the flames. Whether it’s a pile of blocks or a gaming tablet, a fluffy bunny or a toy school bus, the final destination for all of your things is directly into the fireplace. It is there that they will burn, explode, freeze and rain. And when you’re all out of things to burn, with the fire slowly reducing your material possessions to ash, you buy some more toys to fuel the fire.Almost the entire game is spent sitting in front of the fireplace. There are no alternate fireplaces. There are no fireplace expansions. There is no clear objective as to what burning all of your toys is meant to accomplish, aside from staying warm and passing the time. The only actions you have available to you are to upgrade the amount of things you can possess at one time, speed up the delivery of the things you order and unlock new catalogs, each featuring a new set of toys to burn. And, of course, the ability to throw these toys into the fireplace and set them on fire.But perhaps I’m getting ahead of myself. This is merely a simple game about throwing things into a fireplace. No need to rush ahead of that. Like how Hydrophobia depicted realistic water collision, Little Inferno approaches its subject with much more consideration than you might expect. The fire, as it spreads from toy to toy, feels real. No two items necessarily burn the same. Toss bricks into the fire and they catch slowly, burn slowly. Toss some of the mail you’ve received and they’ll burn up quick, reduced to cinders in mere seconds.This doesn’t take into account the various special items you can burn. Everything from mini-nukes to school buses to replica moons, complete with their own gravity fields, are available to you. There’s a fan that will blow out the fire. There’s a fan that will suck in the fire. Toss one on the left side of the fireplace, the other on the right side of the fireplace and you’ve got yourself a funnel of flame, coursing over everything in between. Not happy with how everything turned out? Accidentally froze your fire over? Drop in a mini-nuke and scour it clean with a single blast.You won’t have all of these toys available to you at once. In order to access the catalogs you have to do two things. First, you must use all of the toys available to you in the current catalog. It’s a little forced, but I can see why that’s a requirement. It’s in this manner that you’ll know what happens with every toy when they burn. Secondly, you must achieve a certain amount of combos.A combo in the case of Little Inferno is when you burn two or three like items based on a list of clues. The clues, and the solutions, are relatively simple. The only trick is digging through your growing library of toys to discover which toys are more applicable. Such as, one clue might call for a Sorority Party. Throw in the Low Self-Esteem Action Doll with the Balloons and you’re one step closer to unlocking the next catalog.When you purchase an item from the catalog, it doesn’t immediately appear in your inventory. It takes time. The post office doesn’t react instantaneously, even in this world. Things may take anywhere from 20 seconds to several minutes to arrive at your doorstep. Don’t want to wait? Stamps are available to rush delivery, but they are not infinite. There will be times when the only way to proceed is waiting, sitting in front of the fireplace.Somehow through all of this there is a story. There is a lengthy epilogue that provides a surprisingly satisfactory conclusion to the game. It’s the kind of ending that encourages you to look back at the few hours you spent in front of the Little Inferno Entertainment Fireplace. It’s a strange sort of irony that asks you to question the lack of meaning in something meaningless, but give it time. Think about it some more and you might see how far the metaphor stretches.And then, when you’re all done, what’s there left to do? There’s not much of a reason to play it after you’ve beaten it. Once you’ve set fire to all of the things, all that’s left is to fill out the checklist of combos. And once that’s done, there’s just the never changing fireplace and your catalogs of toys. They may burn brightly, explode in variable screams, changing the colors of the flames into something truly radiant. Then the flames die out, and there’s nothing left to do but buy more toys and set them on fire again. And again. And again.Recommended "

 Hey, kids! Do you like toys? Know what`s more fun then play with toys? SETTING THEM ON FIRE!! I have passed this game 4 times. All catalogs was completed for gold and all combos was found.So, In this game you can burn everything, that you wanted to burn. Starting with credit cards, ending up stars and planets. Every of this you can burn and find combos to unlock next catalog.Personally, I liked the sounds in this game, there realy good.If you feel the story of main character - little boy, which burns everything, this game will leave you with positive memories for a long time. Final of this game is realy great (without spoilers)This game is definitely worth this $5. Thank you, Tomorrow corporation, for this great indie game.			"

												This game is two things:- A fun casual game where you save up money to burn things by, well, burning things. Gameplay is simple, but the results are a lot of fun as each object you burn has a different reaction. You can also find specific combos (hinted at cryptically) that give you extra coins and speed-up tokens, lending the game a puzzle-element.- An unsettling setting and theme, accompanied by an absolutely amazing score and an ending that had me thinking for several days. This is not something I expected when starting this game, and it took me by surprise, and a delightful one indeed.I would recommend this game to anybody except perhaps for people that are looking for a challenging experience. Little Inferno offers a wide range of emotions, some not seen nearly enough in videogames, and you owe it to yourself to give it a try.(...maybe not at full price, but that's a decision I'll leave to you)			"

Product received for free
												 Truly a very pleasant indie title with a properly dignified degree of respect for the buyer. Free soundtrack, no artificial achievements and a critical satire of modern life.It is about what one would expect from a good indie game. By the end it can get quite repetitive and monotonous, hence a really inspiring end.Symbolism is overflowing with this one. I fear writing too much would steal from the experience. But what had other mini game FarmVille's failed - Little Inferno approaches with dark humour and a grin.If you ever get walk-through problems, the steam guides are more accessible than ever.			"

												At first glance, Little Inferno seems like a shallow if marginally fun game, but as you progress through the story via the catalogues, the game really opens up. It doesn't have some big epic story, nor does it have one that's consistently at the forefront of the game, in truth much of game relies on abstraction, but that's where the beauty of it lies. The game thrives on abstraction. The makes several observations that apply very much to both real life events in general, and to gamers and video games in specific. It takes the typical dysoptian/crapsack world and uses it to portray a meaningful message.The gameplay and graphics are rather utalitarian if charming, it's the story in which the this gem of a game shines, and it's one everyone should hunker down and spend a couple hours on.

I wonder what does what? This is so neat! The music is PHENOMENAL!""----Middle: ""Oh my gosh... things are getting good! I don't quite know what is going on here, but I am liking it.""----Middle-End: ""Oh man... that was so sad. Why oh why?! And everything just keeps getting better and better play-wise.""----Almost-End: ""The story, it is unfolding before my eyes. What seemed like nothing but a time waster is so good!""----End: ""That was so incredibly beautiful... I have no words... only tears...""As noted, what seemed like nothing but a neat little time-waster turned out to be a beautiful mini-story unfolding before my very eyes, music that can bring a tear to a grown-man's eye, and special-effects to go with the music that are both entertaining and inspiring. It is an experience, to say the least.			"

												Wow, where do I start!?I'm writing this review on 10/23/2016. A friend of mine giftend me this almost a year ago,I loved it then and I love it just as much now. I think I may love it even MORE now than I did, now that I""ve had tine to sit on it.There are two very important things that I pay attention to when I try games. The art and the music; because I'm a very emotional person and I find that those are the two aspects that really get me into a game. Little Inferno BLOWS it ALL out of the water.  The art is just phenominal. It's smooth, unique, and makes me feel very comfortable. I'm not sure how that will relate to anyone else, but everything just feels so smooth. Each item has its own personality. The game controls and mechanics are very comfortable, very natural. You left click to drag and drop. Very simple. The graphics are unique and the goals are challenging as hell! You really, REALLY have to think very hard when it comes to some of the goals within the game. The music is SO very emotional... I think the music is a good 70% of the game. The dialogue is 20% and the rest is the gameplay itself. I've downloaded the music for my own personal collection because I love it so much. It is definitely someting that helped drive me through the game. The game is simple, try to match up the combos. But pay attention to the story line that SHE gave you. LIsten to her very carefully, it's very important. Listen.... pay attention! ..... what did we talk about???			"

Allows the firebug in all of us to be expressed.Its premise is amazingly simple; use the mouse pointer to set fire to objects you've placed in your little fireplace and watch as each gets destroyed its own way.  Make combos by burning multiple items of a similar theme and this is the mechanism by which progress is made through the game.Really the only downside to this game, and it's a real stretch, is that if put in front of impressionable young minds it might encourage playing with fire!Overall highly recommended			"

												The Little Inferno is an uncommon game that consists on purchasing items and burning them into your new fireplace acquired from Tommorom Corporation. Perhaps at the beginning it seems to be a tedious task, however behind the fireplace smoke hides great storyline which is revealed thanks to a little girl that sends a various letter to us. Many of them are very funny but sometimes they can make you really sad and shocked. I would like to say more but that could be a spoiler ;). You should check it yourself. The whole gameplay with an awesome music and nice smooth animation makes an enthralling atmoshpere. Maybe not for everyone but very enjoyable and relaxing game. If you like bully your toys (or you used to in your childhood) you definitely should play this game :P.Reporting from the Weather Balloon,over the smokestacks,over the city,The Weather Girl.			"

												Little Inferno is a novelty.  It's a fantastic fire simulation wrapped around some quirky humor and a thin veil of a story, but not much else.You buy things from a catalog, burn them in your fireplace, and they spit out more money than you spent on the items.  The items have a shipping time which increases over the course of the game, up to about 5 minutes at the end.  You can speed up shipping with stamps which you mostly obtain by burning specific item combos together.It's a short game, but the novelty wears off even faster.  I really hope these guys go back to a more substantial game like World of Goo again.			"

												Admit it: you like to burn things.  No no, don't deny it, we can all tell it's true.  Fortunately, Little Inferno has your pyromaniac needs covered.The concept is simple: order things from a catalog with money.  Put those things in a fireplace.  Burn those things.  The act of burning those things earns you more money than you paid for them.  Repeat.  No time limits, no points system, no one telling you OMG DO THIS NOW.  Burn, burn, and burn some more.That's not to say there's nothing else to the game.  There's combos to create to unlock achievements, along with stamps that help your ordered items arrive faster. Money also lets you purchase access to more items, as well as expand the number of items you can hold at once.  And believe it or not, there IS a plot, given mostly through letters you receive in the mail, along with an epilogue that is a surprising gameplay shift, but still fits in just fine.You don't have to do any of that though: you're welcome to just burn things without purpose for as long as you like. Doing so is surprisingly entertaining, and really, there are worse reasons to play a game.			"

												Hilarious, and strangely sad.  The game can feel a little slow towards the end, and finding combos a bit tedious.  It's so worth playing through to the end, though.  I was not expecting what happened AT ALL.   Great message, especially knowing that one of the creators, Kyle Gabler studied under the instruction of Randy Pausch, the professor who gave the ""Last Lecture"".    Even made me a little misty eyed.			"

												Do you like burning things but get tired of burning your house down? Me neither but you dont need even try it with this game. you can burn anything from toys to food to personal pictures and many many many other things. You meet a new friend and find a ew world. And how does an amazing game like this sstart you say? By having a fireplace take up your screen (this fireplace stays with you for nearly the whole game) 100% recommended.			"

												Got this game, spent 6 hours playing through it and trying to capture all the combos. And I enjoyed it. Don't expect another World of Goo except in terms of atmosphere, that certain something that accompanies these games. I think it art. I think it may entertain you. I'm not sure I buy into the hype about getting choked up. It's quirky. If you like quirky, try it on sale. I don't think I'd pay the full asking price for the 6 hours I enjoyed.			"

												Little Inferno was a unique game. I couldn't wait to look at all the backstory, immerse myself in the game and go through the instructions... actually, why bother when you can just catch it on fire?It's a cute game, and it's more than it appears to be. It's not an action game by any standards, but it's great stress relief, and  it's fun to burn things and see how they react. But what happens to what you burn? Does it go up, up, up, over the chimmnies, over the smokestacks, over the city? 10/10 would play with fire again			"

												You burn things. I like burning things.Okay so there's more to it than that. With a weird style and sort of underlying childish creepiness (I get a Tim Burton vibe), a story starts to develop during all the mindless staring and burning. But I'd almost be happy just to keep burning things. They burn so nice. It kept me hooked and interested enough to keep going, not at all expecting the big surprise at the end. Like, woah. That was not at all how I was expecting this deceptively simple game to end. You need to see for yourself. There's a pretty heavy metaphor for gaming under it all. But I wouldn't call it pretentious. Unlike other games that talk down to you for gaming while you play the game, it's more just poking a bit of fun at the medium. Disregarding that, even if you don't pay attention to what it all means, it's still a fun game about putting things in a fire until they crumble into ash. Or explode. I'm not sure what more you could possibly need.			"

												I....honestly have no words for how amazing this game is, but i will try to put it into words. This game at face value is about burning things in a fireplace. But if you take a look inside it has a much better deeper meaning. Its about how you shouldnt let life pass you by and waste away. To live in the moment and enjoy yourself and have fun. Even if the fun is a little bad sometimes ;). Dont worry about consequences *to a certain extent obviously* and doing what you want even if a little bad. Live in the moment as long as it wont gurt anyone. Spend time with people you love. Dont waste time doing things and talking to people that you dont enjoy. Cause you might not have tomorrow *corporations xD* So dont waste today!			"

												So much cute! LET'S BURN IT ALL!!!This game is adorable. You buy cute little things from the store, stick them in your Little Inferno Entertainment Fireplace, light them on fire, and enjoy the show. Then you buy more stuff and burn that too. Repeat.Have you ever sat in front of the fire and just watched the flames flicker or the embers glow? I found myself becoming very relaxed while playing this game, just enjoying the peace that comes from gazing silently into a warm, crackling fire. It's so calm and relaxing... until...BLAM!! EXPLOSION! Well, what did you think was going to happen when you put batteries into your fire? Now you hearing screaming, you say? You didn't, perchance, just burn a school bus, hmm?There is a cute, endearing little story attached to this game. After you finish playing the ""end-game,"" you can return to your fireplace and go back to burning stuff again. Because burning stuff is awesome.Burning specific items together can produce more interesting results. Much fun is to be had burning sets of items, looking for the right combinations. And even if you don't discover a new combo, hey, you still got to have fun burning stuff!!Burning things always gives you in-game currency (as does squishing spiders), so you literally never run out of money. This is good because it means you can keep on buying more things to burn!You can even import your own photos to burn in-game. It doesn't get much better than that.Did I mention that this game lets you burn stuff?			"

												This game is very simple. Just take an item and burn it! You can burn all what you (don't) like.It's like an pyromaniac's dream. But this game help you to fight with your phobias, it can also relax you like as a fireplace simulator. You can burn your children fears. Burn things that you always want to drop in fire but always hold yourself. Such as glass bottles or soda cans, which blow up after heating. This game has a good physics. You ""feel"" all things that you burn: thin and lightweight items like a photos burn in a moment becoming an ashes, wooden objects will burn longer. I like game artwork and style: mix of retro and scaring motives.Little Inferno also has a storyline and challenges so you will not be bored. This game also allows you to upload your own pictures from your PC or from social network sites.Ohh.. look like someone would pay for his sins. *evil laugh*

												As user Puggsoy put, ""Little Inferno is not a game of skill. It's a game of discovery."" That is exactly what the game is. I've read that some people were disappointed, claiming that the game felt like it was missing something or lacking, but it's all in the eye of the beholder. I was perfectly pleased and fell in love with it. There's not a lot of challenge to it, if any, but there is a lot of beauty and discovery and fun for the curious who like to experiment. This is not a game for the people who crave constant action or stimulation. If anything, Little Inferno will soothe and calm you. There's something very relaxing about watching the objects burn, and the atmosphere has a very ambient feel despite wondering about the sinister intentions behind your Little Inferno Fireplace that was given to you by a big company, Tomorrow Corporation, that you know very little about. But the premise is that the world around you is freezing, and you have to keep burning things to stay warm and farther more, although it's unspoken, most likely to stay alive.This game is often described as a ""Fireplace simulator,"" but there's a little more to it than that. It has a plot with a few surprises with a twist that left me surprised and emotional. On top of that, watching things burn never grow tiring. In fact, they often burn with pizzazz. There are a lot of unexpected outcomes, from sounds, to special effects, to beautifully colored flames. You'll be excited to burn the next thing to see how it reacts.			"

												Having played and beat World of Goo, I kind of thought I knew what I was in for with this game. I was wrong. Just like World of Goo, the developers have taken amazingly addictive gameplay in which you throw toys and expired food into a fireplace and burn them to get money and stamps to order more; and threaded an intriguing story into it, almost imperceptibly. They force you to think, not just about what items to burn together to unlock combos, but about why you are doing what you are doing. This game is witty, engaging, satirical, and haunting in a way that creeps up on you. Absolutely brilliant.			"

												You get to burn things in a fireplace.  For money.  And love.It's a cute tale of the girl next door in a very strange world.  Or something...  I'm really not sure what the story is all about, but it is rather cute.  Essentially you have a pen-pal with your next door neighbor, however you can't go outside and meet her because of the dense smog making it impossible to move.  So instead you order things in the mail to burn in your fireplace to keep warm during the artificial winter.  You burn different combinations of things for different effects, and every so often your pen-pal will write you a letter, sometimes containing a gift.  Which you burn, you monster.The graphics are very appealing and burning things is always fun.  Even if you don't want to burn stuff, you can always play with the stuff to burn.  Options include various children's toys, one such as building blocks.  If you really wanted to, you could play with those and build yourself a fort.  And then burn it.  There really isn't much left to seek out from what your given.  The game has everything you could want from it.If you're a pyromaniac, you might as well give it a go.  You won't be let down.Gameplay video (6 minutes unedited):

												Little Inferno is a very unique Indie game created by Tomorrow Corperation. The nonsensical, comical game style makes the game highly enjoyable and addictive. The objective of the game is to burn various items in your fireplace in return for coins, with which you buy more items to burn! When you burn certain items together you will unlock combos, these give you extra coins and when you get ebough you are able to purchase a new catalogue containing new items to burn!When put like that the game does not sound very enjoyable, however the way in which the items react just makes you want to see more of the game.Tomorrow Corp also add in another couple of characters who you get to meet and develope relationships with as the game progresses including an annoying but lovable neighbour who circums to a tregedy later on in the game.The game play is very responsive and you do not need a good computer to run the game. The colourful design gives the game a very positive atmosphere, which seems to be uncommon in newer games.The only down critisism that I have for this game is that it does not take a long time to complete, if you do not focus on unlocking all of the combos you could complete the game in little over 2 hours. But, if you wish to piece together all of the clues than you would have to spend a lot more time on the game.To conclude:Little Inferno if a brilliant and unique game, it includes a lot of fun puzzles to solve and will keep someone entertained for a number of hours. It's relaxed game style means you are able to play it without having to stay and ""finish this bit"" as it saves the game as you go.Graphics: 8/10 Fun but still detailed and high qualityFun: 9/10  You can spend alot of time on this simple game and not get boredOveral: 6.5/10 Superb game but it is a little short for my liking.I would recommend this game to all people, exept children who are easily distressed/upset.

												To paraphrase Hyperbole and a Half: ""Burn ALL the things!""Little Inferno is a curious way to waste a few hours. You have a fireplace. You order toys and other objects from catalogs not to play with, but to burn. Sometimes, the mailman brings letters from the neighbors. You'll burn those, too.It's a little bit creepy and, yes, entertaining. Is there more to this game? Yes. No. Both, I think.Fans of Kyle Gabler's earlier work, ""World of Goo"", will recognize a similar smug poke at the things we take for granted in this always-online age, but I don't mean to suggest that there is somehow more of a game here than ""burning stuff."" Suffice to say that there are varying levels of interaction going on with the things you burn. I don't think that's a spoiler. It's game enough that there is a beginning, a middle, and an end.However, the artistic style and soundtrack are the true star of this game. My daughter walked in on me playing, and within 10 seconds she asked ""Is that a new game from World of Goo?"" Gabler's artwork and music are immediately recognizable. Just as in ""World of Goo"", the art of Little Inferno defines a warm and unsettling world, where a fun game with simple mechanics is just the exposed surface of a much larger world gone awry. Or... not! These games can be played by a 5-year-old, but jaded adults will naturally seek deeper meaning.			"

												It's a physics sandbox. Throw stuff into a fireplace and watch it burn, or smash it against the walls to break it. Burned stuff drops money you can use to buy more stuff from the catalogues. Try burning all the objects and watch each one burn in a unique way.But wait... isn't there something a bit more sinister going on here? What's up with the pointless combo system? Why are the timers on deliveries so long, making it so that you’re spending most of the time just staring at an empty fireplace? Why do so many of the inanimate objects you purchase seem alive? And what’s even the point of the money, if the fireplace will just give it right back to you after you spend it?Little Inferno is a game with a message. I could spell it out for you, but in 2-3 hours the game expresses the message much better than I ever could. Just play it, and find out for yourself if there's something in this world that's more dangerous than fire.			"

												There's a lot more to Little Inferno than meets the eye, but let's start with the basics. Do you like to burn things? If, like me, your answer is YES!, then the Little Inferno Entertainment Fireplace is for you! Additionally, if the idea of squashing and/or burning spiders appeals, then this product is also for you. If neither of these hold long term appeal, never fear - you can collect coins and purchase products (to burn and begin the process again). Everyone enjoys purchasing digital junk! Not you? Well, what about progressing through catalgoues and collecting GOLD STARS? And COMBOS. What about combos? Everyone likes combos!It's this commentary that makes Little Inferno great - it has something to say about the state of games, about itself, about you. Yes, it is a ridiculous game, but you'll get more than you bargained for from it - or at least you should.So, how does Little Inferno actually play? Well, it's best described in three easy steps:Step 1: Burn items.Step 2: Collect coins.Step 3: Purchase items.Rinse and repeat. But I'm not a pyromaniac. What's the point?The point is to burn your way through catalogues of items to unlock new catalogues of items to burn. If you're a completionist, you can get gold stars on all of your catalogues. If this (understandably) isn't enough, there's combos - these are likely what you'll spend most of your play time on. These are Little Inferno's puzzle aspect. From the title of the combo, you have to work out which items to burn together to achieve the combo. This gets a bit trickier towards the end when you have multiple catalogues of items to choose from. That's about it for Little Inferno's gameplay. As for the /point/, well, you'll have to find that out for yourself.But, as much as there is more to this game...10/10 - would spend a day burning fake items in a fake fireplace again			"

												You get to burn things in a fireplace.  For money.  And love.It's a cute tale of the girl next door in a very strange world.  Or something...  I'm really not sure what the story is all about, but it is rather cute.  Essentially you have a pen-pal with your next door neighbor, however you can't go outside and meet her because of the dense smog making it impossible to move.  So instead you order things in the mail to burn in your fireplace to keep warm during the artificial winter.  You burn different combinations of things for different effects, and every so often your pen-pal will write you a letter, sometimes containing a gift.  Which you burn, you monster.The graphics are very appealing and burning things is always fun.  Even if you don't want to burn stuff, you can always play with the stuff to burn.  Options include various children's toys, one such as building blocks.  If you really wanted to, you could play with those and build yourself a fort.  And then burn it.  There really isn't much left to seek out from what your given.  The game has everything you could want from it.If you're a pyromaniac, you might as well give it a go.  You won't be let down.Gameplay video (6 minutes unedited):

												To be honest I love everything that is made by this company. World Of Goo, Little Inferno... well, to be honest those are the only two I've played, and both have made me laugh, and feel sad, and I have always had a blast with this one. It is PERFECT for the pyromaniacal pyschopath that's in us all, without getting put in prison. The gameplay is solid, the graphics and sounds are endearing, (if somewhat creepy at times, (the Leperchaun,)), but I think that this game is a good game for anyone who just likes to play with fire.

												Background: Picked up in a bundle, played with my 8 year old nephew.Impressions: Enchanting. Absolutely charming and lovingly crafted. I've had few gaming experiences quite as rewarding and intriguing. The simple, talkative exposition via letters is pitch perfect and the holds together perfectly with the gentle score and cute visuals. The story does take some oddly dark turns and some of the visuals are mildly creepy (not for young kids, without being anything bad.. just not all sweetness) which I actually enjoyed as it made the plot all the more interesting.I can see this is not a game for everyone. It's short, simple and lots of text to read. But if you take the time to enjoy it it's a fine experience.The Good:*Simple mechanics, fire looks and works great*Charming visuals, music and characters*Each item burns differently.*Builds a world though letters and descriptive writing*Dark plot twists and creepy toys add interest*Combo system is rewarding to puzzle out*Superb, rewarding and unexpected finaleThe Bad:*Could be longer, all over in a 4-6 hours*Some combos are really hard to figure out*The darker elements of the toys and story can be off-puttingRecommended for: anyone with a love of simple, elegant puzzle games with beautifully crafted stories.Conclusion.8/10. Not for everyone but there's a lot here if you give it time.			"

												Little Inferno is a toybox game. There aren't any set objectives, there aren't any rules, just pick up your toys, throw them into the fire, and burn them. Ultimately that is the premise to the entire game however there is more to it than that.You begin with a small number of toys available to order from a catalog, and you can unlock more toys in that catalog by earning money, and you earn money by burning toys. The more toys you burn, the more you can buy, and so on and so forth. You can only 'hold' so many toys in your inventory at one time, however you can increase the size of your inventory by spending some of your money which makes the game a little easier as you progress.There are numerous other toy catalogs that you can unlock playing the game, but to do so you also have to work out combinations of toys to burn together from combo names which are given to you. Making combinations of burning toys will not only unlock catalogs it will also give you stamps, and these stamps can be used to reduce the time it takes for your toys to arrive once you have ordered them from the catalog - these stamps are invaluable when you get to ordering toys from the very last unlockable catalog as some of the delivery times are around 4 minutes, and this does start to feel like a long time to wait particularly when your toy goes up in a smoke in a number of seconds.There is a story throughout the game which isn't particularly obvious until right at the very end, and I won't include any spoilers here as I think it needs to be played to be experienced. I found it quite moving, and the whole experience very enjoyable.This game is fairly short - I managed to complete it in 3 1/2 hours, but I hadn't worked out all of the stamp combos, and I'm actually already keen to go and play it again so I can work the remaining ones out as some combo names are quite cryptic (whereas some are blatantly obvious).This game is £6.99 on Steam and this is a lot of money for a short game, however I do think if you connect with the gameplay and the story there is scope for replay-ability, and certainly once you've unlocked everything you can just leave it as a 'toy' in itself to pick up and play whenever you fancy burning something on-screen.Little Inferno is simplistic, it looks great, it's fun, it's challenging, it's polished, it's thought-provoking. I really didn't expect it to be as good as it was. I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish, and would definitely recommend giving it a try. It's something that can be played in one sitting, or something you can come back to, either way it's definitely something that should be experienced.			"

												Little Inferno is a neat little game. It doesn't promise much and it delivers what it does: a fireplace simulator. Overall I enjoyed playing through it and I especially enjoyed the background story that was unfolded as I played. The only gripe I can think of is that it was a little too short. I played through quite conservatively, on and off, but if I'd have played in one sitting I would've finished it in about two hours.			"

Burn those things with past things in certain combinations to unlock MORE catalogs to get MORE things to burn.  It is worth picking up cheap, and it is full of some real surreal humor.  One drawback is that it graduated from the Flash game school of playing it ""just to unlock more, so you can unlock more"".			"

												This is a very fun game about burning stuff. Some of the combinations are well thought out and even the ones that aren't are fun to look for. If you like watching things explode and absurd imagery you'll like this game. The ending is sweet and satisfying and the game play is fun even though it's extremely simple in concept. Partially this is due to the art direction being very consistent throughout the game. I had a lot more fun playing this game with a friend or two in the room coming up with silly combinations to burn with me.The game benefits from knowing just how weird its premise is and running with it.Unfortunately once you've gotten all the combinations it doesn't have a lot of replay value as the story is linear and there are a set number of specialized interactions. But it takes awhile to get all those combinations and it's more than worth it for that first play through.It also runs on well on even low powered machines. I could get this game to run on my net book which barely runs Microsoft Word.			"

The item descriptions are hysterical, and the item animations as they catch fire made me laugh a number of times. I bought this game on whim during the Summer Sale, and loaded it up one night. I looked up a little bit later only to realize that two hours had gone by, with me just giggling and setting things on fire. I can only hope that there is a sequel of some kind to come.

												The problem with Little Inferno is that it burns out too quickly, even after three hours. It kept me shocked during the first hour and a half, alternating between dumb Beavis and Butthead antics and slow-burning horror. Then the game wants you to find combos to progress and it turns into a Tim Burton-shaped grind, ruining whatever momentum it built up. All it needed was Johnny Depp telling the player that NINE MORE COMBOS ARE NEEDED TO PROGRESS, SIRRAH (DOES A FUNNY DANCE) to perfectly emulate Tim Burton's descent into chiaroscuro-tinted underperformance.

												One of the most heart-warming (ha!) games I've played in a long time. The goal of the game is to burn items in inventive combinations; as you do so, the game's story slowly reveals itself. You can't help but to fall in love with the characters, even though you only meet them face-to-face in the final moments of the game. The art is goofy and beautiful, the humor is snappy and perverse, and the video message at the end of the first act will haunt your dreams for a week. Doesn't have much replay value because the story is tied to the sandbox mode. But if you aren't like me and can totally ignore the story, replay value is nearly infinite. Put it on your wishlist, wait for a sale, and enjoy.			"

												Little Inferno is a charming one.If you had any previous experience with World of Goo, you should know exactly what to expect out of this little piece's flavor and aesthetics. For many small games, there is a point where, for the sake of keeping up with the challenges the gameplay introduces, the player's mind effectively strips away the colorful facade of it, revealing the core mechanics to be yet another twist on an ages old arcade, which it is perceived as from there on. Here, that's hardly the case.Then again, the complexity of Little Inferno's gameplay is somewhere between that of Clicker Heroes and a bubble wrap simulator. Yet, given how deeply satisfying the look and feel of this trivial process proves, and how the occasional story shards keep popping up at just the right moments, this simplicity manages to give birth to some mesmerizing immersion.The visuals are freakishly grotesque and disarmingly adorable at the same time, and the beautiful soundtrack contributes overwhelming emotionality to the process. Invest in it just a bit, click away the build-up, and you find yourself at the story's climax, gasping for every little final detail like a revelation.Little Inferno is a cozy place to be. The flames will consume you whole. But that's okay.			"

												The trailers don't lie. The core, and only, gameplay mechanic is ""place things into fireplace and ignite"". However....What an interesting world they've created! It's shockingly immersive. Leetle Inferno does a wonderful job of defining a tone and setting with minimal effort. Rarely have I felt so directly connected to a game's protagonist. What leetle plot/character development exists is suprisingly compelling. As the story is so brief and simplistic, to say pretty much anything would be a spoiler. But to indicate that a game in which the only action you can take is to burn things in a fireplace is even capable of having spoilers should be compelling enough.Leetle Inferno is simultaneously comforting, creepy, inspirational and depressing. I've completed the game and am still unsure whether or not it's ""fun"". If ""unique"" or ""interesting"" is enough for you, it's well worth a $10 sale price.			"

												You burn things to get money.  You burn certain things together to unlock more catalogs where you can get more things to burn.  Burn those things with past things in certain combinations to unlock MORE catalogs to get MORE things to burn.  It is worth picking up cheap, and it is full of some real surreal humor.  One drawback is that it graduated from the Flash game school of playing it ""just to unlock more, so you can unlock more"".			"

An experience""Little Inferno"" is unique. The only game I can think of that is similar is ""Papers, Please"". The gameplay really takes a backseat  in this game. But the way the story unfolds around you is amazing. You regularily get letters that tell the story, while sitting at your fire without seeing anything else but your fireplace.Although the gameplay really gets repetitive after a while and the waiting implemented as ""shipping times"" kinda gets annoying, the story makes up for it. Even though I only played it once a few months ago, the story sticked and still has an impact on me even now.So if it's on sale and you have time to sit down for a few hours, let yourself get immersed by this amazing journey with an amazingly cute artstyle, a uniquely told story and a connection to the characters without ever meeting any of them I have never seen before!

												A game about burning things. Burn things to buy more things to burn! The game has an anti-consumerism message, saying that there is more to life than just sitting in front of a fireplace, but the ending is mostly left open to interpretation. Some of the later-game combos are fairly obtuse and I looked them up to figure out the required items. Fire physics are very nice, and some of the items are very fun and creepy.			"

												I love this game! IT WAS SO..... BEAUTIFUL! From the beginning I loved this game, Hey don't blame me who wouldn't. Burning up things, Getting combinations, killing spiders. ISNT THAT EVERYONES DREAM. I think they have done this game very well and even though it was a short one it filled up a big spot in my heart. A heart-warming (Get it oh what am I saying of course they get it) and fun loving game. Loved the story, loved the granny love the ending (which made me a lil' teary----) LOVED IT ALL! Score well lets rewind and read i again and the say..... 10/10! CONGRATS LIL INFERNO!			"

I'd like to start by saying if there were a ""Mixed"" option, I'd pick that for my recommendation.I can't say I can really call this a good game so much as I call it a fun toy. The fire physics are fun to play with, and this game is guaranteed to make the pyromaniac inside you cackle with glee as you burn stuff. Some items are fun just to play with instead of just burn right away (Manly Razer comes to mind). A lot of the things react in unique ways when burned, others... do nothing at all. But if you ever wanted to burn an opera lady or a pirate or... well, this is the place to do it. In that regard, Little Inferno is fun. Some people will say that's enough. It's made more appealing by the story that goes along with it, told through the letters you receive from three different people. While I kinda like the story itself, some of the themes lose their impact due to their overly repetitive nature. I invite you to take a shot every time someone mentions something not lasting forever or never being able to go back.Another thing I don't really understand is why after buying something, you have to wait for it to ship to you. Some items take a few seconds, others take a couple minutes (I believe the longest you'll wait for an item is five minutes). So if you run out of stuff to burn and are waiting for your next batch to arrive, the gameplay grinds to a halt, leaving you sitting there like a putz while you wait for your stuff. If you happen to get some Tomorrow Bucks, you can use those to skip the shipping time, but the game is very stingy about handing them out. The best way to get more is by finding combos, which is also required to unlock the other catalogs. Oh, and did I mention after buying something, not only does it take a while for it to ship to you, but it takes even longer to restock?So to some degree, it feels like I'm playing a free to play game where if I don't have or don't want to spend money (or Tomorrow Bucks in this case), I have to wait to keep playing. I'm not convinced that's a good choice of gameplay mechanic. At least it isn't riddled with microtransactions like free to play games.I wouldn't say Little Inferno is bad, but my biggest gripe is the waiting system; it's just an unnecessary feature that gets in the way of what's otherwise a fun little experience. You'll have an enjoyable time when you're not waiting for more things to burn. I think the story is the strongest point of the game, even though themes are repeated to the point of losing most of their impact.You're more than likely to play this game, finish the story, maybe mess around with burning stuff for a little while, and then get bored and uninstall it. Worth checking out, but I suggest you wait for a sale; this fun toy of a game isn't worth full price.			"

												This is absolutly worth it just for the joy of burning things. And then after that you can burn things together. and you find out that theres a depth to burning things in fun ways. Theres also a story hidden underneath it all. Its not a long game , but it is fun and worth at least one play through.			"

												Quite possibly the best game in the world to play on cold evenings or to bring some interactivity to tv screens during the christmas ""fake fire"" phase.  All the fun of pyromania with none of the court dates, hospital visits and smell of petrol.   The game is as basic as it comes, burn stuff, buy stuff, burn that as well and repeat.   Can feel samey but worthwhile pushing through that to get to the end. Would recommend on bith WiiU as well as playing through Link to get on the tv as it really is the best interactive fire you can get that isnt actually a fire.Keep an eye open in sales to pick this up for maximum value.  A fiver or less and you're in the value sweetspot for this game, anymore and you may complete feeling ripped off.			"

												Little Inferno is simplistic in design and premise, the world has frozen over in a way, always cold, so, you burn things to keep warm, but you don't just burn them you burn them in a Little Inferno Entertainment Fireplace!  The company is nice enough to provide you with defective toys, household items and small planets and nukes to throw into the fireplace to burn.  Made by three people locked in a closet for one weekend this is an awesome show of true indie gameplay.  It has a simple story that progresses, and you can come back and burn all you like with new combinations, or setting up fun things to come tumbling down and explode in the fireplace.  I highly recomend this game (Even more so if your a crazy pyromanic.)			"

												It took me 3 hours and 20 minutes to complete the game start to finish. I really enjoyed every second of it! It's a fun, quirky game, but underneath that exterior is the truth behind our own world and culture.Yes, it might seem extreme for us now to be burning our things in a furnace, but it showed how completely wasteful we are inheriently as human beings. I personally loved all the different combinations and seeing what effect it has when I set something on fire. Some of the combo's were so cute and cleverly picked. It will test your creative thinking skills to figure out the different combinations based only on the title clues. The graphics are one of the best parts, I loved the colorful characters and then at the very end to the contrast of the black/grey/white somber feel. It looked so beautiful. I really enjoyed this art style.Overall, great game! Once you beat the game there's not much use out of it, but it was a good way to spend 3 1/2 hours! If you're into these sort of games, grab little inferno!			"

												As someone who loved World of Goo about as much as someone can possibly love a game, buying this was a no-brainer. But should you do the same? I'm not sure. This is definitely one of those ""love it or hate it"" games (if it can even be called a game). I personally loved it, but I wonder how many others will. On one hand, the gameplay consists of burning things... lots and lots of things. This is an act of primal enjoyment for most human beings. But on the other hand, that's really all there is to it (for the most part). I mean that literally - the entire 4+ hour game consists of burning things in a fireplace. I know that sounds boring, but it's actually kind of not. It's fun to throw different items in to see what they do, and finding combinations of items that, when burned together, reward you with tons of cash and more items. How much mileage others will get out of that experience I can't even being to predict. Aside from burning things, the only other notable aspect of the game is its story (which for 90% of the time takes place more in the background). The end of the game changes this significantly, but I shan't say more about that ;). The story is a sort of societal commentary built of mounds of metaphors (some subtle, some not so much), with a major revelation at the end... basically, it's the kind of thing that goes over well with the ""artsy"" crowd. I dug it, but again, I'm just not sure how that translates to a mainstream audience. It does, however, lend itself perfectly to the overall atmosphere of the experience (along with the unique art style and music).If you're open to unique indie experiences and don't mind the $15 price tag, go for it. Just be warned that there's not all that much to it. World of Goo, this most definitely is not - but it's definitely something very unique (in its own very, very weird and addicting way), and all-in-all, a worthy successor.			"

												Little Inferno looks like a simple, casual game, but it's actually a little deeper than that. Yes, you get to throw stuff into a fireplace. A lot of things, in fact. But way, way into the center of it all there's also a storyline to be found. I won't spoil it so I'll just talk about the gameplay a little bit more. While burning things you'll earn coins and stamps. You see, all items have to be ordered and the stamps will give you the ability to instantly deliver an item to your doorstep. Coins can, of course, be used to buy items or increase the number of objects you can stock. A few hours into the game these items will dramatically increase in price. Now, the real goal is to find and create combos. Combining certain items will unlock an achievement and earn you lots of money. And what for ? To buy new items, you got it ! These combos are a must if you want to complete the game, by the way. Most gamers should be able to finish it in 3,5 hours or so. So it's not all that long, and the time limit for deliveries artificially lengthens the game as well, which is a real shame.The graphics and animations are cute and beautiful. And the fire looks quite amazing, with all the ashes and whatnot. Impressive stuff if you ask me. The music is minimal, but memorable. Especially the Weather Balloon song got my attention.All in all it's a fun game but I wish it was even deeper than this. It's still a bit too shallow for my taste.[Rating: 78/100]			"

												I keep a positive approach to indie developers, especially if they already created something I enjoyed. My attitude here was ""World of Goo was great. A second game from the same dev? A must have!"". And perhaps because of expecting a similar quality of gameplay, I was ultimately underwhelmed.The mentioned gameplay is as simple as it gets. Buy things -> burn them -> receive slightly more money than you spent on it -> buy more things -> repeat ad infinitum. Some items here and there react a bit more interestingly then others when burned, but in the case of most of them it's about what you'd expect - they catch fire, turn to ash, end.There's no challenge, no timer, no optional objectives a la WoG's OCDs, nothing that really requires you to pay attention. It is definitely much more casual than WoG, though not necessarily more family friendly - some toys screaming (even if cartoonishly) when burned ""alive"" can be quite creepy. Which is good, as it helps stay awake during the game.The game is short - which wouldn't be bad by itself, but it's short despite being already artificially dragged out by time delays between buying items and receiving them (from several second at first to up to about 4,5 minutes for more expensive items). Game takes about 3h to finish, whereas it would take perhaps 30 minutes without the waiting times - and it would be a considerably more enjoyable experience in that case. Between a 30 minutes of well-paced engaging fun and a 3h game in which I regularly alt-tab to keep myself busy while waiting for cooldowns to end, I'd take the former any day.To give credit where credit is due, the game is visually pleasing + has a theme song I occasionally catch myself humming. There is definitely a good dose of creativity put into the aesthetics of Little Inferno. But though I don't regret playing it, I find it hard to recommend to anyone due to the ultimately dull and unrewarding gameplay.			"

												Neat casual game that's good to kill your time. You're given a fireplace and an eternal, somehow, lighter. Your job is to burn as many things as you can to earn coins and finding combos.Getting combos is how you move forward, and the trickiest of them all. If you don't cheat by looking at FAQ list, this can be time consuming. To buy the next recipe list you must complete a certain number of combos - going to be irritating if you can't get that last hint and find the combo.The artificial timer intended to stop you from doing combos too fast is also annoying. Well, it's the weakest part of the game IMHO.Game has no storyline except some obscure dialogues between silent protagonist (you), weather news reporter.... and an annoying neighbor.Overall not worth full price though - and this game's bundle material so you might want to wait and clear your backlog before purchasing.6/10			"

												While I very much like the effort and ideas that went into this game, it's just really tedious.The ""game"" part of course involves burning items one by one to progress the story. As long as you just burn one of each item, you'll get to the end. Each item has a ""delivery timer"", which makes the ""game"" go fairly slowly. Discovering combos gives you the ability to speed up these timers, but that's the ONLY thing finding the combos actually provides.I figured something more would happen when I unlocked all the combos and was pretty disappointed that the Combos are otherwise completely pointless and just meaningless padding to turn what would otherwise be an hour-long game into a few hours of trial-and-error (some of the combos make sense, others are VERY obtuse).After burning one of each item, you get a long cutscene at the end that starts great and should have ended after the first 2 minutes, but then goes on try too hard to have multiple layers of meaning. The surface meaning of ""don't waste your life playing video games"" is enough, they really shouldn't have tried so hard otherwise at the end.All in all, I'd say that while it's a great looking game, it's just not really worth the effort to ""play"".

												I loved this game so much it compelled me to actually write a review. I've never done that. What started out as a fun-enough little novelty game about burning things, slowly evolved into one of the most unique, interesting, engaging and moving gaming experiences I've ever had. While you're merrily going along, thoughtlessly setting fire to all manner of objects, (and attempting to figure out some of the charming little burn combos along the way) you'll notice the game is beginning to draw you in on a deeper level. There is a story here. There is someone to care about. There are quirky and interesting characters, and ultimately there is an ending which is thought-provoking, humorous, and beautiful.I highly recommend this game. Come for the fire.

												A small, haunting little game.  The core mechanic is for you to puzzle out unique combinations of items to burn together, based on clues, which then allows you to unlock catalogs containing even more, increasingly strange items to burn.  Rinse, repeat.  However, during the course of the game, a depressing story with dark undertones beguns to unfold through messages sent to you from neighbors who are also sitting around, burning things in their fireplaces.Little Inferno took me by surprise.  It's deceptively simple, yet I suddenly found myself with over 2 hours invested into it my first time around.  It went very fast.  I haven't completed the game yet, but I am drawn back to it like a month to a flame.			"

												I'm not sure how honestly I can recommend this game on the merits of it's gameplay, but Little Inferno offers both a visually and musically distinct experience, and in my opinion is enjoyable enough on those merits alone. Little inferno carries a message much more profound than it's simplistic gameplay, and if you are one who can manage to look past a games faults and play for the experience, then this title might just be for you. it also helps if you get it in a bundle.    overall, 6/10			"

												Come around and sunggle up to the rawring fire!A very calm, yet hilarious game! Beuitiful graphics, creative ideas and is a game I would play over and over again. There are loads of unquie and bizarre things to interactive with, such as a Mini Nuke, Chainsaws and even the Moon! The fire effect is one of the most stuning things I have ever seen in a game. Just burning a simple wooden block, brings a warm, glowing feeling of seeing fire burn. It is worth your time and money to buy this game!			"

												The premise of the game is you burn stuff in a chimney. A pyromaniac's delight. Surprisingly fun to watch the fire physics engulf the items. You get coins for burning things and you slowly unlock more items you can purchase/burn from catalogs. You progress by burning stuff in combos or following certain recipes for burning certain items together. It's made by the guys that made World of Goo. Both games have an underlying message which is important to know if you want to truly understand the games. It's a strong message that you'll sooner or later understand by the time you reach the ending.			"

												Little inferno the little game that could. During the holidays I heard of a game called little inferno and I was curious about it so with some money I bought it. Ill be honest when i played this game i was amazed! The music is breathtaking. The whole concept of the game is to burn things, like pics of your ex, pirates, robots with souls, and tiny galaxies. This also has a small story, im not going to spoil too much but the ending is inspiring. The art style reminds me of a Tim Burton movie, so its like playing a Tim Burton game. I recommend this if you want to waste some time buring things or listening to the Weatherman's theme music. 10/10			"

												A small, haunting little game.  The core mechanic is for you to puzzle out unique combinations of items to burn together, based on clues, which then allows you to unlock catalogs containing even more, increasingly strange items to burn.  Rinse, repeat.  However, during the course of the game, a depressing story with dark undertones beguns to unfold through messages sent to you from neighbors who are also sitting around, burning things in their fireplaces.Little Inferno took me by surprise.  It's deceptively simple, yet I suddenly found myself with over 2 hours invested into it my first time around.  It went very fast.  I haven't completed the game yet, but I am drawn back to it like a month to a flame.			"

If I wanted to wait to get mi shipments I'd buy stuff IRL using the amazon drone and burn it myself. Being fair, it's pretty and creepy, and you may be entertained for, let's say, an hour or so. Unless you're a completionist who really NEEDS to try all combos, you will stop giving ♥♥♥♥♥ about this game almost inmediatly. Do I recommend it? Why, yes, but beware of the price.			"

												Review for Little InfernoNow this game is something special.The game is simple,basic and in general and easy game. There is no objective,you are not being timed. You burn toys and eventually other items. You do so to get coins to buy more things to burn. You basically just sit there beside a cozy fire infront of your computer.  Now I will be talking about the end so be careful when reading this there will be spoilers So the game introduces you to a set of charachters early on, making you not feel so lonely. These charachters give you comfort and will not dissapoint you. The main charachter introduced in this set would be sugar plums. Now she is something special, she will keep sending you mails, and you soon become friends that keep sending eachother items to burn. Now the other charachter is Ms Nancy she is the head of a corporation called Tomorrow corporation, the maker of the Little Inferno fire place. Now she will introduce you to the shop system. And the last charachter would be The weather man. He gives updates on the current situation outsides and gives you a rough idea on what is happening outside and why you should make your fires to keep cozy.The simplicity adds many hours added to your play count. Beside the fact of not being timed, you have all the time in the world, find all the combos, a system to keep the player puzzeled and entertained.The game isnt perfect of course. The simplicity does make the game worse in some ways. The game is short but furfilling.You will feel satisfied when you finish, due to the atmospheric and intriquing ending of the game.Talking about atmospheric the game has a fantastic artstyle which you have never seen. This game,with its artstyle, will keep you cozy,calm and intriqued. The mails that you keep getting sent will keep you company and will make you feel like you arent alone in this heartless cold world, that seems to have no hope. Now there is a bother in this game, the wait times. Without doing the combos, which you should if you have time, the game will be a long game with wait times that last to 6 minutes. Now the good news logging off would save your progress and save the time , atleast it did for me. Now the ending. The ending is introduced rather slowly. Sugar plumbs will slowly push you towards the end, explaining what has happened to her, will happen to you. The last catalog was her end and you know this as you progress through the game. Now the ending requires you to know the items you send to her over the course of this game. But surprisingly this isnt a hard task, at all. You will remember the items, unless certain conditions. Just due to the unique charachter that she poses to be. The end ties up all the loose strings and as said will make you feel satisfied.I would if I had to rate this game give it a 7/10 Its not something fantastic that would add TONS of replay value. But it is unique and has kept me on my toes, making me pay attention to every damn detail.-Newdles Way over the smoke stacks, over the city Newdles			"

												This game is very unique. It's not quite a puzzle game, not quite an action game, not quite a sandox game, not quite a simulation game. However, it manages to keep my attention for a good amount of time, and the art is very attractive.Little Inferno offers this subtle-but-not-quite-subtle insight on society. It reminds me of the Ray Bradbury novel ""Fahrenheit 451"" in which books are burned and TV is watched all day. Little Inferno and ""Fahrenheit 451"" both share a satirical undertone exploiting and mocking society.Another thing I like about Little Inferno is just how satisfying the entire game is. I never thought playing with fire could be so much fun! (Little Inferno - Condoning pyromania since 2012!)Altogether, Little Inferno is executed very nicely and is definitely worth taking a look at.			"

												     Little Inferno is a simple puzzler game made by Tomorrow Corporation. The game consists if you sitting in front of a fireplace or ""The Little Inferno"" and you simple burn items that you can purchase through catalog. You can purchase items with coins that you receive from burning other items. You always get more coins then you spent when you burn something. The game keeps you going with ""alchemy"" style combining such as many iOS games such as Doodle God. These combinations are called combos and you have to try and figure out the combos by the name suggested. For example the combo the Easter Bunny combo would require you to burn a bunch of eggs and a stuffed bunny toy together.      These simple mechanics could get repetitive for some; but personally the combo system kept me going. The game may be simple in mechanics and it's not too challenging, but it delivers a strong message about how you should spend your time. Little Inferno is a unique indie game with about 3-4 hours of solid gameplay that makes you rethink certain things you do in everyday life. With all that said I feel that it is definitely worth the solid price of 9.99$			"

												Though the game can be addictive at times, once you beat the game and complete all the combos, its replayability level goes down the drain...or is it up in flames?

The visuals are nice, and the symbolism delivers a fine sense of eeriness.			"

The amount of love and care put into each burnable object is nice, and the feeling of burning whatever you want is fantastic.			"

And a lot of people pan it for the wrong reasons, A lot of people hate the wait times and fake microtransactions the game uses to poke at ♥♥♥♥♥♥ app/facebook games. Although it may not be completely stimulating and enjoyable all the time, which is absolutely an important part of a game, it doesn't make this game BAD. This game is honestly just a little toy to play around with and have some kind of odd and satisfying story presented to you about humans and technology. But is it worth paying 10 bucks for, or 5 bucks for? Maaaybe? I purchased it when it was 20, and felt pretty ripped off. But if you can get it on sale and have any interest in the game, sure, go for it. It might just be special for you.			"

												This took me only a few hours to complete, but Little Inferno is BRILLIANT! You start off burning things in a fireplace, using different items to make combos and receiving coins with which you can buy more items.This may sound simple (and it is), but this game is *so* much more than that.It's currently on sale on the Humble Bundle (Humble Indie Bundle #8, ends 11th/12th June 2013), so even if you can't afford the price on Steam you can buy Little Inferno by spending $1 there. [Link= www.humblebundle.com ]This is a wonderful game, and I highly recommend it. :-DPS:- If you've ever whiled away the hours playing games on Facebook or on your phone, you MUST play this game.

												A fun little game with lighthearted jokes and an interesting gameplay. It's a game to fiddle around with and you only progress after a certain time of doing just that. The graphics are nice, everything is sleek, the music is fun, and it unleashes your inner arsonist that we all have inside of us. Perfect for kids since it doesn't utilize complex mechanics --just click on what's in your inventory, place it in the furnace, hold the mouse button and BURN BABY BURN!!--or someone older who finds amusement in a charming time-waster such as this. There is no real goal though there are small ""objectives"" sprinkled here and there as time passes, though you are not bound by them in order to continue your fun.There are achievements for certain combinations of burning items together and whether by themselves or together what results are pretty interesting effects that reflect this game's interpretation of ""physics' and 'cause and effect"". Overall I'd say that if you want to play something that you could spend hours whittling away at or something to distract you or a kid for a few minutes, then this is the game to get.			"

												This isn't really that much of a game. You have stuff, you set it on fire, that gives you money with which you buy more stuff. It barely qualifies as a game at all, really. And yet I find it strangely engrossing. Setting things on fire is fun, and the game has a slightly demented sense of humor. So get it if you like setting things on fire, I guess.			"

												Buy stuff and burn it. Then buy more stuff and burn that too. Sounds pretty boring right? So why is this game so damn enjoyable? Well because they make burning combinations of items rewarding, that's why. And finding combinations by trial-and-error makes it feel like a puzzle game. Plus there's actually a story in all of this that extends it further than just burning stuff. Very soothing music as well. Little Inferno is certainly a pleasant surprise.			"

												Hrm, where to begin. This is kind of a game? More of a practice of design and artistic statement than a game. There really is not much to Little Inferno. You are a kid and you buy things to burn in your Little Inferno fireplace to stay warm. That's it. It feels like a moble mini-transaction game, but it isn't. I cannot say it is fun, but it is certainly interesting. Well, it is kinda fun for the first little while and getting to see all the different items burned, but this is very short lived. There is something more to it, something that you have to slog through the ""game"" to find. But this is very intentional to the overall design, so I cannot say that this is a bad thing as you are suppose to become bored and disenchanted with it and it is only after that where the true statement of the game lies. It does what it is designed to do very well. It is very different, certainly not for everyone. But based solely on it's intended purpose and design, it does it very well. So I give it 70/100.			"

												I loved this game so much it compelled me to actually write a review. I've never done that. What started out as a fun-enough little novelty game about burning things, slowly evolved into one of the most unique, interesting, engaging and moving gaming experiences I've ever had. While you're merrily going along, thoughtlessly setting fire to all manner of objects, (and attempting to figure out some of the charming little burn combos along the way) you'll notice the game is beginning to draw you in on a deeper level. There is a story here. There is someone to care about. There are quirky and interesting characters, and ultimately there is an ending which is thought-provoking, humorous, and beautiful.I highly recommend this game. Come for the fire. Stay for the warmth.			"

												Little Inferno is a delightfully relaxing little game. There's really not much to it. Toss things in the fireplace, set them ablaze, enjoy the spectacle, and just keep adding to the pile. There's no fancy gimmicks, no fail states, no time limits. Just you, your fireplace, some awesome tunes and visuals, and the simple, yet effective narrative that unfolds as you make progress. Progressing through the game is simple enough: Burn various items together using clues from a list, earn money, and unlock new catalogs. It's entirely stress free, and you'll always have enough money to just enjoy the simple act of burning items and witnessing their unique interactions with one another. There's no need to rush it, just have a nice chill out session by the virtual fireplace and let things happen as they may. For those that want to enjoy the more ""gamey' aspects, there are 100 combinations of items in all to figure out, and the clues are generally presented well enough that massive bouts of trial and error won't be too necessary.  Even when you guess incorrectly, the visuals and chill ambience Little Inferno provides still make the experience wholly satisfying. Definitely a game to just chill out with after a hard day's work or when you're feeling stressed.			"

The amount of love and care put into each burnable object is nice, and the feeling of burning whatever you want is fantastic.			"

												You like marvellously weird humor? You have maybe played the game World of Goo? Then this is a game for you!Basically you have to burn things! First of all I looked at some videos to understand the gameplay before I brought the game. It's all about burning things in combination.An example: You get money for burning things and you have to """"level"""" your character. You level while you're doing combinations like burning a Cat and a Fish together in your furnace to get a combo ""Cat Fish"".After you have done a certain amount of combos you are able to buy new things for new combos.The comic look feels unique and fits into the entire game. The effects of fire and like are really awesome. The game has a story - simple but full of humor.Shamelessly there are no achievements for this game. I'm not sure why there are no achievements, because the developers have enough potential to create achievements for this game. Some proposals would be:""Rich man"", where you have to collect a certain amount of money.""Poor man"", where you have no money in your pocket.""Crammed"", where you have put your entire furnace full of things.etc.Recommended!, even if it's not on sale and has no achievements.

												This game gets a slight recommendation, and here's why.It's not your typical game. It's one of those ""games as art"" type of things. The whole concept of the game is you order stuff from a catalog, and set it on fire. Poof! You get coins to order new things, and stamps to get them to you faster. But it's the subtext that's interesting. Your burning things like toys at first, but then you start burning, TVs, radios, e-mail, etc, almost as if you're burning away everything in your life. Get me?And there's also an environmental message in here because the game keeps talking about smoky skies and how it's been snowing for as long as anyone can remember. Hmm.....wonder what that could be, eh?It's not worth $9.99, not at all. It's interesting but it only took me 4-5 hours over the course of two days to beat it. Get it on sale if you must try it out, and you should, because it's a unique game. But don't expect a deep challenge or extraordinary gameplay. This is about as simple as it gets.			"

												Little Inferno is a pyromaniac's sweetest dream. Main purpose of the game is to burn various objects which reacts with fire. Each objects react differently with fire and It is very entertaining to watch. As you unlock more and more things to burn, the mystery behind the reason you burn things unveil, and the message behind the game was definitely something to think on about. The game does get a bit repetitive when it requires you to burn same objects again and again in order to move on, but overall, I'd say this game was a great experience, and I recommend this game.

												The gameplay focusses on burning objects and buying new ones. There are waiting times for items, which can go up to 5 minutes. Luckily, you can skip those if you have some cards you obtain from finding combos, or sometimes at random. You have an infinite supply of money. This is because the items you burn drop MAGICAL golden coins, more than you bought the item with. There's a deep message I won't spoil, but pay attention to the story well. The lighting is beautiful and fairy-tale like. The objects you can burn often have special effects. (Such as popcorn) The only downside I see to this is that people might get bored of the repetetive gameplay, which is kinda part of the game. If you don't find it appealing to burn items over and over for hours, don't buy it. If you would like that, or just are a pyromaniac, buy it post-haste. I rate this an 8.5/10			"

After finally installing it and playing for a bit, I saw that there was more than I had planned for. The music and the underlying themes make this definitely worth playing and one of the best purchases I have ever made.			"

												The gameplay focusses on burning objects and buying new ones. There are waiting times for items, which can go up to 5 minutes. Luckily, you can skip those if you have some cards you obtain from finding combos, or sometimes at random. You have an infinite supply of money. This is because the items you burn drop MAGICAL golden coins, more than you bought the item with. There's a deep message I won't spoil, but pay attention to the story well. The lighting is beautiful and fairy-tale like. The objects you can burn often have special effects. (Such as popcorn) The only downside I see to this is that people might get bored of the repetetive gameplay, which is kinda part of the game. If you don't find it appealing to burn items over and over for hours, don't buy it. If you would like that, or just are a pyromaniac, buy it post-haste. I rate this an 8.5/10			"

												Little Inferno is an enjoyable little game whose story is more compelling than the gameplay. Its feature is burning stuff and doing so in various combonations to earn the right to progress further into the game. The thrill of burning things, itself, is limited. By the time you unlock the second or third catalog of items to burn, you've got the idea and experienced pretty much the extent of it.Little Inferno's story -- told through letters delivered on a regular basis -- is what keeps you burning things and searching for the right pairings of items to match the list of combos it offers you. While the story is compelling, it is not necessarily ultimately satisfying. After about three hours, you'll have completed the game and consumed its somewhat cryptic story and not-so-cryptic parable (yes, there is a life lesson that it's trying to convey to you).I can't advise this game for someone looking for a solid puzzle game. There's just not enough content to last long. If you're interested in a fairly clever little story told through interesting  means, then it's definitely worth trying. Regardless of what you're looking to get out of it, I don't know that it can quite justify its full price.			"

												A fun little game with lighthearted jokes and an interesting gameplay. It's a game to fiddle around with and you only progress after a certain time of doing just that. The graphics are nice, everything is sleek, the music is fun, and it unleashes your inner arsonist that we all have inside of us. Perfect for kids since it doesn't utilize complex mechanics --just click on what's in your inventory, place it in the furnace, hold the mouse button and BURN BABY BURN!!--or someone older who finds amusement in a charming time-waster such as this. There is no real goal though there are small ""objectives"" sprinkled here and there as time passes, though you are not bound by them in order to continue your fun.There are achievements for certain combinations of burning items together and whether by themselves or together what results are pretty interesting effects that reflect this game's interpretation of ""physics' and 'cause and effect"". Overall I'd say that if you want to play something that you could spend hours whittling away at or something to distract you or a kid for a few minutes, then this is the game to get.			"

Ill be honest when i played this game i was amazed! The music is breathtaking. The whole concept of the game is to burn things, like pics of your ex, pirates, robots with souls, and tiny galaxies. This also has a small story, im not going to spoil too much but the ending is inspiring. The art style reminds me of a Tim Burton movie, so its like playing a Tim Burton game. I recommend this if you want to waste some time buring things or listening to the Weatherman's theme music. 10/10			"

												When I was little I almost set my house on fire with a magnifying glass. I feel the need to disclose that because I think it shows that I have a subconscious bias towards a game such as Little Inferno, which rewards you for experimenting with setting things on fire. That being said I honestly do think this charming little pyro simulator is worth your time and money. The actual burning of things is very entertaining and dare I say relaxing. The fire is very pleasing visually and the items you burn often have very interesting reactions to the immolation. My only gripe with the core mechanic is that the grinding to get all the secret fire combinations can be a bit tedious, and for a few really obscure combinations I had to resort to the internet. At the end of it all though, you’re treated to a truly touching narrative conclusion, while that final cutscene was playing I had genuine chills running down my spine. For all the silly, fiery goodness, the conclusion to the tale was what made me completely satisfied with my purchase.			"

												A truly remarkable game. Little Inferno starts off as funny, charming, clever and entertaining, but eventually evolves into an engaging plot that occaisonally pulls at your heartstrings and forces you to ask yourself things you never thought you would in a ""sandbox"" game. The ending offers a different sort of gameplay, that finishes the storyline like a perfect symphony. The best feature though, is the ability to play in sandbox mode even after the close of the story. Little Inferno is both a visually and narratively beautiful game and is completely worth its cost.			"

You get coins for burning things and you slowly unlock more items you can purchase/burn from catalogs. You progress by burning stuff in combos or following certain recipes for burning certain items together. It's made by the guys that made World of Goo. Both games have an underlying message which is important to know if you want to truly understand the games. It's a strong message that you'll sooner or later understand by the time you reach the ending.			"

												Little Inferno is an oddball. It's funny, it's quirky, it's dark, and it's disconcerting. It's also short. I finished it in just under five hours, and you could probably shave a few hours off of that if you ignored all but the required number of Combo Badges. On top of which, there's very little here to call a proper game, and gameplay mostly just consists of placing things in the fireplace, and then burning them for fun and prizes. ""Prizes"" in this case referring to more things to burn, money with which to buy more things to burn, and stamps for speeding up the delivery of more things to burn.It's the ciiiircle of liiiife! And it burns us aaaall!That said, there's a lot of variety to make it interesting, and you're never really positive how a new item will react when you set it on fire or throw it around. I burnt a floppy disk, which caused my fire to become pixelated, and a coffee cup I set ablaze spontaneously grew a face and began screaming. Which brings me to a point: This game is disturbing when it wants to be. On the whole, though, it's all cartoony enough that I think you won't leave your comfort zone.The categories of items are interesting. There's a video game category, of course, and it contains little references, like World of Goo goo balls and a tablet which displays a Duck Hunt nod. My favorite category, however, is the one filled with manly things, such as a monster truck, a flamethrowing chainsaw, and a moustache. And I burned them all.So, what's the point? Well, besides just burning things and seeing what happens (which is kind of its own reward), there are 99 2- or 3-item combos to figure out based on the combo's name alone. These will probably take up the majority of your time. There is also, actually, a plot, told mainly through letters until the endgame, which is... surprisingly different. The ending does what it needs to. It won't answer that feeling you'll get while playing the game that there's something bigger going on here than just people keeping warm, but it gives you a personal conclusion that's a little more than ""Try to guess what happened for yourself!"" Which, considering the tendencies of indie games these days, is a glorious gift.There's an underlying message to be picked up on, as well. It's a message which rings true, and while it's one that I've seen in various forms in indie games before, I think this is the best presentation I've seen it given, yet.Little Inferno's a short game, but it's good entertainment, if pretty basic in the gameplay department. It'll hold your attention until it's over, but if you're worried about the short length over price, well, that's what Steam sales are for.			"

												Little Inferno is a game where you progress by purchasing and burning various objects while getting combos and earning more money.I had expected a terrible game after reading some of the reviews. I hated Doodle God with a passion, and Little Inferno has similar gameplay. However, I found myself loving this game for its short duration. The game's atmosphere is wonderful, and the story is short, but very enjoyable.  I love the items too... they're funny and they're entertaining when they burn.The gameplay is a bit lackluster. The combos make sense most of the time, but a small handful of them require some moon logic. A bit of the time is spent waiting for items to arrive... you really have to manage time well to avoid sitting and doing nothing.Thankfully, everything else makes up for the gameplay. The story, graphics, and sound are on par with World of Goo, which was phenomenal. Overall, I found this to be a very enjoyable experience, and I'd recommend it to anyone that can enjoy a more patient game. Wait for it to go on sale, though... I beat it in only a few hours.			"

Luckily, you can skip those if you have some cards you obtain from finding combos, or sometimes at random. You have an infinite supply of money.

												I really rather enjoyed this. It's not particularly challenging, but... well you burn stuff... and then you burn more stuff and then some more stuff..., with a slightly twisted back story and an end which feels entirely worth while.			"

												This is a really interestnig game.There's not really much in terms of gameplay most of the game, you just burn stuff. It reminds me of a flash game I use to play called ""Powder Game."" The stroy is pretty good, but you can figure it out from watching the trailer. Play if you like burning stuff, or like to play games that push what a ""game"" is.			"

Little InfernoThis review was last edited when I had finished the gameShort ReviewAn unusual & amusing game where you throw items into a fire and watch them burn whilst trying to work out combos of things to burn from cryptic clues. It's much better than it sounds. Recommended. Long ReviewYou spend the entire first part of the game with a view of a fireplace where you can drag items and drop them and right click to produce a flame that can then be used to light (some) objects in the fire place.You purchase items from a catalog, further items become available as you purchase different items and extra catalogs can be purchased once all the items from a previous catalog have been purchased and you have completed a certain number of combos. You perform a combo when you burn certain things together at the same time. Purchased items are then delivered to your home and appear as boxes on a bar underneath the fireplace. There is a cool down time before you can open the box and drag the item onto the fireplace, although you can use up cards which drop from time to time in the fireplace to reduce the cool down to zero. You can only store (& so purchase) a set number of items at a time.Cards always drop when you find a combo for the first time. There is a list of cryptic clues to combos available and as you find each combo it is crossed off. A lot of the fun of the game is trying to figure out what items are part of combos.Once the items have been destroyed in the fireplace coins also drop (more than you paid for the item) and you can collect these.As well as purchasing items & catalogs coins can be used to upgrade the space used to store items so hold additional items.Letters also appear ""randomly"" in your item slots. These offer cryptic clues to the background story, request certain items be sent or deliver additional items.The way the things burn in the fireplace is roughly realistic so some physics simulation is involved. There are interesting items like planets which have their own gravity, bombs which explode etc.At the start of the game you have given hints to explain the game mechanics but to be honest its pretty simple and easy to pick up.There comes a point when the game fundamentally changes and you leave the room with the fire and get to wander around a small town in an adventure style game. To be honest I found this less interesting and only spent half an hour or so looking round before finding the point to finish the game and doing so.Progress is saved when you exit and it's possible to have multiple game progress saved.All in all a surprisingly entertaining game, which my 3 year old loved sitting on my knee and watching, getting very excited when letters arrived & pointing out the things he wanted me to burn .. Hmm thinking about it now maybe I might regret this later in his life ..ProsAmusing game playEasy to pick up and put downSurprisingly addictiveConsI found some combos impossible to work outMarks Out Of 55) Must have - stop whatever you're playing now and play this4) Worth the asking price and considering as your next purchase3) Maybe purchase if you're stuck for choosing your next game or mildly discounted2) Only purchase if it is heavily discounted1) Not worth getting even if given away freePlatform Played OnIntel Pentium G3258 Anniversary Edition, 8Gb RAM, Palit GTX 750, Windows 10, EasyAcc Mouse & Steelseries MERC keyboard.

You'll get away from reality and have some really relaxed time burning things just for fun and trying to solve the combos. In the end, it'll make you think about what you are doing, about your life, your dreams and about the time - making you feel a mix of sadness and hope... It's a great game, greatly designed.

												This is a very simple game: Burn things to earn money, spend money to buy things to burn, find combos, etc. But just 5 minutes in, and it becomes addicting. Despite it's minimalism, you can tell a lot of care went into the game. From the unique ways each item burns, to the combo system, to the corky dialouge. Now, the game doesn't have the same length World of Goo had. I'm 5 hours into the game right now and I've earned gold status (another clever way to get you hooked on buying items) on everything in the catalouge and only have 10 combos left to discover. But if you find this item on sale, $5 is well worth the purchase. Heck, $10 is even worth it if you plan to play it more than once (and HINT, you will have a reason too). This will indulge your basic human desire to burn things for hours. I recommend it highly.			"

												Little Inferno is an odd quasi-puzzle game with a similar style and consumerism narrative as World of Goo, 2D Boy's previous acclaimed release. The player is simply tasked with ordering items from a catalog and then burning them in the Little Inferno fireplace. The challenge comes from unlocking more advanced item catalogs, which require a certain amount of burn combinations to access, but you're really here to just be a virtual pyromaniac. Item design is excellent -- I love the screams from the school bus -- and the game's gradually unfolding story (told via snailmail letters) keeps you enthralled to the end. Little Inferno lacks the replayability of World of Goo, but it's an excellent experience on its own.			"

												The premise of the game is you burn stuff in a chimney. A pyromaniac's delight. Surprisingly fun to watch the fire physics engulf the items. You get coins for burning things and you slowly unlock more items you can purchase/burn from catalogs. You progress by burning stuff in combos or following certain recipes for burning certain items together. It's made by the guys that made World of Goo. Both games have an underlying message which is important to know if you want to truly understand the games. It's a strong message that you'll sooner or later understand by the time you reach the ending.			"

Although it may not be completely stimulating and enjoyable all the time, which is absolutely an important part of a game, it doesn't make this game BAD. This game is honestly just a little toy to play around with and have some kind of odd and satisfying story presented to you about humans and technology. But is it worth paying 10 bucks for, or 5 bucks for? Maaaybe? I purchased it when it was 20, and felt pretty ripped off. But if you can get it on sale and have any interest in the game, sure, go for it. It might just be special for you.			"

This also has a small story, im not going to spoil too much but the ending is inspiring. The art style reminds me of a Tim Burton movie, so its like playing a Tim Burton game. I recommend this if you want to waste some time buring things or listening to the Weatherman's theme music. 10/10			"

												Little Inferno is a delightfully relaxing little game. There's really not much to it. Toss things in the fireplace, set them ablaze, enjoy the spectacle, and just keep adding to the pile. There's no fancy gimmicks, no fail states, no time limits. Just you, your fireplace, some awesome tunes and visuals, and the simple, yet effective narrative that unfolds as you make progress. Progressing through the game is simple enough: Burn various items together using clues from a list, earn money, and unlock new catalogs. It's entirely stress free, and you'll always have enough money to just enjoy the simple act of burning items and witnessing their unique interactions with one another. There's no need to rush it, just have a nice chill out session by the virtual fireplace and let things happen as they may. For those that want to enjoy the more ""gamey' aspects, there are 100 combinations of items in all to figure out, and the clues are generally presented well enough that massive bouts of trial and error won't be too necessary.  Even when you guess incorrectly, the visuals and chill ambience Little Inferno provides still make the experience wholly satisfying. Definitely a game to just chill out with after a hard day's work or when you're feeling stressed.			"

												Hrm, where to begin. This is kind of a game? More of a practice of design and artistic statement than a game. There really is not much to Little Inferno. You are a kid and you buy things to burn in your Little Inferno fireplace to stay warm. That's it. It feels like a moble mini-transaction game, but it isn't. I cannot say it is fun, but it is certainly interesting. Well, it is kinda fun for the first little while and getting to see all the different items burned, but this is very short lived. There is something more to it, something that you have to slog through the ""game"" to find. But this is very intentional to the overall design, so I cannot say that this is a bad thing as you are suppose to become bored and disenchanted with it and it is only after that where the true statement of the game lies. It does what it is designed to do very well. It is very different, certainly not for everyone. But based solely on it's intended purpose and design, it does it very well. So I give it 70/100.			"

What started out as a fun-enough little novelty game about burning things, slowly evolved into one of the most unique, interesting, engaging and moving gaming experiences I've ever had. While you're merrily going along, thoughtlessly setting fire to all manner of objects, (and attempting to figure out some of the charming little burn combos along the way) you'll notice the game is beginning to draw you in on a deeper level. There is a story here. There is someone to care about. There are quirky and interesting characters, and ultimately there is an ending which is thought-provoking, humorous, and beautiful.I highly recommend this game. Come for the fire.

Português abaixoLIttle Inferno is not a game; or, better saying, is not just a game. Of course it's funny, and will consume a couple of hour (about five) to finish. But that is not what is most important here. This is a gaming experience that intendes to discuss game experience itself, and postmodern life, and global warming, and nihilism... It's a complexe and vast critical material about life and human behavior. If you are not interested in the concept of the game, or thinking about deep things, you can still buy it (as it's fun to burn things and find combos); but, in this case, the game price is a little high, and you should wait a promotion to aquire it.----------------Little Inferno não é um jogo; ou, melhor dizendo, não é só um jogo.

É uma crítica complexa e extensa sobre a vida e o comportamento humano.Se você não está interessado no conceito do jogo, ou não quer pensar sobre temas profundos, você ainda pode comprar o jogo (ainda é extremamente divertido queimar coisas e descobrir combos); mas, nesse caso, o preço do jogo está alto, e vale a pena esperar uma promoção.

												     Little Inferno is a simple puzzler game made by Tomorrow Corporation. The game consists if you sitting in front of a fireplace or ""The Little Inferno"" and you simple burn items that you can purchase through catalog. You can purchase items with coins that you receive from burning other items. You always get more coins then you spent when you burn something. The game keeps you going with ""alchemy"" style combining such as many iOS games such as Doodle God. These combinations are called combos and you have to try and figure out the combos by the name suggested. For example the combo the Easter Bunny combo would require you to burn a bunch of eggs and a stuffed bunny toy together.      These simple mechanics could get repetitive for some; but personally the combo system kept me going. The game may be simple in mechanics and it's not too challenging, but it delivers a strong message about how you should spend your time. Little Inferno is a unique indie game with about 3-4 hours of solid gameplay that makes you rethink certain things you do in everyday life. With all that said I feel that it is definitely worth the solid price of 9.99$			"

												This game is very unique. It's not quite a puzzle game, not quite an action game, not quite a sandox game, not quite a simulation game. However, it manages to keep my attention for a good amount of time, and the art is very attractive.Little Inferno offers this subtle-but-not-quite-subtle insight on society. It reminds me of the Ray Bradbury novel ""Fahrenheit 451"" in which books are burned and TV is watched all day. Little Inferno and ""Fahrenheit 451"" both share a satirical undertone exploiting and mocking society.Another thing I like about Little Inferno is just how satisfying the entire game is. I never thought playing with fire could be so much fun! (Little Inferno - Condoning pyromania since 2012!)Altogether, Little Inferno is executed very nicely and is definitely worth taking a look at.			"

												WARNING: Do not play with fire!Good folks from World of Goo bring another puzzle game with their idiosyncratic art style and vague motifs of.. anti-consumerism? enviromentalism? anti-corporationalism? being a hippie? ehhhh... O_oAnyway.. World of Goo was a physics puzzle while here, - here we have an object/word association puzzle.You get catalogues of things to burn, and along with a catalogue, you get a list of named combos - and the goal (besides enjoying the.. ""burning sensation"".. hue) is to guess what things to burn together, based on name of the combo and names/descriptions/behavior in game/presumed functions outside the game/cultural references etc. etc. pertaining to objects from given catalogue and any previously unlocked ones.As such, the game is somewhat culturally biased, and perhaps acts as proof that your command of English language is not as good as you might think it is (not sure about other languages?). Which may be wee bit unfortunate for some... But otherwise this is really enjoyable game, pleasantly tickling your brain!			"

												First off the game is beautiful graphically. I was shocked to see how well the fire mechanics work and some of the items are really fun to burn or burn together. The burning alone is good for a few hours of fun.The combos are basically the only gameplay. There is no conflict. All you do is gather coins to buy things to burn. Burning 2 or more of certain items at the same time scores a combo which gets you express tickets to get items you buy delivered faster. A certain number of combos are required to unlock new catalogs full of new things to burn. There is a combo list you can reference that gives you hints on items to experiment with.There is a small story wrapped up in the game that reveals itself to you over time. The game also has a pretty decent (if long) ending cutscene/activity to reward you for your efforts.Also, if you are given a coupon for a ""Free Hug"", you might not want to burn it. Just a hint. It won't break the game if you do though.			"

There's light puzzles, and stuff along those lines for completionists, but this is really all about the experience. And there's something more dangerous than fire. But what could it be?			"

												When this was announced I debated with myself whether I should buy it or not. I liked World of Goo, one of the dev's previous games, and this one looked fun as well. The release came and went and I gradually forgot about Little Inferno. Eventually it would show up  in a Humble Bundle which I decided to get. Here is what I thought:Pros: + It's really satisfying to burn things. + The music fits the game. + It was fun trying to get all of the combos. + The game's not just about burning things, there's a meaning behind it all.Cons: - It takes a  few hours to beat.You might want to wait for a sale since this game doesn't really take long to beat.

												A small, haunting little game.  The core mechanic is for you to puzzle out unique combinations of items to burn together, based on clues, which then allows you to unlock catalogs containing even more, increasingly strange items to burn.  Rinse, repeat.  However, during the course of the game, a depressing story with dark undertones beguns to unfold through messages sent to you from neighbors who are also sitting around, burning things in their fireplaces.Little Inferno took me by surprise.  It's deceptively simple, yet I suddenly found myself with over 2 hours invested into it my first time around.  It went very fast.  I haven't completed the game yet, but I am drawn back to it like a month to a flame.			"

												Review for Little InfernoNow this game is something special.The game is simple,basic and in general and easy game. There is no objective,you are not being timed. You burn toys and eventually other items. You do so to get coins to buy more things to burn. You basically just sit there beside a cozy fire infront of your computer.  Now I will be talking about the end so be careful when reading this there will be spoilers So the game introduces you to a set of charachters early on, making you not feel so lonely. These charachters give you comfort and will not dissapoint you. The main charachter introduced in this set would be sugar plums. Now she is something special, she will keep sending you mails, and you soon become friends that keep sending eachother items to burn. Now the other charachter is Ms Nancy she is the head of a corporation called Tomorrow corporation, the maker of the Little Inferno fire place. Now she will introduce you to the shop system. And the last charachter would be The weather man. He gives updates on the current situation outsides and gives you a rough idea on what is happening outside and why you should make your fires to keep cozy.The simplicity adds many hours added to your play count. Beside the fact of not being timed, you have all the time in the world, find all the combos, a system to keep the player puzzeled and entertained.The game isnt perfect of course. The simplicity does make the game worse in some ways. The game is short but furfilling.You will feel satisfied when you finish, due to the atmospheric and intriquing ending of the game.Talking about atmospheric the game has a fantastic artstyle which you have never seen. This game,with its artstyle, will keep you cozy,calm and intriqued. The mails that you keep getting sent will keep you company and will make you feel like you arent alone in this heartless cold world, that seems to have no hope. Now there is a bother in this game, the wait times. Without doing the combos, which you should if you have time, the game will be a long game with wait times that last to 6 minutes. Now the good news logging off would save your progress and save the time , atleast it did for me. Now the ending. The ending is introduced rather slowly. Sugar plumbs will slowly push you towards the end, explaining what has happened to her, will happen to you. The last catalog was her end and you know this as you progress through the game. Now the ending requires you to know the items you send to her over the course of this game. But surprisingly this isnt a hard task, at all. You will remember the items, unless certain conditions. Just due to the unique charachter that she poses to be. The end ties up all the loose strings and as said will make you feel satisfied.I would if I had to rate this game give it a 7/10 Its not something fantastic that would add TONS of replay value. But it is unique and has kept me on my toes, making me pay attention to every damn detail.-Newdles Way over the smoke stacks, over the city Newdles			"

												The artstyle of this game alone should justify the purchase of this game. Very well done use of creepy objects/items. The music, sound effects, fire effects... all Beautiful. Controlling the fire is fluent, controlling the objects on screen, simple yet effective. The ONE thing I would change about it is the fact coins and those tickets are involed. When I first started it up, I though I was playing some highly-microtransaction pay-to-win type games but eventually it started to make sense ( this game has no microtransactions btw). Never once in the game did it feel like I was just grinding through trying to get the most coins, the levels and objects were very fun to play with and getting all 99 combos was fun as hell. If you're not going to 100% the combos, this might be an hour long game for your, but it'd be one fun hour indeed.			"

												During my time with Little Inferno I wasn't sure if I could really call it a ""game"" but when you get to the ending you realize it is one, no spoilers, don't worry. Basicly all you need to know about the game is that you need to accomplish certain combos by burning certain items on your ""fireplace"". Each time you burn an item it gives you more coins than you spent on buying it so it's always a win. There's also coupons which you can use to decrease the time the items take to arrive to your place. I honestly can't describe this game really well, all I can say is that is an AMAZING experience, great story, great music. Loved it, I highly recommend it to anyone!			"

												A fun game that requires attention to detail in order to puzzle out all the combos. The basic premise is simple and burning each of the items is entertaining on its own but the combo hunt and progression made it interesting enough to keep me playing. The production is very clean with good art and okay music. My one gripe is the lack of settings option within the game to adjust the volume but there is a settings.txt which lets you change the volume easily enough.Besides all this though, there is a definite undertone of social commentary and advice which puts It into the bucket of philosophical game stories along with Braid.

This game is amusing and yet incredibly horrifying, oh, and it's fun to burn stuff. It has a story that slowly gets better and more complicated as it progresses from you burning stuff... did I mention it's fun to burn stuff?Started a youtube channel, if you're looking for a facecam reaction of the horrifying nature of this game, give us a quick glance!

												I can now burn everything I have ever owned without blinking an eye. It is good practise if your parents want you to tidy up your room, your boss wants you to take inventory, you have a dead body in your basement, that you forgot to get rid of, or an officer wants to give you a speeding ticket. Just to name a few... Just BURN ANYTHING!			"

												A very cute and fun game where you get to burn things. All sorts of things. Some things explode and some things scream. I've been waiting for a game to burn things for so long!			"

												Little Inferno, my very first game on Steam. Truly a classic in my books with good reason. What on the outside appears to be a mirror of modern tablet and phone games eventually shows that on the inside it is a game with deeper meaning and much more to offer than a phone game would be able to. This game is well worth the money due to its incredible soundtrack, amazing characters, and humorous tongue and cheek jokes sprinkled all throughout this amazing game. Once you finish this game your sure to have enjoyed every minute spent playing it.			"

												Little Inferno is a delightfully relaxing little game. There's really not much to it. Toss things in the fireplace, set them ablaze, enjoy the spectacle, and just keep adding to the pile. There's no fancy gimmicks, no fail states, no time limits. Just you, your fireplace, some awesome tunes and visuals, and the simple, yet effective narrative that unfolds as you make progress. Progressing through the game is simple enough: Burn various items together using clues from a list, earn money, and unlock new catalogs. It's entirely stress free, and you'll always have enough money to just enjoy the simple act of burning items and witnessing their unique interactions with one another. There's no need to rush it, just have a nice chill out session by the virtual fireplace and let things happen as they may. For those that want to enjoy the more ""gamey' aspects, there are 100 combinations of items in all to figure out, and the clues are generally presented well enough that massive bouts of trial and error won't be too necessary.  Even when you guess incorrectly, the visuals and chill ambience Little Inferno provides still make the experience wholly satisfying. Definitely a game to just chill out with after a hard day's work or when you're feeling stressed.			"

												I loved this game so much it compelled me to actually write a review. I've never done that. What started out as a fun-enough little novelty game about burning things, slowly evolved into one of the most unique, interesting, engaging and moving gaming experiences I've ever had. While you're merrily going along, thoughtlessly setting fire to all manner of objects, (and attempting to figure out some of the charming little burn combos along the way) you'll notice the game is beginning to draw you in on a deeper level. There is a story here. There is someone to care about. There are quirky and interesting characters, and ultimately there is an ending which is thought-provoking, humorous, and beautiful.I highly recommend this game. Come for the fire. Stay for the warmth.			"

												When looking at this game before playing, you would think that this game is childish because of the art for the items to buy in the game, but it really isn't that childish once you start playing. The story line isn't that good, but it's okay. The way you can burn everything and get different results everytime with every item is kind of good. I finished the game, and I must say, it's really great. For $10, it's worth it.P.S.: When you get the Hug Coupon from Miss Nancy, keep it until the end so you can get a hug from her. It's a bit of a tip to (possibly) get 100%.			"

												A charming and quirky little tale whose subtle stabs at the time management industry are just as interesting as the dark, apocalyptic, and ultimately hopeful narrative itself.At its surface, Little Inferno is another one of those casual ""waiting"" games. You're given a virtual fireplace in which you'll burn things. You purchase items from a catalog, burn the items, and receive more coins and stamps in the process to buy more expensive items. You continue the process on repeat, just to fill out an entire catalog page and unlock a new one. At its surface, just like any other time management game, the premise seems idiotic. But somehow, it works. You begin to feed the fire, you get to watch how different items react to the flames, you notice that certain combinations yield certain ""achievements"" called combos, and just like that the game has already sucked you in. And that's the point.Beyond its surface, this game seems to be a jab at the time we waste on games of the same ilk. As an example, the reward for successfully completing all 99 combos in the game is a ""Novelty Mousepad"". Essentially, for all that work and for all that time wasted, you receive an item that you can do absolutely nothing with besides burn for more stamps. The game invites you to indulge in its addictive qualities, and then it slaps you in the face for doing so. In my opinion it's brilliantly executed, right down to the oh-so-special ""alternate ending"".So why should you waste your time with this? If it's a game that makes fun of time management games by being, itself, a time management game, what's the point in playing? Well beyond the superficial gameplay, there's actually a rather moving theme lying beneath the surface. It unravels slowly at first, but the ending scene is something rather special.Beyond the warmth and comfort of your homely fireplace is a ravaged and desolate wasteland, slowly being consumed by unknown causes in the ""adult world"". You eventually come to realize this as you're stripped away from your Little Inferno, but despite this, despite the inevitable decline you begin to notice around you, you must remember that there's an entire world out there, and you can go as far as you want.

												Little Inferno is a quirky and fun game. The main plot takes place in a modern time with a twist. The entire world has frozen over. Cities of people thrive indoors and never step foot outside. A company called Tomorrow Coorporation makes a fireplace for kids to burn their toys in. Yay! We can be warm! But what happens when you run out of toys? You buy more, of course! By buying toys, you can unlock new magazines to buy toys from. During the game, you will recieve letters from different people. Without these, the story would have no plot whatsoever. Miss Nancy, the CEO of Tomorrow Coorporation, your neighbor Sugar Plumps, and the weatherman will all send you letters. These letters may include quests that you MUST do in order for the game's story to continue. They are all simple and the hardest they get is sending a toy to Sugar Plumps.Overall, this game is absolutley brilliant. Burning toys and getting more to burn? Who would have thought of it! Out of 10, I would give this game an 8.			"

You can find the little combos that the items burned together will create, and you can listen to the music which is amazing. You can(will) even befriend a strange little girl. The game is short, the combos pretty bizzare, but this game has a certain charm that will make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

												I dunno if the game devs thought ""Let's make a game about burning things!"" but damn is it fun!Because this is what you do over the course of the entire game. Burn things.If you're like me you can easily spend the rest of your life playing this game. It's just so god damn satsifying to burn all the stuff. And all of the stuff you get to burn!So anyway, the story is:The world is getting colder and it is constantly snowing and nobody knows why. The Tomorrow Corporation has taken it upon themselves to create a device (and a bunch of items for it) that keeps people warm. It is the Little Inferno Entertainment Fireplace! What do you do with it? You buy things from the company with their currency and burn them in said fireplace!After you burned everything and discovered the hidden combo there's quite a bit of story at the end but I won't spoiler anything.If you're a pyromaniac or you just find it absolutely satisfying to watch things burn (and scream in the process) then I advise you to: GET. THIS. GAME. 10/10, I love it.			"

												So if you were to try to vaguely explain this game to a friend it would probably just be something along the lines of ""you burn stuff"". But it's more than that, I promise. There's a story of a freezing city and a loose canon neighbor that can get annoying to the general person who doesn't enjoy a casual game. There are combos to achieve and toys to burn. Most of the time, you'll sit there wondering what you're doing with your life. What are you really supposed to be achieveing. And that's the glory of a casual game. But at the end it throws you into an emotional torrent of story with no burning whatsoever. seeing things you never thought you'd see in the game. That's the beauty of it. Little Inferno is not a game I expected to see in my top favorites but stranger things have happened. I highly recommend anyone with a good sense of humor and the patience to play a more simple game give this one a try. Seriously a surprisingly great game.			"

												This game is brilliant, it brings together the attachment to characters that is in games such as The Last of Us and The Walking Dead (season 1 & 2), and melds it with the easiness and playability of Toribash or Unturned. So all in all, I'd give this game a solid 9&1/2 out of 10, as I absolutley love the game, it's story and it's components, however, I feel as if The Tomorrow Corperation could have made the game a bit longer, as it is only about 1 hour long, they could've increased it to  3 and a half hours long, as that is shorter than most games, but a bit longer than games of this genre.

It feels a lot like an ipad game but it works and feels great with a mouse. I never thought I got tricked into paying for a mobile game while playing this. It was worth the spent dough all the way.The puzzles are entertaining brain teasers with great wordplay and this is the most realistic digital fire I've seen in a video game. Furthermore, I CERTAINLY didn't expect that epic ending. Don't miss out on this short-yet-entertaining game!			"

												Little Inferno is a unique and interesting experience. The gameplay is simple: You buy things, you burn things. It can get quite repeditive but for such a short game it is a rewarding experience. The story is compelling and makes several social commentaries. Including how our gaming culture has evolved. To say anymore would spoil the story which is most important factor as you play; As you continue to buy and burn your life savings away. I wouldn't recommend trying to do all of the combos and star all of the catalogs unless you are very determined. As that is where the games repeditive nature really kicks in.Experience and enjoy the story you are being told. Normally I would say a game this short would not be worth its price, but to the right person this can be a great experience that's worth playing  a few times over.			"

												A fun game that requires attention to detail in order to puzzle out all the combos. The basic premise is simple and burning each of the items is entertaining on its own but the combo hunt and progression made it interesting enough to keep me playing. The production is very clean with good art and okay music. My one gripe is the lack of settings option within the game to adjust the volume but there is a settings.txt which lets you change the volume easily enough.Besides all this though, there is a definite undertone of social commentary and advice which puts It into the bucket of philosophical game stories along with Braid.

												I purchased this with the Humble Bundle a while ago and decided to play it, though I had no idea what it would be about. The story seems very simple to start off with but then becomes deeper and more interesting as you progress. It doesn't feel repetitive at all and the graphics are quite nice - a lot better than any fireplace simulator that you could purchase for your tv. Little Inferno can become fairly difficult when you have to burn specific items together in order to progress but there are many options and I wasn't stuck for very long.The one thing I remember most from this game is that you can import an image from your computer into the game and burn it. While not particularly necessary to the game's story, it is very entertaining on its own.			"

												It`s Little Inferno just for me!This game is a really relaxing one, and it is a ton of fun to play. The most interesting aspect of this game is poperly the story, which you can analyze (or in some cases overanalyze) to have a really deep meaning, but I will get back to that.The gamepaly is really simple you have to burn stuff. And that`s the game, you do nothing more than burning stuff, and it sounds really boring but the game has a fun way, to twist this, so it becomes fun to play.Throughout the game, you will unlock more and more stuff to burn, and all the items have some unic way of burning away, this gives some fun events and senarios, which is enjorable in every way. The other part of the game, is finding combinations. To make the combinations you have to burn specifick things together, in order to unlock the secret. Normally you only get one sentence to geuse, what the combination is, and it is really fun to try to solve the code.Now to the story, the story centers around you, that have got the ""Little Inferno intertaining fireplace"" which is a toy for children in the games world. You are intreduced to four charecters in the game, and then there is the main charecter, which we get no relation to. We get to know miss Nancy, the creator of the Little Inferno, The weather man, who tells you the weather report, your upstairs neighbor Sugar Plumps, who tells you secrests and gives you tasks, and then there is the mailman, who we only meet towards the end. There are two more charecters in the game, but they are not as important for the story as the before mentiont.The analyzing part of this game, is that the fireplace could be a metaphor for gaming.Everytime the fireplace is mentiont the charecters keep taliknig about how you are just wasting time playing the game, not even in a bad way, but more in a revelatory way, where you can think about what you are doing. Sugar Plumps is also good to back of this theory, since she is talking about you two are so close, and yet so far, in relation to the fact that you are palying games together, but in the very end, you are only two screens looking at eachother, insteed of meeting in real life.If you would like a game, where you burn stuff in order to get money to burn more stuff, this is the game for you.If you are a person that like a simple stoyline you easily can interpretent on, this is a game for you.If you like to solve puzzeles, and get rewards in games, this is a game for you.I give this game a thumps up. 7 out of 10			"

												This is truly one of the most entertaining games that I had played in a while. While solving the puzzles themselves is not that rewarding, experimenting with the results of burning various combinations of items in the fireplace is surprisingly entertaining. The atmosphere is great, mostly because of the amazing soundtrack, leaving me with a feeling of sadness despite all the fun that this game provides. Unfortunately, after only 5h of gameplay, it's all over, and I was left wanting more.I hope that this is not too much of a spoiler, but the only downside of this game for me was the very disappointing ending.

												I was holding off on getting this game because of the childish looking graphics, dialogue, and gameplay, but then I saw some YouTube lets-players play the game so I decided to get it for myself.  It was probably one of the best decisions of my life. This game is INCREDIBLY entertaining, as the wacky dialogue has you craving for more, and the crazy items you can get leave you stuck to the screen, trying to get the remaining combos for the next unlockable catalogue.  It is a short game, as I beat it in about 4 hours, but it does have a high replay value, due to the 99 combos you can get, and just the overall stress releaving attitude of the game.  I would say get this if you are into simple games, cause this game will have you craving the aspect of setting things on fire to release you of your pent up stress.			"

Hey, Kids! Burn ALL Of Your Toys! - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]Hey, hey, kids! How are you doing today? Are you having fun? No? Are you bored of the internet? Cat pictures and♥♥♥♥♥♥not enough for you? All these electronics all over the place just white noise getting in the way of your fun? I have an idea!BURN IT ALL. EVERYTHING. HA HA HA. IT'LL BE TONS OF FUN. AND IT'LL KEEP YOU ALL NICE AND TOASTY-WARM. DO IT. BURN ALL OF YOUR TOYS. BURN IT ALL.Oh? You can't? Well, why the ♥♥♥♥ not? It's easy, come on, anyone can do it. Here, I'll even get you started. Here's your own little personal, nonstop, high-definition, entertainment fireplace. Little Inferno! (Uproarious screams of feral children)Little Inferno is the latest indie masterpiece from the geniuses behind World of Goo, over at Tomorrow Corporation. Originally a launch title for the Wii U's eShop, Little Inferno also found a nice home on PC and Mobile.Like its predecessor, Little Inferno is incredibly unique. The art style is noticeably distinct, with a strong Tim Burton vibe. And that style seems to leak into every other aspect of the game in all of the best ways. Your only purpose in the game is to burn everything. Burn it all. Let it all burn. If that doesn't sound like fun to you, why, you may as well be at the bottom of the ocean.Little Inferno will start you off with the meager instruction manual of the fireplace itself, which will burn pretty quick. But everything you burn will fade to dust, and from that dust will pop magical coins. Coins of a material far more valuable than gold, or silver. They're coins of love. Or maybe chocolate, but those would melt close to the fire.Once you've gotten that far, the entirety of the game opens up to you. You'll be able to purchase a fine selection of perfectly burnable items from one of the many catalogs. Each one brings with it its own unique properties. If you burn batteries, they explode. If you burn wood or paper, it burns very bright and quick. And if you burn living things, why they let out the most delightful scream. But it's not until you've started combining things that the action really starts to heat up. Ba-dum-tss.Little Inferno is a special game in that it's not one with concrete goals. There are no missions to complete, or collectibles to find. It's a simple game with a simple goal. Burning things. It's not quite a puzzle game, or a physics game, or a sandbox game. But it definitely features elements of all three.Trivial ""combo"" challenges work as one of the little things to keep you busy, tasking you with solving little pun riddles by burning specific items together. For example, the ""Springtime"" combo requiring you to set fire to a pack of flower seeds and an alarm clock. Which explodes into a fun little mess of flowers and mechanical bits. Aside from that, the only real ""goals"" to the game are burning every object at least once.But Little Inferno isn't one of those kinds of games. Little Inferno is about more that that. It's about bigger things. Simply burning everything, yeah, that's pretty fun. But the game's surprisingly strong story leaves the biggest impact. And it's done in such a subtle way. In addition to the many flammable objects that you'll be getting in your little mailbox, you'll get occasional letters from your neighbor and other characters. While at first innocent, charming, and mildly creepy, they'll slowly start to clue you in to a much bigger, much more chilling goings-on happening away from your fireplace.It's not a very long game. Unless you attempt to solve every challenge, you should be done with it in hours. It's a lot like like lighting your house on fire. It goes out super fast unless you pour gasoline on it. Trust me. You wouldn't even need to call any firefighters or anything. If you're looking for the kind of game that you can sink tons of time into doing things that might seem ""productive"", this game is not it. But the developers clearly put a lot of love into every little object. Each one is unique in quite a few ways. Some of them have multiple pieces, or react to fire in fun ways. And some have properties that can interact with other objects. You can light a cat on fire and have it explode, filling your entire fireplace with cat poop. And then drop a nuke inside. What kind of sick person would NOT jump at the opportunity to nuke a fireplace full of cat poop?Once you've burned through the game, Little Inferno's haunting and chilling feel will live on in your mind for quite a while. Everything from the zany pyromaniac action to the beautiful use of sound and music, and quirky art direction will leave an impression on you. It's definitely the kind of game that sticks with you for a while after. Burning inside you. Ba-dum-tss.It's the most fun you can have that isn't lighting actual things on fire. And once you've finished playing it, you can just burn the game too. Burn your computer, your game systems, your phones, just burn everything. It'll be tons of fun.Always remember, kids. If you're not the one setting things on fire, you're just the kindling.			"

												Little Inferno is a really hard game to do a review on. Aside from being completely unique, everything is a potential spoiler and just a product of interpretation.I'll talk about its 2 parts. I'll start of with the actual game mechanics, and I'll then talk about the themes it adresses and how well they're complemented with its mechanics.In Little Inferno you have but one objective. And that is to burn stuff. And then, buy more stuff to burn. As you burn something, you'll get just enough money to buy something more.That's the premise. Regarding presentation, the game if fairly minimalist, but also very unique. The graphic style may remind you of World of Goo, and rightfully so, as it was made by the same designer.As you spend most of your time burning stuff, it's obvious that the fire effects would be the focus here. And they look absolutely amazing at times. Perhaps not the flames themselves, but the whole dynamic smoke created around it, with which the player can interact (while waiting for something to burn).Simple, yet awesome visuals.The music is just as simple, and also really good! It's usually more in the background, but it does fit the setting pretty well, and you can clearly hear it in the needed moments. So, all in all, great sound design!Now, the mechanics.In this game, when you buy a certain item, you need to wait for it to arrive to your home. This starts out by taking a couple of seconds, but grows to as much as 5 minutes in the end of the game.If you're out of money, there are also spiders and other bugs that appear in your fireplace from time to time, that drop a coin after you burn them.Do you get it now? Seems an awful lot like ""cow-clicker"", right? Well, to a certain point, it is. But it's also much more than that. More on that later.There are 2 types of currency. One, is just coins, that you can use to buy more items, or inventory slots. The other one, is Stamps, that you can use to speed up the delivery process (1 Stamp for 30 seconds). You can see it as the ""Premium Currency"" in most social games. But you don't pay for it, of course.How does one earn stamps? By making Combos, which is the main mechanic of the game (aside from mindlessly burning everything you can!). Not unlike iOS and social games, there are missions. Achievements (in-game only), if you will. On this tab, all you're given is the name of said Combo, and the number of items needed for it (ranging from 2 to 3).There are about 100 different combos, but you only need to do 45 of them to be able to ""finish"" the game.Some of them are pretty obvious, others are far harder. What impressed me here was that some of them require were far deeper than I expected them to be, even if presented in a very light way. Just like the rest of the game, actually. It can have fairly deep interpretations, or it can not. Everything is very casually presented, never pointing fingers or judging anything. Just making the player aware of its message without trying to force it into him. And it does it very well!The game is divided into catalogues, each with a theme, and items about it. The Combos can be about one single catalogue, or include items from different ones. Initially, you only need money to unlock catalogues, but later on, you'll need stars to be able to access them (stars can be acquired by completing combos).And that's mainly it, really. While you do all this, you'll receive letters from 3 people, but this fits more into the subjective nature of the game, and not as much to the mechanics, as a game.As a conclusion about gameplay only:It's a very limited game, and despite all the work put into the synergies between some of the items (and some were really, really good! I loved most of them), it's mostly flavour, and not a lot of meat. And that was intended, making it harder to criticize.Regardless, if you're looking for a challenging game, or a traditional game, stay away from this. It's not why it was made, and I doubt you would appreciate it if you went into it looking for that. This is mostly grind and no challenge in terms of gameplay.The game can be a bit boring and laborious at times and to be honest, I think it overextended a little bit. The points could have been made with less grind, but it's hard to say.So, why is it good?The game adresses themes related to the rise of social games, so called ""cow-clickers"", and how people waste their lives in front of the screen, doing nothing.The point of the game is to burn food, toys, statuettes, ... everything, really. Things with inherent value to them, and yet... you're just burning it all. The world is a cold, scary place outside, so you simply burn everything that can remind you of it. You don't think about why you're doing it, you simply do it. You and probably thousands of others. But you can't really be sure, you only know 3 people! As I said, the game isn't trying to criticize or make fun of anything, necessarily. It simply presents the subjects to the player, and never really opinates on it. It's all left to interpretation. It would have been easier to point fingers and laugh, but no. Little Inferno is classier than that.Another important aspect, is the context of the game. Right now, the closest connection might be casual games, but the same can apply for countless other situations, it's a pretty versatile metaphor.This game can lead to way more discussions that I can write about right now, and most of them would probably spoil the experience.I tried not to give away too much about it, but I'm not sure I've managed that very well.If you're looking for a completely different that will make you think, pick it up, it's really great! If you're looking for a challenge, don't do it. It's not the point of it and it will probably leave a really bad impression on you.Buyer beware: First off, the game doesn't make its point very clear very fast. It will test your patience before showing its cards, mostly in the ending.Second, the game was trying to burn my graphics card (how ironic, isn't it? I hope that was not intended haha!) due to a lack of V-Sync. You can however enable it directly in the settings documents. Go to user/.../AppData/Roaming/Little Inferno/settings.txt and change the option from 0 to 1, and save the file. That solved any issues for me.This was a really awesome experience overall. The path wasn't the most enjoyable, but the ending made the whole thing fit, and worthwhile.It's great to be surprised by small indie teams with titles like Little Inferno. Give this one a try! "

But, no seriously, this game is amazing and you will feel amazing afterword. Played it multiple times and I still can't stop. Totally worth the money. 10/10			"

												It's a simple game, the videos on the store page will give you a good idea of what the gameplay is like - burn things in a fireplace. Expanding a little on that, the idea is that you burn stuff you buy from the games store in combinations which lets you get access to another level of things to burn. And you don't have to worry about running out of in game money to buy stuff from the store as everything you burn gives you money !Some of the stuff you can burn in your little inferno are really fun, some of the stand outs for me are the mini planets, the cold heart, the nuke, the chainsaw and the valkyrie woman among others.My one gripe is there are no options, running at 1000fps isn't really nessesary so a v-sync option would be nice. And the worst for me is no volume control, the inferno itself is rather quiet as you'd expect from a fireplace but when you go to the store to buy supplies the store music is too loud and repetetive this annoys everyone in my house, myself included!Those are just small complaints though, the game has a humerous and endearing story, fun gameplay and doesn't seem to have any technical faults unlike many other games being sold these days, beware though that for me it only lasted 7.5 hours until completion (I did have to cheat a bit looking up combo's to burn though).

												Wouldn't really call this a game, more of an interactive toy. You burn toys, figure out toy combinations, and unlock more toys to burn. The story behind it is rather charming and creepy at times. Playing this during a rainy day is somehow quite relaxing. 7/10			"

												An experimental game about burning all of your stuff, buying some more to burn and waiting again and again. Nice visual style (reminiscent of World of Goo) but the game is pretty short and repetitive. That's about it. Only buy on sale if you're an interested pyromaniac or keep your money for a lighter.

												Cute little game with a generally fun combo-matching mechanic, a satisfying flame effect and good humor in the writing and excellent animations.  Pyromaniacs will love the heck out of a game like this! As for it's story; It is very simple yet funny. It is defiantly worth getting the ending to see what happens, so there is a reason to play it, rather than just to burn things. [7/10]			"

												If Tim Burton made video games, this is probably what he'd make.  It's artsy and metaphorical without being pretentious or obtuse.  The metaphors are pretty plain to see: You burn things to get money you can use to buy things you can then burn for more money... But it has to end sometime.  When shopping, it plays 50's era music to get you in the mindless consumerist mindset, to boot.  Most things don't simply burn.  When you burn sausages from the food catalogue, a swarm of flies bursts out, for example, or an ear of corn pops into popcorn.  This adds a little suspense and entertainment to what would otherwise be just a fireplace simulator.  To give the player something to actually think about, there are ""unlockable combos"" that really do nothing but give you something to complete.  (There are even exactly 100 of them to complete for 100% completion...)  These are mostly puns or ""do you remember these items that share a similar theme from 10 minutes ago?""  I.E. ""Polar Bear"" requires you burn the South Pole and stuffed bear toys together.That said, not to cut into the dev's bread money, but you should probably buy this one on sale - It's not the sort of game that will last you more than a few hours unless you want to replay it or let your friends/family play a second game, and $10 for 2-5 hours of bemusement, especially when a lot of it ultimately amounts to filler, anyway, pushes my tolerance.

												Little Inferno is a game that lets you burn whatever to your heart's desire! The game is pretty short (~4 hours) and as you progress through the game you will be burning different combination of items together to unlock new items and the combos. Surprisingly, there is a story underneath all of this which the game executes very well and also has a very neat ending sequence. Great game for the winter time as the game puts you right in front of a virtual fireplace.			"

												What's not to like about this game? You burn things. Things that scream. There's a mystery here to be uncovered. Why are you sitting in front of your fireplace burning all your toys? Why are some of the catalog items you burn disturbingly...wrong? What's that strange thumping coming from the other side of the wall? You have to play to find out.Little Inferno is set in front of a fireplace. You order items from catalogues, and you burn them. There are combos of items, and it's up to you to puzzle out what they are, and burn the correct combinations, in order to progress. That's all. There's nothing more. If you need more, then I suggest you move along to another game. But if you're just the least bit tempted, pull up a chair next to the fire, and burn some things with me. It's warm here, next to the fire....			"

												A surprisingly melancholy experience, Little Inferno is a captivating piece of interactive entertainment. I say that because it really isn't much of a game, at least not in the normal sense. There are no scores, no real goals to complete, and no enemies to fight. And yet it still manages to get under your skin and hook you from the minute you light your first toy on fire.But, burn, buy, burn, the endless and monotonous grind should be an absolute chore, but somehow I couldn't stop playing the game. Maybe it was the fantastic presentation, that is both charming and creepy do to the fact you are ultimately burning them all. Or maybe Little Inferno is trying to say something about the way games inherently snare us in away from the world, and the fact I was so drawn into it only further drives home this message.I can't honestly describe my experience with Little Inferno, and I'm not even sure I would say I enjoyed it, but what I do know is that it unlike anything else, and absolutely worth playing!

												5/10+ Great music score - cute, atmospheric, memorable. It is a bit repetitive though.+ There's a large range of items to burn, and they are nicely designed+ Physics are well done+ The game has a unique charm to it+ The story and style of the game is very different in the last part of the game, but is not intriguing enough to make the whole experience worthwhile.- Burning stuff gets old quick. - Gameplay is very limited. You basically burn items, and if you burn enough combinations of some items (combos) you move to the next level, only to find a catalog with a bunch of new items to burn.- Combos seem quite random. Some make sense, most do not.- Delays until items arrive is annoying, especially if you run out of ""Tomorrow Stamps"" (which are used to accelerate shipments)- You occasionally receive letters, but they're repetitive and not very interestingAll in all, a rather boring game that I can't recommend. If it's part of a bundle you may want to give it a shot, but I wouldn't spend much to buy it.			"

												To me Little Inferno is about as much fun as you can have with a fire. Five minutes of watching stuff burn and then you begin experimenting with other things and see how they burn away in to the flames. From a game point of view it's a very shallow amount of gameplay and even for a short game (depending on how fast you combine certan items to burn to fill a check list) it feels like it over stays it's welcome. The novelty of burning stuff wears off fast and once completing the game you are given what I'll expect is supposed to be a meaningful story covered in whimsy and a burton-esque theme but comes off as a desperate attempt at social commentary. Yes we get how destroying material objects in order to gain more is a look in to our own lives and how we live in society but it's not really adding to the entertainment of the game in question.I enjoyed Little Inferno for ten minutes. After that you are just going through the motions.			"

Every item in the game reacts differently when burned. It's good incentive to progress through the game to see what the next unlocked item will be and how it will react when you torch it.- There is a story, and it's quite good. I loved the ending.Cons:- Some of the item combos were VERY difficult to figure out. I had to cheat and look them up a few times. After seeing what they were, I still couldn't see how anyone could have figured them out on their own.- It's a fairly short game.I had a lot of fun playing Little Inferno.

												Personal Rating: 8/10This game. It's great! The story is simplistic, yet very effective, making you care for the characters in the game. If you want a burning simulator, this is for you. If you want a depressing story about the Tomorrow Corporation Owner leaving everyone for dead, this is for you. The art style, beautiful. The animations on each burning object, neat. The amount of time and thought that went into this game is superb.Now from that above statement you're probably thinking. ""But Doc! Why isn't it 10/10?""Well, that's a very easy question. It reminds me of The Simpsons Tapped Out. Constantly waiting for another object, to move on to the next part of the story, that is spoon fed to you every ten minutes or so. Another thing is replay value. None that I can find myself doing, it's a one playthrough game, however fun it is. I must admit there are side ""quests"" that have been added, like finding all the recipies and the secret ending (which I wont be spoiling). In closure, it's a lovely game and it's worth the money to support the developers future depressing inferno games.			"

												A little casual indie game where you burn stuff for fun.You get some money for burning stuff so you can buy even more stuff to burn.The only challenge you're going to get is trying to find out about some 'combos', like burning a wood wolf and a moon together. Doing so will give you some more money and unlock more stuff to burn.There's also a little funny plot going on, but even though it's entertaining it's pretty simple and talking too much about it would be a spoiler.It'll take about 3 to 4 hours to complete the game (unlock and burn everything and see the ending), but burning stuff wont get old so fast so it kinda has a good replayability value.Well, I liked it.

												It's a rather short game, I played through it in four hours, but I also skipped a lot of combos and such because I didn't see the point in doing it to get them starred, when the stars didn't earn you anything, and getting the combos doesn't unlock an achievement for Steam. I would love to see achievements or trading cards added, because I'm an achievement hound and I like trading cards/crafting badges, but even without those the game is worth playing. It's got a bit of a lesson to it, mostly one of those ""Don't waste your life in front of a computer"" lessons. I liked the humor in the game, I love the music in the game, and the art, sound effects, and visual effects are lovely. I definitely recommend this game, and I can totally see the irony in saying that. It's just a fun, casual game. Plus, you can burn pictures from your own files in the game, so it could be a little therapeutic when angry with a family member or best friend. Not that anyone would use that function for such purposes.....			"

There is a challenge to unlock all of the hidden combinations you can make with the different toys, but isn't required to beat the game. If you want to set things on fire, watch the colorful explosions and laugh evilly at burning teddy bears... Then this is the game for you. I would suggest getting it on sale as it is only 6-8 hours gameplay at most with no replay.			"

That is it, there is nothing else; the more things you throw into the fireplace, the more things you unlock to continue doing so. That being said, this game is actually quite charming. The objects you throw in all have interesting and sometimes hilarious animations. A good time waster for when you're bored. Pick it up when it's part of a sale or bundle and you won't be disappointed.			"

												Quote the following exchange from School of Rock:""...Freddie, what do you like to do?""""I dunno... burn stuff?""With an art style similar to its big brother World of Goo, Little inferno is a game where you quite simply burn stuff.And it's beautiful, the combinations even beyond the 99 you need for all the items, are deliciously chaotic, and the plot is pretty nice.After completing the game, you'll still be firing it up to have your friends and family indulge in their pyromaniac fantasies. Who knew Gran was a firestarter?			"

												A surprisignly addictive game; I had previous bought this from humble bundle 8 and only recently had it brought to my attention by a friend to play.It has an amazing soundtrack, the physics and watching things burn is surprisingly addictive (in part due to not only the physics, but the way things burn up/crumble/special effects from certain things,) But looking even deeper into it, there's a story, and the story is quite compelling if you're paying attention to the letters you get, all the way up until the end. This is the best ""entertainment-esque"" game (the closest I can compare is say Interactive Buddy) that I have played by far, and I sincerely recommend it.			"

												Its a fun game. Burning certain things together makes combos. Unlocking combos gives you access to the next set of items and a new set of combos to figure out. Its a silly little game that lets you burn things and watch them explode.. and sometimes scream. Enjoyable and worth it if you can get it on sale or in the Humble Indie Bundle 8.			"

												This disturbing, yet cute little game hooked me hard. All you do is light things on fire, but there's so much more to it. It's so much funner than its simple concept and gameplay suggests it to be, if lighting things on fire sounds fun all by itself, just go get this game. It's just amazing. I got it on a sale for $4, and I got a simply lovely game experience. There is some kind of story that pushes you along as well, and the presentation is so top-notch that it really blows my mind that this game was made largely just by three people. Just a really great game, I was truly enthralled throughout the entire thing. And the burning is very satisfying, and there's just so many things to burn. Just go get the game and BURN BURN BURN EVERYTHING! It's great!			"

												I was pleasantly surprised by the actual depth of the story line, in what appeared to be a simple physics and fire puzzle type game.  The music is great, the atmosphere is spooky and single focused, and you develop attachments to characters you never even see.  The mechanism is simple, but the message is complex. All in all, I'm pleased that I bought the game, I enjoyed playing it, and forsee me buying it for friends in the future, because what's the point of having friends if you can't enable their inner pyromaniac, I ask you?  That said; I'm not sure the game has a tremendous amount of replay-ability, if you get all/most of the combos the first time through, because I don't think the emotional ""punch"" will be there if you know what's coming.  This is a beautifully done game, both visually and storytelling, and well worth the price.			"

												For Adults :This game is delightful, and if you burn through it in short order, you can experience a narrative with the tone of an early Tim Burton film. It is delightfully macabre, and in its final act - surprisingly affecting. Worth the 10 dollar price of admittance, and practically a steal when on sale. For Children:I can't even imagine how fun this game is for a kid. Seriously, my partner's siblings beg me to play this game. The harder combinations are pretty difficult for some kids under say 6 or 7, but as long as they can read - they can usually figure them out through experimentation.  "

												Welcome my brothers , come in from the freezing cold into the world of Little InfernoThe first thing you should know, is that it's freezing, like really freezing, my nipples can cut diamonds freezing. As a functioning member of society, you the noble consumer order various pieces of illegal contraband from the Tomorrow Corporation, aka as the Guatemalan black market. The crafty people of Guatemala can get you all kinds of things, a bus full of children, a conveniently shrunken moon, and a nuclear device. Yes , you heard me right ! A NUCLEAR DEVICE. You can now be the envy of despots everywhere, well until you burn the device in a fireplace. Yes, you must sacrifice, time, money, and your own sanity as you burn away your already meager funds so you can line the pockets of rich fat cats in their ivory tower of doom overlooking your pitiful hovel.

												The game itself is pretty neat, but it has a pay to win aesthetic which I found insurmountable.  The point of the game is to burn stuff in your fireplace, and sometimes burning specific stuff in conjunction.  There is also a girl next door who creates something of a plot.  This is all ok.  The problem was when you order stuff to burn, it takes longer and longer to show up.  This is akin to any mobile game which makes you pay to speed up the timer.  The timer is not part of the game, it is only an inconvenience.  That mechanic got SO annoying I cannot recommend this game.			"

												Great and captivating game, everything was all good until one day I started burning things in real life and that's when they tried to put me in a straitjacket.

												This seemingly simple game just has so incredibly much style! It is really amazing. The main features of this game are fun enough, I mean, who doesn't like burning things? But the real charm is in the story. You start off by burning things, creating combo's and unlocking more things to burn, but after a while some odd things I won't go into detail about happen, and you start feeling like there's something wrong with burning things... But of coarse it's a ton of fun, so you keep doing it. More and more weird♥♥♥♥♥♥happens and... Ah hell, you'll have to experience it. Fun mechanics, great story, short gameplay. Definitely worth your time though, and about 5 bucks I'd say. Get this one, it's really great. One of the rare moody games, that sadly don't really get made anymore. Which is exactly why you should buy it. If you want. You have to.			"

												For Adults :This game is delightful, and if you burn through it in short order, you can experience a narrative with the tone of an early Tim Burton film. It is delightfully macabre, and in its final act - surprisingly affecting. Worth the 10 dollar price of admittance, and practically a steal when on sale. For Children:I can't even imagine how fun this game is for a kid. Seriously, my partner's siblings beg me to play this game. The harder combinations are pretty difficult for some kids under say 6 or 7, but as long as they can read - they can usually figure them out through experimentation.  "

Posted: December 14, 2013
												Now, I was a huge fan of World of Goo which was created by the same team as Little Inferno, it has a charming characterization of goo and a Tim Burton-esque art style (I hate to always compare anything with a dark cartoon like style to Tim Burton but whatever). Not to go off on a tangent, but World of Goo was a great puzzle/engineering game, it was stylish, polished, sympathetic, and magical, I was totally enraptured by the whole experience.When I heard that they were making a new game I immediately became elated, I watched the teaser trailer for Little Inferno and was hooked. Constantly I wondered what the gameplay was going to be like. And then I heard the news… Little Inferno was little more than a simple app; a time waster, an “I have 5 minutes to kill so I’ll play this silly game” game. I felt defeated. I tossed away my hopes and moved on towards other titles.Then it just so happened that Little Inferno was in fact, in one of the Humble Indie Bundles, of course I bought it for Hotline Miami but hey, I might as well check out Little Inferno and form my own opinions. Well, I cannot say that it was not what I was expecting. It is a game where you burn stuff, yeah that is it. A game for pyromaniacs. Now there are quite a lot of things to burn, mind you, but the entire game is buy things from a catalog and toss them into your “Little Inferno” and burn, burn away.If you were ever a kid (and I am sure most of you were), then you may remember a point in your childhood wherein you took to the matches and lit stuff on fire, either army men, toys, sticks, etc… That is what this game is, it taps into your inner pyromaniac; watching the warm orange glow of a smoldering grandma; it all feels very comforting.Now, as you play, you will constantly unlock new things to burn, some things burn nicely, like stuffed animals or wood, and others not so much, like fragile china. It all feels very rewarding, in that, you purchase stuff to burn, and when you burn it you get more money for burning for which you can spend to purchase more stuff to burn; it is a vicious cycle. A very simple concept, yet it somehow is extremely hypnotic.I have not quite explained everything though, there is a slight puzzle element, where you need to burn a combination of items based off some keywords, for example: CORNFLAKES – you need to burn corn and a box of cereal. Some of the word puzzles are fairly simple, and others can be quite a stretch. These puzzles leave a bit of room for thinking while you wait for your products to arrive. Yeah, I don’t quite know why they incorporated a time period for items to be delivered to you other than to pad gameplay, but it becomes especially obnoxious once you have done everything in the game and must wait around a minute to get your items. You can use coupons to speed up the delivery but come on, I have ‘beaten’ the game, just let me burn stuff.And that about covers the entire game; Oh, I almost forgot, the story. Now, I will admit, that I did not quite understand the ending or even what the whole story was really about. This is what I gathered – global warming. Yeah, I really hope I am wrong about this, but the entire concept is that the world is getting colder and nobody knows why, so stay inside and burn all your toys. It is not that hard to see the correlation; but it is not like it really matters, they do not even expand upon this idea, it feels like there is about as much depth in the narrative as there is in the gameplay.Well, I think I have said all that there is to say about this one. Is worth your time? Not really. Is it cheap? No, in the same manner as Proteus, it is offered for an outrageous price of $10, two dollars seems more appropriate. I won’t complain since I got it in the bundle, but you should avoid paying full price. Overall, it is a cozy and entrancing little game yet too shallow to really offer an experience.So no I cannot recommend it.			"

This is the best ""entertainment-esque"" game (the closest I can compare is say Interactive Buddy) that I have played by far, and I sincerely recommend it.			"

												Brutally simple as it is, it is a great game. Little Inferno is a bit of a parody on consumer society and the entire product placement industry. You order products and you burn them, while corresponding via letters with different kinds of characters. It is much more interesting than it sounds, though. Almost every object you burn has its character and has its own weird physics and if you combine them properly, you get combo bonuses (in fact, you could say that that's your main in-game task). As the game itself states, mockingly self-conscious, there are no timers, level grinding and failures, mere incinerating with casual, but addictive, puzzle solving. In fact, if there was a genre called ""sadistic pyro puzzle"", this would be it.Even though I got this from Humble Bundle, I would say that it is worth its standalone price.			"

												A repetitive and boring satire on idle games and gaming by using the very same things the game is making fun of, with a purposely vague ending (make up your own interpretation! what a great story!). Not a puzzle game at all. Small moments like some puns are noteworthy, but that's the highest it will get. Most of the time you'll just be waiting one to five minutes at a time for a mediocre ending. Playing feels like work. 4/10.Does this review seem short? Well, the entire game is almost entirely the same repetitive thing over and over, so it's not like copypasting the whole review 3 times will make it better. Which is exactly what this game is. There's no deeper meaning in this game and it's far from exploring ideas like World of Goo (previous game by developer) did.			"

												A good game that's about watching high-definition pixels burning all the things while being very amusing and relaxing.Little Inferno is a causal, relaxing game with a underlying message behind the gameplay and the story that's told through mail you get periodically every now and again when you buy the next tier of items to set ablaze in your Little Inferno Playset.Before I explain the gameplay, I want to explain some of the foundations of this game this way it feels less awkward in the transistion to the mechanics and how this game is played.So to start. Little Inferno takes place in a time where the world is on apocolyptic-conditions due to the fact that the weather outside is in artic-conditions. Little Coporporation invented ""The Little Inferno"" to stall the arctic advances with creating a temporary source of heat emitted from the Little Inferno playsets (there's many theories and spoilers surrounding this subject, so i'll avoid that.). You have been given one of these playsets in-regards to your entertainment of setting a vast assortment of items on fire.Okay, in this game there's three main characters as you progress. The Weatherman who gives you up-to-date messages about the world and weather, Bubbles, who is your neighbor and also possess a Little Inferno Playset. And then there's the CEO of Little Inferno Corporation who sends you letters from time to time.To progress the story, you have to buy items to burn and then harvest the coins that drop from said burned items to purchase a more-expensive item. You continue doing this until you reach the end of a catalouge. Then you'll be given the option to buy the next catalouge, which has a fee requirement and a combo requirement.Combos, are essentially puzzles. You get a list of these said ""combos"" with a combo title and a clue to how many items are needed to achieve it.  To do this, you must figure out what items are involved in the combo and then you must buy them and then burn them altogther sharing the same flame. If the combo is correct, it will be checked off on your list and you'll be given stamps.Stamps, are used to fast-forward the time you have to wait for shipments to come to your home in the game. The longer amount of time it takes to get there, the more stamps it will cost. Essentially you can wait the time down to be something you'd be more comfortable spending. So say an item costs 7 stamps to instantly send it to your inventory, you can wait a minute or two and then have it sent directly to your house at the price of 3 stamps.Stamps are just used for when you're feeling a little impatient and want to speed things up. They are dropped randomly from a burned item from time to time.The game has good pacing as buying a new catalouge eats up a hearty wad of your cash. More or less forcing you to start from one or two catalouges in the past and work your way back up again. But it also gives you opportunity to figure out other combos as some combos cannot be completed until a new catalouge and item is unlocked.The special effects and sound effects in this game are quite good. There's high-definition effects mixed in with their art style and they work well with each other. Also this games good sense of dark humor is quite pleasing.I found it hard to find any issues with this game as any issues I have with it stems with the fact that I may have not been playing it relaxingly and casually. This game functions very well and it's items mechanics are quite good, no bugs, glitches or anything. Everything functions smoother than a hot blade through butter. It was a very good experience.The story behind the gameplay was very solid, and the games mechanics are simple but they're perfect and well-designed for a relaxing casual game like this.So, all in all. The sound effects are good and they make the proper sounds for all interactions I feel. The balance between the art-style and the graphics they used is well-done. The humor's good, the story's good. I can't complain about this game. At all. They know what they envisioned, and they made it and really made a perfectly functioning game and I commend them for that. Nothing seemed out of placed or a nail jagged out of the floorboards if you catch my drift.I have replayed Little Inferno 3 times, I am unsure of how many times people would replay this game. So I can't give a reasonable estimate for that other than you'll surely beat it once. I bought this game on sale, but it is most definitely worth the full price.Thank you for reading my review, I hope it has aided you in your consideration if you want to buy this product or not.Just know that even if you beat this game once and you wouldn't want to beat it again. ...you'll definitely return to just watch things burn in all their high-resoluted burning glory.Again, thanks for reading. Have a good one.			"

												Little Inferno is a game about letting go of the past.Like the writings of Aesop, Little Inferno could be described as an allegorical narrative. From the outset of the game, we learn that nothing matters, except for its capacity to burn. Even the rules of the game are among the first things that are incinerated. From there, nothing is spared from the fire. Photographs, cardboard hearts and letters, everything that could be considered sentimental is burned, destroyed, and forgotten. This is a sentiment that I can personally relate to.Modern consumerism is also explored, and perhaps, one could argue, taken to its logical conclusion. Meaningless things are bought and burned to make way for more meaningless things. This is a cycle that can continue indefinitely, and unless you choose otherwise, probably will. It is a stark warning, but in this warning is also a kind of comfort.In conclusion, there is much to discover in the modern computer game Little Inferno. It is a whimsical adventure that hides a serious side, and after extensive exploration I am left with one, final regret. It is a regret that I cannot throw my life onto a fire in the way that is depicted in this game. All I can do is take an overdose of sleeping pills and strike one final match, letting it fall into the strategically placed pools of gasoline spread around the house. This will be my final act. Goodbye.			"

												This is a simple game about burning differen items, this sounds fun? Well it is for a while, untill you start having to wait for new items. This means that you are not free to experiment, there is also little interaction between objects instead they just burn.Now I know that the timer is a crtique of in app purchases, but it detracts from what should be a really good game.It does have a few good things going for it like art style and references to other media, but apart from that theres not much else. So yeah, avoid it unless its in a bundle with a load of other games.Also don't forget to check out their other game ""World of goo"", thats really good and has fun puzzles / gameplay.			"

												Little Inferno is a work of art. The superb way every item forces you to calculate combos perfectly, the many varied toys with hunderds of unique designs, everything comes together to make what is certainly the greatest indie game, burning toys game, and meme game of 2015.			"

												21/30 Gameplay	10/12 Replayability 12/12 Sound 14/17 Graphics	12/12 Controls	12/17 Longness	81/100In ""Little Inferno"" you...well...burn stuff. That's it. And for some reason burning stuff gives you money- more than you have to give out for buying them items. So... well... boring you think? No!There are 100 Combos you can breake, some are more hard, some less, and having enough combos you unlock new items. So you always have a motivation for finding out the combos. But anyways...it becomes repetetive after some time and so the game left some points back at gameplay.But it is pretty nice for Replayability: Sometimes I just think: ""Hmm, how about buring some stuff and have a nice fire"" and open it. Just for the heck of it. I burn, because I burn. As the human is, because he is. There is no really deeper sense- wait! THERE IS!This video game makes you think about your whole lifestyle... You have these crazy characters...And KEEP THE COUPON UNTIL THE END!... and then this ending- well, I ain't spoiler. But if you become sick of the game just watch it on youtube- it is really worth it.Sounds and Graphics are neat as every item has his own animation and sound effects and it is just fun to see and hear it. The music is where you need them and characterizing the game, but not nerves you off when you want a nice fire. Everything nice done, Tomorrow Cooperation!Controls cannot be easier- click to burn. That's it. Just the Longness of the game is not sooo long (ca. 4-5 hours for ""plot""), but as it was in a Humble Bundle that is quite enjoyable. I mean- if you want more you get more! So...pretty nice, but not perfect.TL;DR: I think Little Inferno is a fun game to play, has middle-high points in all categories, be sure to check it out! Just test it and love it...or not...and think about the plot when you are done!			"

												Little Inferno is a quirky little game for the most casual of gamers. The game consists of the player receiving various catalogues of items that the player must then set fire to. While that in itself might seem redundant, there is actually a stategy to your pyromancy, where you need to figure out different combinations of items to burn to unlock various achievements. The fact that you are kept in front of a tiny fireplace during the game is kept fresh by the letters you receive, giving you small glimpses of the outside world. While the game is quite humorous, as you get closer to the end and the answers to why you are being made to burn these objects, the game starts to take a bit of a darker turn. All in all, the game is quite a joy to play, and anyone who likes a puzzler as much as I do, is in for a treat.			"

												I got this game thru a bundled deal on another game site. The good stuff graphics are nice and look good. Sound again is great. Who doesnt like a good fire? Younger kids can play this. The negatives are its short and can get some what boring after a few hours. The story is kind of so-so. The game is over once you have played it thru once. The ""ending"" is kind of a let down. I think if you can get this cheaper then the $10 asking price its not bad. However priced at $10 its a little high for what it offers. I do recommend this if you can get it cheap. My score would be a 7/10 if on sale. Not on sale would be a 5/10.			"

												This plays like a flash game and the story is OK. You can burn things but it gets old quick. It took me three hours to get through the whole thing but I wouldn't spend my time doing that again.  The game is timed too so I don't think I could have done it much faster.I think there are better short game alternatives. I don't recommend the game because I think there are better options not because the game is terrible. It's more like a fire making simulator.			"

												The Good:A cute and charming story The Bad:The gameplay is just too basic to give this game a good recommendation. You simply choose items from a list and then you burn it....thats it....thats the game. You can also combine certain items together to get postage stamps so that you can order items faster. I guess if you are looking for a more relaxing game this could be the game for you, but their is better stuff out there.  "

												This was a great little indie game. If you're a huge pyromaniac (like me) you'll love it. The fire physics are great and there are so many things to burn! And underneath that shallow game mechanic is a very deep, ironic metaphor that the game slowly unfolds to you. This game offers a cheerful, creepy, and entertaining experience that really makes you think about your life. 8/10			"

												This game just makes me smile. It's witty and highly addictive. I love the dual aspect of storyline and having to find combinations of items to progress further - complete with some terrible jokes. Also just sitting there and watching items burn safely on screen is a little pleasure. Even very replayable. A quirky gem!			"

												This game. Easily one of the most neat and unique indie games I've ever played as well as the most destructive, twisted, and fun. I've never imagined myself admiring a robot and its cat and then suddenly the sun falls down with a mortar strike and destroys everything. Its cartoony yet dark art style incredible and the ending (which was sadly 4 hours in) left me astonished and loving the game five times more.Just buy the game if you love messing around, laughing at the games silliness, or just burning♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

 TL;DR: ♥♥♥♥ING BUY THIS GAME!!!! 5th favorite game of all time, Great Mechanics, Beautiful art design, One of the best soundtracks I have ever heard in a game, and all made by 3 guys. I love this game and you should buy it.It has a very warm, safety feeling that you get from sitting next to a fireplace, while having a dark undertone that constantly tugs at you as you burn things. I had alot of fun with this game and you can take that for what it's worth. I don't want to spoil much about the game and everything in this review is publically available in the trailers.			"

												This is a great indie game made by the people who brought you World of Goo, it is a game based almost exclusively in front of a fireplace.You sit in front of a fireplace and collect coins to buy stuff that you can burn, in the shop, which you burn to get more coins, etc.As you burn your way through there is storyline progression from an interesting and bleak world.You may also progress through cryptic achievements throughout the game.This game is simple and intriguing, it hasn't got too much wrong with it apart from lack of replayability and the quietness of the game (although intestinal to add to bleak atmosphere) and it also hasn't got the most exiting gameplay.9/15 ""Burn things"" "

												Little Inferno is a physics sandbox.  The user chooses objects, puts them into the box, moves them around, and burns them.  Each object is some kind of very dark joke, from the food items who sprout faces and scream when burned, to the highly explosive bottle of wine labeled ""Midlife Crisis Mitigator"" to the a cat stuffed toy who explosively launches turds on ignition.  The flames and explosions are beautifully rendered and physically simulated.There is a vaguely steampunk post-apocalyptic aesthetic (think Delicatessen), seamlessly blended into a critique on the state of modern casual games.  One spoiler: despite the armchair philosophy remeniscent of Fight Club, their is no twist.  But it mind♥♥♥♥s you regardless, all while being very coherent.Also, could someone tell me what happens if you don't burn the coupon for one free hug which you get towards the beginning?			"

												Interesting, but I found myself grinding for achievments. And then I realized the whole game is about grinding for achievement. You throw stuff into the fire. There are some combinations of things which will get you ""bonus"" achievements by burning them at the same time. Explosions are sometimes enjoyable. Doesn't take too long to go through the whole line up of items to burn.If you can stand to play cookie clicker for more than 10 hours, you'll love this game—but I don't recommend it to anyone looking for a puzzle game. Meh.			"

												Only on a sale. But at the same time extremely gratifying to burn catalogs of items and see how they interact as they burn, its like a boy scouts guide to being a pyro. but still not a complete game in the sense to pay full price for it. no way to loose, the story to me is pretty flat, and it basically comes down to just waiting for stuff to arrive in the mail so that you can burn it get money and then buy more stuff. But the FX are really good for the fire, and there are so many scripted items that the game is really enjoyable, I think its better suited for a tablet than playing on a desktop, but I got both in a bundle so I'm happy.

												Little Inferno is a game about exactly that, a little inferno. Inside that inferno you burn things. Those things you must buy, but no worries, you get more money out of them than you pay for 'em. Rather odd, I know. So anyways, you buy those things from a catalog and burn them brutally (not really) and then repeat the same steps. But there are also combos that you must find in order to unlock the next catalog. They make the game a lot more interesting as you only have the name of the combo which is basically the only hint you get. The combos reward you with stamps that you use to get the stuff delivered to you faster if you are impatient.The gameplay itself is rather fun due to the a bit humorous descriptions of the items on the catalogs and due to the items themselves (and of course due to fire). Sometimes they're something simple, like a spoon or a brick, but sometimes they're something very very special, like a credit card or a TV! Awesome, I know. And they actually are a lot more interesting. They aren't the only not-that-ordinary items, there are plenty of them to keep the game interesting, and it does it successfully.Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												Don't let the Pyro find out about this.Other than that a good game that actually has a strange yet interesting story with a style that I would describe as a combination of Tim Burton and a tea spoon of Salad Fingers (christ that creeps me) and the game is a great time waster to muck about.7/10 Little Inferno is an interesting concept with good design and style.

												The concept of burning things in a fireplace is so simple, yet, in a simplistic but incredibly deep way, there's so much more to the game. The story is open to interpretation and the game ends up feeling like a metaphor. It’s short but great fun while it lasts, it keeps you going, wondering what you’ll discover next. The soundtrack is amazing, the kind whose simplicity but pure emotional tone can reach your soul. Perhaps emotional would be the best way to describe my experience with this game. I highly suggest trying this game, it’s well worth the price.			"

 TL;DR: ♥♥♥♥ING BUY THIS GAME!!!! 5th favorite game of all time, Great Mechanics, Beautiful art design, One of the best soundtracks I have ever heard in a game, and all made by 3 guys. I love this game and you should buy it.It has a very warm, safety feeling that you get from sitting next to a fireplace, while having a dark undertone that constantly tugs at you as you burn things. I had alot of fun with this game and you can take that for what it's worth. I don't want to spoil much about the game and everything in this review is publically available in the trailers.			"

												This game. Easily one of the most neat and unique indie games I've ever played as well as the most destructive, twisted, and fun. I've never imagined myself admiring a robot and its cat and then suddenly the sun falls down with a mortar strike and destroys everything. Its cartoony yet dark art style incredible and the ending (which was sadly 4 hours in) left me astonished and loving the game five times more.Just buy the game if you love messing around, laughing at the games silliness, or just burning♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												The concept of burning things in a fireplace is so simple, yet, in a simplistic but incredibly deep way, there's so much more to the game. The story is open to interpretation and the game ends up feeling like a metaphor. It’s short but great fun while it lasts, it keeps you going, wondering what you’ll discover next. The soundtrack is amazing, the kind whose simplicity but pure emotional tone can reach your soul. Perhaps emotional would be the best way to describe my experience with this game. I highly suggest trying this game, it’s well worth the price.			"

												This is a great indie game made by the people who brought you World of Goo, it is a game based almost exclusively in front of a fireplace.You sit in front of a fireplace and collect coins to buy stuff that you can burn, in the shop, which you burn to get more coins, etc.As you burn your way through there is storyline progression from an interesting and bleak world.You may also progress through cryptic achievements throughout the game.This game is simple and intriguing, it hasn't got too much wrong with it apart from lack of replayability and the quietness of the game (although intestinal to add to bleak atmosphere) and it also hasn't got the most exiting gameplay.9/15 ""Burn things"" "

												I had some doubts on this one, but knowing the guys at World of Goo bade it gave me a tad more confidence.  Its actually ANOTHER wildly entertaining product from them.  The humor is subtle but rich. Every game has a TOS agreement right? Well in their rich humor, you get to burn that first. Its actually a cool little strategy game of burning things in order to burn much better things. Flicking the old charred bits had its fun throughout. When a spider wandered through I burned it as well.  This darn title  is oddly oddly entertaining in a dark non violent way. :D  It has some cool dark humor. A must buy for a pretty darn creative indie title. Lately its been very hit and miss with indie titles. This one seems to be a home run.			"

												This is the perfect casual sandbox game. While there is something inherently wrong with having so much enjoyment from burning random items (which includes a bus full of students, a toaster with screaming breads, and a whole factory with workers running to escape- don't worry guys, everything is stylised, there's no real gore if you can't tell yet from the trailer) I can't deny that this game brings me satisfaction.What's the game about?You order an item from catalogues, they arrive, you burn them. That's itFun?YesAny point to it?No, but it is fun, and that's what a game supposed to do... plus it warms my heart... figuratively speaking of courseRecommendation?Buy itThe GoodsBeautiful, great music, simple, very casualThe BadsI wish there's extra content/new update.

												From the team that brought us World of Goo (One of my all time favourite indie games) comes Little Inferno.GameplayA simple drag and drop system where you buy new items from a catalog to successful complete combos and earn more money. It’s a nice little loop. It has a similar art style to that of World of Goo and features some really fun little animations that are tailors to the different items you can use.Top Tip #001Make sure to burn at least one of each item in the catalog. We’ve been doing this as we unlock another one because it makes it easier in the long run plus you get to see all the little fun animations as different things burn up. The second reason for doing this is you’ll find out which items like to explode on their own and which need a little extra to get them started.Upgrades and ProgressionThere are various ways in this game to progress and upgrade. One of the many ways is using the money you’ve earned in the form of buying new catalogs and extra spaces in your mailbox. The game keeps you aiming for it’s tasks so you’ll have to keep on top of all them combos too if you wanna keep unlocking new stuff.Top Tip #002Running low on money after making some bad combos? Track down them pesky spiders as they give you 3 corns and after collecting a couple of them you’ll be back to no good burning things again.Speed UpUsing the ‘Tomorrow Stamps’ you can speed up your purchases but we wouldn’t advise this certainly in the early stages of the game because it’s got a good progression speed that keeps in fun and entertaining even whilst you wait for your extra items. We were able to complete the game without using any of these at all so if you are willing to put in the time then try and match us on that.Top Tip #003The max money you can hold is 999 and the max ‘Tomorrow Stamps’ you can hold is 99, any more you collect after that won’t count so if your coming close why not take a minute from completing objectives and just burn some of your favourite in-game items.Mail TasksAs well as completing combos you also have to buy items for the odd little people that like to send you letters.Our favourite in-game itemsWe didn’t want to spoil the game too much so we’ve picked our favourites from the early sets of items you get, but later on there are some really entertaining onesMini Nuke – This sure packs a punch with a huge explosion.Mini Moon – This item has its own gravity similar to the moon and allows you to float all your items in mid airPublished Blog Post[www.dabs.com] "

												Little Inferno is certainly a unique game. From beginning to end, you only have two interactive screens - the fireplace and the shopping catalog, as well as two actions - placing newly purchased things in the fireplace and burning them.Unfortunately, the latter somewhat limits the former, as, if you hoped for an interesting sandbox where you watch elaborate structures collapse and crumble, Little Inferno is not it: too much time is spent waiting for things to arrive, restocking, collecting money for the next purchase, not enough things that can qualify as building blocks in the first place, and the physics are somewhat cartoonish. Rather, the sandbox part of the game is reduced to placing items one by one in the fireplace and watching them burn. Or freeze. Or other neat stuff like that. Unfortunately, a huge number of avaliable items qualify simply as fuel, and novelty wears off somewhat quickly, too quickly to qualify as cathartic.Really, the actual game is a puzzle rather than a sandbox: you are offered a list of 99 combos of two or three items that can be burned together. There's usually no interesting gameplay interaction between these two or three specific items, which is rather disappointing, instead these items are related to each other by a provided clue (for example, the LOLcat combo consists of a cat plushie and a camera). Some of the clues are obvious and some are downright cryptic. You know inventory puzzles in point and click adventures? You, the heroic kleptomaniac, accumulate a number of random items and use one on another? Little Inferno is this as an entire game, except you have to wait before items arrive or use coupons for instant shipping that are in limited supply, and sometimes the items are annoying to combo burn properly.There's also a story unlocked as you progress through the game through a series of letters, it is, much like the actual game, kinda unique but nothing to write home about.I have acquired this game in a bundle and beaten it in about two hours, but for the price avaliable in the shop, or even at a standard discount, I cannot recommend this game to be purchased by anyone.5/10 "

												How on earth can a creative little toy such as Little Inferno be so linear? While ""playing"" this game you feel like you are just burning things to unlock the rest of the things so that you can throw away this monstrosity, because Little Inferno is awful. It could have actually done rather well if the unlocking system was sorted out, but since there are so many restrictions on what you can burn and when you can burn them, it’s a losing battle trying to have fun with the toy. You start the game with a catalogue and only the first few objects are available for purchase. You get coins from burnt objects and every object coughs up more money than it was bought for. After you burn these items to a crisp, you go back to the catalogue and buy the next few items. Another problem the game has is that the objects that you buy from the catalogue don’t appear on your shelf immediately. Instead you have to wait for the objects to ship to your house, like freakin’ Amazon. If you really can’t wait, you can use a stamp (which is basically a rarer version of a coin) to knock 30 seconds off the delivery time. That’s right you can get a faster delivery. Like freakin’ Amazon. What makes matters worse is that there are seven catalogues and each one has items with longer and longer wait times for delivery until the last item which takes an outrageous five minutes to arrive.The only actual gameplay involved is making combos, which is where you are given a clue, then have to work out which two objects to burn together to complete the challenge. The only problem is, the clues are unbelievably obvious, for example “Bike-Pirate” is the clue for the combo involving the bicycle and the pirate. What fun.The developers even added a storyline in the form of very burnable letters from people you never actually meet. Almost every single one has the phrase “This can’t last forever” in some shape or form, and this could be like a side-plot except I don’t care in the slightest. I was put in mind of FarmVille and all those other Facebook games that spanned out their gameplay by having users spending most of the time waiting. I can only assume that these games were the developers’ only points of reference when designing. I know I’m probably being a little harsh since it’s only an indie game made by a tiny team of people, but if we can produce something as illuminating as Bastion, there is no need for Little Inferno hiding in a mass of smoke, getting in people’s eyes and making them water.

												Since the creators of World of Goo were involved in making of this game, my interest was piqued. Little Inferno is not a puzzle game, though. It's hardly even a game at all; just a sandbox physics simulation that really doesn't do much for me. I endured until the end based on the merits of World of Goo alone, and while the ending does redeem the experience a bit, it still doesn't make it a good game.			"

												Meh, I have mixed feelings about this game. For one thing, the art style is very nice and fun to look at, and the general story in the game is very well-thoughout and I like it a lot. However, the game just seems boring. 95% of the game is clicking something, dragging it, or holding mouse1 on it. And that gets REALLY boring REALLY fast. Sure, some of the items do interesting things, but they are not memorable and become stale the second time you see it. Also, we have combinations you can make to get achievments, but those are all pretty easy to figure out, even without the guide. So is Little Inferno a good game to buy? No, not in my opinion. However, you might want to get it if it is on sale, as you can have about 4 hours of fun with it.			"

												This is an anti-game meant as a commentary on the pointlessness of repeating menial tasks for no reason other than a superficial sense of gradual accomplishment. Pretty avant-garde for the creator of World of Goo, one of my all-time favorite games. Unless that kind of oblique artsiness appeals to you, I wouldn't recommend this as an actual game to play.			"

												Gameplay 1/10:No failure states, no success states, the gameplay is just the vessel upon which the player's boredom rides to reach the auteurs' conclusion.Plot 3/10:Told through letters, and some exposition in the end, it's essentially irrelevant to the experience. One could argue that there are two stories being told: the story of the main character, told via traditional means, and the story of the player, told by the timers on the boxes as they're being stared at by pairs of eyes round the world, eager to discover the next nothing. Finally, there's no closure given, instead the player returns to the start screen, able to pick up from where they left.Character 5/10:Ms. Plumps is a classic example of a hamartanousa heroine, who, after being punished, distances herself from the tragic hero, who keeps committing the same crime till the ultimate hubris that will set him free, as it did her. However, none of the characters seems to have any more depth than their cardboard representations: Plumps is the ditz the PC should strive to follow, PC is a blank slate, Weather Man is stuck in his balloon, and Nancy is just someone with a plan that came to fruition regardless of any actions or omission by any other character.Thought 2/10:Only there as background noise, seeing as all the characters are single-minded pyromaniacs.Diction 5/10:It's what could have saved this game alone, if it was given a little more love. The message is simple, yet powerful. Any gamer has probably felt it (more so any critic/reviewer), however a simple mention of a deep thought is not the same as exploration of the same. In the end it felt like a cheap cop-out.Melody 6/10:The music has the decency to not overburden us with its presence.Spectacle 7/10:It manages to be pretty throughout; be it through sleek flammable objects, or haunting character design later on.Final verdict:Recommended only if you are willing to suffer mild boredom so that you can appreciate its half-baked message.

												This game should be used by anglers worldwide, because it's the biggest and most powerful bait I've ever seen.Basically, you're some jackass that sets fire to things because that's all you can do. There are combos to complete, but all this lets you do is hurry the game up, because a lot of the game is just spend waiting.Throughout it, you get letters that tell you all kinds of stuff and that hint at some sort of dark truth which is never really explained. Instead, you get the ""too deep for you"" ""open to interpretation"" ending, which probably earned this game IGN and Kotaku's 10/10 ratings.Don't buy this game.Don't pirate this game.Don't obtain this game through any means. It is the most inconsequential waste of time I've ever experienced, and I'd love to save you that experience.			"

												Little Inferno's actual gameplay leaves a lot to be desired, which is why it isn't a game most players will be returning to. With its short completion time, the game itself serves as a vehicle for its overarching message. Unfortunately, the game relies too heavily on its one-note atmosphere and handles its theme in a heavy-handy manner that ultimately insults its player--both literally and intellectually. The 'point' is hammered so obnoxiously and self-righteously, that the masochism that is playing Little Inferno attributes any negativity towards the game as being a part of its design.

												Wow, this game is horrible. World of Goo was incredible, so i decided to try some more by the same guy, but this was just a waste of money. It's got good reviews... idk, maybe there was some artsy element that I missed, but I was just but I was just bored. So you start off with a tiny stash of cash and a small collection of toys you can order. You order stuff and it appears after a delay, and then you toss it in the fireplace and burn it, which always gives you a few more coins than you spent. Symbolism for the insatiability hunger of human consumerism maybe? Idk, but it got old in a hurry. Most of the toys react in some novel way as you burn them... the dragon breaths fire, the ear of corn has popcorn pop off of it, the moon changes gravity so things orbit it. I imagine you could make some tiny rube-golberg machines if you were so inclined, but the space is so limited that it's pretty limited so I didn't have much success. Also there are hidden combos of items. If you burn certain items together, you've completed the combo. Once you've got enough, you unlock new toys to burn. So a big part of the game is looking at the titles of combos and trying to guess which toys are required, which is easy when you've only got access to a dozen items, but once it's closer to 100 it starts to take some trial and error. A message about sitting in the same place, looking at the same thing, and still searching for novelty? Might be a meta commentary about spending too much time on a computer looking for interesting games, but that might be something I'm superimposing on the subject. There's a thin plot about a relation with the girl next door. You get letters, and exchange toys with her. She's fascinated by a mystery of the inferno. And the environment of the game, the whispers of the world outside the inferno are quite haunting. But, that was the only interesting part of the game that I could see, but there wasn't much of it. Anyway, eventually you hit on a mystic combination of items and burn the house down, and then you've got to find something else to do. The end. I usually enjoy artsy games and games with social commentary. World of Goo kept surprising me with understanded but poignant imagery. Little inferno though? No so much. I unlocked all the items and completed the endgame, in about 3 hour, which was much shorter than I like to see a $10 game take. Maybe there was symbolism I missed, but this was just a waste of time and money as far as I could see.			"

Some of the combos don't really make much sense and the ending is a letdown. I'd recommend this game if it were a free web-based timekiller one could screw around with when the boss wasn't looking. However, I can't recommend paying money for it.			"

												Ok, i really don't get all the praises this game get.You're burning stuff in the fireplace...some find it relaxing, i just find it boring. I like playing with fire, but i don't get that vibe out of Little Inferno, since it's mostly about waiting for new items to arrive, then they burn in a few seconds. Yet, I would write that down as personal preferences, and move on.But after that, it keeps getting worse. The wait timer become higher and higher, the money you need keep getting higher. So there is even less burning and a lot more waiting than before. Even at the end of the games, you will not get to do that much of a fire because ""express delivery coupons"" are so damn rare.I at least expected some kind of payoff when you ""finished"" the game, something that would raise it past the boring waiting mechanic...Well there is an ending...and it was almost as boring as the rest. Big disappointment. I wouldn't even recommend it on sale, whatever the price, it's not worth it.			"

												**I LIKE THIS GAME, BUT THERE ARE GLARING ISSUES THAT SHOULDN'T BE IN A PC GAME THAT COSTS MONEY**It's Little Inferno just for me. Now, the question comes in here: Is it really for me?I'll making this review into a quickie. LI is a fireplace simulator about consumerism and a very overused global issue that you'll find out about later in the game.The visuals are truly beautiful, the atmosphere is slightly claustrophobic, but in a good way, like the feeling of cuddling up under a thick blanket in a cold night in just the right way.The story is passable and most people won't really care about the ""companion"" or the other characters there. The writing is annoying if anything to be honest.Now, the products that you burn will have an interesting way of burning up at least 50% of the time. But here comes the real issue. You can order a limited amount of items, you have a limited sized wallet and you have to wait until you can buy the item again and the times can span up to 30 minutes, which is insane. There are skip tickets, but even then, it's ridiculous. Do I recommend this game? Sure, but make sure that it's heavily discounted or in a bundle. For a full price you'll be disappointed in it.			"

												This is a favourite of my 8 year old nephew. On a basic level you simply burn stuff, then once you get past that novelty you can start completing levels by burning the right items together to make 'combos'. There is a storyline with it and having read other reviews I see there's a big ending. Unfortunately I don't have the patience to reach the end, it's fun for a while but becomes ""meh"" unless you have a fascination with fire. Maybe my nephew will tell me all about it one day.A very polished, quality game with great graphics but perhaps not aimed at adults.			"

												This does not mean I did not enjoy the game- I greatly enjoyed it. But I cannot recommend this game to anyone I do not know: It is a very specific taste of game.This will not appeal to the average gamer. If you are looking for depth, you may enjoy it. If you are looking for a great gameplay experience, you likely won't. If you just want to burn everything, you'll love it. The gameplay is built around repetition and waiting, as a satire of AVGM and the pay-to-win formula used in Facebook games. But this means that the game is designed to be repetitive: Not a great trait in most games. And if you don't like waiting five minutes to burn a single thing, it'll cost you stamps, which are an in-game currency you slowly accumulate.The entire game takes place in front of a fireplace, with the exception of the end, which serves to teach a preachy lesson about wasted time. But there is more to it than that, if you're willing to look into it. The depth is a decent hook for game analysts, and the meaning of the ending is vague enough to be interpreted as a good number of things, all positive and optimistic. Most people won't look into this, though, and I don't blame them.The atmosphere is just as fantastic and eerie as World of Goo was (Same creator), with that silver lining lingering in the distance. The dialogue is kooky and fun, yet reveals a dark and sinister motive. But I expect most gamers' reactions to this would be ""so what?"" Atmosphere does not make the game. It cannot serve as the initial hook, and only becomes tangible when the player is immersed.So no, I don't recommend it. It has fantastic atmosphere. It has a dark theme. It has a sweet-but-simple ending. It has great idle gameplay. But you would need to be an ""artistic"" gamer to acknowledge most of this. If you don't look for atmosphere in games, you won't care about it in this one. If you play games to play games, this falls short of the criteria.However, my negative rating of this will likely draw people that are honestly researching into if they should get this game. And, as you read through my review, you may notice that I am not describing you. You may think ""I'm not an average gamer. These assumptions don't apply to me.""

												Finished it in a bit over 3 hours, and it just didn't grab me.  The gameplay feels like it's deliberately wasting your time in parts (having to wait over a minute to get some items, for no reason at all), the story was cute but sparse, and there's no challenge.That said, it's fun burning things in the fireplace for a while - just don't expect to come away feeling like it was time well spent.  Don't pay full price ($15 at time of writing), take a look for $5.  But even then, I wouldn't put it high on the list of must-plays.Instead of this, look at Thomas Was Alone.  That's amazing.			"

												Little Inferno is basically a fire simulator. You set things on fire and they react in cool and funny ways. Seeing how each item would react to fire and how they would interact with each other is really fun, but the game has one major problem. Delivery times. Now I know that the required wait times are there as a sort of satirical comment leading to the game's ultimate purpose, but honestly it takes the fun out of the game. It just seems like it was put there to prolong the game because the developer's were worried about the amount of content. I think even if they kept the timing system there should be a way to reduce the time like if gold items actually had no shipping time instead of just no cooldown. Its annoying to have to wait 2 minutes everytime you want to get an item. Exploring each catalouge and seeing the interactions is really fun, but the need to wait for every item really makes me wonder if it is worth it.			"

												Martin L.Little inferno to me was a real quick game that don’t take much effort to win. This game I found to be really bad as in I like to play challenging games and this was the opposite of that. The gameplay was really bad and I wouldn’t recommend it for the everyday gamer who wants to play good games. The graphics were good but it all went bad when you hit the end of the game. I regret choosing this game as it was simply just a burning game. No spoilers here as what happens at the end but it is most obvious. It don’t take much time to know what will happen. Its common sense and you got any of that then this game is not for you. I don’t recommend it to anyone and if you want to buy it, I simply recommend asking me as I will give you my account for free so you can play it and know what I am going through.Score: 1/10  "

												Playing with real fires is way more fun.I only played 88 minutes. Won't finish game.  You burn things in combinations.  Does look cool visually, but I only kept going because I was thinking maybe there's more to it - as if the burning stuff was an intro game and the real game would start soon.  But apparently not much else happens. A big part of game seems to be to figure out what items to burn together to complete a checklist.  I greatly enjoyed the developer's previous game World of Goo, and that's the reason I tried this.  But it's just dull and pointless   I gather from other reviews (and did get the same sense while playing) that there's cultural commentary about burning things to make money to buy more things to burn, all the while spewing pollution up the chimney.  I get it.  But not very fun game.			"

												The premise of just throwing stuff into a fireplace to light it on fire doesn't really sound like a great game.  Throw in a few puzzles and now you've got something, but still not quite something great.  The sole point of this game is too find combinations of two or three items that fit a description on the list of combos.  For example, the Bike Pirate combo obviously needs you to burn the Bike and the Pirate, but others are not quite so easy.This is basically the game of Doodle God, but instead of unlocking new elements, you're just unlocking new junk to burn.  The game is moderately enjoyable at first, but the combo-finding rapidly loses its interest.  You also need to burn the same items over and over again just to grind and unlock the next catalogue of items, which further adds to the lack of enjoyment. The included dialogue with your neighbor does add a little bit of flare to the game, but not enough to make the game worthwhile.  There are far more games that you could be playing instead, so I wouldn't recommend wasting your time with this (unless you absolutely loved Doodle God).			"

												Gameplay is extremely dull and repetitive, plus it has this ""waiting time"" added that makes the game even slower when purchasing expensive things. And there's basically no reward in finding all the combos other than stamps to accelerate the very own waiting time the game has. Plus some of the combinations are plain odd.While the game is not bad, I don't recommend it because it's a repetitive, dull game. It does have nice visuals and okay music though.			"

It's one redeeming feature is the rather depressing yet somehow cute storyline. I use ""storyline"" very loosely as there's not much to it.

This game doesnt have a goal that you need to achieve all you do is burn stuff you buy from a catalog, The concept is so simple it works perfectly for this game. It also haves a lot of humor that works and sometimes is Laugh out loud funny.The game has a story thats told throught some creppy but funny letters and it develops perfectly till the end.The burning mechanic is amazing and its amusing to watch all the stuff you burn turn to ashes and sometimes explode. This game has a puzzle system called combos. Combos are a mix of stuff you burn together to get stars and it works perfectly. This game is really fun and should be checkd out by everyone i give it a 8/10			"

												little inferno is an experience that as a kid i was obsessed with. after seeing many of the older day popular youtube channels play it and finding a pirated copy myself i begin to very much enjoy the game.Little inferno delivers a fun enviroment with some rather simple mechanics to any pyro maniacs and arsonists to be by giving you a rather simplistic story and a neverending supply of burnable materials via the catelog, it promotes creativity in the fire place by mixing and matching different flamable objects and has a colourful cast of characters that entertain along your journey through the Little Inferno Entertainment Fire Place.the game opens with you burning the instructions and saftey manual.i can fully recomend this game to anyone who is a fan of original ideas. fun mechanics. and indie games in general. the miniscule price tag makes it a rather fun game and it can get extremely addicting.

												It's not much of a game - more like an interactive toy - but burning stuff is always fun, and Little Inferno just executes it flawlessly. It only takes little over three hours to complete, lacks achievements and given how little there is to do I just can't recommend it on full $9.99 price. Even current sale price of -50% ($4.99) is bit stretching it, but under that it's a nice piece and nicely makes you spend one short evening.			"

												Incredibly. Disappointing. I did NOT finish the game, nor will I ever bother with it again. Do NOT waste your money (although apparently that is the stupid, ironic point of the game?).I really do not understand people in today's society who swarm over things with cheeky, hidden messages, as if they are some sort of saving grace for something that is terrible. You know, create some horribly bad game or TV show, but if it has a ""fancy"" meaning between-the-lines, then it is suddenly the best thing ever.This game is not a game. I played it first and foremost because the photos and videos looked like it would be a funny little way to spend some time, mixing the toys and things together to do silly things, like the moon's gravity, or trying to buy enough blocks to make a little castle and then burn it down or drop something on it.And it was enjoyable in that way for a little while. But once the game started drastically delaying all of the toys when you bought them, I became very bored and annoyed very quickly. Taking away some time for me sitting with the game idle and chatting with a friend, I probably played the game less than 90 minutes. Apparently the average players go to like 5 hours to finish the game, because they have to finish burning items in these combos and so on?And once they finish the game, as I looked into it after I shut it off and decided not to go further, they're basically given a message (although I could see parts of it showing up already, after-the-fact) that they are wasting their time doing some stupid repetitive mess like playing iOS/Android games that are just collecting some dumb items and making coins.Okay... Except 1) This isn't really that game market; and 2) I realized the game was stupid, so I didn't even get near that point nor does it apply. So basically I wasted money on a game that looked really silly and fun, but only was fun for less than an hour. Everyone somewhat raves about the game, which made me feel safer in making the purchase, and often I'm skeptical about user judgment... and would have been right to be so here.People praise this game saying that it breaks out of its mold and is great with its message of ""dreams"" and ""living life."" Some people even compare it to games like Spec Ops (saying how Spec Ops is a dark and anti-fun shooting game). Now, I loved Spec Ops (I played it on Xbox first) and agree it's dark and has a great story, but I don't understand people claiming this game to fit with that. This game is nowhere near the same thing. Spec Ops has a general message about life and war, and so does many books, movies, documentaries, etc. It's not exactly a ""new"" message. If people think it is, that is mostly because they're young and simply don't understand life or the repercussions of things like war. Blowing people up in games is fun if you disconnect your mind from it, and it is easier in something like Halo. But in ""real"" war scenarios, it is harder.Anyway, I am off-track talking about Spec Ops somewhat, but the point is that this game is just a waste to take your money, but not in the same way as those dumb mobile games. There really isn't a saving grace here to be found. There is no good ""message"" or point.			"

												Just awful. Since the game description doesn't tell you anything useful, here's what the game is really about:You're given a list of achievement names, and the object of the game is to guess which combination of 2 or three objects you can select to get the achievement. This is extremely easy since the achievement names are usually a pun based on the object names. The whole deal with the fireplace and burning stuff is just a gimmicky way of doing multi-select. There is a completely pointless timer that you need to wait for between selecting each set of objects and essentially nothing to do while you wait for the timer, in the stupidest possible effort to pad out gameplay.If this game sounds original and different, it is. There's a very good reason why nobody's ever made a game like this before: it doesn't work on any level.			"

												Boring. Didn't even want to buy it, but Friend said i need to try it and it was on sale.Don't get me wrong, i didn't want it because i kinda knew that it will wear off fast and just drag on for hour with me searching the fun that i payed for.if your young and want to play with fire or have some serious problem with your mind and it helps preventing you from incinerate the next house that game is for you, but for ever one else it will wear of fast and wast time after that.

												Congratulations on your new Little Inferno Entertainment Fireplace! Throw your toys into your fire, and play with them as they burn. Stay warm in there. It's getting cold outside!Burn flaming logs, screaming robots, credit cards, batteries, exploding fish, unstable nuclear devices, and tiny galaxies. An adventure that takes place almost entirely in front of a fireplace - about looking up up up out of the chimney, and the cold world just on the other side of the wall.			"

												It's not really a game as much as it is an interactive toy. Grab stuff, throw it in the fire, get money to buy more stuff to throw on the fire. It's all pointless. Give it to a pre-school child you want to be a really bad influence on and turn them into a pyromaniac.			"

												I went into the game without knowing what it is, had it from some previous steam sale, in a nutshell this game is the burning simulator.You will burn stuff then collect coins that dropped and buy items from store with those to burn......thats it.If you like to watching burning stuff in a video game with a twisted presentation this game is for you if you're not that stuff like me just skip this			"

Gameplay is pretty simple and you'll appreciate it more if you're not going to cheat your way to the game.

												Little Inferno is a great casual game with just enough goal-oriented tasks to keep you playing through to obtain every achievement.Gameplay is simple enough for very young children to understand (my 3-year-old loves it) yet has enough built-in challenges that it kept me interested until the very end. Buying items from catalogs to gloriously burn in a home fireplace seems rather arbitrary, and it is, but it is also surprisingly entertaining. The story seems a little forced at times, with some rather odd elements throughout, but the payoff is rather interesting, as the game suddenly takes on a completely different feel, morphing seemlessly from one genre to another to see the game's conclusion.Bottom line: If you've ever felt the urge to set fire to everything in sight, Little Inferno will provide you with hours of digital pyro-tainment (which means that you won't get burned, or incarcerated, while indulging your pyromaniac tendencies).

												I love to burn♥♥♥♥♥♥ and so does everyone else in the house. Hence almost 20 hours of play time on this one. Get it, you won't suffer any remourse for doing so. I thought replayability would be low, but have found that to be wrong, mostly because it is a great time waster for those times when you don't have enough to get in to something else more involved.

												Not a long game. Have to say I enjoyed storyline and gameplay very much. You are basicaly just burning stuff. It doesnt matter how boring that sounds, Its not. By burning different objects together, you make combos and progress through game. Storyline is interresting, original and exciting. Due to short gameplay, I wouldnt recommand buying for full price. When on sale, it will make you happy for few hours.			"

												Little Inferno is an outstanding work of interactive art. Initially, I thought it was a typical casual game: a few basic functions and some other components revolving around it, with little else than those functions as assets to the game. However, this game crushed my expectations. The basic functions (i.e. purchasing, receiving, and burning an assortment of items) were exactly as expected, from how it progressed to what you could get (though many items produced cool effects), but Little Inferno expanded far beyond the basic functions. The narration of the game--something I didn't believe existed--is mostly played through the main character's correspondence with another character by letter. It could've been a regular ""entertain the player"" scheme by making a fun little story, but as the game progresses the story proves to have a philosophical theme that exists in a larger world than just the fireplace. Accompanied with beautiful music, strongly cohesive design, and a though-provoking narrative, Little Inferno astounds the gamer who expects merely a little amusement from it.			"

												From the makers of World of Goo comes Little Inferno.This game is strange, but that goes without saying, you buy items to burn in your fireplace, which give you more coins than you purchased them for to buy more items to burn. If the game had left it there I would have said don't bother with it but... there are combinations of things to burn. Like burning the Old lady and the kitty poo poo doll gives you the 'Cat Lady' combination. This gives you a stamp which, one you collect enough, allows you to buy another catalohue.Meanwhile while your burning things to yur hearts content theres a little plot going on through letters sent to you by your neighbour. I won't spoil anything but I didn't see it coming. Well the first bit I did, but not the second part.So yeah I recommend this, but only if its in a sale for maybe £3 or so., Its only a short game, you should be able to find most combinations in a very short time, and has little replay value since once you've burned everything and reached the end theres nothing much to do other than burn the same stuff again in a new game.

												Little Inferno is a hilarious game.So your parents are encouraging you to BURN all your toys in the fire place! You know, any parents would let their kid do that now a days, wouldn't they?If you have never seen a lets play/walk through/anything like that, I will tell you a little about it.You have to buy things from a catalog and make combos with the objects you buy. You can also do your own things and make funny combos(not even in the game) like using the dry ice to freeze stuff.You will not get any combo score for it, but you will get money for burning it/breaking it anyways!This game is hilarious, I could go on, but that is the basics of it.-I shot a piece of toast out of the toaster, froze it with dry ice, and made it my forever happy toast...

												I played this on a cold winter evening and it was an awesome experience. I really recomend playing it like this (on a cold/rainy evening/night, I mean) because, duh! It's a game about making fire and watching things burn! It's so creative, relaxing and heartwarming even though the idea of the game might seem dumb but in fact, it has an amazing story behind it.It might be a little expensive for just an evening of gameplay. But it's perfect if you are looking for a totally unique game.			"

												Little Inferno is an unusual game to describe and ‘throwing your toys into the fire and playing with them as they burn’ doesn’t immediately sound as if it would make for an exciting experience. But with its satirical gameplay, gorgeous physics, grin-worthy humour, and positive message about not wasting your time on pointless things, here’s a title that adds up to more than the sum of its parts.Of course, it won’t be for everyone as it could be considered too ‘weird’ or ‘simplistic’. But look among the flames and you may just find a little game that burns brightly.A full review of Little Inferno can be found here:http://1001up.com/2015/11/05/review-little-inferno/ "

												Little Inferno is a casual puzzle game which can be completed in a few hours. It's worth the short amount of time and attention it asks of you imo. If you're looking for a 200+ hr time sink at a cheap price ala most ""endless"" or replayable puzzle games which are more common nowadays, consider something else. Overall a decent game, but not for everyone.			"

												Ok, this game is a really odd one for me to recommend. It's a quirky puzzle game. You spend 95% of it buying items from a catalog and then buring said items in a furnace. While this may seem pointless at first glance it turns out that burning certain items along with certain other items at the same time will unlock ""combos"" which are basically the reason for the game. You are given a combo name and it's up to you to figure out what items are burnt to create that combo. The items all burn in different and often amusing/creepy ways. It's a bizarre little game with a disturbing theme and equally creepy story yet I found myself compelled to complete it. If you like trying to figure out combinations of items or just burning stuff (lol) then this game is for you!			"

												The pyro would love this game......Also, PHHT fire extinquisers are for wussiesAnyways Little inferno is more of a touchscreen game, so it feels like it should be on an Ipad.And dont let that fool you, this game does too have a story and MAN is it deep.its as simple as the trailer puts it,Burn all youre crap then buy more, that simple :)  .but HOLY SH!T is it fun!! Not only that but the game tends to trick you into thinking ""Well ill just wait a couple minutes for my new stuff to arrive"" but then NO you get a letter, then 2, then 3 and then so many that you end up TOSSING THEM INTO YOURE INFERNO OF A FIREPLACEBut to contrast, its full and you should get itThats_all_i_have_to_say			"

												I found the game to be fairly pretentious. Im not a pyromaniac so I did not enjoy the premise of burning random things together. Honestly didn't enjoy the game as a whole, but I kept thinking itd pay off with an interesting ending. It didnt and the game's ""moral"" was basically like an extended verison of nintendo's ""you should take a break now"" popups. The game's message would be more appropriate if the game was free.			"

												TL:DR Little Inferno is an indie game about burning catalog purchases to stay warm. Amusing burn animations, great indie graphics and subtle introspective social commentary critiquing the gaming industry and possibly world environment. Overall, good diversion, but sometimes painful delivery wait times. Suggested, but can benefit from DLC or updates.Now onto the full review, “Little Inferno” is an indie game available on PC, Mac, Android, IOS and probably your mom’s toaster. Created by Allan Blomquist, Kyle Gabler and Kyle Gray, presumably in their mom’s basement, advertises no outside funding or any other support in the creation of, “Little Inferno”.Marketed as 100% indie, DRM and IAP free, no form of copyright protection and spam and ad free, it currently goes for $10 dollars on the PC however, you can purchase it from Steam at $4.99 for the holidays.You enter the scene as a child, presumably abandoned by your parents for being a selfish git, and you’ve just received your, “Little Inferno Entertainment Fireplace”. Encouraged to keep warm by purchasing and burning items found in catalogs, you progress through the game by spending money and stamps earned from burned items on new catalogs and bigger and better items. The gameplay is simple, you have no score, no time limits and the only goal is to burn stuff you buy from catalogs and everything else that comes into your possession including letters, and coupons for free hugs.During your pyro sessions, you’ll receive letters from three other characters, you’re neighbor that you’ve never seen, the company owner of your entertainment fireplace and the weather balloon guy that constantly lets you know that the weather shows no signs of improving.As you burn items, you’ll receive money and stamps. The money is needed to buy items and new catalogs, and the stamps are used to speed up the delivery of your catalog purchases.In order to buy the new catalogs, you’ll need to gain a certain number of combos. Combos are combinations of 2 or more items burned together.The game is very well situated to take advantage of touch screens, which is no surprise since the developers of, “Little Inferno” also developed, “World of Goo”, and there’s even a combo that pays homage to that game.Each item burned has a unique burn animation, and it’s important to remember what these are since the combo hints may reference this and you’ll end up having to repeat multiple burns to figure out what the hint is referencing.This may not be a bad thing since many of the burn animations are amusing enough to revisit multiple times, like screaming marshmallows and pixelated green fire.While the game is amusing enough to play through, I can’t help but think there’s a bit deeper meaning to the overall gameplay…something that overshadows the simple minded amusement.It seems there’s a bit of social commentary embedded in the game as well and it seems to present a situation where the, “Little Inferno Entertainment Fireplace” can be equated to a gaming system like the PS4 or the Xbox. Ironically enough, the game appears to suggest that you step away from your system and explore the world.Through the progression of the game you’re in first person, fixated on the entertainment fireplace, and the only communication you have with anyone is through letters…which can be compared to text chat in MMO’s. You cannot turn away from the entertainment fireplace, and there is no mention of parents or siblings, adding to the self-imposed solitude of a gaming system.This notion is further enforced later in game through forced events and communication with other characters, and this game would not be the first game that encourages players to step away from the game and get out into the real world once in a while.I may be reading too much into this, but there seems to be additional commentary about the state of the world beyond the state of you as a gamer. You’re trapped in a world that is getting colder and being polluted from the smoke of your entertainment fireplace. Basically, the world’s environment is going to hell, and no one really cares as their too busy, “staying warm”. A letter from the weather balloon man enforces this idea.Both of these perceptions are strengthened by end game events which I won’t spoil for you and again, not sure if this was intended or not, but I’ll leave that conclusion up to you.The game, more than anything, a puzzle game, possibly a social commentary, and a relatively fun diversion from standard games that encourage e-peen waving. This is not, “Call of Duty”, or, “Assassin’s Creed”, nor does it intend to be. "

												As I started playing it I quickly recognized the art and music styles to be almost identical to that of World of Goo, making me wonder if it was in fact the same dev team. It of course is not World of Goo, there's a story here and it's something far darker and more disturbing. I've barely started this game and I'm terrified of proceeding, dreading what horrible tragedy lurks in the next letter. Mechanically, the game is simple enough (it seems like it was designed for touchscreens.) Set stuff on fire, collect coins, buy more stuff to set on fire, burn different things at the same time to get combos.This game is not for everyone, but those people it IS for will love it to death.

Burn certain combinations of things together and you get a check mark in the list of combos.  There are 99 combos and the game gives you hints as to what to burn.

												It's an interesting ""interactive experience."" Would I call it a game, per se? No. The graphics are charming and disturbing simultaneously, the fire effects look great, but at its core it's a condemnation of casual free-to-play mechanics, using same mechanics in a game you pay for. It's a condemnation of digital distribution services like Steam...on Steam. It's a game where the gameplay doesn't matter...then tells you it doesn't matter. If that sounds good to you, then get it. Personally, I would say it's not worth it.			"

												I wasn't going to recommend this game at first, but after playing it for several hours, I changed my mind.  After trying to figure out combos for more than four hours, this game grew on me.Summary of the game: Essentially, you spend the entire game throwing random objects in the fire.  Pretty simple.  As you play the game more and throw more into the fire, more items are unlocked.  If you run out of money to buy more objects, you can easily earn more money by waiting to burn spiders.  There are also list of combos you can earn by burning certain objects together.  Even though you spend 95% of the game burning objects, it still has an interesting storyline.First, reasons against recommending this game:1.) It's not worth $10.  It would be a stretch, but $5 might be ok.  2.) The scenery for the most part doesn't change.  You are in front of a fireplace for 95% of the game.3.) Some of the combos are too vague.  I feel like several of the objects not in the combo also fit the theme of the combo, and some of the combos are confusing.  There was one in particular that did not make any sense to me.  Some of the combos also need better hints.  I was able to complete all but 3-4 of them without help, and after getting help, I could tell that I wouldn't have figured them out on my own.Now, I'll go over why I like this game.  First of all, many of the combos are quite amusing and addicting (such as online piracy or LOL kitty).  Others are a fun challenge to figure out.  The selection of items to burn is amusing.  You can also choose to burn the photos from your own computer (all the photos have to be in your pictures folder though).  It comes in handy when you want to burn pictures of your ex, but you have no fireplace available for that purpose.  I got joy out of it even 1.5 years later.  The storyline is cute.  The ending is great!If you are a person that likes games with a ton of action and exciting adventures, this game is not for you.  However, if you like short, light games (especially ones that can distract you from schoolwork or chores), give this game a try!			"

												little inferno is a great game to play when you just want to you know.. burn something... okay so i am joking, but seriously this game is wonderfully addictive. The game in itself is simplistic but that does not take away the fun of trying to create (burn) cool combo's. The games storyline  (although rather peculiar) is heart-warming and the overall vibe of the game is quite peaceful. deffinitely a game to play at 4 am in the morning when you are fairly tired but just don't want to get off steam just yet :)			"

												From the beginning when I watched the trailer/gameplay video I thought... what a weird simple (& probable short) game. Now after play 12+ hours I can say my first impression of the game was very wrong. Sure burning things and watch what they do when they are engolfed in fire is fun, but the core aspect of the game is making combo's. You need to try and match 1 item with another item soley based off the Combo's Name that is displayed in the combo list (some are 3 part combos). Some a very obvious and easy to figure out, and others can take a deep train of thought to figure out. Then meanwhile, there is also a letters being written to you by another character in the game that kinda creates a plot for the game. About the only negative thing I have to say about the game is the wait times on deliveries of your items you'll be burning. This aspect of the game just doesn't feel quite right. Why should I have to sit around and wait to play a game...  Besides that, a very enjoyable game!			"

												World of Goo was unique, cheeky, seemed to look at the world in its own little way.  Little Inferno seeks to recapture that spirit and feel to solidify how 2D Boy games are like.  Unfortunately it just doesn't leave the same lasting impression.The game starts off innocently enough just like World of Goo does.  You have a fireplace and a cutesy, but loomingly sinister setting about snow that never stops falling and that you bought a fireplace to burn things in to stay warm.  You burn things, get money, and buy more things to burn.  These objects come in themes with increasingly tongue-in-cheek jabs at consumerism in general.  There is a surprising amount of little details in pretty much everything but at the same time, it really loses that luster and subtle humor after the first few times you burn something and it starts screaming.  However, as you keep playing, you realize about half-way through that this is all the game is and it quickly overstays its welcome.  Unlocking things is an incredibly lengthy process and finding all the various combos, that range from obvious to clever to straight up random, can sometimes be an exercise in straight guesswork.The visuals and sounds are highly reminiscent of World of Goo which from I figure seems to be the developers' attempt at a unique style which does suit the game rather well.  It's fairly easy to get absorbed in the atmosphere but it's also very easy to break said atmosphere.  The nods to World of Goo are ever present, but it almost feels like they draw too much from their past success to remind you how artsy and anti-establishment they are- almost to the point of tedium.The biggest problem with Little Inferno is that unlike World of Goo, you have to not only push yourself to finish it but there's absolutely no value in playing it more than once.  If you've done everything the first go around, the only thing you can do differently is not burn a single item you get early on that changes a single passing line of dialogue at the end.  It set itself up almost to feel like a spiritual successor to the beloved little puzzle game that I still highly recommend to anyone who would want to play it, but it wound up being too similar to World of Goo to stand out on its own, and too different from it to really hold my attention.It's been a while since I uninstalled and forgot about the game, and in hindsight, I kind of regret paying the full $15 for this one when it came out.  Fans of World of Goo or artsy indie stuff in general will still find something to enjoy from it, though.  It's not a bad game in its own right, but its lack of lasting presence really hurts it in the end.  You'll play it once and forget about it.			"

												How to even start to describe this game. Needless burning of material possessions, cute next door neighbour, an all controlling powerful corporation, a home shopping network that pays for itself.... not making much sense... it's a truck load of mindless fun and pack full of meaningful social statements all rolled into the one game.Playtime: A good 4-5 hours if you are set on getting all the achievement combos along the way. Maybe 1-2 hours if you don't.Cost: $9.99 (Has gone as low as $3.99 during sales)Replayability: I can see myself playing this every now and again, as throwing stuff into a fire and watching it burn never gets old.

												Little Inferno is a delightfully cheerful, albeit sometimes dark, game in which you buy things with the purpose of setting them on fire in your Little Inferno Entertainment Fireplace. Each item you burn gives you more money to buy more fuel for your LIEF. Stay warm out there, kids. It is a cold world out there, but keep the fires inside your Little Inferno Entertainment Fireplace. It would be dangerous to do otherwise. And copyright infringement.			"

Also if you're worried about th lack of steam acheivements, the game has a list of them in game. They're all like a little riddle to try to figure out what items to burn together to get them.			"

												I really love this game. At first you just have fun being a pyromaniac, burning all your toys so you can get more money and burn more toys. You can also create funny combos by burning certain things together. Then the story starts getting darker and more meaningful, and I found myself kept on asking questions about what am I doing in front of a fireplace and why am I here... One down side is this game does not have much replay value, unless you want to explore possible alternative endings, which may or may not exist in the first place. Overall, a very interesting game that would entertain you for a few hours, but leaves you thinking about you and the world for the rest of the day.			"

												Maybe it's just a reflection of my age, but I found myself genuinely upset for having played this game all the way through.  What starts out as cutely creepy ends up being a soul sucking waste of time.  Too harsh?  I just feel like a game whose entire message is about going outside, talking to actual people, and not burning away one's time in front of some stupid distraction machine shouldn't then suck you in to do exactly that.  I don't know, maybe the developer wants you to feel awful by the time you've finished the game.  Like the cliche father sending his son out to the shed to smoke an entire pack of cigarettes as punishment for sneaking his first puff?  I agree with the message, and would much rather have a beer with friends than frag all day, but there are also those times when nothing else is going on, you're tired, and just want to chill out for a little fun escape...those times shouldn't be ruined by the guilt of Little Inferno.

												3 out of 5.I like Little Inferno. Unfortunately, I don't think it's worth the $10 it's going for. If you can find it for less than $5, grab it. Like other people have stated, this is mostly a chimney simulator. The goal of the game is to create combos of items that you obtain in the game and then burn them. Don't think that's it because these items just don't burn. They all do something special when that fire hits them and learning what they do when they burn is a big key to what items go with what in order to create the good combos. Now, the biggest gripe I've had with the game is that there IS a story in this game. The sad part is that we're hit with it too late and the interactions you have with the other characters is so small that the ending to this game makes you want more. The ending is great, but the story leading up to it is not in the same ball park. Take it for what it's worth, a pyromaniac's paradise.			"

It didnt and the game's ""moral"" was basically like an extended verison of nintendo's ""you should take a break now"" popups. The game's message would be more appropriate if the game was free.			"

												Even though this is a simple (and maybe for some people dumb) little game, it is worth to play it just to see the ending, which can be interpreted  in different ways. But, I assure you, if you think just a little ""outside of the box"", you will find a simple, yet deep meaning behind this game. This game can and will remind you of something really important.			"

												This is a very unique game that was a joy to play through. I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought it, but I do enjoy burning things so I went for it. What I found was a clever little game centered around burning things in a fireplace while receiving messages from the outside world. There is a steady progression as you burn things in combos to unlock more catalogues with more things to burn, and there is an engaging story happening at the same time via letters you receive. There are goals you can achieve such as unlocking all the combos, earning stars on all the catalogues and reaching the end of the story. However, I spent a lot of time just burning things. Most of the objects have animations that are activated when they are set on fire. Here's a tip - burn the edge of the object rather than just setting fire to the middle so you don't miss out on the clever animations. For example, there is a boat that will simply explode if you burn the middle. If you burn an outer edge, you get to watch it spurt oil and then fire before blowing up. The burning is great - oil paintings melt, fragile things are quickly reduced to ash, metal things leave charred skeletons. The only feature I would have liked to have seen would be a way to make up your own combos and share them with others. If you're looking for something different that you can enjoy at a leisurely pace, this game is an excellent choice.			"

												Yes, it seems juvenile but once you get past the title screen the game grabs you and doesn't let you go. It has a great artistic look and it appeals to everyone's desire to burn things. Wrap that up with a good moral at the end and its a good little game. The unlockable alternate ending is a nice challenge.			"

Unfortunately that's all there is to the game and it's over in about 5 hours. One can spend extra time trying to get all 99 combos but it's optional. All in all, a good game but I wouldn't pay more than $5 for it. I got mine through the Humble Bundle with a few other games so that was pretty cool.TL;DR: Don't pay more than $5 for it.			"

Each item has its own unique effect that satisfies the little pyromaniac, sitting on your shoulder, that gently whispers in your ear about how everything is much more pretty when it burns.I recommend it to everyone.

												The game is of a dystopian setting, where people don't tend to leave their homes, let alone their city. The weather has been getting worse, with snow constantly falling - was this intentional? The citizens spend their days ordering things from several catalogues so that they can burn them in the Little Inferno Fireplace to keep warm.You are a boy that is doing just that, and you get letters from several sources that progress the storyline. The more I play this, the more I am inclined to think that the constant snow is a corporate plan to keep everyone inside so that they can buy the Little Inferno Fireplace and the products in the catalogue?The game is graphically beautiful, and the way that you play it, as well as the story itself, it's just one of those games that you must play! It doesn't take that long to complete, if you know what to do!			"

												Simple game, but can become really boring. You buy and burn things in your fireplace. A lot of items have special effects or events that are triggered by setting them on fire. There is also a combo system, in which you combine items and burn them (you need to guess what should be used in a combo). Combos are listed and their titles can be helpful. There is also some kind of neighbour who sends you letters and items sometimes. She is a little girl and she wants to be your friend. You did not actually meet her. You also get some sort of weather news through letters. And that's it. The whole game. Burn everything and read letters.It is well made and it is enjoyable for couple of hours (or rather minutes), but it gets boring soon. "

												At first it appears to be no more than a carrot on a stick kind of game. Do one thing to unlock another, then repeat, repeat, repeat. The gameplay is essentially that, but the pay-off is something unexpected. It is a game with a lot of heart, and if you are looking for it, enough intrigue to keep your mind reeling hours after completion.			"

												For the little pyro in all of us! You wouldn't think a game with screaming marshmallows and exploding green fire would be all that engaging, but you'd be wrong! Little Inferno is relaxing and fun. You do need a bit of a warped sense of humor, but it's truly addictive trying to find combos for stamps and finding out what the next thing you burn is going to do (explode? yell? try to escape?). I bought this on sale but it would have been worth the full price.			"

												After completing Little Inferno, it's a game that I would highly recommend for a tablet / mobile device, but struggle to recommend for PC. The biggest issue I had with the game was the time I spent doing other stuff. The basic mechanics of the main game are buying items from catalogs and burning them in the fireplace. The developers implemented a timed ""shipping"" mechanic, where once you buy an item, you must wait a certain period of time. In a way, I understand a bit what they were doing, but the last couple catalogs feature items with shipping times well into the 3-4 minute mark, and the final item takes a mind-numbing five minutes to ship. This is inexcusible for a PC game, waiting five minutes for no other reason than waiting. This absolutely drives pacing into the ground as you search for combos.     Speaking of combos, the combos fall into one of three catagories. There are some well thought out combos that, after about five minutes, you will figure out and maybe even smile at the logic. The vast majority of the combos are very easy to solve and you end up wating more for the item to show up than solving the puzzle. There are some combos that, unless you follow the same logic trail the developers did, you will need to look up. This happened about 3 or 4 times to me, with a couple combos I simply got lucky on guessing / happened to get while burning stuff for money.       This is a quite fun time waster, or if you are doing something else like playing a turn-based game online, but they ask 10 dollars, and there's no way I can recommend this as a full-fledged game. For a game this short and this expensive, there should be far less waiting around. Unless the game looks very interesting to you, wait for it to appear in a bundle or on sale and pick it up. I can recommend for 2-5 dollars, depending on interest level, but ten is just too much for a game this short and with this many delays.			"

												Burn everything!I really enjoyed this game and I recommend it to anyone who has a good few hours to burn. (pun intended) The story is interesting and leaves you guessing, while the reactions of some of the items being set ablaze is defintely entertaining, just as the Little Infero Entertainment Fireplace suggests.

												I played the whole game in one try, and enjoyed it a lot.  However, during the first minutes of gameplay of Little Inferno I wasn't feeling very comfortable with setting absolutely EVERYTHING on fire. Even school buses with kids screaming inside. It was funny how some things would react to the fire, but still, there seemed to be no purpose to it and I felt like only a psycho would enjoy it. But then an actual story started unveiling and hooked me... and the objects that you set on fire did the rest. As you advance the objects get sillier, and you can combine them with others to unlock even sillier combos. Without noticing it, you just keep on playing and playing until you reach the shocking ending.Recommended indeed.			"

												Little Inferno is for players who enjoy to try & see what happens. Basically player just burns things up, sees how different items react to a fire and then combines those (items) to find combos. Behind this combo-finding and burning things up is a story to follow, which isn't much, but still reminds me of T. Burton and has the same feeling as did World of Goo.			"

												From the makers of World of Goo comes Little Inferno.This game is strange, but that goes without saying, you buy items to burn in your fireplace, which give you more coins than you purchased them for to buy more items to burn. If the game had left it there I would have said don't bother with it but... there are combinations of things to burn. Like burning the Old lady and the kitty poo poo doll gives you the 'Cat Lady' combination. This gives you a stamp which, one you collect enough, allows you to buy another catalohue.Meanwhile while your burning things to yur hearts content theres a little plot going on through letters sent to you by your neighbour. I won't spoil anything but I didn't see it coming. Well the first bit I did, but not the second part.So yeah I recommend this, but only if its in a sale for maybe £3 or so., Its only a short game, you should be able to find most combinations in a very short time, and has little replay value since once you've burned everything and reached the end theres nothing much to do other than burn the same stuff again in a new game.

												Your burn fings in the fireplace with your mouse and get coins for that to buy new things... to burn. Makes no sense.Periodically you get letters (that you burn after reading) and you're encouraged to discover combos which make no sense either. Burn a pirate and a bike - you get a combo.To be clear: you're not doing anything other then burning things you buy. If you like that kind of games you might enjoy it, but this is worse than Farmville-like games in social networks in my opinion.			"

												I didn't really know what to expect from this game going in. I picked it up in a humble bundle and it sat untouched in my library for a while. Then one day I just felt like burning something. Well, good news if that sounds like fun to you. That is all you do in this game, burn stuff in a little fireplace, and then you buy more stuff and then you burn it. To some this may sound dull, so let me explain, there is a story taking place, and there is an ""ending."" There are achievments and combos to make, and the animations are very tim burton-esque. I enjoyed the sheer dark humor of the story put in front of me, while I mindlessly ignored all the games warnings and burned my fireplace's manual. This is the mindset you put yourself in while playing. You can easily ""burn"" this one out in an afternoon (LOL bad pun I know.) but certainly worth the money. You'll enjoy it, I know you are all pyros anyways.			"

												This game takes a dark twist of the usually fun and satisfying activity of setting fire to various objects that you own(ed).The world is getting colder, it's the opposite scenario of what is happening in real life, and you're not allowed to go outside. You have no gas or electricity, so there's only one thing you can do to stop freezing; You have to burn things. Lots of things. More things than you have ever burnt in real life, and ever will, unless you do this for living, of course.You find a letter, several letters infact. Terms and conditions - burn. Greetings from producer - burn. Envelope from secret lover? - burn. You burn things if you didn't already get the memo.I would rate this game a 7/10. It's a nice game, could be a bit cheaper, and really, it's basically just about teaching you a life lesson which I refuse to spoil in this review. "

												Don't pay full price for this.  It's fun, it's amusing, and you'll enjoy it, but it's not worth $10.  Honestly I'm not even sure it's worth $5. I got it in the Humble Bundle and that was great.  Otherwise... meh.			"

												A charming little game that you can expect to spend a few hours in. There's a sweet story amongst all the fun of watching things incinerate or blow up, and combo hunting will keep you busy. I really liked the visual style and the fire effects were quite mesmerising as you watched the air ripple from the heat of your little fireball.Personally it doesn't have much replay value for me once I've found all the combos. I'd only go back if they introduced trading cards or achievements to the mix. It was an enjoyable experience though!			"
