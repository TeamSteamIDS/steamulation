												Alone in the Dark (4): The New Nightmare is a 3rd person survival horror game which was released in 2001. Some may say that it's a ripoff (see Resident Evil), but that's not entirely true. AITD4 is a reboot of the series which is placed in modern times. There are two playable characters with different, but interconnected storylines (similar to RE2), both have average playtime of 4-5 hours. The game has unique soundtrack (created by Low Distortion Unit) which is really atmospheric, scary and menacing. The game offers you limited amount of ammo which strengthens the element of survival horror. It also has puzzles which aren't that difficult (if you actually read in-game's files). There are powerful weapons such as double barrel revolver, triple barrel shotgun, plasma cannon, grenade and rocket launchers and other special weapons. I should also mention that the game also utilized a flashlight which is used for seeing dark areas, for puzzle solving and even as a weapon (see Alan Wake). The PlayStation 2 and PC ports have better FMVs, models and backgrounds, runs at 60FPS, however, the music is badly ported and sounds barely like the original (PlayStation 1). The Steam version of the game has a broken launcher and that's why I suggest getting the GoG version instead (or have them both?). With the proper launcher you can select any rendering resolution, but only 4:3 resolutions are recommended.AITD is a truly scary game. The mixture of good soundtrack, atmosphere (including rain and thunder), flashes, sudden screams, supernatural monsters does it's job. Be sure to play at night and/or with headphones. Generally underrated game.			"

												I shall always remember this as a game that scared me the most. The story and the depth of it are most memorable, so for a game of its age, it does incredibly well. Due to change of hands, the title has been milked ever since, making this as the one and only decent game of its series. There are slight compatibility issues which are to be expected for such an old game, however there are several fixes out there. It's a shame that there was never a remake of this.			"

												Holy crap guys! This is one of the scariest freaking games on Earth! DO NOT: Play shortly after, while or shortly before eating; Play with the lights off; Play with your headphones' volume set high, Play if you suffer hearth health problems. It's not only the jumpscares (they're actually not many). It's the atmosphere, which is downright hellish, and it's actually above the average in terms of difficulty.			"

												Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare is still giving me the creeps to this day. The music and the sound effects are very well made and give the game a good athmosphere. Overall runs faster than the Psone copy i still have!However, the game has its downsides. You can't change the resolution, so you'll be stuck on 640 x 480. Controller support is almost obsolete as well, even though i was trying to set my controls with my 360 controller, i'm thinking it might work on the arrow buttons on a rather older gamepad model. The cutscenes never show up, unless i alt+tab and by then the game might crash and quite frankly i don't want to do that every cutscene.Was it worth the 5.99€? Not necessarily, if it wasn't just a mere version of the 2001 copy. If they had actually cared about modern customers, they would've fixed all of those problems. Now i'm left thinking should i be mad that i wasted my 5,99€ on this game or do i keep playing putting the problems aside?I can't decide between recommending this game and not recommending, so i'll give it a thumbs up just for the nostalgia that i've got for the title. If you're expecting a fully working game, look away. If you don't mind about the half-bakedness of the game, pick it up.			"

												Really scary, it does give some good heart poundings from the creepy music, horror atmosphere, and gives off a well good jumpscare for a old game. If anyone plays Resident Evil 1, should know this is somewhat similar in the gameplay, and game plot as well.Keep noted however, there are bugs and glitches in this game, so please save carefully. Also another note that the saves are limited so dont save too much, but you will earn some along the way, would suggest go scavenging on items and dont waste all ammo since enemies are either too much or endless to kill, they WILL come back at some point in some areas, excluding bosses of course.I was able to beat it while saving cautiously, so have fun and dont end up trapping yourself or otherwise you will have to restart all over again, that includes if used up all ammo and dont know a strategy to run through the enemies.

												A really great game I would recommend for anyone who likes horror or likes to get jumpscared. It's a old game yes, but its still scary as ever. It might have alot of bugs but I have not come across any bugs and the game has been really fun to play again, as I used to play it as a kid but never got a chance to finish it. If your a fan of Alone in the dark or a fan of resident evil, or any kind of horror game with jumpscares, this game is for you. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I will.			"

												It can easily be argued that Alone in the Dark is the series that created the survival horror genre. The first game was released in 1992 for the MS-DOS and laid the groundwork for the genre. After a couple sequels the series fizzed away, until Resident Evil came around and recreated survival horror. So obviously the original had to come back to the field and compete, and what it came back with was Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare.  game starts with Edward Carnby, a private detective, finding out that his partner is dead off the coast of Shadow Island. Edward soon learns of some ancient tablets that can unlock a secret power. Edward teams up with Aline to find the tablets and avenge his friend's death. Their plane is attacked by some mysterious creature, forcing them to parachute, become separated, and become stuck on Shadow Island. Here the game makes you decide which character you want to be, either Edward or Aline. Each has their own storyline and adventure, which intersects at certain points. The gameplay is what you would expect from a survival horror game. Your character controls like in Resident Evil, where up moves forward and you pivot. The game also uses pre-rendered backgrounds, that are in fact very detailed and dark. The game has a great atmosphere that is mostly focused on darkness. You will grow to fear the darkness and the nightmare creatures that lurk within it. And like most survival horror games, the game has a heavy emphasis on combat and puzzle solving. What is different is, while both characters will see their fair share of both, one is more prevalent in each character’s campaign. Edward has his trusty double barreled revolver and will always have it in hand. His story involves mostly fighting the nightmare creatures. The enemies are very tough and ammo is scarce, making you have to know when to stand up and fight, and when to run away. Aline starts off in a huge mansion and must solve the puzzles littered through mansion to advance. It is interesting how they separated these two gameplay mechanics, allowing you to play the game the way you want. But whether you are solving puzzles or fighting monsters, the darkness will always be there. This is a great return of the original of the genre. With the separate campaigns and the beautiful but dark graphics, the game is full of tricky puzzles and terrifying enemies. his is another strong reason why you should be afraid to be alone in the dark.

												Caveat Emptor: this game lacks basic Win 8 / Win 10 compatibility. Despite the fact it's an old game that can be purchased for a dollar or two when on sale, it's still irresponsible for Atari to leave this game up for sale without a proper warning. There's a rather complicated ""fix"" using the Spanish alone4.exe (Google it) which does seem to get the game to boot to the in-game menu...but...all of the menu choices will, of course, be in Spanish. This ""fix"" is rumored to allow the game to play correctly for some & apparently uses English language in-game (as long as a companion ""locale.cok"" file is also placed in the Provider file). However, even with this ""fix"" my experience has thus far has been a crash to desktop every time. Additionally, I've read in at least 2 forums the only way to get this game to actually work on newer computers is to use a cracked .exe file (WTF? lol) However, I cannot confirm as I haven't tried this ""fix"" yet.TLDR: As of July 8, 2016 the only way to get this game working is on a Win 7 PC. For anyone who has moved on to Win 8.1/10, do not waste your time or money unless you're willing to revert back to Win 7 - or dual boot. I'll update this review if I find a working solution.			"

												As someone who loves PS1 horror games like Resident Evil,Silent Hill,Martian Gothic,Dino Crisis,Countdown Vampires and other I also have a special place in my heart for Alone in the Dark series . The New Nightmare is very spooky game with obscure plot,dark atmopshere and traditional horror-survival gameplay with fixed backgrounds . Technical Problems You may need third party software to use some controlers properly . I was able to assign all buttons to a controler but LT,RT not supported on F310 so I had to utilize Start/Back . (which is fine but not optimal) Free/Look is very hard on controler so be prepared to use mouse for some puzzles and maybe enemies on low elevation . For the most part you do not need to aim at enemies as long as you shoot in general direction .Some people can't get Part2 of this game to work which is what PS1 copies were known to do . I can only speak for myself and the game works fine for me on win7x64  . According to some folks using this game on Win 10 is a pain in the butt ( although I am not sure why people expect a game this old to work with abomination that is Win10 ) If there is a compatibility mode try that . Gameplay Very similar to Resident Evil 1 when it comes to controls and game format .Fixed Backgrounds,Tank controls,puzzles and reloading from inventory - classic .Some enemies are vulnarable to effects of Light so you can sometimes save bullets by using flashLight or turning on lights in room . Also some puzzles will utilize Light effects so keep that in mind .Some enemies respawn infinitely so if you stack and looking for a puzzle solution you will eventually get hit .Navigating in this game is also a pain in the butt . There are hundreds of god damn doors ,eveything is dark and camera angles sometimes make it worse . I played for hours with no ammo because i just missed a shotgun in the shade :) There are 2 playable characters which have some unique areas sorta like Resident Evil 2 had with Claire and Leon . One of the bosses even chases you around which reminds me RE3 Nemesis .You can save the game at any point if you have a medalion ( No save room? I know right ) Atmosphere and Immersive Settings Among all horror games on PS1 The New Nightmare was the best looking horror game having superior visual effects,textures and 3D models. Sure it looks dated now but back then it was as good as it got .Probably the most important thing for a Horror game is great atmosphere which this game has in spades .In the dark surrounded by shadows you will meet few characters and they won't bring you comfort. Walking through dark corridors not knowing what is ahead , what you need to do or if you have enough ammo to fight what is coming .The New Nightmare is truly immersive game that makes you feel alone in the worst place you can imagine . The hellish soundtrack is just the cherry on cake .On a side note I love camera angles in this game that add to gloomy mood ( if you playing as detective watch out for camera angle from the window of the house it is ♥♥♥♥en cool )Score 7/10 . If you like PS1 horror games with tank controls you will feel right at home . This game is somewhat cryptic and can be pretty obscure with puzzles. Most of enviroments are very dark so it is hard to find items and navigate with respawning enemies . Intense settings,fun gameplay and beautiful backgrounds overall make up for the minor problems . Good game but you may need a guide .			"

Atmosphere is scary4. 2 playable characters, one more focused on combat and one focused on puzzles5. OK combatCons1. Controls are bad and I had to use third party russian hack to use controllers.2. I had to use a no CD crack to get the final part of the game because the game insisted on inserting disk 3 (WTF lol)3. Its Short (Maybe like 4-5 hours per character.4. Kinda easy towards the end.5. You don't get ammno for the grenade launcher after leaving the mansion :(Its much better then the 2008 Alone in the dark by far.			"

												Right this game is great I loved it as a kid but if you use Windows 8/10 oh boy your going to have a fun time with no FMV's loading, the title menu screwed up and in game the background to pure white and your a shiny blue colour. Audio still works but everything else broken! All broken! There is a fix but makes your game spanish but I don't know spanish so yeah thats good. Until Atari or someone else can be bothered to fix the game its not playable. Overall its a great game but Atari released it to not work on higher OS so you cant play the damn thing. Lucky I got this in the sale or I would not be happy buying this full price. In this review the game gets the thumbs down for me but I really want to give it a thumbs up I do. Right if you don't mind me I'm just going to get this game ""legitimately"" on my PCSX2.			"

The games atmospher is very eerie and creepy.

												A overlooked gem in survival horror. It's Alone in the Darks version of Resident Evil 2. Multi scenario that follows two characters through their stories.This was good on PS1 back in the day. However, I can't recommend the PC version. You'll have to go through alot of work just to get it running on modern operating systems. Even then, it doesn't play as smooth as the experience I had back in the Playstation 1 days.Would be nice if a company would restore the glory to this franchise. Return it back to its cinematic survival horror roots. Until then, this series will just be sitting, ""ALONE IN THE DARK!""			"

												The New Nightmare looks and play like most other survival horror games. Those of you familiar with the Resident Evil series of games will instantly know what to expect and how to play/control this game. If you are looking for a Silent hill game on steam I think Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare is your best bet. Unless you have not played RE HD Remaster yet.You can play as either Edward Carnby, a private detective looking for revenge or Aline Cedrac, a university student specializing in ancient Indian culture. Each character has their own unique adventures on Shadow Island and while they will interact at times, each must rely on their own strengths to solve the puzzles and complete the game.Edward's game relies on weapons and combat and features more monsters while Aline's game consists of more puzzles that require you to use your wits. You can play either character first although for maximum enjoyment I recommend playing as Edward Carnby. He is the stronger of the two characters, and you will learn the layout of the mansion quicker and easier while playing as him.P.S : Don't forget to download the 'patch' that let you play in 1920x with High Resolution. It's a must have but when playing the game it won't give you play time on steam.(since you have to start the game with the new launcher.) I have completed the game but my playtime didn't register!

												This game is nothing but one bug after another.  Stays on a black screen for the first couple of minutes, and then repeats this process every time there is a cut scene.  Game won't recognize controllers and the keyboard controls are a joke even if you go in and reset them to modern keys.  Aiming and firing a gun with this setup is ridiculous.  There are other problems but I have basically given up.I've only got 0.4 hours on it, but that is all I can take until the game gets patched, if it ever does.  Quite a shame.Don't buy, not even on sale.  First game I've bought on Steam that just flat out rots.			"

												From the moment Edward Carnby and Aline Cedrac set foot on Shadow Island, they are confronted by mysterious, evil creatures intent on thwarting their progress to recover 3 ancient tablets believed to hold the secret key to some incredible menacing phenomena. Danger threatens from every corner. The slightest shadow could be hiding deep secrets, or concealing worse nightmares... Can you see beyond your fear? Edward Carnby, the supernatural detective is back! And this time it's for revenge. Carnby's best friend, Charles Fiske has been found dead off a mysterious island off the coast of Maine, Shadow Island. Carnby's investigation quickly leads him to Fred Johnson who informs him of Fiske's search for the three ancient tablets which, when placed in a specific location, will unlock an incredible and dangerous power. Johnson pleads with Carnby to pick up where Fiske left off and reopen the investigation in order to recover the tablets. Carnby accepts the mission to find and destroy the murderer of Fiske and avenge his death. The original survival horror franchise continues with a pure blend of intense action and suspenseful adventure. Alone in the Dark immerses the player into a dark and strange atmosphere where conventional rules do not apply. The player must overcome his natural fear of the dark unknown and control Edward Carnby through a deep and highly detailed storyline. Armed with a flashlight and a pistol, Carnby must find the necessary items to survive as well as the clues which will help him escape his ultimate nightmare.			"

												I really loved the old Alone in the Dark games when I was a kid. But picking this up, oh dear. I'll be honest - I didn't get far. But I can't bring myself to continue.The voice acting is so monotonous you can't truely pick the girl to play after you heard her, and the controls - they're a joke. You use 's' to turn on the flashlight and arrows to move - and you're probably leaving your right hand on the mouse to shoot. Now how'r you going to do that? And the graphics - I know the game's old, but seriously, they could've made a better job. That being said though, they're better than the audio. And wtf man - you just crashed your plane, and you're walking slowly around like zombie? If you have to choose between flatout 3 or this, get this. But otherwise, save your money.			"

Avoid this game unless you like having high blood pressure.			"

												I have had many issues with trying to get this games to run the launcher file. The launcher for does not work and says that the file is missing although it is right infront of me and clicking that file will run the game BUT won't let me play in a resolution above 480p. I play on a 1080p monitor and I have specs way above what is needed to run the game. I have tried many tutorials to sort the issues and none have. I am computer savvy and I am an A-Level student in Computing. So this is not me not having a clue on what I am doing.This is a real shame... I do not discourage people from playing this game based on my review as I have heard Windows 7 has it's own fix. It is also a shame that I can't play it because I loved the PS1 version even though it scared me. I have contacted Customer Support letting them know about the issue. Hopefully it will get fixed.

												AiTD is the resurrection of the old games retold in a new fashion (aka a reboot).The mansion you are at has these demons that are afraid of the light. Light is your best weapon in this game. If there is a shadow, you might as well expect something to be there or waiting for you to get near it. Back in the old school days before Resident evil and Silent Hill, this was the horror game.Too bad the port and storyline have been utterly mangled. As far as the port is concerned, they did not update the graphics so it looks nowhere near the quality it should. There are no video settings so larger resolution monitors are going to resize this a lot.As far as gameplay is concerned, they tried too hard to make a fully 3 dimensional game that they forgot to add the mystery to the horror aspects. Everything feels too scripted and not eerie. The voice acting is pretty bad. Sometimes in a funny way. If you can overcome these setbacks, the game is not that bad. It was a good attempt and welcome attempt to trying to bring back a classic game. If the developer spent a little more time on it, it could have been a great game. "

												~ NOTE: Windows 10 breaks some visuals in the Steam ver. of the game. The community has found a fix for it and the game is now playable again after some fixes. If you don't want to bother with some fixing you can buy AitD 4 from GOG as well. ~I've owned 3 different versions of this game, the original PS1 title that I got some 14 years ago, the PS2 title I bought so I didn't need to change discs and this Steam version for nostalgia and the fact I don't have the physical copies anymore. This said, I think I have some mileage with this game. I still play this game through at least once a year on both characters and, in my opinion, it's one of the better horror games of the PS1 with good soundscape, visuals and gameplay, and it still holds up (or maybe that's just me). It's a game every horror enthusiast should play at least once, and I highly recommend it to anyone who either likes horror games or old games.			"

												""Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare"" is a mild horror game wich is fun, has acceptable graphics (considering that it is from 2001) and a nice story.It has been quite entertaining to play through this title, especially because of its good level design and interesting characters. The graphics are still OK, even by today's standards. Basically, it uses the same mechanics as can be found in the original ""Resident Evil"", that is, you have pre-rendered backgrounds with animated 3D characters and items in the game world. If you want to play it on Windows 10 and want to have a higher resolution, just check the info on the Steam community. I think it will not work on newer OS if you do not fiddle a bit with it and use the fixes provided in the forum here. The setting is very atmospheric and eerie, and the rather nice-looking lighting effects add to this impression.In general, both the effects and music are good. Sometimes the disturbing music and some creature sounds are even really terrifying which is of course a good thing in a horror game. The controls are also good, except for some glitches when auto-aiming. I think the difficulty is medium. It would have been nice if there was an option to change it for those who would like to have more challenge.Characters and voiceover is also quite decent, only some of the male character's one liners and comments are a bit dull. Some might even like this as it makes the character more unique. You can also choose between the male and the female character. I have only played the man's storyline, but I think there are quite some differences when you choose the woman at the beginning.The only two real flaws to this game were occassional minor glitches with some enemies or other objects and that there are sometimes the notorious invisible walls or obstacles. So, when you run near the walls you hit an invisible boundary, even though your character is not actually touching any physical object. All in all, I would give this title a 75 % rating.			"
