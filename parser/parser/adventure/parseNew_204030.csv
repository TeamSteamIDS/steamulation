												When I was younger, my gramdma came over to my house to hang out. She was a ""OG gamer grill"", so we played a lot of the same games. When ever Fable TLC came out she fell in love with it, so she made a pirated copy for my 12 yr old self. I installed the game on my dinky little pc and started playing it immediately. When I started out in Oakvale, the graphics where so demanding (for my POS rig at the time) that the ground looked like snow and the water was♥♥♥♥♥♥yellow, but I still played it anyways. I, too, fell in love with Albion's quirky humour. A few weeks later my dad bought me a graphics card so there would be no more♥♥♥♥♥♥oceans. I learned a few things about PCs because of it. So I played Fable for months and when I finally beat it, I was so happy. The story is so great and the gameplay is amazing! I then played the game two more times, leveling up different skills along the way. I had a good guy knight, a neutral rogue, and an evil wizard. This game ment so much to me because my grandma gave it to me. She got upset when I told her I beat it before she did, so I teased her about it forever :)I bought this game for nostalgia reasons, and also because it reminds me of my awesome grandma. I miss her... <3			"

												I was stuck in Havana, Cuba for 2 weeks.  That city (and country) is a cesspool.  I was starving, sick, tired, and angry.  I was also cut off from electronic civilization.  No email.  No internet.  No phones.  No nothing.  It so happened that I had this game installed on my laptop and was able to play it in offline mode.  Accordingly, the hours I played this game were not clocked on my profile, but believe me...THIS GAME IS AMAZING.  It is older, but it maintains it's classic status.  For 2 weeks straight, the only pleasure I found in life was playing this game and roof drinking.  Do yourself a favor and buy this game.  Now.			"

												Fable TLC is an amazing game. I remember playing it for the first time years ago and I still play it on occasion. The gameplay is fun and basically everything about it is pretty awesome. I guess it would have been better if they had added different difficulties, but it's still a great game regardless.This is my first review, so I apoligize if it's not too well written. I strongly suggest trying out this game sometime.			"

												Fable. Yo. The Lost Chapters.Alright where do I start?This game was my CHILDHOOD.I PULLED MY FIRST ALL NIGHTER BY MYSELF PLAYING FABLE THE LOST CHAPTERS ON THE ORIGINAL XBOX. If that isn't love, then I really don't know what is.Let's get down to it.Pros:-Fun combat. Sort of basic hack n' slash action rpg fare. Now I love to be rewarded for me kills. Typo was unintenional but I'll leave it there.      So you got SWORDS, BOWS & ARROWS, AND CROSSBOWS, and MAGIC! For each type of way you eradicate your enimies, you get experience for that category of killing. So, if you bash a hobbe's brains out with a hammer, you'll get melee experience, then stick in between the eyes with an arrow, you'll get ranged experience, and then finish him off by burning him to a crisp with a fireball, you'll get magic experience. And to put icing on the cake, whenever you finish off an enemie, or an innocent civillian, whatever, you'll get general experience. HOW EXCITING.        Melee combat comes down to left clicking, blocking, dodging, and doing cool overpowered attacks with the right click when your weapon lights up. Ranged is holding down the left click to draw and charge your weapon then popping heads from afar. Magic is self explanatory even more so than the other categories. Do your thing, Harry. You are the chosen one.-There are a lot of spells. Lightning, teleporting, reviving the undead, being a jedi and unleashing the wrath of hell.-Obvious character evolution! Not only do you feel your character getting stronger but you can also see it. Upgrade your strength and become The Hulk. Upgrade your skills and become Shaq, because you get tall when you kill enemies with a crossbow or scam someone out of their money, because hormones work like that. Use magic and you'll turn into a super saiyan. No lie.         Another example of that character evolution would be your morality. I think morality systems in video games are dope. If you're nice, you'll get a pretty little halo will float above your head, butterflies will hoard you, and you'll grow angelicly. If you're evil and kill your sister lol, you'll grow horns and people will cower in fear.-Chicken helmet. 'Nuff said.-Story's a little cliched, but only really the beginning. You play some as some kid who's village gets burnt to the ground by bandits but a wizard saves and takes you to meet a short Hulk Hogan, who raises you to be a hero. The story then turns out to be a lot bigger than story of just vengeance will the balance of Albion hanging in your hands.-The game doesn't take itself TOO seriously. There are serious moments but the overall tone and atmosphere of most of the zones is all laid back and chill.-Soundtrack's pretty dope too.Cons:-The game's ugly. ""Oh, Levi, the game is ten years old,"" well, I DON'T CARE. The game has not aged well. It didn't look good ten years ago. Deal with it. Anniversary edition looks beautimous though.-Its pretty short. I don't have an exact estimate of how quickly I got EVERYTHING DONE in the game, but I got all the sidequests done, max'd skills, fully geared, ect and started a second playthrough in less than 30 hours.-Your morality and story choices don't have a huge impact on the world. Yes, there are consequences for killing an important character at some point in the story, but it all really boils down to that the life you took was expendable anyway and their death would've decided whether people would talk smack to you or applaud you. Other than that though, the story is basically the same regardless of choices and the two endings are very slightly different.-The game is really linear, zones are small and there a little opprotunities to go off the beaten path. However, if you can find a place to explore, you will most likely be rewarded.In a nutshell, the game has a good but cliche story, fun combat, and you can get experience by eating meat. Buy it. Or the Anniversary edition for Xbox 360.			"

												I took a side quest from a random guy at the age of 18 when my skin was tender and smooth as a baby's bottom. I made him stand there and wait for me for 40 years before I actually did the quest. When I returned to him, he was still exactly the same and I was looking like Gandalf The Grey. 10/10 Would take on more side quests.			"

												Welcome to the very first Fable.This is the upgraded version from the original XBOX, and it's one hell of an adventure.Remember when Fable was good? This is that time.Remember when combat was something more than ""roll around and shoot things""? This is that timeRemember when bosses were actually BOSSES? When they were TOUGH and CHALLENGING? This is that time.This very first Fable is the embodiment of ""freedom"". You can choose almost everything. From your weapons, to your morality.Kick chickens, kill things, steal things, earn some money, go to the fight clu-OOOPS, FIRST RULE.Yep, you got the point. This is THE FABLE.Better than Fable Aniversary, and this game has, like, 9 years?Man, that IS something.Go buy it, kick a chicken, use lightning on some dudes. Go on, the choice is yours.Also, freaking Jack of Blades, dude, is almost like Handsome Jack, ALMOST.			"

												Fable The Lost Chapters is an old Xbox port with some extra bits.The game has you playing through the story of a boy turned man who becomes either a hero or a villian.Like many of Peter Molyneux's games you have the constant choices during quest to do good deeds or evil ones.The world around you reflects which side you choose and your characters appearance changes .The story itself is interesting enough but its the storytelling presentation that won me over.Weapons,skills & abilities in the game are your choice never being forced to pick any over another.They all have strengths and weaknesses but none outclass the others,other than in terms of damage.There are various outfits ,armors ,collectibles ,tropheys,and acclaim status to be gotten as you play.You can buy houses & rent them,barter for profit, get married,get divorced in the game as well.The game world is linear but the world itself is decently sized and you will revisit area's often enough.The game sports teleporting from anywhere to specific nodes to help keep the ending running down well enough.The game is littered with humor and sidequests many of which the rewards are worth doing but completely skippable. For an old game its a good buy if you have never played it and want a decent linear action rpg.With a sweetfx mod the game looks even better. Get it 75% off on the cheap or get Fable Anniversary with all its new shiney looks.Either way worth that linear playthrough if you like rpgs.			"

												Superior to all other Fable games in almost every way, sadly! On top of that, it's dated beautifully due to the cartoon-like visuals which in my opinion are a lot more attractive to those seen in Fable Anniversary. The only area that Fable really falls down, which Anniversary improved, is the combat controls, but bloody hell were they great at the time of release! :)15/10/2014 update: If you're wondering why my game time is lacking, it's because I own a PC (and Xbox) copy off-side the one I own on Steam. ^^			"

												Probably one of my favourite games of all time. I'm not a hardcore gamer though.First things first, don't judge this game based from experience from Fable 2, Fable 3 or the journey.The original Fable and the TLC edition are by far the best of the series and they started removing elements from the game such as the loss of a mana bar in Fable 2 and the health bar in Fable 3.Why is this game awesome?This game was one of the best of the Fable series thus far. It included the ability to slice your own destiny giving you the option to go full out evil with horns and flies buzzing around you or the choice of being good, being rewarded with a halo and popularity amongst the people of Albion. This game really emphasises the choice of your morality alignment, whether you wanted to have fun running around trying to take on guards or sacrificing people in order to receive a weapon; to just being able to stay clean and donating to the Temple.What is it like?This game is a sick Action Role-play game where the player gets to control a character and goes around bashing things with a sword swell as casting spells and spamming expressions to random villagers. While the environments aren't massive like the newer games they are sufficient and they are good enough for a basic casual gamer (like myself, they are pretty big to roam). The best thing about this game is being able to see character development. You start as a weak puny character that is a stick compared to the beast you become after you finish the storyline. It's a lot of fun mucking around with abilities.Apart from the main story line which has some really intense kicks and shakes the player can also buy out properties and steal stuff all the actions you make do change your morality which is probably the biggest aspect as I mentioned before. This game is worth more than it's price on steam and I really do highly commender it. Either TLC or the original edition, they are both beast :)			"

												My thoughts on Fable - The lost Chapters:I've played this game a lot when I was younger and didn't have Steam yet, that's why it says I've not played it at all and I'm still writing this recommendation. I got this game during a sale just because of the nostalgic feeling and so that I could tell you what an awesome game this is.Fable was released on PC back in 2005 and got a lot of attention back then because of the freedom it gives the player and the impacts those decisions can and will have on both your character and the environment, which was a pretty much unknown feature.You start the game as a young boy who's given several tasks, during which you're already forced to decide wther you want to finish them on the good or the bad way. Then, after some events, another tutorial and lots of talking, you're a grown up man who's (amongst other things) trying to figure out why those events happened and who's responsible for your parents death. You'll be given several quests, you may explore the world and fight numerous enemies, gain exp and gain access to bigger and better spells (which can be upgraded too), weapons (which can also be upgraded, giving them some awesome visual effects) and armor. Houses can be bought, women married (and f*cked, though the screen becomes black), chicked can be kicked around, and whole cities can be murdered.Cool thing about this game is, it always gives the player a choice. You can play it as a good guy, where you always help the innocent, never steal anything and never kill anyone who didn't deserve it. The more good things you do, the more saint-like your hero becomes, until you have your own halo and literally fart butterflies.If you do things the evil way, your character grows horns, becomes pale and scares the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everyone he encounters which makes getting a woman to marry you the most difficult task in the game (still a better love story than Twilight!). You can save a lot of money though by simply stealing the things that you need, and murdering an entire city is ♥♥♥♥ing funny! The hero also adapts to the weapons you use - if you fight with spells most of the time, your arms start glowing, but if you use swords, you'll become a big beefy warrior. Eat much, and you'll become fat, but eat nothing and you'll be thin as a branch.For a game that old the graphics and dialogues are still pretty good, the soundtrack is great and you'll be entertained for several hours. There may be lots of quests that are nothing special at all, but the freedom you enjoy in between is what makes this game one of the best I've played so far.There aren't many bad things I can remember because it's been a while since I've last played it, but be sure not to be playing a perfect game. It has its flaws like any other game, but I can't remember anything that makes me want to say ""♥♥♥♥ this game"".There seems to be a HD remake of this game on the way (no idea when though), but as someone commented below, only for the Xbox. Don't sue me if that's wrong.Buy it and enjoy!			"

												This is my favourite, and the best, RPG of all time. Period.Yes, I have no game time right now - but don't judge the review on that just yet.I remember back when I was younger, my brother had an Original Xbox, and Fable had just come out. He'd tell me how amazing it was and I always wanted to play it when he wasn't. After fighting to, I finally got to play and it was amazing. I'd spend all my free time on it when he wasn't using his xbox and it was just the best game I had ever played!As an earlier birthday present one year, I got to choose between an Xbox or a Nintendo DS - Yes I chose the correct choice - I bought an Xbox Original for the sole reason of spending my days on Fable. Fable is an amazing game, you make choices, buy and sell and collect items, weapons and armour. You have many expressions to make and learn, keys to find, chests to unlock and a lot of enemies to kill before killing the pfft...""Almighty"" End-Game boss. Fable as a whole was an amazing experience. Not so long after, Fable: The Lost Chapters was released, which I bought the day it came out. There weren't a lot of changes, flourishes were a different colour, Mini-map updates, some extra quests and optimisations, but of course, because it was Fable, it never stopped me spending countless hours playing it.Fable: The Lost Chapters, - or Fable TLC as some refer as - was a great experience, especially a small 'DLC - like' continuation of the game where the original Fable finished off. It's great and adds some extra lore and beef to the existing story, some new armour and Demon Doors as well as new expressions. The games in their entireties are amazing, and if you have never played either of them, then you should or we can't be friends.I have a lengthy review on Fable Anniversary, which in my opinion is also great. Especially since the Develiopers were kind enough to release a load of patches to improve on it where players were not happy.10/10. Best RPG of all time.			"

												Despite the tedious combat, this is a really good RPG game. It's somewhat short and quite linear, but there's enough interesting content in it to keep you busy for at least 20 hours. While a lot of the features are a tad superfluous. there is a good story, plenty of quests and a lot of interesting places to visit. The moral choices you have to make really add to the game. The only downside of the game is that the (melee) combat is just a lot of clicking. The training about blocking that you receive early in the game is rendered completely useless because you're (almost) always attacked by more than one enemy. Still it only lengthens the battles and doesn't really make them harder.Recommended for 10$ and a no-brainer for anybody who likes RPGs when it's on sale.			"

												The animations are atrocious to the point of being hilarious. The voice acting is so, SO bad.The graphics looked dated even back when it came out.But even with all its faults, I still love this game with a passion. Maybe I just have nostalgia goggles on, but I think this game's charm is through the roof. It's just some damn good fun.However, it is nowhere near as ridiculously amazing as that professional hack Peter Molyneux hyped it up to be back in the day, so just try to play this like any other game and you'll have a good time.If you like RPGs, then you owe it to yourself to at least try playing this once.

												This is the first time I've played a Fable game andI enjoyed this game mostly, I liked the story and that you could do bad, or good things or both. I like having a choice and not have to be a goody goody hero all the time.Though I disliked and found it very frustrating that you could not save when doing a quest and should you fail, you have to start all the way from the beginning. That almost made me rage quit when trying to escort some spy and there was a massive amount of guards and no matter how much I tried he kept being killed as he dies in a few hits. So decided it was not worth the frustration to bother with that quest anymore.The game is rather linear and the world seems quite small. Hirelings are rather useless with bad AI.Despite the things I disliked I found the game fun and it kept me playing and wanting to see what is going to happen next. I recommend this game if you like RPG's and a interesting story and don't mind that it's linear.It's a bit too short for my liking.

												When I thought about games that stand the test of time, the first game that came to my mind was Fable- The Lost Chapters. It was one of the first games I played and I spent hours upon hours playing it. So when I bought it on steam, I was somewhat sceptic. Would it live up to my childhood nostalgia or would it ruin a fond memory?You might have already guessed the answer from the intro, and you're right - it did live up to the nostalgia. The game have a certain charm I haven't found in another game. I personally love the skill/magic/combat system and how the leveling functions. The gameplay is very accepting, yet it's challenging in some parts of the story/game. You'll have a relaxing and fun experience with it.   There is a moral ""dilemma"" in the game, do you walk righteous path of a saint or do you walk the path of evil and slaughter? I very much enjoy this dilemma. Sure, it is very simple and there has since been countless games with similar and more ""advanced"" systems implemented. Yet, I still tend to like the one in Fable more. It affects your interaction with npc's, some game mechanics, clothing, your character and parts of the story. Throughout the game, you'll have some big and some smaller choices (e.g. in the beginning of the game, you can find a fellow cheating on his wife. You can decide to tell his wife - good, or you can keep a secret and get money - evil). As this was my first review, it might lack in certain areas but bear with me. All in all, I 100% recommend this pearl. Yes, it does fall short in some aspects due to its age and it might not have the same effect on you as it had on me, but give it a chance. You will not be disappointed.			"

												This game is a quirky classic. You run through the storyline choosing between good or evil. (Either way you're still a 'hero') Of course this is an older game. The first in the series, it is rather difficult to play an evil character. (Killing bandits, beetles and other enemies that will fight you regardless of alignment give you good alignment points.) It's a game I played when I was younger and despite the flaws it will always have a special place in my heart.			"

												Fable: The Lost Chapters is a 2005 re-release of the 2004 killer app Fable, brought to you by Lionhead studios - a studio famous for this, having Molyneux as a creative director, and having Molyneux as a creative director who lies.Luckily the 2005 release places it outside of recent memory, so we can ignore all promises of real-time tree growth, multiplayer and multiple guilds, and get on with the game proper. This is not a blind review. First played this game near release, and remembered it being incredibly mediocre. How's that for a first impression? As it turns out, it was just the memory that was mediocre. ""Your health is low. Do you have any potions, or food?""  - GuildmasterBy combining all three virtues/playstyles - Strength, Skill, Will - you'll end up with a character that forms many unfinished wholes into an Ultron of tolerability. Going for a specific ""build"" is not fun, limiting yourself is not fun, the only way to really squeeze some playability out of it is to throw it into a smoothie. Abandon all delusions of sticking to a single path, you're a spellswordbowman. With that out of the way, the game has more to it than you'd initially expect. Will gives you a dozen tools for every situation, Strength keeps you in the action with little touches like rolling having i-frames and the guard-breaking flourishes that I swear trigger at random, and Skill supplements the other two with speed and money.At times, especially during endgame when you've completely broken the game to become a regular munchkin, I was having legitimate fun with the gameplay alone. Something not expected from the half-remembered aeons of strafing/kiting at a distance, or continually bouncing off an enemy's impregnable defense.But it's sloppier than a pig's feeding trough. Movement isn't remotely 1-1, there's no combos beyond mash attack, no way to play gracefully or precise at all. Enemy attacks either telegraph from a mile away, have just enough startup to seemingly knock you out of wailing on them, or in some amazing circumstances are completely messy distance attacks with no way to predict them at all, just react.Accept that you will be spamming your go-to preferred glorified macro lategame and you'll be happier.  ""Try to get your combat multiplier even higher.""  - GuildmasterWhat's there is there, but Fable has largely sold itself on character morphing. Which is okay. A bit ridiculous, you'll end up twice the size of the average character and shrivelled to a prune while the tykes at the local school still take their first lessons. There's not nearly as much character customization as you'd think - maybe 25 outfits, 10 haircuts and a handful of supplementary aspects, you'll rest easy in the knowledge that your super special Hero is going to turn out about the same as everyone else's.The only real morphing here is of your expectations, and with no way to roll back level upgrades you're probably going to end up with a stature you're unhappy with regardless.It's fundementally a silly game, which is fine except that means that any attempt to appear serious falls flat on its face. All the lore ends in abrupt handwaves with no payoff (Did you know that Jack of Blades is a primordial horror-demon, despite just being a smug trickster ingame you trip over and OHKO?), all the character art angles more towards the era's World of Warcraft domineered sensibilities instead of more traditional aesthetics - fine if you like that - and all the music is consistently great there's no dissing these tunes. ""There's a Quest Card waiting for you at the Guildhall.""  - GuildmasterUltimately what Fable is, is a surprisingly mechanically fun but otherwise shallow and cliched RPG. Much like Molyneux's hopes and dreams, it aimed for the moon and landed amongst the dirt.  A final sidenote, it'll run on just about anything but you're going to have to do some moderate legwork. Deleting codecs, adjusting administrator privileges, the like.  "

												When I first played this game, I was only 8 years old. I had it on the original xbox console and I had to be forced to put down the controller and turn it off. I'm 19 now and I can still sit at my PC and play it for hours on end and never get bored. This is one of those games that will never make me think ""I'm too old for this''. I grew up with Fable, watching my parents play it, playing it myself and now to watching my own son play it. Fable - The Lost Chapters will always be one of the greatest games of all time			"

English Version: It was given to me about a year ago and I was pretty skeptic at first, but after playing it I had to change my mind; this game is amazing.The plot is simple but nice. It tells the story of a young hero after his village, Oakvale, is raided by bandits. He's rescued by a hero, Daedalus, who leads him to the Guild of Heroes, where he meets Whisper, his roommate. After years of training, he becomes a hero and goes out on his adventure.The gameplay is varied and is mainly based on two main aspects; ''Experience'' and ''Personality''.Regarding experience we can choose, after the tutorial training, to specialize in ""Strength"", ""Skill"" and ""Will"". The first is related to health, strength and physique; we receive ""Strength"" experience points whenever we fight hand to hand, thus allowing us to improve it. The second is related to agility, precision and cunning; we will be awarded ""Skill"" experience points whenever we practice ranged combat, and as a result we will be able to improve ranged capabilities. The last is related to three different types of spells; attack (targeting the opponent), environmental (targeting surroundings, such as being able to slow or stop time) and physical (targeting ourselves, with powers such as healing spells or shields).Regarding personality there are four different factors: morality, fame, charm and scariness. Morality is linked to the choices that we make during the game, usually either good or bad. Fame is linked to the missions that we have to do: if we taking challenges, we will acquire more fame if we succeed, but we will lose money if we were to fail the challenge. The charm and scariness are related to the physical aspect that we will have in our character (tattoos, clothing, haircut) and are mostly opposites.In addition, the gameplay is full of sidequests that improve immersion in the game's universe, and allow us to enjoy fantastic locations. Besides, the possibility of betting on the missions to acquire more fame and money makes it even more fun for me.Then let's talk about the possibility of getting married to an entire city. How's that? Overall it's a nice game and I recommend it fully!Italian Version: Mi è stato regalato circa lo scorso anno ed ero abbastanza scettica inizialmente, ma dopo averlo giocato mi son dovuta ricredere; è un gioco a dir poco stupendo.La trama è semplice ma carina. Racconta la storia di un giovane eroe rimasto solo dopo l'attacco al suo villaggio, Oakvale, da parte di banditi. Viene tratto in salvo da un eroe, Dedalo, e portato alla Gilda degli Eroi, dove conoscerà Sussurro, la sua compagna di stanza. Dopo anni di allenamento, diventa un eroe e parte per la sua avventura.Il gameplay è molto vario e si basa principalmente su due aspetti principali; ''Esperienza'' e ''Personalità''.Riguardo all'esperienza possiamo scegliere, dopo l'allenamento iniziale, di specializzarci tra ''Forza'', ''Abilità'' e ''Volontà''. La prima è mirata alla salute, alla resistenza ed al fisico; ci vengono dati punti esperienza ''forza'' ogni qualvolta utilizziamo un combattimento corpo a corpo, e quindi ci migliorerà sullo stesso. La seconda è formata da agilità, precisione ed astuzia; ci verranno assegnati punti 'abilità'' ogni qualvolta usiamo il combattimento a distanza, e di conseguenza ci aiuterà nello stesso. L'ultima invece è formata da tre tipi di incantesimo; d'attacco (ovvero mirato all'avversario), ambientale (mirato invece all'ambiente, come fermare il tempo) e fisici (che è mirato a noi stessi, come incantesimi di cura o di scudo).Riguardo alla personalità invece possiamo trovare quattro aspetti: personalità, fama, fascino e spavento. La personalità è legata alle azioni che compiano nel gioco, ovvero alla classica scelta ''buono'' o ''cattivo''. La fama è legata alle missioni che portiamo a termine, scommettendoci sopra ne acquisiremo di più, ma perderemo soldi nel caso dovessimo perdere la scommessa. Il fascino e lo spavento sono legate all'aspetto fisico che faremo avere al nostro personaggio (tatuaggi, vestiario, taglio di capelli) ed uno esclude l'altro, ovviamente!Inoltre, il gameplay, è pieno di sidequest che aiutano l'esplorazione del gioco, e ci permettono di godere di ambientazioni fiabesche. Inoltre la possibilità di scommettere sopra le missioni, che siano principali o secondarie, per acquisir fama e soldi, rende tutto molto più divertente, secondo me.E poi vogliamo parlare della possibilità di sposarci un'intera città? Nel complesso è un gran bel gioco e quindi lo consiglio pienamente!			"

												This is not a proper review of the game, but in its place I will tell a story. This story will include a few spoilers, but let's be honest- the game is from 2004, the story will most likely have been spoiled for you at some point.Let us begin. There once was a boy, brought into the great Guild of Heroes at a very young age, who trained hard night and day, dedicating his life to becoming a great Hero, seeking fame and glory. Even as a child the Hero was very boastful- proud of his physical and mental prowess and always seeking recognition for his accomplishments. But then one day the Hero took a boast that would later prove to humble him; the day had come that he enter the Arena, and the prideful Hero raised himself upon the podium outside the Guild's walls, looked down into the cheering crowd below.This was, by this time, a familiar sight, for in his search for glory the Hero was not satisfied with merely completing a Quest. He would stand upon the platform and utter the most outrageous of boasts, at one time defeating an entire pack of Balverines stark naked without taking a single scratch as a personal test of his agility. His pride knew no bounds, and the Hero took upon himself the title of the divine Avatar, claiming that he would be the sword which the Gods wielded to drive back the darkness. However, this day the Hero saw an opportunity to forge a truly legendary tale within the Arena, one which could never possibly be surpassed: he would enter the Arena and slay all that came before him, be it man or beast, completely unprotected, and without a so much as a scratch to mar his rosy skin. The crowd cheering and his chest puffed with pride, the Hero set off to the Isle of Witchwood, and the Arena therein.The Hero entered the Arena to the roaring of a crowd that could only brought on by the anticipation of imminent bloodshed. A veteran of the bloodied sands had just fallen, adding yet another entry in the long list of those who had died in pursuit of glory through combat. The Hero made short work of an entire nest of Wasps, then of a clan of Hobbes, all singlehandedly. From the third round on he would be joined by a fellow Hero to defeat the beasts that were released upon him. The gate lowered and from beyond came his greatest rival, a Heroine by the name of Whisper who had looked upon him with disdain ever since they had begun their training together many years ago. However, the Hero was satisfied with this, as it would only add to his legend, and so together they set about cutting down a pack of Balverines to pieces. By this time he had set into the familiar groove of combat, and with spell and sword his foes fell before him.The Hero did not blink an eye as the remains of those who had died on the sands of the Arena tore themselves from the blood soaked earth and rose to reclaim their glory in death. After dispatching the Undead, a clan of Bandits, once feared throughout all of Albion and slated for execution within the Arena several years ago were next. Methodically he dodged their blows and cut them down one by one, Whisper his constant companion this a whirlwind of blood and blade. By this point it had become apparent that group tactics were no match for the Heroes' skill, and so the master of the Arena swiftly changed tactics and introduced a matched pair of trolls to the audience. The Heroes had already faced Trolls before, so as they saw the rumbling of the earth and the giant hands of stone emerge from the sod they knew what to expect. Cool and calm, they circled their prey, waiting for the opportune moment to strike and avoiding the attacks of the other troll. First a pair of Earth Trolls fell beneath their blades, then the even tougher Rock Trolls, chipped at repeatedly by their hit and run attacks.With the defeat of the Trolls the Heroes stood tall, knowing they could take on anything. With the end near, the question of who the gold would go to should they win, as the Arena can only have one Champion,  arose, but this thought was quickly purged from minds as a massive creature the likes of which they had never seen before clawed its way out of the sands, stinger raised and claws snapping. The beast, a gigantic scorpion, was called Arachanox, and many a Champion candidate had fallen before her, their aspirations crushed along with their bodies under its massive stinger. This threat was novel, something the Heroes had never faced before, and it took a great amount of teamwork to learn its strengths and weaknesses. Carefully, they paced around it, dodging out of the way and poking at is when they could. The Hero had managed to maintain his boast of being untouched up until this point, as familiar foes had patterns which he could exploit. But in the face of the unknown his abilities remained sharp, but even the most skilled warrior eventually makes a mistake. Learning the patterns of the great beast the Hero hacked at it with his greatsword when it was stunned, retreating from the slashing of its pincers when it freed itself. They repeated this, but the long hours of combat had begun to wear on them, and the inevitable happened: the Hero made a mistake. Thinking the beast dead after an especially powerful blow, he raised his sword to the sky in celebration, to the delight of the crowd. But Arachanox was not yet defeated, and in its death throes it struck the Hero from behind, putting an end to his long line of successful boasts. Angered by the ruin of the legend he was trying to forge, he turned and struck it down, making sure it was dead, then turned to the cheering crowd.Above them appeared none other than the legendary Jack of Blades to commend them for their valour. However, with his praise came a final, deadly, proposition: one final round. There could only be one Champion of the Arena, Unable to refuse this challenge or lose all they had just fought for, Whisper turned to the Hero and said that she could not kill him, not after all that they had been through in the Arena. The Hero then recalled his earlier boasting, declaring that he would cut down all he faced on the sands. He was a good man at heart, but he realized that his hubris had led him to this situation. Whisper's voice broke him from his thoughts, declaring that they should at the very least put on a good show. And so they crossed blades, once rivals, then allies, and now as reluctant foes on the field of battle. Whisper's skill proved to be no match for that of the Hero in the end, and as she kneeled in the sands, beaten, the Hero had a decision to make: would he sacrifice this woman who had caused him so much anger and betray the bond forged between them in battle to salvage at least some semblance of the legend he had hoped to create? As he looked down at her, he realized that he could not take the final blow and sheathed his blade, turning from the jeers of the disappointed crowd and the pleading eyes of Whisper to walk silently through the gates. With this he took an oath to never boast again, and became a true Champion of Righteousness, rather than a slave to the battlefield, going on to forge a legacy befitting the title of Avatar.			"

												This is the real deal.  I chose Fable - The Lost Chapters over Fable Anniversary simply because this is the game I remember playing so many years ago on the original Xbox.  This has the classic look and gameplay that I crave, regardless of the polish on Anniversary.  I just bought this today for $9.99 on Steam and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  It's not a big deal but I do wish it was controller compatible (I play most of my pc games with a PS4 Dualshock controller) but the WASD control type is fine and it's nice to set hotkeys to say, additional buttons on your mouse.  If you loved the original Fable, adorably dated graphics & all, this game is for you!  If you are new to Fable and somewhat archaic visuals from 2 generations ago annoy you, or you absolutely must use a controller, you might feel more comfortable with Anniversary.  Either way it's a great story & a lot of fun...sooo excited to own it again.Runs on Windows 10, I didn't need to adjust compatibility.			"

												Fable!It has been blown out how good this game is way before it came out and... well, than it came out.Besides the fact that there have been higher hopes for the game and later than everyone was a little upset with what came out (that happened before and it will again), this game is nice. You are playing in an RPG world that seems to be made for children 12+ and it is fun to see people react to the way you are playing the game.I played that game a long time ago and than bought it again without knowing about it's relaunch in HD, so it seems that i don't know this game by hours spend ingame, but I can assure you: I am an dragon-slayer!If you are searching for an not to hard game for RPG beginners, you might wanna take an closer look on this one.8/10 If Fable, then Lost Chapters			"

												This game is fun. It really is.When you play as an evil character, I found the constant screaming hilarious (for some reason it did not get old for me).The same goes for the cheering when good.Despite some of the things I list below the gameplay and story here are great.Some things I hated about the game included:-How stupid the AI is.-I hate the idea of having multiple spouses (and the system for this is so dumb).-Some bugs in the game that were annoying (particularly when a certain troll in front of a certain door doesn´t appear).-The hero save idea is horrible, especially early on.-Why does the guild let people choose good or evil? What kind of guild is that...-Some of the concepts in the game, namely what I just listed, are just incredibly illogical.Simply put, there is a lot to the game I found illogical and mind blowing in that respect, but the gameplay is just too good for me to really have cared. Really it is a good game.			"

												this game is a artpeice, you start off as a child, condemned to suffer at the hands of jack of blades. you Join a guild then train. youll find yourself gaining fame and so much applause that youll have to Run to avoid their cheers. your cautious fighting will be toned to bloodlustt rage at end game. youll also be faced with morality choices. this game works wonderful, i was surprised how well it ran. easy to play on pc with keyboard and mouse. I usually have difficulty playing 3d games due to fps being low. but this one worked great. Good overall download. No compliants in quality. i hope they releash fable 2 and 3 for steam.			"

												Compared to its sequels, this game is completely fantastic. Fable is such a great game with a great story. Adding to that, each quest you venture through comes with different outcomes, which adds a lot to the re-playability of the entire game. The game is a great RPG for its time and, like I stated before, beats out it's newer, (and more flawed) sequels. I recommend this game for anyone who can spend hours into a story and trying to make the best character.			"

												One of the greatest games ever made.Combat targeting is a bit annoying with mouse + keyboard (no controller support) but it gets easier to deal with the longer you play. The rest of the controls are good.Graphics are still good for their age (in my opinion), the comical art style helps it age well. The level design is memorable and the music is amazing. The characters are wonderfully styled, characters all have unique proportions like big hands and feet compared to the rest of their body. Guards have their caps pulled down over their eyes for a stern look, traders wear goofy tall hats, Thunder is a giant warrior.It's great fun watching your own character change as you progress through the game. You become older, more battle hardened, taller and more buff. You have full control over how good or evil your character is and your actions/appearance affect how the world views you. Later quests allow you to make some pretty major moral choices which is nice.The XP and levelling system is simple which is nice. It's quick and easy to level your character based on your playstyle, you don't have to dedicate yourself to one thing. You've got melee weapons, bows, and spells and you can use them all however you like.This is definitely a game everyone should play at least once. Doesn't matter how old it is, it's a classic now. There's plenty to do in the game for a long single playthrough but it also has replayability if you want to try being the opposite of good/bad or inbetween.The beginning of Fable where the Hero starts in Oakvale followed by training at the Guild before being released into Albion will always be one of my favorite gaming moments.

												Fable - The Lost Chapters may lack the fancier graphics of the Anniversary Edition but is far more stable. The save system hasn't been updated in this classic so the silver key exploit is still possible. Has less options than the other two main entries in the series and yet this was the Fable game I fell in love with and keep coming back to. I felt like a kid with my first computer all over again, googling the best way to open Demon Doors and the best way to sacrifice followers for the most amount of evil alignment points etc. Only real complaint is that you can't change ur gender but whatevergood game, holds up pretty well. imo the best entry in the series (and the only one available on Steam)			"

												(Note: My opinion of this game may be biased, since I grew up with it. Nonetheless, I feel the need to represent this game as truthfully and realisticly as possible.)First of all, I played the original Fable on Xbox, so when I saw Lost Chapters on PC, my mind was blown. Lost Chapters is, in a sense, a ""DLC"" of the original Fable game, in that it adds more content, characters, events, and items. Unfortunately, most of these characters and items won't show up until you complete the first phase of the game.The graphics in this game are admittedly not the greatest. Textures are blurry, people look blocky and pasty, and the landscape turns into this odd, melty blob when you look past mountains and town edges. The characters in this game have a certain charm about them, every one is diverse and unique. From stubborn warriors like Thunder and mysterious people like Briar Rose around every corner, you'll never be short on enemies and friends to make-- by choice, of course. Voice acting quality isn't the best, but usually the actors know what they're doing and can get a point across to you.Combat is... alright, I suppose. If you don't mind taking out the time to redefine your keys in the menu, there's no real problem with it. Some weapons swing oddly, like heavy weapons that FEEL awkward when you use them for the first time, and crossbows that don't fire when you expect them to: zooming in is especially awkward. Boss fights aren't hard, if you just observe and manipulate their patterns, and most minor enemies will run at you, wait a second, and attack, giving you time to fight.And, finally, your character is what you make him into. The game uses the term ""Hero"" loosely; your character resembles your actions and personality, how you interact with and change the world around you. Those who help people in need and stop bandits and minions get halos and beams of light, while those who slay innocent people and side with thieves and criminals grow horns and walk with flames on their feet.In conclusion, this game is great. It's not short on plot, characters, or choices for you to make. If you have spare time, grab this game, and you won't want to put it down.9/10			"

												This game is The Hero's Journey: The Game.The quests can get repetitive but the main story is good pulpy stuff. If you grew up watching Hercules, Xena, and/or Highlander, Excalibur, Dragonheart, you'll love it. The gameplay isn't anything extraordinary but it can be fun thwacking hordes of bandits with your BFS spamming Enflame and Multi-Strike. The stealth is unnecessary. Fishing can be tedious, and escort quests suck but all you need is to make them wait, clear out enemies, follow. Magic is fun.What can you do? You can slaughter a village and buy up all the vacated buildings, or you can lead the inhabitants out to a different zone and buy their property if mass murder isn't your thing. You can collect silver keys, treasure clues, and goofy outfits. You can change your PC's hair, tattoos, and clothes. You can grow horns if you go full evil-and you get a halo for being fully good. You can sacrifice innocents for a sick bow, you can trade goods between shops for a limited profit, join Fight Club, show off trophies, shoplift, go fishing, figure out what the hell the demon doors want, and walk around in your Union Jack undies.It's ludicrously easy to gain EXP once you fully understand how the combat multiplier works in conjunction to Physical Shield and how much EXP carrots, red meat, fish, and combat-oriented actions pay out. Hint: eat 150 red meats (3xp) with a x20 multiplier to equal 9000 Physique XP. I wish they hadn't changed Jack of Blades' voice for The Lost Chapters, the original was more menacing. It was like changing Frieza's voice in DBZ Kai. Sure it makes more sense but it's not as cool. Five stars.			"

												My childhood in a nutshell. You can finally be the naked, ugly-looking chicken kicker your parents have always wanted you to be.On a more serious note, Fable is one of those games that you can replay over and over again without getting too bored of it. The beautiful world and scenery will definitely tickle your fancy and make you want to revisit the world of Albion multiple times.			"

												In my opinion Fable TLC is the only Fable game worth playing. Fable TLC is a quirky humerous game that unlike its successors doesn't feel to streamlined. Fable TLC is possibly the only game were the morality system complements gameplay and doesn't feel so much like a tacky add on, plus seeing your characters appearance reflect these changes is pretty cool.However Fable isnt perfect the game isnt particularly challenging and there is no way to change the difficulty. Alot of the choices that make the game feel so open and free are completely nonsensical for example getting married.Good game but it couldn't live up to the hype that surrounded it pre-release.			"

												A very entertaining single player, guided story RPG. There isn't a lot to say for the choices you make having much of an effect on the world around you. People like you different, your hair and eyes look different, and you're restricted from one or two spells; the only decisions that really matters are at the very end of the base game, and the expansion; which basically dictate one or two cinematics; in the expansion, you have three pairs of people you can kill one person each from, that's about it. The narrative however is quite good, and it appeals to the nature of a story that could quite go down as legend. You become a great hero in the span of years, and work to resolve your fate. The legendary items and gear make it feel more like an RPG, and the atmosphere is quite good. The only issue is, while great music, the lack of diversity in the music tracks makes some of the scenes rather... anticlimactic. When you're approaching the gates to armageddon basically, and the happy town music is playing.End result, for $10, and those qualities ascribed?Definitely a passing experience. Not excellent, but it's rather good.			"

												This is THE GAME.On a personal note, I've never enjoyed any game as much as this one.The story... is facinating and makes you want to pursue it all the way to the end without boring you even for a minute. Most quests also give you several choices during them which in turn make your status more evil or more good while twisting the means and/or the end result of quests.Character customization... is well done. You can add tatoos, change your hairstyle, wear different clothes, have battle scars, get older... and all these together decide how NPCs see you and react upon your arrival. You can also get married which usually requires your character to be more attractive and renown.Combat system... your combat skills don't advance along those lame ""skill trees"" you often see in RPG games. In Fable you can choose everything yourself. If you want to max out all possible skills, go on. If you want to specialize as a combat mage, archer or whatever, you can do it. Also your status will show your combat class depending on which skills you invested your experience into, and there are a lot of classes. Scout, rogue, spellwarrior, witch hunter, fighter, warrior. Just to name a few of them. It's even possible to choose never to train your skills and stay as an ""apprentice"" all the way to the end game, though this being an expert level challenge.As an action RPG, the game allows you to fully decide how you move, use skills and take on enemy attacks during combat. Changing from spell to another, or from bow to your sword is very simple and doesn't require you to memorize dozens of different buttons for different commands. On a personal note, I've never encountered a combat system anywhere near as fun, exciting yet not too complicated as this one.Well over 20 hours to reach end game unless you rush only the main storyline quests without completing a single side quest along the way, messing with marriages or looking for some of the several legendary weapons hidden throughout the lands of Albion.On a last note. I recommend this over the Anniversary version. Having played both, honestly all I see are a few tweaks to graphics which mainly just make your own character look ugly as hell.			"

And to top it all off they are actually making a third version of the game! Fable Anneversarry! <-(Thats spelled wrong get over it!)Other then that the gameplay is incredible. Graphics may not be as good as other games but if you are like me and play older games you will not even glance at that. Enemies are real tough to beat even if you are max level. Even after you beat the story line you still get to continue! Buying this comes with a DLC pack that continues the adventure even more!Overall it is the best game/series of games I have ever seen. Fbles 2 and 3 are what I filled my summer years with when I got really bored. I have clocked over 50 hours on each of those games but this one will recieve more!Buy it before it is to late!20/10			"

Fable: The Lost Chapters is an expansion, continuing where Fable left off. The expansion includes new land masses, new items, and new characters, as well as re-introducing characters from the earlier stages of the game. Fable: The Lost Chapters includes the original game, so there is no need to purchase Fable as a standalone. Fable Anniversary was released in the recent past, and is a revamp of everything including The Lost Chapters. Overall rating for Fable: The Lost Chapters; 9.5/10			"

												This is my favorite game and has been since I was 11 or so. This version is much much better than the Fable Anniversary, which I purchased for the bells and whistles... This one was by far a better choice, so I'd say save your money. Most people are saying don't buy II & III, I mean, they went really wide with both games and the ending of II frankly made me really angry. I am a die-hard fan of the series itself though and I don't want to play the same game over and over so I appreciate it. Lost Chapters is still the same old loveable Fable where you can decapitate traders and pelvic thrust at unsuspecting ladies, at a $20 difference in price.			"

												The first game from Fable Franchise.Fable(or Fable the Lost Chapters) is a great RPG, especially if we consider it's launch date.Some features of this game are:+ A different level up system, you can only upgrade and get skills based on your play style, because doesn't make much sense play as a warrior and be able to upgrade your Mana or unlock some kind of ""Meteor Storm"".+ A karma system that gradually affects your appearance, it's pretty cool, if i can say so.+ An interesting customization system for it's time, today it must be a ""little"" outdated.+ A good variety of weapons and armor sets, even including some dresses, yes, you're male, but who cares? You'll look fabulous!+ Aging system, you'll get older, only up to 65, otherwise you would die from aging before you could finish the game.- The choices you make doesn't seems to make a big difference, if you kill an ""important"" NPC, it will never appears again, if you don't, it will never appears anyways.- Sometimes being bad is hard, since killing some of the most common enemies is considered a good deed.- Fable's economic system is faulty and as the way it works, it can be easily exploited.- Only you age up, you start as a kid, ends with 65, but almost everybody is still the same.- It's hard to use multiple skills, you can only use two at a time and then switch to other pair of skills, it's up to you, to organize and manage this.

												Fable was definitely one of my favorite games on the original XBox.  The PC version looks great and has the same excellent gameplay but it is completely bogged down by the horrible mouse/keyboard layout.  The flow of action is often slowed down by the constant ""which key am I supposed to be hitting"" situation that often pops up.  It can be remedied a bit by downloading a decent gamepad program to map your keyboard but it is still a pain.  Sometimes you feel like you are going to have to hit a key with your nose or something since you are running out of fingers.  I still highly recommend this game however.  It is a classic.			"

Although it has your simple choices of good or evil; they're seemingly endless weapons, armor, and misc items to collect. The side quests are somewhat fetch quests but the main story is what makes this game great. What gets me about this game is the small things. For example: the npc's, tattoos, hairstyles, aging, and just the way you look the more evil/good you do. It was a game I had to play more than once just because I wanted to see what happened. Overall it is a great rpg, adventure. The ""choice"" is yours to buy it or not...Ya see what I did there?			"

												One of the best action RPG's around. I recommend this over Anniversary, the only thing changed is the art style and controller support, which I prefer the old graphics and I use a M+K perfectly fine so I don't see the need for a gamepad.  Played it countless times on the Original XBOX as a young boy so my Steam hours are not indicative to my hours in the game. I've probably done hundreds of playthroughs that's totalled up to hundreds of hours since I discovered it. Even though it's a decade old it still holds up. Magic is fun, melee combat is alright, as is the ranged. Upside to those two is that you can decapitate your foes and kick their heads around like soccer balls, though, so there's that. Humor is hit or miss a lot of times, but if you like Monty Python you'll probably like this. Some of the funniest scenes in the game come from the Book Collection quest, from when you scream ""SH!T"" at a classroom of children, to when you make a little kid perform a play about a vengeful cuckhold inn keeper. The quests are fun, and you can add challenges to them by boasting if you feel they're too easy. Story is a tried and true fantasy, ""Only You Can Prevent Evil"" trope with a flavor of ""But Evil Can Be Cool Too"" thrown in. Some quests in the game are strictly good or evil so there's room to roleplay there. It's usually really obvious as to what's what, too. Some of my fondest memories of RPG's are from the Fable series, and this game will always manage to keep  me interested even after years and years of knowing every inch of it. A sold 8/10 at least.  Maybe one day Fable 2 will be ported to PC and I can relive that again as well. It's nearly as good as its predecessor.			"

												This game along with Fable 2 are old games for their time now, but classics.I'd highly reccomend both these games (however, Fable 2 can only be played on a xbox 360 and xbox one as they didnt release a pc port).Set aside the older looking graphics and youll find these games to be ver enjoyable.  Played them back when I was a kid and came back to playing both of them recently and forgot how much fun they were.Both these games are classic hack and slash rpgs where you play as heroes choosing either good or evil on your journey, which each decision you make deciding a different outcome to the storyline.All the citizens react to your repuation whether youre well known or barely known, and also react depending on how good or evil you are.You can also marry citizens in both games, but can buy out real estate and own many homes/properties as well.  (more so in fable 2 but can still own a few in fable).  You can also have kids and buy out all of albion in fable 2 as well (which i thought was pretty cool), but not it fable.			"

												Fable is one of those classically good games with very nice production value. It's primarily an action RPG where you play as an epic hero as you quest through the lands. The game is full of humor and riddled with sidequests. But bare no bones about it, Fable is not a smart game by any stretch of the imagination. It's an action game first and an RPG second, and if you're determined enough you can beat the game without buying any equipment or levelling up your character in any way, I know this first hand.So don't go into this expecting a game with the intelligence of Baldur's Gate, or any of Molyneux's other games, because it's not. Thankfully, the PC port is pretty solid and it features a completely extended part of the game after the original's ending.Overall it's worth the 10$ on Steam and keeps your attention, but it's not anything to break an appointment over.

But i loved this game so much and was one of the first video game releases i looked foward to along with halo 1. The only problem i had with the fable series is fable 1 was amazing then fable 2 got really simplified removing spells and the leveling system from the first game then fable 3 tried to make even less spells and gameplay but added the combination system and hero weapons it all just changed too much of what i loved from the original as a kid. But Fable 1 has stood the test of time and still has me coming back to it especially since tlc added a lot of new stuff ive never experienced growing up with the game.i would recommend playing this, but if you like fable you may be like me and not like 2 as much and hate 3 and give up on lionhead for any future fable titles.

												An xbox classic. In retrospect, Fable is not the great game I remember, but a solid game nevertheless. Fable is an action RPG surrounding what starts out appearing nothing but a simple boy who had lost his family and his village, but the plot thickens instensely throughout the game to become much more.Fable was based around the idea of ""for every choice, a consequence"", but don't let that motto fool you. There isn't a whole lot of choice besides ""what's your combat preference"" and ""good or evil"", but the quests, combat, and loot selection are unique enough to still feel fun. I've played enough of Fable to see through it (I have way more hours on xbox than here), but if you haven't picked it up yet and are considering it, $10 is more than fair for your time. I will say though, do purchase *this* version and *not* the anniversary edition; as much I would like to love the anniversary edition, the clunky GUI and un-updated animations make the game more of a crappy retelling than a welcomed overhaul. Fable TLC is still graphically fidelic to be appealing today as it was when it released.Overall, if you like action RPGs, visit the world of Albion is it's oldest (and arguably, best) incarnation of the series.

												I remember playing the original Fable on the XBOX and loved it. Back then, I was kind of disappointed that the game ended after beating Jack of Blades the first time and the game ended if you threw the sword in or not. Imagine my excitement when I heard XBOX was releasing Fable The Lost Chapters with new content? I was ecstatic. Played it and still loved it. Although I never could get all of the dolls.Now that the game is on the PC, it's still good. There's lots to do. You can rent out houses, you can slaughter (and own) most of the world, if you wish to be evil. Or you can be good and loved by the world. No matter which path you choose, I guarantee you'll love his game.			"

												The fable games have a truly unique feel to them, with a classic British Monty python esque sense of humour, and a generally laid back chill, cosy, warm, charming..atmosphere that I'm struggling to describe concisely. Fable: The lost chapters in my opinion is the best game of the series, a series which has sadly ended.The gameplay and controls are pleasingly simple, its not a game that will challenge your skill directly, but with things like the combat multiplier, quest boasting and mini-games allow you to test your skill and reap large rewards.You have various skills and abilities to unlock, and truly unique weapons, and armours to find in the world, each with a backstory. The world itself isn't open like Skyrim, its split into zones, all of which have their own feel and are well designed in that they feel just large enough to lose yourself in, and find new areas in places you thought you had explored.The story itself is like the gameplay simple, but in a good way. It is essentially a parody of your typical RPG tropes countering the typical ""your parents were killed by bandits, and you are now the chosen one"" origin story, with its distinct surreal humour, effectively delivered through amazing and memorable voice acting.The graphics are dated, but yet due to Fables art style still somehow seem just as relevant today as they did back when it came out. If however you do want a graphical improvement, you can get Fable: anniversary, however that is more expensive.Further info:-Combat multiplier is a combo that builds during combat, the less you're hit the higher it gets and the more XP you get.-Quest boasting is what it says on the tin, you pick up a quest and make a boast, for example you will do the quest naked etc, you gain extra gold and XP.

												I grew up playing this game in my early to mid-teens. Finally after 7 or so years I could actually sit down one week and take the time to beat the game and still do every single quest. Great on Xbox, Great on PC. I love the game, dramatic, creepy at times, but has its harmonious moments. Importantly its very enjoyable and fun and that is what really matters. It's an RPG, somewhat medieval with fantasy such as magic (Will) and demons/gods, powers, etc. You can be good, evil, or neutral, you always have a choice if almost every action taken in the game. I have much more to say, but I'd be sitting here typing for hours. GREAT GAME! RECOMMEND TO BUY BEFORE YOU DIE!			"

It is also much better than the other Fable games by far. The graphics are beautiful and i don't know why they changed them in the Anniversary version. Words cannot describe how amazing this game is. The gameplay and story are original and stupendus. Now if you still haven't bought this game yet, you will miss out on a wonderful experience. This is cheaper than the anniversary version and looks much better in my opinion. I say get this instead.Has many comedic points that add wonderfully to the game.The graphics are really good considering how old the game is. The story is very immersive and really keeps you hooked all the way through the game.Just get it.			"

												Take this with review a grain of salt because the only other video game I ever finished was Orcarina of Time back when I was a kid but I really loved this game. I missed out on the whole Fable thing back when it first came out but I'd always heard really good things about it so when I was looking for something to play on steam and saw it, I decided to give it a shot.I really enjoyed it. It took me about 31hrs according to the statistics and I'm surprised it was only that long because I spent a lot of time just wandering around in the game, messing with charactersd, getting married, and things like that.  And I'm definitely going to play through it again and this time try to make different moral decisions. It's really a good game with a lot of possibilities and definitely worth more than they're charging for it.			"

												Possibly one of the best games ever even to this day. It is a definite classic. While you can get tthe supposedly refined Fable Anniversary for close to $40, why do that when you can play the original for only ten. The use of choices effecting the story and how you look/how people treat you is very creative. It's nice that you have more of a choice in the game, and that you are not just following a one way only formula. I've had many fun experiences in this game, like massacaring a town and buying and renting out all of the houses, and then the new inhabitants end up worshiping me in a few days. In the end, this game is awesome. 10/10			"

												Many of you know me as Sinclair on steam, but closer friends & others know me as ""That one kid that is crazy about writing dumb♥♥♥♥♥fictional stories"".Let me tell you why.The first time I ever played this game was when I was 8 years old, It was my birthday and I've gotten a xbox classic from my parents. With the Console I obtained two free games, one of them was halo and the other one was this one.I hated the idea of halo (I was 8 ok) So I started playing Fable. It was the main reason why I grew up as a writer and I thank my creativity from this game.This game means a lot to me, not only because it was the one that got me into writing and videogames, but also because I've basically been playing it since today. I take breaks, of course, I finish playing it then i take a 2 year break and focus on other things, but its a great game to come back to. I honestly never grow tired of it.The OST is beautiful and fits the entire theme. You can be whoever you want to be in the game and the best thing is that you can kick a ♥♥♥♥ing chicken.It's a typical old school rpg game, and one of the best back then if you ask me. The writing and lore are absolutely stunning, the npc's are great and have a lot of backstory and the enemies are cool.You get a lot of choice within this game, something i've been missing from other fable games. Beside that, exploring is so much fun in this game. There is always something to do, and you always have quests. The main quest NEVER gets boring for me.The graphics are OK for its time, really, Beside that, I've heard they made a HD version of it too.I may be speaking out of nostalgia and love, but i honestly want everyone who likes old school RPG's to try this out. It has a typical ""Epic"" Hero theme and its just loveable. You get this feeling that you've been sucked into the game because of the story and end up playing it at 3 AM.9/10 !			"

												Fable and I go way back. Back to the days of the original XBox. When Fable originally came out, I remember not knowing what it was all about exept for the little bit of hype overheard at Gamestop. And while the game may not have lived up to the biblical proportions of hype this game apparently recieved, it certainly resonated with me. Fable was one of the first games I remember playing for long, multiple hour sessions. This game had transended the medium and reached out of the television and captivated my attention in such a way that my free time was forfeit to it's greatness. That being said, it doesn't hold up so well. A lot of what made this game unique has been incorporated into games that followed it and has since been improved upon. Not to say there's nothing here to enjoy. Fable is a great action RPG with a great story, fun character progression and fun combat.			"

												If you have never had the chance to pick up a copy of Fable - TLC, then you simply need to. Even today it offers plenty of fun with an excellent story line and combat which, while simple, doesnt seem to boring. Steam usually keeps this game a super low price, and given that it'll take you a fair amount of hours for full completion, it is certainly worth it. This game is to PCs as Zelda OOT is to N64.Originally: 9.5/10If released today: 7.5/10 for graphics and outdated combat system			"

												I remember back to a time when i was but a youngun when my family first got an xbox. I was so excited and i asked my mom to get a game for me, That game was fable. i was so excited that i was reading the instruction manual in rite-aid before i even got home. and when i turned it on, my veiws on gaming changed forever.It was a game of nothing i had ever played befor it was beautiful, artistic, and it was the best thing i could have hoped for in a game. I played for days on end without stopping, even going on the internet to find all the secrets so that the game didn't have to stop. But when it was over, and i killed jack at the end. There was nothing to be said but. ""Thank you for your game Lionhead studios."" -DR. Brian Hughes ~esq			"

												When I was young, back in the days of the Xbox Classic, I played this game almost non-stop. There was something about it that was just so incredible. On top of the beautiful graphics and hilarious dialogue, there was something else. It was charming and clever. Now, on the computer, I can improve the graphics even further and even today, the game still impresses me. Fable is by far my favorite game of all time. I could not recommend any other game more than this one.			"

Back then i really didnt get the whole feel of the game but now as i play it, i am flooded with memories and pure feeling as if i am part of the storyline. This game is a great buy even if you arent  familiar with the series. Itll keep you entertained for hours, it has a great storyline that gets you lost in it, epic music when walking around or killing bandits, and the graphics really arent that bad as i remember.btw this is my first review so sorry if its kinda everywhere.

												If you enjoy having a saying on what will happen and not just being the blind guy who receives orders and has to deal with the consequences without having a choice, this game is for you. To put it simply: this game is awesome.When I watched the trailer I was like ""Meh. Might aswell read the reviews."" and the reviews made me wonder ""If it's such a good game, why does the trailer suck?"". So I decided to watch some gameplay. The best advice I can give you is: Watch the gameplay of the first mission. By then you'll problably know wether you'll like it or not.As for me? I loved this game. I've spent too many months playing FPS games and this game made me remember why I love RPGs so much.At this current time I finished the game as a good guy, and I have 26 hours of playing it. I haven't even gotten into the assassin aspect of the game, the thieving and all those stuff which cause you to be evil. I've still got to play the evil side of the coin and see what kind of stuff will happen differently. Also, there is much I haven't done yet, side quests and things of the sort.Also, the combat is awesome. While you might choose to be the overpowered dude who beats everyone up, you also can choose to play not to your fullest power, but actually use one or two magics at a time. If you play the overpowered dude, combat gets boring too quickly, since no foe will stand up to your power. But if you decide to give your opponents a fair fight, the combat is really interesting. The enemies don't have much power by themselves, but they certainly beat you in numbers and I found myself dying a few times. But don't worry about it, the game is really fair and it gives you a nice ammount of revives with the ability of you being able to buy more revives really cheap once you get to the mid point of the game (before that they're there, but they aren't that cheap in comparison to the gold you have).To sum up: This is a must-have. If it is in sale, you should buy it ASAP. If it's not, you should take a look at the cost and see if it's worth it. But even at it's full price, in my opinion it's worth it.			"

												Why buy Fable Anniversary for 35$ when you can get Fable The Lost Chapters with more of a story AND its cheaper? To be honest it doesnt matter about graphics or just the name to be Anniversary, its about gameplay and the extention of the story... Please note if you are deciding between Fable Anniversary and Fable TLC then think again if you are looking more at gameplay and a cheaper price... So Fable TLC is a must have and I must admit it has been one of my favorite games since it first came out for the Xbox (the very first one).			"

												Fable is a divisive game for me; where as its soundtrack, its art style and its character development system is incredible, its far too linear for its own good at times. it's essentially Oblivion Lite, which is both to its credit and detriment			"

												Game came out 10 years ago. Never got to touch it till now. With an HD retouch, the game has managed to exceed my expectations and has definitely shown it can hold up after a decade. The story is presented in a nice, even pace without dumping a bunch of lore on you all at once, and the core gameplay works beatifully. Needless to say, this one's a time-sinker for sure.			"

												First off, this might sound a bit biased. That's because it absolutely is.I grew up playing this game on my old Xbox. My mom would tell me ""[redacted], you can play this game, but only if you're a good guy"". I would run around, only killing evil things, eventually becoming a shining beacon of happiness and hope throughout Albion.Then I turned 10. Things got a bit crazy. May or may not have ""accidently"" slaughtered a couple villages and grew a set of horns.Anyway.That was in the past.I hadn't played this game in at least 7 years (which is crazy to think about) and for some reason, never checked on Steam for it. When I saw it at the Summer Sale, I froze. Oh my god. It's my game. I picked it up without thinking about it, and am 100% happy with my decision.The game is great. The voice acting is horrible. The faces and lip movements are really bad. The Guildmaster is annoying as hell. But the game is a rare gem from the past that I don't think anyone should miss playing.This is the Lost Chapters. It adds much, much more to the base game. It no longer ends when you beat the main villain the first time. Instead, you find yourself with another HALF A GAME to go. More weapons, more enemies, more armor, more quests, and more fun.It also runs really, really well on my laptop. I still haven't felt it get hot, even after a 5-hour gaming session. Camera is a bit wonky, and I had to rebind a few keys (who would want to block with the middle mouse?). Once I got used to it, I've done very well with it.One thing I love about this game, is that it can give you a sense of being overpowered, but only if you play it well. If you mess up, you can easily be overwhelmed by enemies and lose half your health. Play it right, and the only damage you'll take is from a few stray crossbow bolts. If you like rpg games, this game is one of the best out there, even today. I highly, highly, highly recommend getting it and trying it out. After you endure the first hour or so of not-so-great ""gameplay"", you'll come to love this game as much as I do.Well, not as much.Not nearly. "

												When it comes down to it, there are games from the past that are totally not worth. However, since this game, Fable, was the first and the best in the series, I would have to recommend those to play this game. Whether you enjoyed it years ago on the orginal xbox or computer or not, this game is a beautiful, addicting, single-player game. It wont take up too much of your time, you'll enjoy the story, and most of all, you can ♥♥♥♥ with people so hard. In my first play-through, I chose the path of light and justice. The game was amazing. Then I realized that being an evil mother ♥♥♥♥er makes this game about 10 times better. In most games, I have a hard time being evil; I just feel bad for these NPCs and ♥♥♥♥ing with their ""lives"". Then I grew some god damn balls and chose to ♥♥♥♥ with everything these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s hold dear. It's really easy to be evil if your real-life morals don't come into play. And one of the best parts is that in the beginning, when you're a child, you can't get in trouble for evil deeds. You can be a ♥♥♥♥ing bully and mess with everyone, beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the random kid who wants his teddy bear back, and still be back in time to give your younger sister her present.Just ♥♥♥♥ing drink or get stoned, and play this game for a night or two. It's totally commander Warf.			"

												Fable: The Lost Chapters builds upon the original best-selling Fable with loads of new content including new regions, quests and enhanced story elements that further enhance the mystical world of Albion. Fable: The Lost Chapters gives players the chance to fight new monsters, use epic spells to obliterate huge numbers of enemies, don new armor, wield additional weapons and interact with friends and foes using amazing new expressions.In this role-playing adventure game from Lionhead Studios, every action determines a character’s skills, appearance and morality. A character’s life story is created from childhood through adulthood and on to old age. As additional story and side quests await, so too does the path of righteousness, as well as the life of evil. With every choice, a character transforms into a reflection of his actions and decisions.			"

												The game was first released on the original Xbox 10 years ago. Despite its age, the game holds up pretty well by today's standards. You can play as Evil or Good by making moral choices. The combat hasn't aged too well, but the combo system is still very fun. The game is mostly linear; however in-between main quests, you can choose to do side quests, explore around for treasures, or buy a house and marry someone. Visually colorful with a unique art direction. Musics are great and memorable. The story is simple and straightforward, but there is a lot of lore if you care to read the books and pay attention to what NPCs say. Overall a good RPG. It's humorous world, fun combo system, and exploration will give you a good 20 hours of Fable.			"

												This is one of the best RPGs that I have played to date.The medieval setting is somewhat accurate.The combat system proves itself quite advanced for its age. The quests are very different from eachother and they're engaging, both gameplay and lore wise. The world has variety and it's well planned out. The soundtrack is good and soothing. The karma system lets you choose whether you're the good guy or if you can't resist and give in the devil's teasings and end up killing and sacrificing people for your own sake. The voice is acting is probably the best in every game I have ever played, it's worth checking out just for the amazing voice acting, also hilarious at some points.			"

												Have not played this game in many years and as nostalgia set in I decided to revist this old gem ... As the story began I found myself loosing track of reality as I became lost in this truly imaginative story and unique game experince. This is a time classic game where the graphics aged well and the game play still within reach of the modern gamer. It is one of the all time best single player RPG games and story lines for that matter. This game allows for your choices to affect the storys outcome, wether you plan to be the hero of Albion or its dark end the choice is yours... and if your like me you'll play this one over and over always seeing new things and reliving this great adventure.

												As of having over 200+ Hours on the original released on the xbox, I have a deep love for this great rpg, set in one of the best fantasy worlds known as albion, which is widely known and loved my many. Because of certain circumstances I haven't had the chance to play lost chapters. But last chrismas I saw it on sale and being a fable nutcase I just had to get it. With the visuals overly improved due to more computing power from home pc's, I finally got to emerse myself in this amazing world once more, with new quests and other features that the original fable did not possess. Lost chapters how ever let me 1 or half a night to complete even though you could play it for hours on end, and not get bored with its charms. If you're one for this genre of game then I recommend it you, Because I know this game will ensnare and capture you're heart within minutes. For being released around 2005'ish it still competes with over titles as one of the best RPgs of its time. But the choice is yours. For will you become the hero and saviour of Albion? or  dark warrior whose live consists of un-heard of and merciless deads of  evil? that I leave to you, Farm boy.			"

												Fable: The Lost Chapter was not only my first RPG, growing up it was the game I'd always go back to after dipping into games that just couldn't compare to the truly epic experiences I'd have with it. The world and lore of Albion flowed through my mind like the blood in my veins. It was like a second home to me. And after dipping into it for the first time in years, I found that it still is.     I always find that I keep critique to a minimum when it comes to Fable: The Lost Chapters. I do this intentionally. This game was my childhood. I therefore don't want to destroy the fond memories I have of it by locating negative aspects with it.      I'm really not sure if you'll have such a great experience I've had and still have with this game, but I really want to believe that you will.

												In my humble opinion, Fable: The Lost Chapters is one of the best games I've ever played. I remember playing the original Fable on the Xbox, and then playing The Lost chapters later on the Xbox as well. I also feel that the first Fable was the best out of the series, I felt the physics of the game were tighter and some of the animations weren't so ""loose"" like in the following games. But more importantly, having this game on Steam is also much better than when it was on the Xbox, it runs smoother, the loading is faster, and there is no loss of the original fun. Anyone who is of age, (Or not because I was about twelve when this game first came out) will have a fantastic time creating their character and choosing whether to be good or evil. All in all, this game is fantastic, and I would recommend this to anyone who is willing to buy it.			"

I'm the first to complain about graphics and when I saw this game I was kind of put off but heard nothing but good things about it so I decided to try it out and I'm glad I did.There needs to be more games like this one, this is a TRUE RPG, more of one than popular titles like Skyrim... in fact I had more fun playing this game than Skyrim.  I saw mechanics in this game that present day games don't even touch; the fact that your character's appearance changes depending on everything from your fighting style to the foods you eat or good/bad deeds you do is freakin genius and you just don't see that today.  If you love RPGs seriously pick this up.			"

												Ok, It's Fable... We have mostly played it before. I picked this up simply to scratch a nostalgia itch. On the whole I found that it was good... still! Yes there are a couple of issues as it's an older game so the port hasn't aged particuly well, no controller support and as the magic system relied on three buttons on the xbox version it now relies on 2 (left and right mouse) which can make it a little difficult with all the scrolling to find the apropriate spell. you could of course get very wow style and have a million hotkeys buuut meh, its not really designed around it.Anyway back on track, the port is actually good, 1080 supported (which looks quite lovely!)  AA is supported as well as some basic visual sliders and such. The only thing i found didnt work properly was the refresh rate, is seem to stick at 60fps, not terrible at all but i have a 120hz monitor sooo, well it would have been nice.On to gameplay! Yes the game is flawed... it does feel a little like ""babby's first RPG""  but it has bags of character and you will remember your time with it. i found on my recent playthrough some more annoyances... such as indestructible barrels, having to run MILES to pick up rent and a slightly janky inventory. Seriously when you pick up a book you cant find it in your inventory.... its in your hero's logbook UNLESS it is a note/letter given by a non main story NPC and then it turns up in the ""other"" section of you inventory.  Yes the attack cycles will get repetative you will get bores of the 4 or 5 different unblockable ""flourish"" moves, ranged combat feels slow and you become super powerful very quickly. and then you feel like all the experience you have aquired is useless (it is) But with all that being said, Albion is a fantastic world to inhabit, a lot of thought went in to contextualising the world, everybody has a life that you can see being lead, they will react accordingly... if you raid Oakvale, and murder people (even as a good guy) you will find that for some time the inhabitants will cower and run away from you... even though you have a halo....THE BOTTOM LINE.....Flawed, but fun and a relatively well done and useable port    "

												Fable: The Lost Chapters is a well designed and executed game. It has great controls, a good story, and is generally a bug free game. Though at times it can be a bit unfair, it makes up for it in all other aspects. I really recomend that you purchase this game.			"

												I haven't heard of Fable at all,I have no idea how. I got this just before Fable III came out just to see if I would like the premise and I loved this game in ever aspect. It was incredible. There's really not a lot I can say without spoilers but for the price that it's at. It's well worth it.			"

												Fable: TLC is a game I used to play as a kid. It's an absolutely fantastic RPG game. Compared to the other games in the Fable franchise this is gold and the others are dog♥♥♥♥♥♥ In Fable you get loads of moral choices which affect your character and the way other people in the world views you. Fable enjoys really enjoyable combat including a huge variety of spells. The variation of  weapons may be lacking, but there's a good variation of armour, clothes, tattoos and hairstyles. But the main part of the game is the amazing story and the great side-quests and the choices you have to make, there's load of things to do! (Unless you just rush the main quest which I don't suggest) Only problem I have is that the difficulty is really easy, and completing the game without ever dying isn't hard. This game is an absolutely buy! You'll have hours of fun, and seeing at it is quite a old game, it's quite cheap as well!			"

												Let me start off by saying one thing. This is hands down the best game that has ever been made. There is no contest and there will never be another game that is as good as Fable. I may be a little biased because this game has been with me since the original XBOX came out, but I think I'm justified. I remember it vividly: my small six-year-old self pressing buttons, enjoying the incredible gameplay, et cetera. It never does get old. I replay this game often and it's the same effect every time. Now that I'm grown the effect is a little different, mind you. I start up the game and I seem to ejaculate pretty much everything I have in me because this game is just perfect. It's just so perfect every single time. I don't care if the graphics are dated. I don't care if it's not popular. I don't care if the audio quality is like filtering diarrhea through a tube sock. This is simply the best game that has ever been made. If you don't have this game in your library then you're not alive. You haven't lived yet. Just do it. Just buy this game and stop reading my dumbass emotional review. Now I'm crying. Look what you've done to me.Thank you merciful Molyneux.			"

GAMEPLAY: 8/10STORY: 8/10A great start to a great series. The story is simple and interesting. In my opinion, Fable is NOT supposed to use a mouse and keyboard and the default key bindings are just strange. However, you can quickly adjust to this control style. I actually played Fable 2 first (which remains my favorite) and it was nice to see that good aspects got carried over in the series and the bad were left out or modified. Thus, after this game, I recommend getting Fable 2, and possibly 3 (not everybody likes Fable 3 and there are plenty of reviews to explain why or why not.)Well worth the bucks.			"

												This is the game that takes the title as I favourite RPG ever. It may not have the size and content of Skyrim, but the impacts you make on the world really add to the immersion. People actually chanting your name and either cowering from you or praising you, and actually knowing when or when not to oppose you is something that even Skyrim fails to achieve. The combat may seem just like a button masher but if you know what your doing, you can turn it into a fun game of mind tricks with your opponents. The story is the cherry on top of this brilliant cake, and contrary to what many people say, the game can get pretty difficult.			"

												the only things i dont like about the game is that you age a tad to quickly and that in the arena the AI for whisper was very bad at one time (i kept getting smashed with rocks from rock trolls and she did not do anything) i therefore recommend that you get ""slow time"" as one of the first things. it is also hard to be a mage since you have to press 1,2,3 etc. to use the mage abilities wich can be hard in the heat of combat. therefore i think you should do like me. Have a warrior that uses the most important magic abilities (etheral swords, slow time, heal etc) they greatly help in combat and can be used quickly.there is also one thing i love very much, the level up system. The simple thing that means even though you use mostly melee (strength) you can still use the general exp to make your magic better (will)so all in all 8/10			"

												First off, this might sound a bit biased. That's because it absolutely is.I grew up playing this game on my old Xbox. My mom would tell me ""[redacted], you can play this game, but only if you're a good guy"". I would run around, only killing evil things, eventually becoming a shining beacon of happiness and hope throughout Albion.Then I turned 10. Things got a bit crazy. May or may not have ""accidently"" slaughtered a couple villages and grew a set of horns.Anyway.That was in the past.I hadn't played this game in at least 7 years (which is crazy to think about) and for some reason, never checked on Steam for it. When I saw it at the Summer Sale, I froze. Oh my god. It's my game. I picked it up without thinking about it, and am 100% happy with my decision.The game is great. The voice acting is horrible. The faces and lip movements are really bad. The Guildmaster is annoying as hell. But the game is a rare gem from the past that I don't think anyone should miss playing.This is the Lost Chapters. It adds much, much more to the base game. It no longer ends when you beat the main villain the first time. Instead, you find yourself with another HALF A GAME to go. More weapons, more enemies, more armor, more quests, and more fun.It also runs really, really well on my laptop. I still haven't felt it get hot, even after a 5-hour gaming session. Camera is a bit wonky, and I had to rebind a few keys (who would want to block with the middle mouse?). Once I got used to it, I've done very well with it.One thing I love about this game, is that it can give you a sense of being overpowered, but only if you play it well. If you mess up, you can easily be overwhelmed by enemies and lose half your health. Play it right, and the only damage you'll take is from a few stray crossbow bolts. If you like rpg games, this game is one of the best out there, even today. I highly, highly, highly recommend getting it and trying it out. After you endure the first hour or so of not-so-great ""gameplay"", you'll come to love this game as much as I do.Well, not as much.Not nearly. "

												Ok, It's Fable... We have mostly played it before. I picked this up simply to scratch a nostalgia itch. On the whole I found that it was good... still! Yes there are a couple of issues as it's an older game so the port hasn't aged particuly well, no controller support and as the magic system relied on three buttons on the xbox version it now relies on 2 (left and right mouse) which can make it a little difficult with all the scrolling to find the apropriate spell. you could of course get very wow style and have a million hotkeys buuut meh, its not really designed around it.Anyway back on track, the port is actually good, 1080 supported (which looks quite lovely!)  AA is supported as well as some basic visual sliders and such. The only thing i found didnt work properly was the refresh rate, is seem to stick at 60fps, not terrible at all but i have a 120hz monitor sooo, well it would have been nice.On to gameplay! Yes the game is flawed... it does feel a little like ""babby's first RPG""  but it has bags of character and you will remember your time with it. i found on my recent playthrough some more annoyances... such as indestructible barrels, having to run MILES to pick up rent and a slightly janky inventory. Seriously when you pick up a book you cant find it in your inventory.... its in your hero's logbook UNLESS it is a note/letter given by a non main story NPC and then it turns up in the ""other"" section of you inventory.  Yes the attack cycles will get repetative you will get bores of the 4 or 5 different unblockable ""flourish"" moves, ranged combat feels slow and you become super powerful very quickly. and then you feel like all the experience you have aquired is useless (it is) But with all that being said, Albion is a fantastic world to inhabit, a lot of thought went in to contextualising the world, everybody has a life that you can see being lead, they will react accordingly... if you raid Oakvale, and murder people (even as a good guy) you will find that for some time the inhabitants will cower and run away from you... even though you have a halo....THE BOTTOM LINE.....Flawed, but fun and a relatively well done and useable port    "

												My favorite game of all time! Deep and involving story that goes beyond just the main quest that can be read about in the huge array of books scattered throughout Albion. The loading times on PC are only 3-4 seconds long, vs the Xbox's time (15-20 secs).The huge amount of weapons and armours are fantastically designed and each have a unique ability. The amount of choice is amazing! You can marry a man or a woman, you can be good or evil, be a powerful wizard or a brutal fighter. There are so many choices and paths to take! The open world environment allows you to roam free between towns and find ancient legendary weapons hidden long ago in chests and behind magic stone gates known as Demon Doors, which to open, you must solve a riddle or complete a challenge. The best game I've ever played, and a long time favorite! This game is a must-own for every roleplayer out there.EDIT: It's been a couple of years since I wrote this review and this game continues to be one of my favorites in my steam library. It's fair to say that I won't ever stop playing this game.			"

												When it comes down to it, there are games from the past that are totally not worth. However, since this game, Fable, was the first and the best in the series, I would have to recommend those to play this game. Whether you enjoyed it years ago on the orginal xbox or computer or not, this game is a beautiful, addicting, single-player game. It wont take up too much of your time, you'll enjoy the story, and most of all, you can ♥♥♥♥ with people so hard. In my first play-through, I chose the path of light and justice. The game was amazing. Then I realized that being an evil mother ♥♥♥♥er makes this game about 10 times better. In most games, I have a hard time being evil; I just feel bad for these NPCs and ♥♥♥♥ing with their ""lives"". Then I grew some god damn balls and chose to ♥♥♥♥ with everything these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s hold dear. It's really easy to be evil if your real-life morals don't come into play. And one of the best parts is that in the beginning, when you're a child, you can't get in trouble for evil deeds. You can be a ♥♥♥♥ing bully and mess with everyone, beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the random kid who wants his teddy bear back, and still be back in time to give your younger sister her present.Just ♥♥♥♥ing drink or get stoned, and play this game for a night or two. It's totally commander Warf.			"

												Finally finished this game. If you haven't yet, do so. It's a great fantasy roleplaying game that might be a little easy. However, it oozes charm, and has a fun, action-packed combat system. While Fable II is the best in the series, this is a great game, too. And the best part is that this version has the true ending, extra quests and weapons, and a ton of stuff added to the base game. At this price, you can't lose. So check it out!			"

												Fable is one of my favourite games on the original XBOX. A solid 15-20 hours of pure fun gameplay. Fable to this day holds a spot as one of my favorite adventure RPG games. Everything about this game is right. For the time it was released it had so many innovative ideas. Your character actually got scarred up and caried your wounds from battle with you throughout the game. You could become good or evil with a noticeable difference to your characters appearance to show this. The world is beautiful, happy and great fun to adventure through. The only downfall with this game is it's short time. If you have never played Fable before I can't reccomend this enough as I feel everyone should play through this game at least once.			"

												This game was amazing when it came out, and it's still amazing to this day.The story holds up, the combat holds up, the mechanics hold up. Hey, even the graphics hold up well enough.If you've never played this, I cannot recommend it enough. If you've played Fable III and not this one, boy, you're in for a treat.It really is a shame Fable II is never coming to PC, it's the only other game in the franchise that can compete with the first in my opinion, despite all the fuss about firearms being in it.Bottom line, if never played it before and want a great, fresh, medieval fantasy game experience, this is where you should look. If you've played it once or twice before, it's a game with enough choices to revisit once more. If you already played it thoroughly and like it, I'm sure I don't even have to tell you to play it all over again sometime.			"

												Fable TLC is great for people who don't have an original copy of either Fable or Fable TLC for the original Xbox. The game is a direct port and I experienced no bugs or crashing when I played. One thing that players should keep in mind when purchasing this game is that there is no controller support for the game. Playing on the keyboard was incredibly difficult for me because I was so used to the Xbox controller format. To fix this I used Xpadder and made a specific profile that worked very well with the game. I've probably beaten this game about 6 or 7 times and it never gets old. It's a classic game and worth shelling out the cash to play it.			"

The only reason I'm not playing Fable: Anniversary right now is because the laptop I'm currently using can't run it... but it can run this, so why haven't you played it yet? It is my favourite game, it's that simple. I only wish that they had kept the whole series feeling this good......well? What are you still reading this for?

You can ""be what you want"", buuuut...SPOILERS?your alignment does not change the story, apart from some details. Different playthroughs with different alignments are fun just to see the people's reaction and the changes your body go through, but it does not add anything at all to the story.You can customize your character with hairstyles, mustaches, beards and tattoos.It does not take a lot of grinding to max out the char stats, and the peculiar thing of the leveling system of Fable is that you grow old as you level up your skills: this makes things a bit awkward, especially when you're older than your big sister, or even your mother.The trading system is exploitable, so making big money is a piece of cake.And last, the equipment/item system: it's really nothing special, and a bit of a let down. Weapons have an attack stat and swing/reload speed, armors a defense stat. You can upgrade your weapons, but since you may get really powerful gear here and there you'll not do it often.			"

												This game really shows why the Fable series has been such a huge hit for all these years. The newest ones are only going to get better. It's so great to see how one of the greatest franchises began. Some people might think this particular game is no different than a free-to-play fantasy rpg, but show me a free-to-play that has this much of a diverse storyline. The actions you choose change the world around you. You are in ultimate control over what happens, so playing this game all the way through more than once will be far from boring. Even after this game goes off-sale it's still worth the $10. Do yourself a favor and buy this game. Don't put it on your wishlist. It's too good to wait for someone to buy it for you. Get it now and truly feel what it means to be in control of your own destiny.			"

												Fable takes the old cliche boy turned Hero story and makes it a very thorough and engaging game story-- Fleshed out in such a way it goes beyond the cliche completely. It remains so unique you probably won't put this down even after you've beaten it a couple times. Replayability is insane. If you're like most of my friends and have only played the sequels, you're really missing out. The first in the series is the best, and definitely one of my favourite games.The RPG mechanics are easily exploitable, but if you play the game straight as it's intended, it's a Hell of a lot of fun.Your character changes based on your actions and your skills.If you decide to get buff and put points into strength, your character visibly gets more muscle definition.If you invest in learning magics, runes and symbols will start glowing on your body.The people around you react to your actions and appearance, running from you or following you around and singing your praise, possibly even falling in love with you.Maybe the game has really bad voice acting, maybe its character morphing system forgets a value sometimes and glitches out so you look funny (Also causes the AI to act conflicted sometimes -hilariously enough- screaming in fear but madly in love with you).Sure, it has a really bad, really long tutorial.There are some tone inconsistencies in the late game that don't really flow with the initial non-TLC ending, and small issues with age show.But that's all trying really hard to find issues with it.This is definitely the best RPG of its time.

												This game really shows why the Fable series has been such a huge hit for all these years. The newest ones are only going to get better. It's so great to see how one of the greatest franchises began. Some people might think this particular game is no different than a free-to-play fantasy rpg, but show me a free-to-play that has this much of a diverse storyline. The actions you choose change the world around you. You are in ultimate control over what happens, so playing this game all the way through more than once will be far from boring. Even after this game goes off-sale it's still worth the $10. Do yourself a favor and buy this game. Don't put it on your wishlist. It's too good to wait for someone to buy it for you. Get it now and truly feel what it means to be in control of your own destiny.			"

												This is one of my favourite games of all time. It might be the nostalgia talking (it was one of my childhood games), but I really do love this game. Sure there are things which were annoying such as the voice acting, it's graphics are outdated, and the moral choice system was laughably binary. But it had a real charm to it, a great story line, amusing side quests, a highly enjoyable battle and magic system, beautiful and magical environs and items (for the graphics level).You may want to get the Fable Anniversary remake of the game instead of this one (I haven't played that one so I dunno how it stands up), especially if older graphics are a problem for you. But this one is about $25 less so if you're strapped for cash this one is still an awesome game.			"

												Most of the games today that arent MMOs have around 10hrs of gameplay and tops 20. But when playing Fable you can choose so many paths for your character so you can even start the game all over again and still have hours of endless satisfaction. But I will warn you this game is highly addictive and has a bunch of hidden funny quests and punns :D Hope you will enjoy this game as much as I do, I recommend for everyone who loves RPGames cos this will give you a whole lot of it.

												I came in to this game as a heavy Elder Scrolls/Open Environment RPG player.That said, the limited environment as long as it's expected. Didn't limit my experience.I actually enjoyed the more confined setting as a nice change of pace.The graphics may not hold up today to some, but to me they are above passable.The combat I would say is the weakest link in this game.I was put in to situations where NPCs would spam stun techniques which would lead me getting multi-hit and multi-stunned with out me even being able to give a simple movement command in response. Allowing a very frustrating experience.Aside from this, which seemed to only happen against the Rock Trolls or larger enemies that used AoE the coimbat though limited and repetitive managed to keep my interest.I am a huge fan of stories in games, and this story seemed a bit sterotypical and generic for a RPG.Yet it kept my interest with the townsfolk around me commenting on my recent quests I have achieved/completed.I would say this is for any RPG fan for a quick play through, or if you want another average to above average RPG to dive in to. I will say this is worth the 10$ price tag, but I would wait for a sale for a extra pick up, rather than a main purchase. If you were to do that, as I did.

												An attractively unusal, enticing, and refreshing game. A must play for anyone searching for a fresh fruit from a familiar tree. Fable covers the basics anyone would expect from an RPG and adds comical and quaint ideas of its own. Gameplay is smooth and intuitive and the graphics are charming and timeless. The voice acting is superb, only adding more charm to the game. Don't listen to the hype on forums, anyone who has anything negative to say about this game ruined it for themselves by anticipating something this game wasn't meant to be. I recommend this game to anyone.			"

												Fable - The Lost Chapters is one of the best games I have ever had the pleasure to play, and I have played many many games I don't have many hours in the account but I've replayed it at least 3 times needless to say it's loads of fun and very addicting.The game has a great story with good plot twists. The player (You) follows the life story of a little boy who loses everything and is taken in as a student of a Hero school then you can choose to live his childhood or not and that's all i'm giving out! Not gonna spoil the fun :)The world itself is responsive to what you do and the Npc's react to what you have done, if you have been good they will be warm towards you, and you'l get a circle above your head like if you were an Angel, If you have been doing bad deeds ( like me) such as hiting people with sticks, kicking chickens etc XD, you'l grow horns and people will fear you and be cold towards you. But that can also be influenced by what type of armor you are wearing, some types of armor have an ""evil look"" to them  causing people to be repulsed by it. Another fact about the world is that it is not fully open world it's region locked, little areas where you can explore and that's a minus in the game, but considering it's age it's not something the developers could do about it. There is fast travel areas in the hero school where you will receive numerous quests and where you can upgrade your character.You can also buy titles such as ""The Chicken chaser!"", ""Sabre"" and many others that I can't remember right now hehe.You can customize your character by finding cards of tatoos, beards or haircuts in chests you find in the world. There are doors guarded by Old men faces that provide the player challenges some are to get a kill streak or getting fat, and as you complete the challenge you will be able to enter the big doors and a chest will be found with loot inside it. There are tons of things to do in this amazing world.The Ending is one that will stick with you, the way it ends is choosen by you, I found the Good ending more satisfying than the evil ending. It is a great game and if you don't have it yet or have money left over during steam sales give it a go. You won't regret it :)I give this game an 8/10 Very good game!!			"

												Fable - The Lost Chapters is truly one of the best RPGs ever. It covers and AMAZING story, alongside a bunch of really nice side-quests. Basically, you start the game as a young boy who dreams of greatness and you continue your journey through the vast land of Albion. Step by step you grow to be stronger, faster, smarter, and also older. Either you choose to be a mage, a warrior, or a rogue, you will end up to be the greatest hero of all, a Legend. Now, the game has nice graphics (even though it was released in 2005 for PC), an AMAZING soundtrack, and one of the best, and most memorable voice actings ever. The worst thing about this game series is that they have failed to make the other Fable titles like this one.10/10 "

												Although i do love this game and originally played it on le xbox, I can't help but to say something negative about it, Not due to the actual gameplay itseld, but for some reason (and it may just be me) I can't even load the damn game T.T. I get to the 3 opening scene (before even see the main menu) and it force closes. I love this game and i wish i wasn't having this issues. already tried uninstalling and re-installing. so, if anyone has any info on how i can fix this, please let me know. This game is too pimp to not want to fix!			"

												Easily the best adventure game ever created. Explore the realms of Albion and save the world while rescuing your family. Make life choices that will take you down the lighted path or the path of evil. Every action influences how your loyal fans will react to you. Will they cheer your name, laugh at you, or cower in fear? The choice is yours, Hero.			"

Posted: May 2, 2016
												So I've decided on making a review on this game in writing for now, but I plan on making a video review in the future. Fable The Lost Chapters has been my second favorite game since it was released as just ""fable"" back in 2004. Upon hearing about The Lost Chapters I got extremely excited. Hell, I played through the game again on the xbox just so I could play through the second part of the game. I feel that they could have included The Lost Chapters in the game itself and honestly it's stupid that they didn't. But nostalgia blinds me from being mad at that. So I feel that the game plays just as good if not better than the xbox version, but I still wish I could use a 360 controller on the pc port of the game. I prefer the comfort of a controller with games like this and other rpgs because I can relax and actually play the game.The story in this game is a bit lacking and I could kind of tell even as a 14 year old how things were going to play out. I won't be covering the story because I recommend you play it yourself. But basically who you think is dead isn't and who you think is good isn't as well.Fable wasn't exactly a well recieved series, Fable 2 never came to pc so I never really got the chance to play it through, and Fable 3... Well. I think it's trash to say the least.They really hyped up the good and evil system in this game, and for good reason! They were pretty much the pioneers of alignment choices with Knights of the old republic just a year or so before. We have games like this to thank for the big aligment based games such as Mass Effect and Fallout, so next time you say the fable series is awful, it may be bad to you, but they did certainly try to do something different. Games like Final Fantasy don't really have good or evil choices, you're the chosen hero. This game lets you be the bad guy. Wether it's you killing traders, or your own family, it doesn't matter. Also there's a brothel you can take over and  bang chicks for free. 19/10Rest in peace Lionhead.			"

												This game is a classic for me. Back in the day most people got hyped up on all of the false promises surrounding the development. Not me. I had never heard a thing. I walked into Best Buy one day, asked about good PC games, and they dude told me to buy this. I think I was 14 or so. Long story short, I had so much fun. It was the perfect beginner RPG. For a while it was my favorite PC game, I think I played it for around 2-3 years. Great memories.			"

												I don't appear to have alot of hours on this, but I used to boot up the original Xbox consule just to play this game. To start off with, this is by far on of my favorite games in the previous generation of games. And even now, playing it is still fun, there is always alot to do. And quite frankly its just Fantastic. Story driven, and well put together. I haven't run into any bugs since I was playing it 10 years ago and honestly the controls are easy to get around with.Well woth the 10$ usd honestly.			"

												This game, in my opinion, is beautiful.When you hear someone say a game is beautiful, they're usually talking about the graphics. I find this game beautiful because of the atmosphere. The Music, the World, and the Graphics together make this game beautiful to me. If you can get your hands on the OST, get it. Besides the atmosphere I also like every else. The story is good, the quests are alright, the characters are decent, and the combat is ok. Overall this game is very, very good. I would highly reccomend it.			"

Then I started again on a new character with spending experience on different abilities.graphics not hurtful to eyes but very outdated 6/10gameplay amazing I feel like I AM the hero but there is some things that lessen immersion 8/10overall rating 9/10Some people might not like this type of game but the leveling system is great.Fable 2 and 3 messed it up, and I was dissapointed when they weren't anything like this. they felt more linear whereas here, although it isn't open world it feels like it is.

												I have a lot of nostalgia for this game. It is a delightful little hack and slash, though it REALLY has not aged well. I give it a thumbs up, because it is a good game, but I would argue that the simplicity of it and teeth-grinding voice-acting can wear on even the biggest fans. I disliked its sequels, and I never feel the need to revisit it - but Fable will always hold a place in my heart as a rare Gem from Moleneux.			"

												okay for those who dont want the long run. this game is awesome. with that odd british humor i personally love, a cool (though cliched) story line. the art-style is awesome. but with an odd camera and a bit clunky combat it isnt the best in the world.but DEFINITELY pick this game up, i can simply spend hours and hours on this game, and once you get the hang of the combat it really isnt that bad. with extra tricks and so on, its quite nice to try and figure out these techniques to be better and so on so forth.although the renowned good/bad system isnt at all what it was hyped to be, its still a nice feature, and there are alot of choices which influense what character you are trying to build, and although it doesnt impact the game much more than the occasional cheering/buuing its still nice, and since it doesnt influence the game too much, i cant really complain since its just a thing you can care about if you want to, its an option, not a requirementthe quests are great, although not very special, this is one of the few games where i can actually care about the side quests.the bosses, although way too few, they can be quite fun, the wasp queen is quite nice and  Jack of Blades 	 is an amasing boss. when i say amasing though, i mean i enjoyed it quite alot.so all in all, its an amasing game, with its querks, its far from the best, i enjoy it to hell, and i hope you will too, since this is a game i believe everyone should pick up at some point.

												My Fable franchise experience was a little bit weird. I started by playing the newest ones instead of the first game....I started by playing Fable 3 and loved it, every single aspect of the game. Then on the xbox i tried Fable 2 and guess what...I thought it was just simple amazing, I looked back at Fable 3 and saw it was just lacking some things comparing to Fable 2.This year my brother said: ""Try Fable The Lost Chapters and you will look back at Fable 2 and 3 and see how much they are lacking compared to this one"" and soo I ended up cracking it and later buying it on steam.....I ended up falling in love and now i think how much my brother was right, compared to the other two I just  felt like this one had much more too give.Long Store Short:Just buy the game!

												~It's just like skyrim, only its 95% cheaper... my god such cheap.~Welcome to the world of Fable, this classic game wich was first released on the xbox made its way to the pc.I played this game for a while and bought it for the cheap prive of 1,50 dollar.I'm not going into full detail but see this as skyrim, you go on  quests, buy weapons, cloths ect.And you try to rid the world of evil.HEY  you could even marry and have a quicky with the mayor of the town if you like (wich i would recoment cause she has dem big boobies and money in dem pocket.)For what this game costs i would hily recoment buying this, you will have lots of playtime on your hands with this game,and it gives away that nostaliga feeling that games used to have when you played it.Best part of all, this runs almost on any pc.During steam summer sale its really cheap so i would buy it the next sale, you wont be disapointed.

												Music 7/10- This game has a good soundtrack. Lots of memorable songs that help to describe the tension or calmness of a situation that the game places you in.Gameplay 7/10- I got this game on the original Xbox, I loved the game then and I still do now, BUT there isn't much of a challenge to some of the major fights in the game. It might be that certain character builds are just TOO strong for the game or mabey I just played the game too much to even remember if it ever was difficult. Story 9/10- The original game had a great story, one that starts off simple and slowly builds to the main character finding out about his family and it's secrets. This game also gives you the choice to either be a hero or a villian and decide the fate of Albion and its people. Overall - Great game, if you're a fan of adventure rpgs then this game is a must buy. The game isn't too long but it is a fun game. However be warned that this game does have some minor bugs, for example on the final boss there is a choice you can make and it doesnt display the options, or in some parts the subtitles are shown but no dialoge is heard from the voice actors.

												Music 7/10- This game has a good soundtrack. Lots of memorable songs that help to describe the tension or calmness of a situation that the game places you in.Gameplay 7/10- I got this game on the original Xbox, I loved the game then and I still do now, BUT there isn't much of a challenge to some of the major fights in the game. It might be that certain character builds are just TOO strong for the game or mabey I just played the game too much to even remember if it ever was difficult. Story 9/10- The original game had a great story, one that starts off simple and slowly builds to the main character finding out about his family and it's secrets. This game also gives you the choice to either be a hero or a villian and decide the fate of Albion and its people. Overall - Great game, if you're a fan of adventure rpgs then this game is a must buy. The game isn't too long but it is a fun game. However be warned that this game does have some minor bugs, for example on the final boss there is a choice you can make and it doesnt display the options, or in some parts the subtitles are shown but no dialoge is heard from the voice actors.

												Pretty fun and, if you're replaying the game, it's a real treat. Fable is advertised as the ultimate RPG with a lot of moral decisions and a big world, but those are all lies. It's an action adventure game with a morality system and some mild stats. 7/10.EDIT: Now that Fable: Anniversary has been released, you should probably buy that instead.			"

												This game is a unique and one of a kind RPG that they developers were never able to recreate in it's sequals. It is really fun however it is exetremely short so if your looking for a game with more then 12 hours of gameplay then this game isn't for you. Also, a lot of music is reused in later parts of the game, which despite Fable's amazing sound track, does get annoying. Also the game is pretty easy considering the fact I can complete it without dying once throughout the playthrough. I still recommend this game, however. This is one of the only games besides GTA where you can randomly kill villagers for no reason, and you do get more gameplay if you try to find all the secrets without looking them up on the internet.

												WHAT CAN I SAY...... This is by far the best of the series, this game is full of magic, revenge and compassion as you start as a young boy waiting to avenge the death of his family.... This game is full of decision making which affect your overall outcome.... will you be a feared hero or a loved one, will you have horns coming out your head or surrounded by butterflys?? It's all up to you.... the story telling is remarkable, the creatures and characters are fantastic, the combat system is very easy to master and not all over the place like League of legends and other magic power inspired games....Once you have finished the storyline, you are free to keep playing and unlocking the other secrets of Albion.... I would still pay $20 for this gem....Warning....be prepared to lose a few days in front of your computer.... If I was to say anything bad, I'd say that the graphics are getting a little old...but that's it!!!Overall I give this game a 10/10...it's a classic and it's just too good!!!			"

												Fable TLC is the one of the best RPG I know.The questline is filled with choices, be they evil or heroic. You can become an evil ""Hero"" or a good ""Hero"". You can kill nearly every main character and all NPCs, you can join factions and you can marry an evil ♥♥♥♥♥ to become a mayor.Don't get confused by the ""Evil Hero"", since Hero is a name given to everyone who graduated the Hero's Guild.SPOILER ALERT!!!In the end, you can even become the villan that you fought during the whole questline.

												I remember playing this game when I was younger and it was everything I ever dreamed about for a month atleast, back then it seemed like a long journey through the fable world, growing from a young scamp of a hero into a 70 year old bulked up, sword wielding legend. So naturally I jumped for joy when I saw Fable: The Lost Chapters on steam so I could relive the adventure... I completed the game in around 10 hours including the lost chapters section, if you loved or enjoyed the original fable back on Xbox then Im sure you would enjoy this just as much if not more but dont be sad if you complete the game within 2 seconds.Graphics - Good (for its age)Story - Epic (Best one out of all the Fables)Gameplay - Does The Job (for its age)Mechanics - Does The Job (for its age)Memories - Brought BackOverall - For the games age I'd give it a solid 8/10			"

I just came up against an enemy that was far too powerful for me and so I left it open for about two weeks. However, so far I can say that this game is all that I had hoped it to be. I have played through Fable 2 before, but none of the other games in the series and playing through this has so far been excellent. I adore this series, from what i've seen.			"

												Avaliable only on computer, unlike it's follow-ups, this PC game is still as good. My only faults are: that it was made in the dark ages of gaming when nearly all games had male protagonists, so there isn't any female option to play as; and that the people are fairly boring (none of the NPCs have as much character background as those in Fable 2 and 3, and you've no dog as a companion). The NPCs also follow you around with simple interactions and have hearts over their heads to indicate romanceable or not. It's not Fable 3 bad, but it's certainly not as good as Fable 2. Finally, clothing is fairly limited in this game unlike its successors, as the outfits of Knight, bandit, etc, do not have dye options. Plus, it also seems like a carry-on in the series; you're required to attain a bandit outfit from boxes in order to gain entry into the bandits' camp, which is very similar to Fable 3. However, to be fair, in Fable 3 you have the options of dying the outfit and changing your hairstyle more. Plus, you never actually meet any Knights in this game, or in the others for that matter, so that outfit is made practically meaningless. Basically, Fable 1 therefore mostly just has showy outfits for the player.However, if you're a fan and want to find out how it began (I played 3, 2, and then 1), then this would be a good choice. The story-line is interesting, if a tad cliche, with the main character's family being separated by a bandit attack; you still have moral choices (good or bad actions, skinny or tubby, etc); there is certainly more information in Fable 1, as on the menu you can find how many houses you own to whether you're defined as hetro/homosexual through your interactions (information that isn't present in Fable 2 and 3!); you're more likely to gain scars and die during the battles in this one, as the gameplay is more difficult; and the graphics are quite good for a game this old.Further, with the release of Fable 1 Anniversary on xbox360, the graphics are even further improved if you're more inclined to spend a little more and play on the console. The pixels are more noticeably defined on the console, but there are known glitches and the developers didn't add anything to the series. You would literally be spending your money on just lighter graphics. This PC version is just as good. In fact, it's better because it has more of a history.So, all in all, the PC Fable 1: Lost chapters is a good game if you're looking for an intro into playing the later series or you're in want of playing a humorous game (the quests certainly do fit that bill).

												WAY shorter than I expected, the main quest lasts less than 10hours (and I'm not one who like to rush through games). I'm not sure why steam says I have been playing 14 hours, since the actual game says only 9 (plus the final battle, which could have lasted like 20min).(may contain spoilers)anyway, it's a great game, although the lost chapters seem a little... ""OMG I have killed him but he is not dead yet"" too much. Like, it's kinda obvious that it was some added content, and not part of the original game. anyway, I bought it on sale for very little, so, can't complain. but I would't pay full price for this, since I allways look at the price/hour, and this was not that long... btw, the ending has a bug (I suspect on panoramic resolutions), where an important message is not shown. so, be sure to save before the final battle, just in case. (although I was happy with the ending...)			"

												Bought This by Mistake :} For its time this was really a good game, one of the Better RPG'sBUT I would not buythis one,the Anniverasy addition is much betterits not just touched UP alot of new elements.Better looking a few new quests also controler friendly.this one is not..BUT am giving thumbs UP just because this is one of those gamesIf you had it when it first came out, you would never forget it[side note] if you own Fable 3 there is a work around for the black screen bugcaused by the ""games for windows"" being outdated.Id post link here but there are so many on the web and easy enough to findHope to see Fable 3 come to Steam soon :} "

												Every time I play Fable I'm pleasantly reminded as to just how timeless it really is. It's so damn good in my opinion that at least every 2 years I find myself playing it again, just to re-experience it and all of its stellar contents. In my opinion it's way up there in what I'd consider one of the best RPG's - if not one of the best games - of all time. If you haven't played it before, buy it and find the time to. You won't regret it if you're interested in good video games. I'll preface in saying that I've played this game far more outside of Steam, on both PC & Xbox, so I've more hours played this than what my profile suggests.The amount of dynamic freedom Fable offers you is unprecedented anywhere else even now. 10 years on, I'm still surprised by how much I'm allowed to do. Infiltrating a bandit camp? You can either shoot the guards to pass, or sneak in-between them. Further in, you then need to retrieve a uniform; which then allows you access to the base camp. But how do you proceed to the Boss's location? You can choose to kill all the bandits in sight, drawing out the elites, opening your passageway. How about you release captive slaves as a diversion, hire a group of assassins to do the work for you, OR acquire a pass from a shady bandit hiding in a dark corner for 1000 gold pieces. Which you can then kill him to retrieve your money. Or just skip giving the part where you pay him. And it doesn't indicate to you these options - it leaves it for you to find them.You've got all of the game's tight mechanics, and then on top of that it shoves this titanic amount of meta-content. Visit bars to play games like Blackjack, Pairs and a table-top golf-esque game called Coin Flick. Assist traders with their passage through the woods, seek out silver keys to open locked chests or pursue a treasure trail. Go fishing. Dig up some loot. ♥♥♥♥ some ♥♥♥♥♥es that you pick up from your nearby Inn. Oh, and CHICKEN KICKING, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. There's just so much to love. The sense of culture is hilarious; the attention to detail, consuming. The story, soundtrack and characters are memorable ones, too, and after finishing The Lost Chapters - the game's rather large and only expansion, from which this edition gets its namesake - for my first time this weekend, I can easily say Jack of Blades is certainly one of the most appealing antagonists I've seen in a video game.I could write about this game for ages. One of the highest recommendations I could give for any video game out.TL;DR: If you are one of the few that haven't played Fable, go out and buy it. It's a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome game. Period.			"

												It's the best Fable game but that isn't really saying much considering how awful the rest of the games in the series are. This game is dated as hell since its an Xbox game so you're bound to have weird compatibility issues if your PC and operating system aren't ancient. It's pretty fun though for a single playthrough. Every once in a while I give this another playthrough but I enjoy it that much. It's a very simple game though. The skills you can unlock don't really do much other than look flashy and you're honestly better off just upgrading your stats until you can slash every enemy until it dies.If you haven't played a Fable game, don't go in expecting much because expectations are what killed this game.

So points off for that.Other than that, the game is bright, colorful, and although it IS an older game it still looks pretty decent in terms of visuals (scenery, yes, people, no). The story is charming and the controls for keyboard are well done. II reccommend this game to anyone willing to play an old classic.			"

												Fable: The Lost ChaptersFable is one of the first M games I had ever been allowed to play when I was younger, and I believe that even now, it has aged gracefully. In Fable, it is simply astounding to the amount of interactions you can have with people. Sneer at them, scare the crap out of them, and children will run in terror at your approach. Or, become the saint that all love and respect, and give everyone a gift or two. Or, give 'em the middle finger and tell 'em to ♥♥♥♥ off. Then say sorry. Then ask a gay man to marry you. Reputation is everything in this game, be you good or evil, a good reputation for being good or evil is still a necessity. Or, live between the lines, but there are times that playing around with your alignment is not the way to go, and only one choice can be made. That choice, however, is entirely up to you.While the game does not entirely match up to some of the graphics of today, this game looks very beautyful and full of life, or death, especialy for it's time. The gameplay is very simple as well, and combat against multiple enemies can be fun, easy, very action packed once you get used to it. The replay value is actualy suprisingly high for the kind of game it is, and I'll tell you, I played this game on the XBOX dozens of times, each time telling myself I would become a different person, and each time, I found out something new about the game.I will say that if there is anyone out there who wishes to test their fantasy of a Hero or Villian, come along and experience the game that changed the way games were made. 9.5/10			"

												NOT CONTROLLER READY! WTF MICROSOFT?! COULDN'T YOU PORT YOUR CONSOL GAME TO THE PC WITH GAMEPAD MAPPING?!?!?!?I have yet to play the pc version, but after finding this out, I am turned off to play Fable: The Lost Chapters for the pc.*EDIT 3/26/2014*So I decided to give Fable a chance and so far playing with a mouse and keyboard is not so bad. Keep in mind though that I just started playing so I have yet to have any combat. I just wanted to say that Key  and Mouse isn't as bad as I thought.*EDIT 3/29/2014So I have been playing Fable: The Lost Chapters for a while and I feel like I must note that the game is great ALTHOUGH I do run into some difficulties due to where the actions are mapped. You might have two actions mapped to the same key, so you end up doing things that would didn't want to do. I thought that it was just me not being used the Keyboard and Mouse, but I still notice that I am getting actions twisted. I just want to make one thing clear thought, this is not game breaking. The game is still as wonderful as i remember. With added content waiting for me to explore, I am anticipating what I am going to encounter next!*EDIT 4/4/2014This will be my final edit for Fable: The Lost Chapters.After playing Fable for like the millionth time (probably 5th time), I have to say that i did enjoy the new content. The Lost Chapters added more to the mythos behind the game and I did feel like I wanted to know more. Something else that The Lost Chapters (TLC in short) gives you is a somewhat better conclusion than the original. Although I feel like they could have done a lot more with this expansion. In a way, it feels like its what the original game SHOULD have been rather than purchasing TLC again in stores.I know than when people first played this game, one of the main complaints was that it was a really short game, but I dont know, I clocked in with my 5th play through at around 18 hours, and im typing this right after I finished the game, no back tracking. Fable has a world that has SO MUCH potential, but the way it presents itself in the game seems as if it was half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ almost as if it was a blast talking about it, but the effort wasn't put into it. The way I see Fable is just a greeting to the world of Albion.Game play on the computer was difficult at fist. I had a lot of trouble getting my character to do what I wanted since some keys are mapped along with other actions, but the issue was resolved when I mapped the magic activation and exp orb gathering to the mouse thumb keys. Remaping my keys made the gameplay a lot better.Fable is a game that is a must play, wether you are new to the series or played the sequels. I recommend when playing this that you take your time, listen to what everyone (with a green glow) has to say. and explore the world.			"

												Fable is a groundbreaking roleplaying-adventure game from Peter Molyneux, in which your every action determines your skills, appearance, and reputation. Create your life story from childhood to death. Grow from an inexperienced adolescent into the most powerful being in the world. Choose the path of righteousness or dedicate your life to evil. Muscles expand with each feat of strength. Force of will increases with each work of wit. Obesity follows gluttony, and skin tans with exposure to sunlight and bleaches bone-white by moonlight. Earn scars in battle and lines of experience with age. Each person you aid, each flower you crush, and each creature you slay will change this world forever. Fable: Who will you be?			"

												Very good game. You can choose between good and bad. This also changes your skin from godlike with nimbus on your head to devilface with 2 horns on your forehead.If you only follow the mainquests the game is a bit short but if you try all quests and if you play it 2 times (good/bad) it has a moderate playtime.You start the game as kid and you will grow up while playing. Also with skin changing and a growing beard and changing haircolor. Story is good, gameplay is good. Game has a nice moneytrick which seems very planned by the developer.I have played it 2 times for testing both sides and the story really changes a bit, every side has his pros and contras. Check it out yourself. ;D9/10			"

												Now, I'm not one of those people who had this game ruined by the hype that ensued around its release, nor does this game offend me, I'm just voicing what I feel is so problematic with this game. Fable is essentially an action RPG, so I'm going to hold it to my standards of an action RPG, I feel that is only fair. Since Fable is an action RPG I guess I'd be best to start with its RPG elements. My biggest complaint is how shallow they actually are, they make Pokemon (the single player aspect that is, so the fanboys stop ripping my head off) look super in depth and complex. No thought needs to be put into leveling your character to make sure he can face the challenges ahead. The fun of RPG elements is having to make a tough call on what needs to be leveled to keep your character ready for the fights ahead. The thing is you can essentially max out the levels in every skill tree in one playthrough, this lowers replay value significantly, and eliminates the decision making aspect that makes RPG elements so enjoyable. Other action RPGs like Fallout New Vegas have max levels, so you have to making a decision as to what you're actually going to level up, this ensures the player isn't mindlessly filling all the bars on the stats screen, keeps the game interesting. All of the RPG elements are basically tacked on, and have little to do with your success in combat in any way more than how much damage you do, and how much defense you haveSo if the RPG elements are rather shallow, the game must fall back on its action, or combat. The combat in Fable is rather uninteresting to be quite honest. It has little depth to it as well, as it ends up being constantly clicking to keep hitting the enemy in the face, shooting the enemy or blasting an enemy wth some spell. *Correction* Enemies do have weaknesses, but I went the whole game without noticing a real difficulty jump from ignoring these weaknesses, rendering them pointless, since they failed to add complexity to the way I played the game. Enemies don't have stats that effect the damage you do to them, like if they wear armor or are immune to certain spells or elements or weapons. So little thought is required from the player to be successful in combat. The combat is so simple that it grew quite repetitive and monotonous very quickly. An in depth RPG system and nuanced combat would give players something to dig into, invest time in and master, but this game plays more like a really uexciting beat 'em up than an RPG.Of course there is player choice and morality, which has become a near industry standard in action RPGs. Just like the combat and level system, the element of choice is just as simplistic. Most situations have very black and white morality involved, which holds back a players freedom to construct a character that is anything other than a saint or a demon. While you are given choices, you never face serious consequences for these choices, so why should they matter to the player? One choice bothers me in particular, where *SPOILERS* you can choose to put on the mask or not at the end of the game. Instead of using some kind of prompt or better yet presenting this choice to me through the gameplay, the choice happens during a cutscene, and the way they handle it baffles me to no end. Why would you click the mouse to NOT put on the mask? Wouldn't you NOT click the mouse to NOT put on the mask? How is a player supposed to know it isn't just a regular old cutscene, this isn't conveyed to the player on any level.Fable highlights my problem with morality systems in general. Fable tells the player what is right and what is wrong, so the player doesn't have to think about this morality for themselves. The morality system should have been a hidden aspect of the game, working behind the scenes, so the player doesn't know they are being judged on a moral scale. If the player was making morality choices throughout the game without being told which options are good or bad, their actual moral alignment would come to light, and the game would make people think about the decisions they made. But since this game tells you immediately the good and evil options, people will choose what the game tells them is good or bad rather than what they actually believe, this morality system reveals nothing about the player, and has little bearing on the direction the story actually goes. People's true moral standing comes most to light when morality isn't in their thoughts at all. Since the morality system doesn't make me question my moral alignment, or have any serious consequences story wise, why should I care about making these decisions? I make decisions in the real world because I am concerned with their consequences.This game gets a lot of recognition for its charm, I'd credit the game's tone. While the story, characters and setting are not exactly super compelling, especially on RPG standards, the tone is handled quite well. The tone of this game lends Fable a pretty memorable atmosphere. The most prominent example of the game's use of tone is right from the beginning when a light hearted intro is suddenly cast aside by a quite jarring, uncomfortable and expectation flipping tonal shift as tragedy strikes the main character. This intro is a nice kick-off to the game's plot, and gets the player ready to start the game. Unfortunately charm alone can't hold up a game.I feel Fable, while not as offensively simplistic as its sequels, is still too lacking in sophistication on a gameplay standpoint for me to consider it a solid action RPG, and I cannot recommend it to anyone.

												A classic. Your village gets attacked by a group of bandits. Your sister gets taken, your dad gets killed, and a stranger teleports you to the heroes guild to become stronger and avenge your father. This game is such a good RPG if you look at the dated it was created.But then they ruined the whole Fable title. If you,re going to buy a Fable game, buy this one. The others suck.			"

												It's taken me about 8 years to get around to it, but I've finally mustered up the desire to beat Fable: The Lost Chapters - and it's taken me around 10 years to beat EITHER version of Fable. It was my first (quasi-)RPG on my first game console; so yes, I do have quite a few fond memories of this game in my youth. Does that mean that this game gets a rose-tinted reccomendation, free from the burden of actual critique? Far from it.In terms of tone and presentation, Fable: The Lost Chapters is unique. It's one of the few fantasy settings in a video game I can think of that doesn't take much influence from Tolken: while some of the more tropey fantasy creatures such as Trolls and Nymphs are present, there are quite a few original creations, too. The artstyle and general world design echoes more traditional fantasy, giving the impression that one is, yes, in a fable. Top that off with tounge-in-cheek writing, a fantastic soundtrack by Russel Shaw, and vocal talent that is evidently from creator company Lionhead Studio's home town of Guildford, England, and Fable feels extremely fresh more than 10 years later. However, the mirror-sheen production values can't hide a game that is, for lack of a better word, pretentious. Every mechanic, encounter, and story element is played up to be grandiose and epic in scale, but after the first few hours, the game clearly is clearly struggling to swim to the deep end of the pool. The game's most notable feature, the morality system, is represented by ""good boy"" and ""bad boy"" scale (note: may not actually be what they are called in-game), and the extent of how much the game changes boils down to horns or a halo on your characters head, and wether or not townsfolk run away screaming or endlessly clap their hands above their hands yelling ""AAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYY"" (no, seriously). Most good boy points are aquired by saving people from attackers; most bad boy points are acquired by killing every non-combatant in sight. Even during major, story-influencing events, the choices are presented to you in a yes-or-no question asked by the game; the only remnants of what you did afterwards are an entry in your character's journal and villagers straight up telling you exactly what you did a few quests ago. The system is so arbitrary and easily-manipulated that you can go from villian to hero in a couple binary choices' time. Worried about a hard choice? Don't worry, the game will compansate you equally either way, so even if you choose not to do something that would be rewarding, you'll still get an alternative item or money for participating.The combat and leveling don't leave much room for role-playing. You can level up your hero's abilities ad infinitum; sure, you'll specialize at first, but what will you do when you've leveled up your specialities' abilties nearly all the way and have spare expirience to spend on less-leveled abilites? As a result, the game's combat becomes all too easy and boring very quickly, and never compensates for your higher level. The game at least tracks how you play, so it gives you a nice illusion of having your own playstyle by giving you a title based on magic, bow, and sword use. By the game's end, your character will end up the same mary-sue every playthrough save for how many good or bad boy points you've earned and what clothing from the game's extremely limited wardrobe you've chosen to adorn your character with. And the rest of the game is just fluff. You can get married! Except there is very little reason to unless you want to get underpowered weapons gifted to you from time to time. Prices vary between shops, so you can be a buisnessman and buy low and sell high! Except that the price range doesn't change all that much, and by the time you're buying and selling really expensive items you'll be rolling in too much dough for it to matter. You can buy houses and shops and rent them out! Except you make tons more money for completing quests anyway, and you don't have to go out of you way to pick up your reward that way. Maybie my nostalgia goggles are broken, but even after understanding that Fable: The Lost Chapters didn't live up to the hype all those years ago, it still managed to dissapoint me. The whole game felt like it was one big lie that someone was trying desperately to show that it was true. Given the precendence of Lionhead Studios and it's rather hyperbole-prone founder, I guess I shouldn't be too suprised. Well played, Peter.			"

												It would be nice if there was an absolutely clear indication of whether you can use a controller with a game or not.  I HATE USING A KEYBOARD TO PLAY GAMES!!!!!  That is why they make game controllers.  Fable Anniversary lets you use a controller so one would figure that this game would let you use one as well.			"

												I was never able to get it to work on my main computer, even after countless hours of forum searching and troubleshooting. I had played it at one point on another computer at homes -and it was good- but after seeing how many people online have had issues with it, I wouldn't suggest purchasing this edition from Steam.

												It's very short. If you want a good RPG where you can choose to be good or evil, you should prefer knight of the old republic.Thanks to Beagán comment, I explain why I'm saying ""It's very short"" :Yes, i played it 28h but in fact i tried to compare the good and evil side, so it's more like 2x 14h. And I was very disapointed. If I read again :""Each person you aid, each flower you crush, and each creature you slay will change this world forever"" [...] ""Create your life story from childhood to death""but it's not very like that, the side you choose is not very important. And there is a big ellipsis from child to adult. So it's not a bad game but since I buyed it for that I feeled like I was lied.			"

												The only reason i bought this game was because i was looking for games to play with a controller, and i remembered playing this on xbox. Of course i assumed it supported controllers, which is my bad because i didn't actually check to make sure. I tried to play it with mouse and keyboard, and it is horrible. If you can deal with the lack of controller support, then you might enjoy this title.			"

												The game is good though short, but buy Fable Anniversary instead, its the same game with upgraded graphics, and built in controller support.

Posted: March 12, 2016
												I am not reviewing this game in the perspective of ""at the time it came out"" or comparing the editions in any way. I'm reviewing this game as it is, for what it was to me playing it in 2016.TL;DR: I wanted to like this game a lot but overrall I couldn't get over how clumsy it is. I personally cannot recommend it to anyone. I'm sure it was more worth playing at its time, but in 2016 you have so many better RPGs at hand and this is not one of those timeless classics, which I truly thought it would be.To start, the save system is an absolute disaster. You can manually save the game while you play, but when you're in a quest you can ""hero save"" which saves your items and stats but not your quest progress. In any case, both of them are extremely problematic. It's not actually consistent what saves and what doesn't, and the game is in no way smart about making sure it saves properly. For example, at some point the game forgot that I had completed a side quest, but it remembered that I had used the items required in the quest.... so basically, it made the quest impossible to complete. On a later save, a bunch of my money disappeared but it remembered the things I had bought during that same session. It just picks and chooses what it remembers and what it doesn't, occasionally breaking an entire storyline altogether. This alone is a game breaker.Now to combat. Fighting against one enemy, combat is sort of fun. You lock on to your target, you can hack and roll and block to be a formidable fighter. As soon as 2+ enemies come at you, it all falls apart. Blocking becomes useless (actually, blocking performs inconsistently to begin with). The target system is supposed to let you switch between targets but doesn't realistically let you do that in a helpful way. Most players invest in a physical shield that uses mana as a defense and doesn't allow you to use your block; this to me is a screaming flaw. So to get through a wave of baddies without being seriously hurt, you need to use an overpowered spell and consume 10 mana potions? That sounds like a cheap exploit, not like enjoyable combat. In many ways, this game rewards you for overpowering easy spells and punishes you for trying to take part in actual melee or ranged combat.The enemies seem to be very inconsistent. You will face an enemy and find it easy to mow down, then moments later you'll come across another one and it seems to have infinite health. I don't know what the basis is, exactly. When you run into some bandits on the way to a destination and it takes 5 minutes to get rid of them in the same repetitive chop chop chop get knocked over drink mana put up shield chop chop chop sequence, it just becomes tedius. You can recruit some expensive mercenaries to help you, but in my experience the auto target likes to aim at them during battle. So I'll have ten generic looking bandits, each with a totally random mystery amount of health, swarming me while my auto-target aims at my mercenary or the person I'm supposed to be escorting to safety. What? How does that help me in any way?There are two cosmetic mechanics in the game that are really cool to a point but become rather irritating. First of all, your character ages each time you level up skills. This is an interesting mechanic, except that nothing else ages in the same way and it is way too drastic. By time you finish leveling, you look old and withered (you are 65). Meanwhile, everone else looks EXACTLY THE SAME. The children in the game are still children. This makes aging utterly meaningless; it just ruins your toon if you care about how he looks. The other mechanic is scarring: As you get damaged in battle, you develop scars over time. This is actually really cool, until you realize that your face gets cut up like butter. Given the awful combat system I mentioned, you are GOING to get attacked and after only a few hits you will get a new cut or your old cuts will become more prominent. In the end, it's just scratching up your character for no reason. The only thing that can stop it is the afforementioned mana shield which basically strips combat of any actual skill and devolves it into hacking at your opponent as fast as you can so as to avoid being hit, and gulping down mana potions if you do get hit.The characters in this game are f***ing irritating. There were a few funny moments that genuinely made me laugh, but for each of those there are dozens of nerve grating lines of dialogue. For a game that's so cartoonish and silly, there isn't really any heart to it because the storyline is entirely cliché and there isn't a single likeable or relateable character in the game There are a lot of small features in the game like the chance to buy and sell for profit, marriage, owning a house, etc. Unfortunately, all of them are mere distractions and offer no real depth whatsoever. Since none of the characters are actually likeable, and marrying one just involves pressing ""laugh"" ""flirt"" ""show off muscles"" and giving gifts, it is entirely purposeless. You buy a house so that they can live in it, or so you can rent it out for gold. Let's talk about gold: There is a memory game you can play in the tavern that is extremely easy to win and on which you can bet thousands of gold pieces. You can win all the money you need from it, making everything to do with currency in the game entirely meaningless. Why should I do quests boasts (an interestnig feature where you bet money on accomplishing quests with special limitations) if I can just make all that money from a game of memory? Why wouldn't I just buy all the best armor there is if I can get all the money I need at any time? Any progression pertaining to the spending of money is undermined. I think the best example of how this game tacks in random features to make it seem better than it is is the experience orbs: When you defeat an enemy, it leaves experience orbs which you collect for experience. Well, why the hell are they little orbs which I can miss? Why wouldn't the game just allow me to have the experience? That exemplifies how the game sort of makes ""features"" out of non features. Why would I choose to be evil when it'll literally be like ""save this person or brutally murder them?"" Why would I buy and sell for money when I can gamble for it easily? Why would I choose to be a swordsman or archer when I can just acquire some overpowered spells?The sad thing is, for all the roleplaying features the game boasts, there is actually no real variety in how you play. Things are pretty much predetermined for you, and the choices are an illusion or a gimmick.I dare anyone who thinks I'm not being fair to this game to look up a strategy forum. Pretty much any serious player used loopholes, exploits, or overpowered spells in order to play the game and do well. If you want to actually play the game in the way it presents itself and that has meaning to it, you will probably find it isn't worth the trouble.Altogether, I'm glad I finally got around to playing a game from the Fable series just so I could check it out, but I don't plan to actually finish the game as there is no reason to do so.

												I think this game may have been great in 2004, but I never played it back then. Nowadays I don't like it mostly because of it's combat system. You have to score as many consecutive hits as possible without getting hit yourself, to get the combat multiplier up. Unfortunately when I see anyone attack it's far too late to get a block up/dodge. You can kill things this way, but it feels like button smashing to me. The flying nymphs who constantly summon melee fighters to attack you are incredibly annoying, as you can only hit them with your bow with the target lock on system, which i could not get to lock on to the enemy i wanted to attack but instead the nearest enemy, which was not the nymph but all the summoned melees.The good/evil choice system is interesting, i just couldn't find a motivation to do anything evil. I thought the hero suffered enough evil in his youth and got rescued by good ones to feel that good is the only path for him and there are no great rewards for being evil. BUT it's still better than Fable III which i could only stand for 2 hours before deleting it.			"

												Clickorgy during fights. If you fail at a quest you cannot start directly at that quest again but start somewhere else in the map where you have to run a lot and kill the spawning enemies over and over...or you can just zip through by clicking the middle mouse button - since then no enemy can harm you at all. It´s ok - but gets old after a while. Nice soundtrack, nice art style. Seems open world, but isn´t. Quests don´t make sense - rescuing traders has no consequences to the further game. It gets very tedious after some funny skits (like expressions or different things to wear).			"

												I bought it because it supposedly had an amazing story. Other than a few good parts (escaping from prison was cool), it was mostly memorable only for the annoyances. The ""Chicken Chaser"" joke was funny for the first three hours, but the repetition of the same voice acting wherever I went slowly drove me insane. The fact that ALL guards EVERYWHERE look and sound EXACTLY the same also killed any immersion and sense of exploration. It's like the kingdom got its guards from Kamino.I ended up skipping most of the sidequests and unlockables, and I look back on the game as somewhat of a waste.It probably held up better at the time, but it's no Bioshock. It's not even Skyrim's little brother in terms of story (and Skyrim only had a decent main storyline). Gameplay is surprisingly good for a game this old though (lightning!) and it has a blend of action and tab-targeting combat, so there's that.  I still can't recommend it though. Go play something else if you want gameplay, and avoid this one if you want a good story.			"

Unfortunately, this game's core selling point is a mere gimmick. To top it off, Lost Chapters has zero controller support and even with all the side quests, it's very short for an rpg. My recommendation is that you play rpg's where choices actually matter, hence, anything but Fable series.			"

												Overall the game is pretty addictive and fun to play.The only thing that is extremely frustrating to the point that it pisses me off is theway the enemies attack later in the game. You have to be super on point when it comes to blocking and moving.Otherwise you will just get hit repeatedly and it will affect your multiplier quite often.In the part of the game with all of the skeletons, they pop up from under the ground right before you and attack you over and over and over and over right as they come up. You can't block it and you can't avoid it unless you slowly creep along the pathways and hallways. That is extremely stupid in my opinion and a total waste of healththat you can't avoid losing.Other than that, the game is pretty fun. I have played through as a good character, now I'm playing through as evil.Once I'm done, I won't be playing it ever again. It's sorely lacking on player experience.			"

												About the worst camera work I've ever seen being put into an action/rpg game. The moment you enter any sort of cave your entire field of view starts shooting everywhere. The friendly AI is trash, the enemy AI is trash, and the only way you might ever die by their hands is if you get swarmed by them like a bunch of ants. And that happens a lot, pretty much anytime when you're in a quest. I'm not going to comment on the voice over since everyone has different preference on that one, but it does get repetitive quickly. I'll say one thing though, for a PC port it runs rather smoothly, so I guess that's a plus.			"

												Ran it on Windows 8.1 While it worked great the first time I ran it and even played for 3 hours, when I tried to run it the next day the game became unplayable because of contstant crashes right after the intro movies which prevented me from even getting into my game.Yes I tried all the possible fixes suggested, including all types of Windows compatibility mode, Data Execution Prevention, rerouting sound through motherboard. Every time it crashes you ""Verify integrity of game cache"" and there is always one file missing that redownloads. But it just doesn't work. Sometimes a combination of fixes works randomly but the very next moment if you quit and restart, the same problem comes again. I don't want to waste 2 hours everytime I want to play just to see what will randomly work today.Too bad. I was so excited to on a journey through Fable's world and all hope was shattered. From the little I experienced I found it to be delightful but alas! I wish I could get a refund seeing as how Valve stills puts the OS compatibility of this game as Windows XP or later in the store page.			"

												This is a game which could have been decent (even though it really shows its age). Unfortunately, the user interface is very poorly designed. To add insult to injury, the save system is probably the most idiotic that I have ever seen. You can save only very rarely in predetermined points (that you don't always know about). If any mission is a failure, the only option is to redo it until it succeeds. Ignoring failures is not even an option. The silliness of the ""moral"" system is not better either. There are no moral quandaries: just choices between ""saving the kitten"" and ""crushing the kitten with your boots"". Stupid. Poor design.			"

												No controller support on a game that was made on a console with controller support. Use xpadder I guess. Nothing new has changed other than that on this game if you were one of the millions of people that bought this game more than a decade ago on the promise from its boneheaded creator that it was gonna be the most amazing thing out there with so many features (that sadly weren't in the game). You run around killing monsters, following a moderately good RPG story and do other stuff as well. Such as collecting, playing mini games and choosing wheter to be a good or bad guy. Most games do what it does better and just to name one around the time that this game out was Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. The Knights of the Old republic game also  was better on the rpg aspect and really letting you feel like you're making good choices or bad choices. The second fable to me personally was a better investment than this, but if it happens to go on sale you should buy it. After all we here at Steam believe in racking in as many games on our library and completely ignoring them when other games we will ignore as well go on sale.			"

I guess it's still fun, and ofcourse it's not gonna be the same as the first time. You can see for the playtime that I enjoyed some time on it however I'm still reluctant to 'recommend it'.

												I wish there was a ""I liked it but I don't think it's worth getting"" option. I've played through this game three times, two to completion; and the third time is why I don't recommend getting this game. My first time I played a warrior, the game was a piece of cake. I had like two points in mage and so when I got to the point where you had to used ranged -- it was slow and I went through a ton of healing potions but doable. The same thing with playing a mage. If anything after a few levels it was beyond easy to run around and basically wipe the floor with anything that came close. There's lots of threads that talk about how OP mage is for good reason, the game is a cake walk with it.But the third playthough I wanted to do a pure archer. Only turns out you can't. There are certain quests where you will get mobbed even trying to be extremely sneaky and one shot people with max range -- certain quests essentially require close combat. I don't mind when a certain combat style or class, is overpowered and much easier to play through. In fact that's sometimes a plus; but to have a whole class be nearly impossible to win with does bother me. I don't actually think you can complete the final boss battle as an archer -- it's again structured to give an advantage to mages and warriors who can take damage close combat style. Maybe I'm missing something, because there's certainly gear and setups for all three combat styles, but it just feels like range is really underpowered throughout. Overall, you really do become insanely powerful proportionally quickly. The later levels were honestly overly easy, even with the additional content added, I still breezed through it all. Wearing plate as a warrior you're essentially invulnerable; and you can get several swords that can single shot almost everything. There's no real challenge to the game.That all being said -- I consider it ""adventure game lite"" in that it's short enough to beat in an afternoon and have seen all the content and feel satisfied that you played a whole game. Excluding silver key and demon door hunting there's about 7 hours of content per playthrough, which makes in a nice fix for wanting to play a RPG but not wanting to invest 100+ hours in an elder scrolls game.I would say it was kiddie -- but there's enough sexual innuendoes, and a brothel outright at one point, that make it rated-M and so it just falls into a category where it feels like something I would let a kid play as introduction to the genre but it has moments of being a little to edgy for that.Pros+ Easy difficulty+ Good lengthCons- Unmemorable story- poorly balanced combat triangle "

												The game was one of my faves when it was released. Unlike most RPGs, there were immense amounts of choices on how to build, and essentially, how to play as well. There is a main storyline, of course, and a presecribed path to take, but the game does sell on its promised choose your destiny format.That said, gameplay is quite broken in general, and takes adjustment if you wish to scrape by without the broken aspects. For instance, you can make money simply buy buying and selling stuff to the same shopowner, as his stocks of items fluctuate the cost. Additionally, the most broken skill in the game is Physical Shield, as it not only keeps you from taking any damage at all, but you don't get thrown around, and you never lose your precious combat multiplier, so long as you chug mana potions, and that helps break the game wide open for you. But, in general, any character can grind to the point of being all-powerful, with some time invested, of course, as any build path is open for any character, as even though ""Being good"" or ""Being bad"" does influence your skill pool minimally, it's even more minute because fluctuating between good and bad is not difficult (especially for being bad...). All that aside, the game was pretty much the first game to give a hero any type of plotline choices that I saw, and I must commend them for that. However, the game has a poor look for being released on Steam nowadays, and only diehard plot enthusiasts or general gamers who want to experience it all will enjoy this. I had to buy it for old time's sake, and while it has managed to accrue a bit of playtime, I don't see many out there enjoying this for what it's worth in this age of gaming. I really don't know of anything like Fable still, and I enjoyed it more than Fable III (haven't played the others...), but getting through the early game will be hard to weather through to get to the better parts of the plotline and become strong enough to feel less than some shrimpy character at times. In my opinion, casters are very underpowered, partly because Physical Shield is so overpowered, and will sap your mana if you don't kill things fast enough as a caster. The other paths get so much more powerful, and I don't see why you'd even bother. Still a huge step in the right direction for a choose-your-own-path type adventure, but there is still a clearly prescribed path, like any adventure with an adversary. It just has good areas you can stray from the path a bit, and they will effect your destiny in various ways.I checked... I played it on Steam for 2nd most hours compared to any reviewer, and that's not all that much... I don't know what that could mean for certain, but I'd guess that the majority of reviewers who upvoted it are in it for the nostalgia. It was a good game in its heyday, but I believe that the strengths of this game would be overshadowed too much by its weaknesses in today's gaming environment, even at its lower price. There are a number of games that deserve being carried over into today, but while this one is on the fence for me, I'm leaving my opinion where it was; This game doesn't hold enough appeal to stand out amongst today's games.

												i'm only going to do this because i didn't have a good experience with this version of the game. hpoefully the remake of it will be better, but if you loved this game with a controller, you won't like this version of it.this version og the game, i noticed had problems, maybe it's my computer or just the old hardware it ran on.but there are physics glitches in cutscenes that really jar the experience, and i don't remember if it was this bad on the console but it kind of hurt after a while.i also had this weird lag in menus, so it'd take a bit of time to get the mouse over what you wanted to click on. i also noticed lots of flisckering with teh lighting in ares of the game.one of the worst parts of this though, is thta there isn't any controller support, so you have to put up with the weird keys to play the game. i tried rebinding keys, but important ones i wanted to bind couldn't be changed from where they were set.i'd think all of these things really made me not care about how i played the game. i did still have fun though. i went as far as to play all of the story and the dlc, because i wanted to have a full feel of how it ran on pc and not give up and give it a bad review.personally, i'd say, if you really wanted this, that you could take your chances with the remake, since it looks like it's more promising, and i hpoe it'll run better than this. but if you want this, since it's cheaper, don't let anyone tell you not to.if you get this as a gift from a friend, like i did, thank them and have fun.

												Might be an awesome adventure, but for some unknown reason the developers decided to put a camera bounce when you turn  Everytime you move the camera left to right, or right to left then stop, instead of stopping it wobbles /bounces a little. I'm sure it's a ""nice"" effect, but it doesn't take too long for the nausa to kick in. So if you know you suffer from motion sickness from games that have fixed FOV then there is a reasonable chance you will suffer whilst trying playing this game.

												I played hours upon hours of this game when I was younger, closer to it's release. Upon replaying it, I still enjoyed myself, but wasn't horribly impressed. The morality mechanics, feel dated, heavy handed, and ultimately pointless, and the story isn't anything particularly special. This is by no means a bad game, the gameplay still holds up fairly well, particularly the character building, but if you don't have any nostalgic attachment and are looking for a variable RPG experience, you'd be better off picking up Skyrim, Mass Effect, or KOTOR instead.

												Peter Molyneux can suck a big ol' butt, with his damn overhyping of every game he has created. ""Oh, trees and other plants will grow as you progress in a realistic manner! Your choices matter! raiding a village can have a big effect on the world, a forest can probably grow in its place or it will become the new base for bandits! Your choices matter! The people of Albion's look on you will change depending on your morals! YOUR CHOICES, ♥♥♥♥ING, MATTER. What we got in truth was a mediocre, ridiculously easy, and downright boring excuse for an RPG, where your choices have absolutely no effect on ANYTHING. So, on to the review, my time with Fable started off with excitement, I enjoyed the game in the beginning until I noticed the flaws. The first and one of my biggest problems, healing items were absurdley common, I found them at literally every turn I made, not to mention: Resurrection phials, something that keeps you from actually dying and lose your progress, were also needlessyly common, not that I ever needed them, I had over 99 health potion on me at all times, not to mention I had well over 500 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ things of red meat, which resulted in me ALWAYS having max resurrection phials.Next awful part, the story, Now what makes an RPG good besides the feeling of growing stronger and feeling like a hero? A non-generic, non-cliché, interesting and well thought out story. Does Fable the lost chapters include this, not in the least bit, it has a boring story with an overused theme that has been in every fable game to this date, ""Oh I'm a Hero looking to seek revenge on the stupid butts that killed a certain member of my family, erp a derp a dur!"" Characters are uninteresting and have no soul (well more soul than Fable 2 I guess, what a ♥♥♥♥ing mess).On to combat, role a mage/melee build, use berserk and physical and divine fury or infernal wrath, repeatedly click using whatever overpowered as hell weapon you own, assign both mana and health potion to 1 and 2 on your keyboard and spam the ♥♥♥♥ out of those, win the game.Finally, what makes Fable completely fall apart, the overhyped theme of your choices effecting the world. Peter Molyneux originally would constantly brag about how every morale choice you make in Fable ompletely effect those around you, when I played through the whole game, at no point did I think that my choices were effecting ANYTHING, I actually played through sections twice to see the difference between my choices, did anything change? Barely, except for my devil horns (oh no I'm slightly more ugly than I was before.)Overally Fable the lost chapters is really not a too good of a game, it can hold your attention for roughly 30 hours or so but has no real replayability, luckily it is only $10 on steam, so it isn't really stealing your money.

												The game keeps crashing during the intro; can't even skip it or it freezes, play through the whole intro and it freezes into a black screen. I guess I'm better off playing Fable Anniversary with it's terrible graphics ):			"

												Didn't work on my very standard Windows 7 PC (i5, GeForce 560 Ti) ... Not really worth spelunking through google debug tweaks or contacting Microsoft support.Got it for $2, so no big deal, but it seems that it's not something that works out of the box for others as well, based on what I've seen online.So, be weary!

												Right. I haven't played the game for too long, but these are my two cents on the matter -The voice acting absolutely kills the game.I am really not trying to be racist, or to bash an 'older' game for having low quality, but the voice acting in this game is just SO BAD. For a game that's really suppoused to immerse you in a fantasy world, the voice acting just throws you off. Aside from that, though, the game's good. So I guess if you're deaf and therefore can't hear what these characters say, go for it.			"

												Kinda excited when I got it, 40 minutes in and... not so much. Terrible voice acting, sound is crap. I think I got motion sickness from playing this. The metacritic score wasn't bad so I thought I'd give it a shot. And then I did more research and... lo' behold. Peter Molyneux's name came up. This game is so him. Full of promise, but it falls somewhat short. Probably... not going to touch this again. Not with so many games out there to give my attention to.			"

												This game shows it's age. Not just in graphics, but in plotline. Maybe the voice acting and side quest mechanics were interesting at the time, but now? Meh. Specific points:Marketed as a game where you could have influence in the world, but....-You can be mayor. What does it mean to be mayor? Nothing. You don't do anything, noone reacts.-You can own property. What does it mean to own property? Not much. You can upgrade the furnishings, hang trophies on the wall, and collect rent. And then never go back, because why would you?-You can get married. Find one of the many nameless NPCs and stand in front of them to show off your manly pectorals. Then throw a ring at them. You now have access to the sex scene, which is a fade to black with suggestive voice acting. Never interact with your wife again.-You can be good or evil. What's the difference? Halos or demon horns. You could slaughter the innocent one day, vanquish the wicked the next, and that's totally fine.The running theme is that none of these decisions impact the story greatly. You can occasionally choose: ""kill this dude"" or ""don't kill this dude."" That'll affect 2 or 3 scenes. Basically doesn't matter.Not sure what to say about the core gameplay. I found it very easy, but YMMV.======================================================Response to first comment:I am skeptical of your rebuttal, and examined faqs and forum posts to investigate.Are you sure about that mayor thing? Everything indicates that it does nothing. I did learn that I COULD purchase and rent out buildings and businesses other than the marital homes in each town, but you have to kill the tenant to do so. Which...geez. Talk about a hostile takeover. *rimshot* Anyway, nobody reacted to me as mayor. And no new properties became available for rent. All signs point to violent death being the only way other property becomes available.Still not sure what the point of renting things out is. It'd take an awful lot of time just making the rounds accumulating rent to earn the money back, and what is there to spend the money on? There's some legendary sword you can buy with it I guess, but there's dozens of legendary weapons sitting around everywhere anyways. You can pour it into the temple of Avo to shift alignment over to good. That's something I guess, but getting good alignment just happened as a natural result of going through the main quest, since every monster or bandit killed gave some good alignment points.Didn't realize the spouse would give gifts. So that's something.All indications also point to never having a child of one's own, that was added in Fable 2.  If you marry the right person in Bowerstone, and they happen to be a single parent of one of the children in the school, then the child may be brought along. No sign that the child would eventually act like you. The aging mechanic gets weird here too, since you might get married at age 30, get married, meet your stepchild, then advance levels to age 65 and the stepchild is still the same age. Good and evil have more result than most of these other effects, but...eh. Complaining that I'm not locked in? Hm. Perhaps I would like to be locked in a little bit. Redemption and corruption stories are interesting, and I don't want to always have to be the stupendously good-aligned butterfly-attracting goodly hero of goodness just because I ate some Tofu one time, but yeah. When I decided to try the other alignment, it was unsatisfying. Swapping the extremes is just too easy, and too without consequence. It doesn't seem the game particularly cares. Townsfolk alternately run away from me or come around to applaud me, and both are kind of annoying. Big clusters of sound files all being played at once either way.I don't know what your last comment is supposed to imply. Do you mean I shouldn't have needed to spend that much time to complete the main storyline? I could have dropped the sidequests and paid even less attention to the economy, I guess. Do you mean I should have realized that I could kill townspeople and buy their houses? I was definitely surprised to learn that, but I don't see why I would.			"

												Not bad but not great, though it is only 10 bucks so you're getting what you pay for. This game feels pretty restrictive by today's standards in terms of what you can do and where you can roam. Also the good/evil mechanic is very simplistic compared to other games, even ones that are older than Fable (being evil just means helping out bandits, other games allow you to join assassin's guilds or criminal syndicates, or even to join a despotic tryannical government over a democratic people's revolt). The characters lack complexity or depth, your main ""rival"" Willow for instance seems to despise you for no other reason than to give you an opportunity to have a rival. I did enjoy the ability to be an entrepreneur and invest in properties, trade goods for profit etc. and the character customisation, I guess I just expected a lot more though considering the hype around this game. 5/10 from me.

												A long time ago, when this game first came out, there were a bunch of people telling me how awsome this game was.  Originally it was only for the XBOX.  Years later it was on Steam and I got it cheap.  I have played it for 20 hours, but I did not finish it.  I finished the main quest, but once I got to the expansion part, I just couldn't make myself play it any more.  The people who made this game sure had some strange Ideas such as the color of your clothes causing NPC reactions, what kind of mustache actually matters, etc...Anyway the UI is horrid.  The mechanics are somewhat simplistic.  I do not care about any of the NPCs in the game.   Perhaps at the time it was revolutionary, but it has not aged well.   It did spawn 2 sequals.  I am not sure why.  I can't reccomend it, however if you are bored and this is very cheap and you go in with low expectations, you might be pleasntly surprised.			"

												Ummm, no.Camera is horrible and makes me want to puke lazer beam.Shift to collect exp orb? huh? you wont earn any exp if you don't collect any exp orb.Combat is very clunky and impossible. Target lock system is bad.Considering other game of the same year like Gothic 2, Fable falls flat with everything. Metacritics of 83? And everyone hyping this game? Overhype at it best.I can play gothic and enjoy it but this game, its going to the bin.			"

												The creator of this game has been called a lier for years over the fact that he failed to deliver on the epic scope of this game.  I resevered my hate because I had not played the game.  Now that I have, I feel that he deserves all the hate mail he has reseved.  I think any game that you have to force yourself to play is bad.  Even though I only played a few hours of this game, I regret all the time I lost.  The plot drags, the combat is dull,  and I can't even say it's a pretty game.			"

												Bought this after reading so much praise on Metacritics and the likes of it...Well, i have to say i thoroughly disagree with the critics and user reviews...This game is just a botched attempt at creating an interesting RPG experience:the whole idea of following your character through his life... just not true, you play just chunks of the prologue where you are a youngling and then you are an adult like everybody else in the proper game.-- Combat F****G sucks! Never experienced such flawed combat system, you just mindlessly punch your mouse buttons and hope to not be interrupted... pure boredom after a while-- Incredibly silly storyline with childish writings ( sister appearance is just nonsensical )-- Can't speak for everybody else but with my SB X-Fi audio card the dialogue were just massively flawed, like they were coming only from my left or right side altogheter.. no actual mixing left me appalled and annoyed after a whileThere are MUCH MUCH better games in this RPG sub genre, don't waste your time on this one			"

												I saw Peter Molyneux at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.			"

												I don't even feel like this deserves a review. I have tried every Fable game as they came out and they were all without exception garbage. Remember how everyone acknowledged Fable 3 as a terrible, shallow game full of idiotic characters, dull to the point of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ storyline, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to the point of dull button mashing gameplay? Yeah, that's actually every Fable game as seen through the eyes of people who are no longer 8-12 years old and couldn't read all the text in Morrowind.It's not ""fine for it's time"", idiots were fine with it at the time. Games far superior were released a decade before Fable decided to leave it's hideous stain on gaming history. Thanks for supporting the career of one of the game industries many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t celebrity developers while dumbing down an entire genre.			"

												When the original Fable title launched on the original Xbox console, I bought it and loved it so much that I recommended it to my friends. When the Lost Chapters version launched a year or more later, I traded in my Fable game and upgraded to The Lost Chapters. In 2009, I purchased the PC version at retail for only $10 to have it on my PC. I then purchased it again recently off of Steam (at a price only a madman would refuse to pay) to have a Steam copy always available. I also plan on buying the HD remake coming to Xbox 360 in 2014. I have purchased the game 4 times, and will purchase it for a 5th time. This game is fantastic, and is the best in the series. Buy this and give it a play through if you have not done so. It's funny and charming.			"

												This was a very good game with a lot of character control (in-game appearance, personality, interactions, and various, evolve-able fighting styles). I played this game in Spanish to help me learn, so for my purposes it had just a little less repetitiveness than I wanted but that also forced me to learn more and made the game a fast pace. I beat the game both as pure good and pure evil and experimented with some of the exploits. Fable claims that different choices you make in game affect the rest of the game and it is definitely true. I especially like how the game can differentiate between minor things that you do. For example, killing an innocent npc as a pure good character will still make the other npcs in the area scream and run away from you. Likewise, doing some random good thing as pure evil with people around will cause them to stop running for a bit and clap as if you're not about to kill them all. 3:) There are also levels of attractiveness and scariness that influence what others think of you. I think it's great that the game forces you to fatten up if you want a side-quest type item. All in all, great game; definitely worth playing.			"

												Do I recommend this game? Of course. This game is so much fun, from slaughtering towns of innocent people to slaughtering camps of evil bandits ya can't go wrong. Please take my word when I say DO NOT COMPARE THIS TO THE OTHER FABLES. This is a unique and wonderful game. It is so unlike the fables you wont belive it. You wll spend hours playing through the same game, this time being the sneaky bowman rather than the evil hammer man. It offers play beyond the end and even an expansion pack! I BECAME THE CHICKEN CHASER. I was the legendary hero that saw his own village massared before his eyes, had his sister get her eyes sliced out, and father well he was kind of a wimp. Anyway each playthrough is definatley one of a kind. My favorite thing to do is bring people to the chapel of skorm and sacrifice them. Ahh the pleasure I derive. Plus you can fish until midnight! Skorm's bow brings warmth to my heart as it helps me erradicate the wonderful people of albion and still walk around with a halo.I have sunk so many hours into playing this game and would not tell you it was a good game if I did not believe it. It is worth every penny because you will get so much out of this game. and remember when your health is low have some food or potions. -Chicken chaser! haha he chases chickens!!-			"

												I used to play this game on Xbox when it was just Fable. The extra storyline in this version just blows away any other RPG i have played in quite a while. The only new-ish RPG that comes close to this game that has the same style of play would be Fable 2, yes i know its the same people but thats the thing noone else makes a game quite as good as this IMO. So lets go over the 4 categories I like to write my reviews on (other than Combat Arms, doesnt even deserve the time anymore, yes it used to deserve it). Now onwards,1) Graphics 8/10Obviously the graphics are going to look and seem old, but thats one fo the tings i love about this game. It gives the game a classic feeling. If you prefer older textures that dont look all 8-bit then this game has just the right graphics for you. (I would do 10/10 but I do have to take in to account some glitchy textures like your hair looking wiry, etc.)2) Storyline 12/10 (HOLY SH#T)This games storyline will suck you in and make you feel as if you were living it. The narration is just amazing giving you in depth background and current information on whats happening. In the very beginning you start off as a boy trying to get a present for your sisters birthday so you go around doing good deeds so your father will pay you for them (1 gold piece per good deed). *SPOILER ALERT* If you havent played skip to the next rating, After your sister gets her present she knows something is not quite right. You hide in a field while the entire village you knew and loved is being burned and its people slaughtered. A guild master comes and rescues you and you start training as a hero from there on out the story gets more complex and interesting. By far, one of the best storylines I have EVER had the PRIVILEGE to play.3) Character development 7.5/10Yeah this game is slightly lacking in chracter development. You get more famous, you get good or evil, and you choose all your skills. This might sound incredibly amazing but the way they chose to lay it all out is slightly boring. You doo good or bad deeds your alignment changes (obviously). As your alignment changes you get horns and red mist if your evil and butterfllys and a halo if your good. You skills are Strength, Skill, and Will. Stregth is your health, damage and damge taken. Skill is speed, guile(sneakyness), and damage you do with cross/bows. Will is actually the main thing I loved as far as the character development go's hence the 7.5, You are able to choose skills that heal you, damage your foes, make you do more damage, make you take less damage, among an array of other spells you can buy all of them (eventually) for your experience. You earn experience based on which attack you use to deal with enemies and general experience that can be used for all three (skill,strength, and will) trees at your disposal. The alignment and renown is a little clunky but the Skills are very in-depth (if you dont like spending alot of time figuring out what works for you and what you like just stop playing RPGs their not for you)4) Gameplay 9.5/10This games gameplay is amazing as well. I cant give it a 10/10 however because of one tiny detail that I cant get over. When your stealing stuff and noone is looking at you but since they are in the same area you still get caught. THat is so unrealistic. If they didnt see you do it HOW ARE YOU IN TROUBLE. >:(I Anyways other than that the games mechanics and fighting are all very well thought out and its runs great on pretty much all computers (because its an older game).The fighting is in depth yet still easy to control and the other controls for just moving and using spells etc, are well thought out because you dont ahve to use complicated keyboard controls to kick a$$. Its that simple great mechanics make for a great game.OVER ALL RATING Should you play it: If you dont you should blow up your computer.Do I recommend this: YES but only to those people who are serious about RPG's because its a little in deptha and challenging if your not a RPG lover.Rating out of 100: 92.5/100 ( As far as im concerned no game will ever earn 100/100 from me (EVER)			"

												Ahh, the memories... People are very bipolar about Fable, they either love it or hate it. However, I generally enjoyed TLC more than 2 or 3. The greatest thing about it is probably the storyline, mixed with fun gameplay mechanics. Although, in the end you become so overpowered, it's almost a grind. Basically Physical traits+Health potions=WIN or Physical Shield+Mana potions=WIN. Is more balanced than it's sequels. Play it if you like fantasy RPG's.			"

												First off don't class yourself as a true RPG gamer if you've never played this.Firstly this game is the reason I play so many RPGs to date, I played it non-stop on my original XBOX and it never got old and a fewyears later I came across it on here hence the play time.Okay so first the graphics, admittedly by now they are WAY outdated and but don't let that deter you from a true RPG experience. If you can (like a man) get over the shoddy graphics and somewhat corny Yorkshire accent that most people have adopted in game the game delivers one hell of a story. At parts I found it truely gripping and in my opinion still one of the best sories out there. The leveling up system is fun and sometimes challenging. It's a breath of fresh air and I wouldn't have Fable change it at all! So I'm gunna leave this just as a short review because I'm sure potential buyers wouldn't like to read for hours just for me to say this game is great.This game is great! For me it's a well deserved 10/10.			"

												One of my favorite roleplaying games of all time. Originally owned it on the Xbox before the additional 'Lost Chapters' version came out. I saw this version on sale during the Steam Summer Sale and thought to myself, I can't go wrong repurchasing a game, with further expanded story content for a mere $3.39 at the time. Easily was worth every penny, as I got over 29hrs out of it on my replay, thus far.          I must say, even years later as an adult, grown up from my childhood, I can still revel in the excellent gameplay/story. This game was supposed to be monumental and break the mold for choices in a game, easily succeeding in the task, inspiring future games in the genre to come. Thusly, if you are a fan of RPGs and open world combat, feel free to pick this gem up. If anything, I can thoroughly endorse this game, with a lifelong gamer's seal of approval. Have fun in Albion if you found this review helpful.                                                                                                                                                                          10/10 - James			"

												I loved this game when I had it on Xbox. I have heard and seen it as being one of the most disapointing games of it's time, but I loved it. I went into the game blind, and loved it. I think it was because it was expected to be much more, but I was very happy where it was. It had plenty of action, a good story, great characters, and a lot of humor. It had a quite ElderScrolls feel to the leveling up. Instead of like most RPGs, where you get EXP from killing enemies and used that to level up, Fable is a bit different. You do get EXP from killing, but you also get it from doing the killing. You shoot something with an arrow, you get skill EXP. Blast them with lightning, you get will EXP. Bash them with a hammer, you get strength EXP. They do not mix together, so you can't play as pure mage and have a high health. Not from Will EXP, at least. This is where the General EXP come in, the stuff you get from killing and quests. That can be put towards anything. Also, what you do in the game effects your appearence. Like to crunch on little newborn chickens (yes, you can do that) and kill people? A red mist will rise from your feet and eyes, you will become pale, flies will be drawn to you like the corpses you leave behind, and you grow horns (also destroying the majority of your hairstyle). People will run in terror from you, and hate you though your power will keep them from doing anything. But if you play as good, people will flock to, you will get a halo and a beam of light when you stand still. I think your eyes change color, though it has been a long time. Max out strength and you will look like a bodybuilder. Will will make you glow. I can't remember what Skill does. Fighting badly leaves you with scars.I could keep going on, but you should play it yourself. My only complaints are that the GuildMaster gets annoying ""Your health is low. Have you any potions, or food"", and I am having trouble getting the game to run on my computer even though it should be able to run it no problem. But once I get it up and running I won't be doing much else.			"

												Awesome game. Personally my favourite game in the world. this game involves you deeply in the world of albion and putting you in the shoes of well... you. it is your choice to be a hero or a villan.(Good/Bad). if you chose the hero path your body will glow blue and a halo above you head and everyone loves you and applauds when you go near.If you choose Evil you will be feard by everyone they will cower in fright and the demon will come out with horns bursting out of your head. The character customization is astonishing with tattoo's and hair damn even the fasion is beautiful unless you are running around in your underware with the union jack on it. this game has small tweaks for your charecter like magic,strenght,allusion. No real skill trees but even then pulling a sword out of a rock has never been so hard without the phisque needed. This game is loved by millions and millions of people. i highly recomend this game to anyone. And if you have a Xbox and want this game try out the Remade HD Version. 10/10			"

												I recall playing fable and fable III and enjoying the game quite a bit.I purchased the game on sale and my 12y son really got into it, and we both played and finished the game with different characters.This was a lot of fun and I was surprised how good this game actually was and the additional quests from the lost chapters helped increased the overall value.Lots of bugs but those I like: they do not impair stability but instead offer a few exploits to choose from and sometimes offer a pleasant surprise or another element of fun.Lots of humour, exploration, fun ( and easy) combat system and aged but decent graphics. It pushes you to experience both evil and good  ( I usually have a hard time playing the evil characters but I do like in this game)It has some of the most interesting quest system out there as well when you compare to other RPG like games.Overall a great game in my opinion, "

Review:The very first Fable game in my opinion is better than the 3rd and the Fable: The Journey, but cannot isn't as good as the 2nd. Many can argue that point due to P.M.'s false promises, but I felt I enjoyed the 2nd one far more. This review is about Fable - The Lost Chapters NOT the other games, so let's talk about this title, shall we? Fable - The Lost Chapters, the extended edition of... Fable, is a game that many people thought could rival against The Legend of Zelda. Many people have mentioned that this is essentially Zelda, but a more mature version of it, with a different take on RPG Adventure titles by Microsoft. The game has a pretty mediocre story, but that wasn't really what Fable - The Lost Chapters is about in my opinion. Sure, story is very important in Role Playing titles, but this isn't a game where I actually cared about my character or any other character to be honest. I just did what I felt like doing, and that's exactly why I liked this title so much! There's FREEDOM involved! Sure, it's no where near The Elder Scrolls type of freedom, but for it's time it was wonderful, and arguably it still is! The decisions you made had people love you or fear you, and that is why I enjoyed this game, because your character ages, and you feel your decisions effected the growth of your character in the way you wanted him to be at!Personal Experience:I played Fable; both vanilla version of the game and The Lost Chapters on the orignal Xbox, and I've gotta say this is still one of my favorite franchises that Microsoft owns the rights towards. It's a darn shame that Fable 2 never saw the light of day on the PC, because I'd probably still be playing that game if I still owned a Xbox 360; despite finishing all the quests and racking up all that dough by collecting rent from all the houses and stores I owned. I had a snobby Good Guy and a generous Evil Dude, and it was just funny to hear the NPCs fear me, but are thankful I was generous, and vice versa. The jokes in the Fable Universe are relatable to Monty Python's, and that's awesome! Fable - The Lost Chapters had lots of things that were enjoyable about it, but when Fable 2 came out I just couldn't stop playing with the dog. The only thing I actually cared about in the game was a dog that helped me find items by shoveling the areas he was also digging up. I wish I could go into more detail about my experience with Fable - The Lost Chapter, but I just didn't care for it as much compared to Fable 2. In Fable 3 I liked the combat a lot more than the others, but I didn't like how they didn't make it seem like a RPG. There was something about the 3rd title that didn't sit with me, but it wasn't a bad game, it just took away an element that I enjoyed about Fable 2.~ twitch.tv/samsterboy ~			"

The amount of things you can get up to in it was crazzy. so many side uests and random ways to annoy the villagers and what not.Back in the day this game was Ground breaking and was one of the first games to give you the choice to do what you wanted as far as the storyline went. Defenetly the best in the series.The armour and clothing are highly styalised to a cartoony perspective but looks amazing. the uildings are ever so unique, and the storyline very rememberable.If you havent played Fable the lost chapters...Do yourself a favour and BUY IT!!!

												A lot of my peers have written reviews, so I am going to express my opinion on the Steam version of Fable TLC. I remember being 11 years old and getting this game for Christmas for Xbox (yes, the original one) and thinking this cover looks cool, lets hope the story line holds up. My parents knew I was into the Sims and all that, so a decision game might be of my interest. Boy, were they right. This game allows for so many possibilities, and with TLC allows for the good guys to get a sword for being heroic (I had the first one, and I remember when I first beat the game and saved my sister, they were like ""Oh, you were so herioc, giving up power like that"" and not getting a major reward for it. Thankfully, this game has a reward, so no complaints there).If you are looking for a game to stear you down a storyline with little to no variance, this game will be disappointing. This game allows you to make choices and live with the consequences, being a hero, villian, or unprecedented acts of both. Out of all the Fables, this one is definitely worth replaying over and over again. When I found this game on Steam, I had to have it, just to relive some nostalgia of being a kid again. Thanks for reading. GreenEggsPwn			"

												it is a great game, the best Fable game in my opinion, the Third one should be forgotten and the second one it's not bad, besides being a Xbox 360 exclusive but still had framerate issues. This game, however, does not (well, it is a very old game), it runs smoothly for a nVidia user.It's a great game, it's fun, has a great story and is very enganging. I have completed it in the original version and on the Xbox version as well, just bought the Steam version on a daily sale and I plan on playing, and finishing, this game again, however... Now here is the thing, AMD users do not seem to be able to run this game in Windows 8.1, so wait until someone figures out how to run it on Windows 8.1 (just Windows 8 seems to work fine). That and the game does not support a gamepad, yes, the game has made for the original Xbox and yet there is no gamepad support, you can play it very well with a mouse and keyboard and there is software to make a gamepad work with this game, just so you know.As for the price, get it on a sale, 9 € for a ""average"" remastering of a game that might not even work?

												Ok, first off... I have played and completed this game multiple times on the Xbox and oh my this gets better. The nostalgia when playing this game is incredible. I remember the days of kicking chickens and now I get to relive it for PC. I recommend this to anyone who played the orignal on a different platform. Got it for £1.04 on Sale and I love it. :)			"

												Highly reccommend this old time classic of the Original Xbox for a repeat play on the PC. Fable was deffinatly a great RPG of its time for a reason. It still captures me and with the many side quests that I had never tried before still offers new interesting quests.I still find it so hard to be 100% good in this game though haha. You can only be human after all. ^_^			"

												This game is truly amazing, I freakin' love it! In my opinion, this is the only truly impressive game in the Fable series. In this game you play as The Hero Of Oakvale, a young child with dreams of greatness. The game sees you grow from a young punk, into a daring hero, dark warrior, or powerful mage. You can be anything you want in the game, you can even be a naked guy who runs around murdering people with a pic-axe! The game has fairly good graphics for the time, and I think they've aged fairly well.This game's soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks I've heard in an RPG! The theme tune was done by the amazing Danny Elfman, the same guy who did the music for the Spiderman trilogy and The Simpsons. The game allows true character evolution, as your character will evolve depending upon what skills you choose to focus on and your chosen allignment. For example, if you focus on building your strength skills you will become a big muscly giant. If you focus on being a good guy, you will look like Super Saiyan Goku. The game allows you to be whatever you want, and that's what I enjoy.The game does have problems though, and I'm going to avoid talking about the false advertising, because everyone has already bashed on it. One of the main annoyances I've had with the game is it's difficulty. It's way too easy, seriously! Five hours into the game and I'm able to bat everything away with zero effort! Almost all of the magic spells are overpowered and break the game. Do yourself a favor and avoid getting the Slow Time spell, it will kill any fun you can have. On top of that, there are various exploits in the game to get more powerful in a short amount of time. One such example is that the game features Ages potions, which give you a fair boost in EXP in a certain skill tree.The problem? If you have your combat multiplier up high enough and drink the potion, you'll get mad EXP for almost nothing! I had my combat multiplier at 14 and drank a potion, and got 14800 EXP in the will category! Also, the story was fairly predictable at times, and some of the characters seemed flat. I never really liked Briar Rose all that much, and Maze was just lame to me. I'd like Guildmaster more if he didn't pipe random advice into my ear every five seconds. And I found that some sidequests were either really lame, or didn't off much reward. One such quest is one where I have to acquire for blue mushrooms to cure a sick child, but the reward wasn't really that great in the grand scheme of things.Despite all that, I highly reccomend this game! If you're new to open-world RPGs and are on the fence of getting into these kinds of games, Fable would be a good starter for you. It isn't as large or as immerssive as Oblivon, Fallout 3, or Kingdoms Of Amalur, but you'll still get some bang out of your buck. Fable introduced me to the world of action RPGs, and I will never regret buying this game used back in the day. When this game goes on sale, I highly suggest picking it up. One final thing to note: This game does not have a difficulty slider, so you're stuck with the preset difficulty. Like said, it's easy but totally worth the price tag.			"

												It's my first time playing Fable, and I can say that it is very enjoyable. The gameplay is very smooth, and the environment is really nice. Up to date, i've only had one glitchy quest, but luckily it was just a side quest. I definitely do recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RPGs!			"

												this game. although it has its downfalls (ie dont kill a beetle with your summon) it does manage to bring an amount of joy and pride that only fable can bring due to, going out and getting EVERY legendary weapon, which is no easy feat. it reminds me of childhood, and there is nothing wrong with a bit of depravity every now and again :D			"

I'll be frank, the characters in this aren't the most...attractive bunch, but you can bare with it. The anniversary edition.....I have no idea what the hell they were thinking. They had the chance to improve on it, but just made them a different sort of ugly, so ugly in fact it was painful to play. I ended up installing this and playing this one. Stick with the original, and best. Buy! 9/10			"

If you're a fan of decision based games that effect the world, and your renown karma, then you will most likely enjoy this game. Keep in mind it only has around 5-8 hours of story gameplay, but has replay value as well. Great game, would reccomend to anyone interested :).			"

The game roughly take between 8-40 hours to beat depending on your speed, but the best part is the re-play value and the fact you can custom build your char on a more rpg aspect then in later games. Unless you specifically try for the same build the game plays differently every time. At least armor still has some value in this game as well as weignt limits on weapons.10/10			"

While the graphics and voice acting are mediocore at best the gripping story, easy mechanics, and humor are all what make this game so fantastic. Once you look past the graphics and voice acting (i mean look at how old the game is, cut it some slack) there is a rich and endearing world underneath. By far the best in the series and Lionhead's crowning achievement. I'll stop gushing like a fanboy now. The money is well worth the game!			"

Some are pretty good and others will make you laugh until your head explodes!!! 6/10Gameplay:I can just say that it was the only game I played for a week and I came out of the room when I finished it saying""What a game""!! 10/10Final Verdict:This game is amazing even if the story and voice acting aren't great.Overall I'd give this game 9.5/10 "

												This game's great. It's little slow to start out, has a really quarky camera, and some missions can be extremely annoying (and don't even get me started on the damn Hobbes). Oeverall, Fable is really fun and you'll find addicted to it sooner than you think.			"

												A game that has flourished me so much as a little pike, me and my big brother played this game a ton back in the day. And I stil play it nonetheless today. My only question would be why people were dissapointed by this game so much. Sure, nothing that was said to come out of release would come to be. But it still has the potential it recieved. That music, that gameplay, that RPG elements, DAT MUSIC.ADHD Version: This game is awesome, get it right now.			"

												I played it because I was told it was the best in the series, and it has a lot of potential, but Skyrim has definitely spoiled me. A cute little game, and a clever gameplay, but it leaves a lot to be desired. The intro and setup to the story felt completely rushed and near the end, the quests just got tiring. Nevertheless, combat system was superb. I especially enjoyed playing a swordmage. Worth a playthrough, but I won't be replaying it anytime soon.			"

												I love this game. I remember Playing it back in the good ole' days of Original Xbox. It was such a nice offline break after Halo 2 or Classic Coutner Strike online sessions. I always liked doing the attractive tattoo's and hair styles. Just walking into an Inn in any city, and have all the ladies (and some gentlemen too) Falling in love with me on the spot! Nothing charms like that pure good Halo and butterfiles over your head!Don't get me wrong though, the evil play through on this game is also very fun! Nothing like sneaking into homes and shops after hours, and robbing the place... Or just slaughtering the entire city. Good way to rack up experience too!     This game definitely takes me back to a different day.  A better day.. When gameplay entwined with graphics (these were awesome graphics when it came out) A splendifferous creation of gameplay, replay, and graphical essences. combined to make a wonderful game that will engulf you and in some cases pluck any particular emotional string, wether is be Anger, Sadness, Or Surprise.  Just F*cking buy it already.			"

												Just as awesome of a game as you remembered on the XBOX. The whole keyboard only thing is a little hard to get used to and the camera is far too sensitive until you turn it down, but well worth the trouble to get it running properly. Also, Pro-Tip, you have to go to the application in the steam directory and set the compatability to Vista (Service Pack 2) and to have it run in 640 x 480 screen resolution to get the video ouput of the game to run. After you lauch it sucessfully though you can ramp up the graphics and resolution to suit your display. I give it a 9/10, would have been 10/10 if you didn't have to fiddle with the compatibility settings to get it to work. (PS after you set up the settings on the application file you can still launch it from steam)			"

												If you enjoyed the original you'll enjoy this. Fable the lost chapters is a re-release of Fable for the oringinal xbox back in 2004. This version of the game not only brings you back to the original Albion but adds extra contant as well, The new content is as follows New Weapons, New outfits, New Jack of blades voice actor, and a continued story where the Hero takes on Jack in his dragon form. In the Oringinal, players where able to repeat the final mission again and again for there heart's content. In the lost chapters version players where stripped of that option to bring the extra story content. Even though the battle machanics are not like such others as Devil May Cry or God of War, it makes up for it being a story driven game focusing more on what the players do to change there apperance to shape the world around theme, Fable anniversy adds Xbox 360 graphics to this version but with the game crashing at a moments notice it won't be recemended here. Whiether or not you look at its up or downs, I give Fable The Lost Chapters an 8/10 slighty missing my seal of apporval. a must play game,			"

												Fable is a game I've played several times, and at first I thought it was fantastic. I loved the story, the world, and it was really one of the first RPG's I really got into. I owned it on Xbox, and after losing it I thought I'd buy it again on steam. And after playing and beating Fable for the hundredth time, I've only just now began to realize this game is far from perfect.Don't get me wrong, Fable is still a good game, and decent RPG overall. The graphics hold up pretty well today, which is impressive for a game that's going on 12 years old. But that's really where Fable ends, ""Good"" and ""Decent"" The story has really weird pacing, the game's length is far from impressive, and the games lack of side quests really detract from replay value. Another thing I've come to dislike about fable is how simple it is. The game has very few deep and interesting mechanics, and some of the ones that are there are broken (ex. the morality and ageing systems)It may seem like I'm harping on it, but I would still recommend Fable to both casual gamers, and fans of action RPGs. While it may seem lack luster, Fable is still a solid experience with great combat, good characters, an interesting world to explore, and plenty of chickens to kick. It was a fantastic third person action RPG experience back in 2004, and while it has aged over the years, I think Falble is a purchase that you won't regret.			"

Anytime I start to think the game is actually getting good, it'll minimize for no reason, or introduce a quest that's frustrating without being engaging and it's just a massive disapointment. Fighting is unnecisarily hard to get a grasp on and isn't worth the time. Maybe the other Fable games are better?

												I loved this game when I had it on Xbox. I have heard and seen it as being one of the most disapointing games of it's time, but I loved it. I went into the game blind, and loved it. I think it was because it was expected to be much more, but I was very happy where it was. It had plenty of action, a good story, great characters, and a lot of humor. It had a quite ElderScrolls feel to the leveling up. Instead of like most RPGs, where you get EXP from killing enemies and used that to level up, Fable is a bit different. You do get EXP from killing, but you also get it from doing the killing. You shoot something with an arrow, you get skill EXP. Blast them with lightning, you get will EXP. Bash them with a hammer, you get strength EXP. They do not mix together, so you can't play as pure mage and have a high health. Not from Will EXP, at least. This is where the General EXP come in, the stuff you get from killing and quests. That can be put towards anything. Also, what you do in the game effects your appearence. Like to crunch on little newborn chickens (yes, you can do that) and kill people? A red mist will rise from your feet and eyes, you will become pale, flies will be drawn to you like the corpses you leave behind, and you grow horns (also destroying the majority of your hairstyle). People will run in terror from you, and hate you though your power will keep them from doing anything. But if you play as good, people will flock to, you will get a halo and a beam of light when you stand still. I think your eyes change color, though it has been a long time. Max out strength and you will look like a bodybuilder. Will will make you glow. I can't remember what Skill does. Fighting badly leaves you with scars.I could keep going on, but you should play it yourself. My only complaints are that the GuildMaster gets annoying ""Your health is low. Have you any potions, or food"", and I am having trouble getting the game to run on my computer even though it should be able to run it no problem. But once I get it up and running I won't be doing much else.			"

												I used to play the original Fable on the XBOX when i was younger. Even though the grafics are (they still are pretty good for the age of the game) a little bit outdated, the spirit of Albion is still flowing throughout the whole world. I played through the game about 4 times on the XBOX, and even though i know almost everything i cant stop playing. ''The Lost Chapters'' adds some cool and funny stories to the main game, i really like the PC-remake in overall.Everyone who is searching for something to play on a rainy Weekend, something which he can dive into, he should definitely buy Fable - The Lost Chapters. I prefer the original Fable over the Sequels, so i suggest you try out this first. "

												Quick Review:This is the basic game I remember playing on the original XBox. Both fun and frustrating at times.Pros- Installs and launches flawlessly under Windows 7 Professional (my first concern, didn't see it addressed anywhere else)- Supports high resolution, AA, and high textures/details (just be sure to disable VSync)- No hesitations, hiccups, etc (unlike Fable Anniversary)- Has the original, cartoonish graphics that just go better with the atmosphere of the gameCons- Only (natively) supports the use of keyboard and mouse  ** You CAN get around this by using 3rd party keyboard to controller mapping (xpadder, CTK, JoyToKey, etc)- Saving is a bit screwy (I may be mis-remembering this though), see bottom of review for details- Does not have Steam Accomplishments/BadgesBottom line, pay the $10 for this version and you don't have the ""better"" graphics that actually make the game look worse. You won't have the slow-downs, stuttering, etc, You'll need to look into a keyboard to joystick program if you are dead set on using a gamepad, but the game is easily played with keyboard and mouse.A Note On Saving: This game has set savepoints that you must reach or your progress is lost. Examples:- Starting the Game: Finish a few quests to get Gold to purchase a gift... but if you complete only two of these quests and quit, you have to start over. You have to complete the town to get an ""Autosave""- Guild Training: Go through the basics and a few tests, but don't complete the final step of getting your badge? Too bad, even if you saved mid-level, you now have to start the training over from the very beginning.Basically, you need to fully complete quests to the point that you see the words ""AUTOSAVING"" (or something like that) appear on screen.BUY THIS VERSION AND NOT THE ANNIVERSARY EDITION!!! This one will never be on sale, but at $10... it's a steal!			"

(I would pay the price for the whole game just for the music) It may not be the biggest game, but it sure feels expansive and holds a special place in my heart.			"

												A truly amazing game that will have you coming back looking for more. An immersive storyline that isn't as linear as many modern RPG's. Don't be fooled though, just because this game was good doesn't mean the sequels are. Only downside is that the sword of aeons has been severely nerfed in this PC adaptation so killing endless waves of Oakvale guards for exp isn't as easy. 9/10			"

												Fable is a franchise I've had a bit of a rocky relationship with. My first experience was Fable II (having completely missed the original), and it is one of my favorite games of the Xbox 360 era. Fable III, not so much. With Fable Anniversary coming out soon, the remake of the now 10 year old RPG, I figured why not just get a cheap copy of the original and see what it’s all about. The premise starts you as a young boy in the town of Oakvale in the land of Albion, who has a loving sister and parents. But that kind of story makes for a boring video game, so a group of bandits attack your village, kidnaping your mother and sister, and murdering practically everyone else, including your father. But before you meet your own demise, you’re saved by a hero named Maze, and are inducted into the Guild of Heroes. In the world of Albion, a hero isn't just a title but an occupation, something you learn by joining the guild. The game switches over to your teenage years for your guild training and then finally to adulthood after you become a true hero. This is the first neat trick Fable does, giving your character, and the world, a real sense of growth. Seeing the world change around you as you grow and make choices is neat, and gives everything a sense of place.Fable has the typical “your character glows if they’re good and pale skin and devil horns if you’re evil” that most games with morality like to do, but how you spec your character also affects them. If you put a bunch of points into strength, your character will become more bulky and muscular as a result, while if you put a lot of points into magic, you get glowing blue tattoos on your face. Unfortunately the options felt a bit too simple preventing me from having my character look exactly how I want. I like my characters to be a bit on the thin and scrawny side, probably because I myself am thin and scrawny, but there wasn't any way to go full on melee combat without forcing yourself to become a hulking beast. A little more variety on this front would have been cool.In combat your main tool will be your melee, of which you are given a nice selection of fast swords like the katana, something with a bit more punch like great swords, and even more massive weapons like hammers. There’s not much in the ways of multiple attacks, it’s rather simplistic with one button for attacking and another for using a flourish attack when you build one up. It’s all about timing and avoiding your enemies with blocks and dodges. Getting in hits and avoiding them yourself builds up your combat multiplier, letting you deal more damage. It’s a system that works but by the end of the game I found myself a little tired of it. The ranged combat, bows and crossbows, I found to be rather useless. It has its place in certain situations but you’re not going to want to spec your character into a full ranged one, which is a disappointment. Magic is by far the most interesting and varied. There’s a ton of spells all put into a bunch of categories. So if you want to go full on attack magic you can throw points into lighting, fire, etc. Even if you’re melee focused like I was, it’s worth getting spells like slow time, which I found invaluable during the later parts of the game.The core of Fable has you taking on guild quests, making choices, and being the ""hero."" The moral choice system is bit too black and white for my tastes. You’re never really given any grey area and it’s always very clear which is good and which is evil. Having a character say something like, ""you can go do this quest for this reward, or I guess if you were some sort of evil person you could always just kill me,"" doesn't really leave much to the imagination. One nice thing however is the game does provide full good and full evil side quests, usually having them be on opposite sides of the same problem. Will you take the quest the farmers put up to help stop the bandit raids, or will you take the quest the bandits put up to help with the raid. Stuff like that’s more fun because it lets you put your intentions forward right away rather than giving you some black and white choice half way through the quest.Another big component of the game is the interaction system with NPCs. You hero has a ton of different emotions they can express ranging from simple ones like laughing or saying hi, too more morality specific ones like flexing your heroic muscles or giving an evil laugh, too the ridiculously absurd such as farting and doing the chicken dance. Sadly I never found myself having any real gameplay reason to use them past their first time. For example you can flirt with NPCs and eventually have them fall in love with you. Cool idea, but no real benefit doing it. I didn't even have to try honestly. By the end of the game, every girl, and even some men, had a big enough heart above them that I could simply walk up to them, hand them a wedding ring, and be married before the sun set without even trying. The ability to interact with NPCs is a neat idea, and admittedly I got excited when they started to call me by my title I picked out and talking about past quests I did, but overall it feels more like a proof of concept than a fully implemented feature.The story does go to some interesting places and has a large focus on family, with the hero's sister and mother coming heavily into play. This does give everything a more personal feel to it and I found myself caring in the hero's journey and his seeking revenge. The antagonist, Jack of Blades, lives up to his awesome name by being a great creepy villain. My only wish was that is motivations were explained better as I was never quite sure why he was doing what he was doing other than to just be evil.It’s worth noting that I played the PC version, known as Fable: The Lost Chapters, which contains a bunch of extra characters, side quests, and continues the story after the final boss battle, which by the way was pretty weak. The extra content is cool, adding new characters and extra story that is welcome, but doesn't feel completely necessary. Also the new final boss somehow manages to be easier and lamer than the original.Graphically the game holds up pretty well for being 10 years old. Stuff like faces and character animations feel a bit old and outdated however it is saved by Fable's art direction which still shines though. The game goes for a very classic bedtime story fantasy look, hence the name, and succeeds at it well. It’s a world that takes itself very seriously one minute, and starts poking fun at itself the next. It all manages to work very well; making Albion a world you want to spend time in. This is also helped greatly thanks to the music, which is quite wonderful, perfectly capturing the whimsy the game is throwing at you.For a 10 year old game Fable one holds up surprisingly well. Moral choice in games has certainly grown in the years and in a lot of ways fable feels too simplistic in its decisions to a fault. But at the same time it all works well in the context of its storybook like nature. If you want a fun filled adventure where you get to be the hero, or villain, Fable is still a game worth checking out.			"

The story is amazing and has interesting characters, objectives and battle sequences which are backed up by an XP spending system for getting upgraded and new spells and strength in melee and ranged combat. The side objectives are also pretty fun. My only complaint is that the game is extremely short, it takes about 8 hours to complete the main story.			"

												No matter what path you take, your character is seriously disturbed and should consequently get some professional help right away. Your body develops in a very very unusual way. You are one of only 4 or 5 people in the game that actually ages and you do it at an incredible rate. You age by about 20 years in between events that take 2 days in the story and no one even notices. Puberty doesn't occur until you are at least 30 but it only happens if you do warrior or skill training. Until you hit puberty all your weapons are about 3 times bigger than you are, but you can still wield them perfectly well. Going to prison for many years ages you immensely particularly when you spend many years there.			"

												One of my most favourite games. I essentially grew up playing this game. I cannot count how many times I've played it through. What I loved most about the steam release is that I could use my save file from 6 years ago, back when I had the discs. Can't wait to get back into my favourite character and kick some bandit butt!Very nice combat, for an older game. Tonnes of content with some serious replay value. Sure, only took 16 hours to get a maxed character, but those are some of the most fun 16 hours of my gaming career. Decent story, characters are enjoyable. Some of the choices are very hard to make and always lead to me replaying that level again to see what could've been.FEAR ME! I AM CHICKEN CHASER!			"

												JUST TO CLARIFY: I have played the Fable series for a long time on the Xbox, ever since it first came out. So my hours don't really reflect how much I have played Fable, let alone the other Fable games (2 and 3).This game has a lot of features and memorable moments (Wont tell you them, no spoilers here). First off, as an RPG, this game balances all the different attributes of a character and how to get them very well. It has a lot of items, a lot of quests, and the main story is over 15 hours, which is a lot more than most games now. The story is also designed very well, and has many memorable moments, as well as a lot of variety in the envirenments. Over all, in a review, I would have to give this game a 9.2/10, but now that it is a very low price, I would give it a 9.7/10 as one of the best singleplayer games on steam.Summary: If you can bear with the older graphics, this game has very good gameplay, story, and has enough side quests to keep you going for hours.

A cute little game, and a clever gameplay, but it leaves a lot to be desired. The intro and setup to the story felt completely rushed and near the end, the quests just got tiring.

												The best of the Fable series, this game is literally where IT is at. A fantastic RPG with fantastic features. The combat system is enjoyable and has many mini games. The quests are fantastic and the story is great. You'll be playing the game again and again because this game was one of the first where you can truly choose how you want to play, to be good or evil, or neutral. Have the people love you... Or fear you.Experience the life of the son of a hero and shape how he grows up. Face the greatest threat the land has ever seen in this fantastic game and it's expansion.No other game will have you enjoying it as much as this. The sequels don't even come close to how good this game was and are an insult to it's legacy. Play how YOU want to play.I recommend this game, it's truly 9.9/10!PS. This game was poorly received by a lot of folks because it didn't live up to the hype back in the day, but if you're like me and never listen to hype and play games as they come, you'll appreciate this gem of a game.

												Fable The Lost Chapters is an exceptional RPG adventure. You can customize your character to be, well, anything you want him to be. You can be an archer in robes. A wizard in full armor. You gain exp based on how you fight. You gain exp to level up your melee stats by using melee, ranged nets you ranged, magic nets you magic. Basic. The spells are vast and fun, and the swordplay is well done. My selling point is the archery though. While this game doesn't quite have as much visual customization, the combat and personality customization is unmatched. Super good? You get a halo. Evil? One foot long horns sprout out of your head and your eyes glow red. Yeah don't apply to any jobs like that bud. Won't get anywhere. Probably because there aren't jobs. You want money, get off your♥♥♥♥♥and beat the snot out of some monsters. Now THAT's work.			"

												I remember playing Fable on my old xbox with my step brother. It was so much fun but when i heard Fable 1 was coming to PC i thought two things 1. I get to relive this game again and 2. It is going to be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port. However the port for this game is great! the graphics aren't the best but it's 2007. The story line is good, keeps you intrigued. Lot's of side-quests. Just like in the later Fable games you can be good, evil or neutral and it affects your appearence. There are lot's of skills to choose from too so you have lot's of diverse ways of playing. Overall great RPG. Don't get this for the open world. Buy for the long story, replayability, side quests, and the great gameplay!			"

												It's time to dust of the Lionhead Classic and give it some recognition. This game is a visually, literary and comedic masterpiece. Never has a game been able to perfect the balance between hilarious humour and the dense story that will  make you feel the same emotions that your hero would be feeling. Connect with all the characters, esoecially the highly british NPC's who never cease to make me smile, even when their dialogue is the same. ever. single. time.I love this game, I have ever since I was a kid. Lionhead have done this right, I cannot fault it. I love it.11/10			"

												This is a freaking amazing game. One of the first hardcore RPGs and a classic. For its time, it looks great, has complex combat and gameplay and remains challenging up until the mid/late game. Terrific variety of opponents and locations. Variety of weapons/armors/clothes leaves something to be desired, but is more than made up for by the incredible look of the legendary weapons and armor one can find around the map.			"

Even if you played 2 and 3.  You can tell some of the older modeling and art techniques used in making the games but other then that the games aged very well, and looks great with the graphics maxed out (which any mid modern PC or laptop should be able to do theese days)			"

												I missed playing this as kid, having only a playstation, but I must say I am impressed. This is a fun, misleadingly light rpg that draws you in with a neat art style and wit ranging from low brow to high. Playing this game, I realy felt a sense of progression, thanks to the aging and growth system being linked to xp. While it did end up with me being 70 by the time I beat the game, I felt like I had taken a journey as oppossed to completed stages. The lore wasn't particularily deep, as far as I found, anyway, but the game does explain its culture on the way, removing the need to research history on your own. There are karmic paths in game, allowing you to choose how you will behave and in turn how people will treat you. I tried being evil, but I couldn't do it after the second bullying encounter, so I can't say how the dark path is, but the light path like the rest of the game has good progression and meaningful impact on the world. I genuinely enjoyed myself, laughing and tearing up at times, and I highly recomend this game.Now that the anniversary edition is released you may want to play that instead, but I would recommend the nonetheless. 8/10			"

The combat is superb, the missions I enjoyed. Its a great game for people who like fantasy/adventure games, and is certainly worth the time. The only downfall is the game is a bit pricy, considering its a game from 2004. Otherwise great game.			"

												Originally I bought this game on the Xbox over a decade ago. I liked my time in the world of Albion so much that I jumped at the chance to buy TLC just so I'd have an excuse to revisit the world, albeit with some welcome changes and additional content that broadened the world and further refined the game play.The Steam release of Fable is thankfully the latter, and it's never been better. The game supports psuedo HD, which is to say that although it runs native at, I believe, 800x600 it can be scaled up to whatever display you require. Much to my delight, widescreen support is also present.Sadly controller support is not available in the vanilla release, but if you felt so inclined there are some readily available mods that place that functionality in there.Many are of the opinion that the first Fable game was the pinnacle of the series, I share in that opinion. Though even if you are new to the series or a returning fan, this game warrants a playthrough. It clocks in at a modest 30 hours, but the real charm of the game is the morality system which tailors events and content of the game to how good or bad you are in interactions or story choices. People may delight in the sight of you just to run to you and cheer, the inverse would have the population of the world running in fear and screaming.The sole complaint I have with this game is that the player character feels a little lifeless. Some of that can be forgiven if you take into account that he's intended to be a cypher for you to project your own emotions upon. Still, it is disheartening to see in the games cutscenes a mute character that for the majority of the game reacts like a wooden playdoll.			"

												You might think this is backtracking, but in point of fact I have not played this before. I now played it three times in a row. Awesome as many people would probably tell you. However, I would like to speak to people not familiar with this type of game. It is somewhat intuitive and has lots of help with the controls. Storyline and puzzles help keep it going as well as gaining experience that allows you to level up. I tried this because I like puzzles, not being a fighter or playing battle games. However since embarking on tower defense games, I find this game genre inspiring and helping me to move in new directions.			"

												Hra, kterou jsem na prvních pár pokusů nedohrál. Snažil sem se co nejrychleji doběhnout hlavní lini, samozřejmě vedlejší úkoly sem také bral, ale vždycky ve třech čtvrtinách mě hra z nějakého důvodu přestala bavit. Jednoho dne, po asi 20. rozehrání sem si řekl kurňa, tak já teda zkusim koupit barák, udělat manželku, zahrát si hospodský hry, měnit účesy,... A zjistil jsem, že Fable je ještě větší hra, než sem myslel. A to sem si původně myslel, že je pěkně malá, díky ne tak rozlehlým lokacím. Úplně jsem zapoměl na hlavní příběh a užíval si vítězství v hospodách, soutěžích v kopání slepic, sbírání legendárních zbraní, rybaření, hledání pokladů, atd. Hra je na tom jako Morrowind/Oblivion. Musíte mít chuť si jí užít. Osobně jediný zápor, který mi vadil, je ten, že i když už je hrdina v pokročilém věku, lidé na něj pořád mluví jako na fakana a ťuťu ňuňu, no musíš zabít balveriny, kteří trhají vesničany na kousky, yes you do, oh yes you do... Kromě toho nemám námitek.Pro: Pěkné lokace, pěkně vypadající zbraně a brnění, magie, minihry, vedlejší možnosti, zpodobení dobra a zla, místy humorProti: Malé lokace, mluva vesničanů, ne moc kvalitní příběh			"

Haven't played Anniversary edition but wouldn't bother with it when you can just play the original. Would recommend Fable 2 on the Xbox 360 as it is a great homage to this original glorious game. Fable is a stable RPG focusing on character choice and development, It was one of the most developed for it's time but don't expect too much from it compared to recent games.			"

												The great music, the interesting story, the nice graphics. I'm ready to play this game over and over again because it's the best virtual fairy tale in the world for me (maybe not just for me). Everyone should play it... and it is unlikely you will be sorry about it.			"

												This game was my childhood. I remember all the time I spent playing this with my dad on weekends, it might show it's age now, but it's still a good game  to mePROS:It's simple, easy to understand combat Non complicated skill treesThe story of the Guild does make sense and is interesting The best Fable game (I've played 1-3 but don't have an Xbox to play any of the new ones :cIt runs on most computers people would have (I have a♥♥♥♥♥♥computer and it ran really good)Got it for $2 ($3 in the Summer Sale)I got a pimp hat.CONS:The controls are pretty iffy if you don't mess with themThe graphics really show their timeChildrens eyes are super demonic and bothered me (especially at the start)As far as I know I have one of the best swords already (I'm about half way done)The Guards tend to not want to dieThe Good-Evil choices don't really effect anythingYour clothes/Hair also choose if you're good or bad?It isn't actually open-world1/10 ""it was clearly a Skyrim rip-off""-IGN			"

												Amazing classic from the xbox the best fable in my opinion and im not alone. The story is well played right to the end theres no dull moment. worth picking this up or atleast when the hd verison comes down in price from $35 at the time of this review was written. Also you should try fable 2 if it ever comes to steam but stay away from fable 3 its so bad and lazy.			"

This is how every game should look like. I think i felt in love with this game. Game is just so beautiful, i could never actually complete it as a bad hero.

												I own this game on Xbox, and all the sequels on 360. I bought this originally because I wanted to replay it without having to dig through stuff and set up my 360 again.I absolutely love this game. I haven't experienced any bugs or glitches in my game at all, which is great.I was surprised by how much nostalgia playing this on PC induced, but that's not unpleasant :3The only differences I've noticed between TLC and Anniversary on PC are cosmetic, I.E graphics/interface/loading screens/menus. I absolutely <3 the Fable trilogy, with or without the extra graphic trimmings of Anniversary.			"

												This game is a fine RPG. It was on sale and I bought it and I'm glad I did. Its humorous, enchanting, and a great classic from the XBOX. The combat system reminds me of Ocarina of Time in the sense of whacking an enemy with a sword, or shooting with a bow. However there is will. Will makes the combat system make it play as if WoW had action combat. However the controls are strange, but seem as if you are using XBOX controls and I can get passed that.			"

												One of the best RPGs of the decade. Simple, yet beautiful. Fable's trademark is the fight between good and evil and the freedom that you, as the main hero, have to choose your own side. You can be evil from start to finish and literaly end the story in tragedy, instead of saving the world for selfish purposes, as it usualy is when you take an evil path in a RPG that has a happy ending regardless of your choices. Beign good, as always, also has its advantages and can be rewarding and fun. You'll feel like finishing the game more than once just to see the differences between playing the good and the bad guy. I've been playing and replaying this game throughout the years and it never gets old.Graphics, animations, gameplay and soundtrack still holds up, nothing feels dated or inadequade, even though the game is already ten years old. If you like action-centered RPGs, this one is for you.Gameplay - 8/10Soundtrack - 8/10Graphics - 7/10Content - 6/10Challenge Level - 3/10Replayability - 4/10			"

												Played this originally when I was way too young for it probably. Definitely brings back memories.I forgot how expansive this game is for its time and just how many quests there are to do. The only downside is that it is a lil buggy, but that's to be expected. I've heard a lot of people complain about it crashing on them, but for me it works fine, aside from minor lag, and I'm playing it on a laptop.+You can punt chickens+You can have 5 wives and 5 husbands if that's what floats your boat+There's a bordello where you can touch all the butts+You can get a kickass handlebar mustache10/10 would always recommend.

												Awesome game! One of the best RPG's I've played! Character growth is the most amazing part, can't compare it to any game of this age. The actual story is also really deep and governed by the characters personal choises. Even the choices the character takes define how others see him, physicaly and individualy. The only negatives could be that there are set paths to follow with a sizeable movement area, and that there is no character creation at the beginning. The character is a boy that grows into a man over the course of the game. The player can dress in whatever they so choose as to also have as many tatoo's or whatever hair style they want. This game has taken a special spot in my heart for most memorable RPG's!			"

The only concerns are about the menu mode, on XBOX you can see how you wear the equipment and everything is clear, on PC it's all in F1 F2 F3 F4...ect, sometimes you'll forgot how to go to the weapon page; besides, the magic attack mode is not as good as XBOX.

												The best Fable game in the franchise and probably one of the best RPGs I played in early childhood. As an adult I've been able to explore the other sides of the game I ignored and I am still impressed by how they handled the morality system along with player choice. I especially liked the ability to be a homosexual (despite marking the husband as my wife) considering the lack of options in games back then. Overall, this game offers a lot of side quests, weapons (no crafting), spells, and worthwhile plot that still has me in awe considering how much better Jack a villain was compared to the others in the franchise.

												One of the best games i have ever played. I used to watch my brother play it when i was younger and always wanted to play it. Once i got it for the original xbox i completed it over 20 times but never once did i get all the silver keys :3Basically its a role playing game where you can either pick the side of good or evil, every bandit you slay and every trader you punch in the face or cut up accidentally with the cutlass bluetane while trying to hit nymphs makes a difference in terms of weather your good or evil, you kill a bandit and save a bunch of traders through butterfly effect while doing so? You gain good points. You punch a trader in the face because he called you a *annoying runt*? you gain evil points.You feel very free in this game even though the world is reasonably small, The main story line (if you don't take your time like i do) Takes around 13 and a half hours of continuous play including the TLC after-story if its your first time, and only around 5-6 hours if your a pro and you rush it like sanic. The story may feel short but that's only if the story is all that you do, personally i run around killing bandits like a madman and even though i could rush the story if i wanted you don't really get your moneys worth if you do.The story line itself, story wise, is good. The developers clearly put alot of effort into it, unlike me typing this review, and even though its relatively short for someone like me who plays video games for the majority of there life, its long enough for the majority of the populous and the other things to do in albion (the name of the world) more than make up for the short story. To be honest i spent days on my first playthrough however i was very young at the time and after i completed it the first time i started to clear games quite quickly.I love the games mechanics, the combat system is fun and not to hard to use but reasonably difficult to master. The magic isn't over powered whatsoever and the way you level yourself up gives you an amazing sense of achievement even if (like me) your completing the game for the quadrillionth time. They really balanced it perfectly but the glitches really give you an easy time if you chose to exploit them.Now the bugs. The game is solid most of the time and it has a few loading problems every now and then but overall i don't take much notice to that. But the thing they really ♥♥♥♥ up on is the hero save system.Now if you have ever played fable before for longer than one playthrough you would have realized how bugged the herosave system is. Basically if your in the middle of a quest you cant save the game normally, you can only transfer your current hero to a previous save file as to not waste all the time you spent grinding experience in the current quest. however herosaving also transfers items...If you don't see the problem here I'm kinda surprised. By going into a quest and picking up an item of value and then herosaving to before you started the quest you can get infinite of that item. But don't get me wrong, i love this glitch, you can complete the game then herosave to before your first ever quest and complete it again with an over powered character and one shot all the bosses ;DBasically the only ""gamebreaking"" glitch in the game makes it better and most fans were horrified when they realized the remake had removed it.Its a solid game good gameplay good leveling system and good story. I have no problem with anything in the game except the aging system and as long as you don't abuse the herosave system that doesn't effect you to much anyway.Good luck fighting the final boss on your first run though. xDI rate 9/10, more content would mean the best game of all time for me.

												Played the first release on the original Xbox and loved the game back then. The art style and colorful characters in this game completely immerse you into its world and storytelling.  ""Fable"" is one of those games that most people have played, as its been out for so long and has been so highly acclaimed but always had one downfall. It was not long enough. This has been dealt with in ""Fable: The Lost Chapters"" with so much extra stuff to do within the game, giving more replay value regarding side quests specific to whether you are playing a evil or good character. As well as this, there is a whole new section added to the original ending of the first released game really adding something to the development of the world you have become a part of in playing this game. I felt the need to write a quick review on this game to simply point out, if you've never played a ""Fable"" game play this one! And if you've played the original definitely play this one, experience that awesome world created in the story along withh all those new things to do!			"

												This is one of my favourite games of all time. Fable: The Lost Chapters, Fable II, Azurik: Rise of Perathia. Top three. I only wish Fable II had a PC version on Steam... Anyway. I don't know what my play time is on Steam, but, long story short, I played this to death on the original XBOX and the XBOX 360. I refuse to even begin talking about the features, because it's simple. If you like RPGs and dark humour, get this game. Now. Right now, if you have the money. If you don't, then wait until you do. And buy this. Forget your wishlist, get this game. If you don't like it, get yourself checked at the therapist. If you do like it, good, you're sane.			"

												Nice game, I first play this game was years ago on XBOX. It's awesome, I love the combat mode and story, way better than FABLE III (Not recommend to buy FABLE III). The only concerns are about the menu mode, on XBOX you can see how you wear the equipment and everything is clear, on PC it's all in F1 F2 F3 F4...ect, sometimes you'll forgot how to go to the weapon page; besides, the magic attack mode is not as good as XBOX. Overall, it's still a very fun game to play and the price is worthy.			"

												If you haven't played a Fable game, yet, just do it. You get to play through the life of a boy. A boy who becomes a man. A man who becomes old. An old fart who becomes...young again? Only if you're evil enough to do such a thing. You can choose between good and evil, you can change your looks, you can pick different weapons, learn different magical spells... You could go through the main quests rather quickly, or explore almost everything before you're even halfway through the storyline. I've heard the later games are great improvements on the first, allowing you to do more things and have more options.			"

												Very good game, I used to play it on the original xbox so I was excited to find this game on the Steam Store. The Lost Chapters adds new items, quests, spells, areas, and a new end of the game that lets you continue playing beyond defeating Jack of Blades. A great game, that has humour, and plenty of gameplay, and a morality system that can make you look angelic or devilish. By far the best Fable game, none of it's successor's have been as fun as this little gem.			"

												If you are new to RPGs this is a good game to cut your teeth on.First off, I am relatively new to the pick and choose RPG. That said, this was the first one I ever played. Although the graphics look a little dated, it still was a fantastic game that had a good plot. Mind you this game came out before game makers incuded voice acting for the main characters. So your character is silent for most of the dialogue. The game is a pretty quick one and has a decent amount of content and replay value. An enjoyable feature was that you could take parts of all classes and include them in your game for example, you could be a tank that shoots lightning, and then pull out your bow to fight. In the end, I played it through twice, had a good bit of fun both ways. Really got a good kick out of some of the British humor... (Loads of it)If you want an example, just look at the Union Jack boxers the character sports when he doesnt wear his armor....			"

												This is definitely a fun, simple game. It's got a cute story, but it's not a huge challenge most of the time. Some of the boss fights are difficult, but not frustratingly so. The aging in this game is interesting; it seems like you are the only person in the world who ages to Professor Farnsworth levels of old, but it's worth a laugh. While this is by no means a ground-breaking story, or innovative combat methods, it is a nice, simple game you can put some hours into and finish in a weekend. Get it on sale and enjoy an old-school RPG.			"

												I always had heard the general misconception that Fable games are bad, or rather disappointing. I delved into this world looking for high fantasy with no questions asked, and it seemed like the right game for me. I kept seeing people saying 2 and 3 were bad, and that Fable the Lost Chapters was the best in the series, but I was still a bit, if not a lot, hesitant. I doubted and doubted, but I made up my mind and decided to purchase it and play it blind without knowing what is going on. As you may see I yet have to finish the game, but I cannot resist the need to just yell out how great, how excellent this game is. It strives for realism and achieves it in a ""videogamey"" way. It is action packed and the decisions to be good or evil are very fun. The world does change around you. People hail you if you're good and loathe you if you're evil, even running away from you. You can marry shallow but good-looking characters, and the game even makes fun of itself in this aspect on a book in which it incites you to murder your beloved just because you're bored of him or her. It is great, simply and absurdly great, and it was a real surprise for me to see this game be so good. 9/10 would give a wedding ring to the Guildmaster again.By the way, do not bother with anniversary, play this one, the real one, and see why it doesn't even deserve a remake.

												You should take my review with a big grain of salt because I was only able to play it for such a short while. But the reason for clocking out so soon was that the spinning camera angles gave me a really nasty motion sickness / migraine combo, and that means I can never go back to this game. No game has managed this spectacular feat since the 90's, so it's a huge minus in my book. Probably not a good game choice for anyone who's experienced similar problems with FPS / third person visuals. It's possible I would have endured longer in a console version, but I doubt it.In terms of gameplay, I was also immediately disappointed with... well, pretty much everything. The main character annoyed me from the start and I felt utterly disinclined to watch him grow into an even bigger bundle of annoyingness. Most importantly the hyped moral system was so blatantly black-and-white that it's just a bad joke. Seems to me there's not that much you can do to branch out from that, and I suspect the character changes would be mostly cosmetic.			"

You've got a great adventure with a nice storyline on the side, With favorable gameplay mechanics and a wide variety of spells. Downside is, The game unfortunately lacks a bit of difficulty, Takes about 16 hours to clear the main storyline. Since you can choose your destiny, Good, Neutral or evil, The game has a good replayability value. This, By far IMO, Is the best Fable title out there and one of my favorite single-player RPG experiences. This game might have been considered ""Over-rated"", But it doesn't mean it can't be gold.

												I've played Fable in so many ways over so, so many years. I was one of the poor fools waiting years for it to come out, and event hen I was kinda late to the party. All you really need to know is that this game -should- be awful. It failed the hype more than any other game in the history of ever (except maaaybe Duke Nukem Forever, because that one is awful), the graphics were not what they could have been, the combat shouldn't be fun, the voice acting is painful, the story is simplistic, and a few of the design decisions for models still hurt my brain.But the game is wonderful. For all that is 'missing', your mind is happy to fill it in, for all that combat should be a boring slog, every player will try a handful of weird rules and challenges, or, just goof off entirely, and get their fun. Collectibles are at once plentiful, and achievable without aid. Marriage is utterly pointless and unfulfilling. . .that's it, marriage is just pointless and unfulfilling. >.> Meta humor >.> Point is, there is no reason this game should be so awesome, and that's why it stands out as the shining beacon of ""See here! This is what matters!"" - Aesthetics. Every individual piece seems mismatched, disjointed, and frankly lacklustre on its own. Put them together and. . .you know the rest. Personally, I find this games sits with precious few others on that point of pure aesthetic gold, and among western-produced RPGs? It almost stands alone. Backing away from cartoonishness severely damaged the franchise, and I really do place 90% of the blame on that alone. I'm serious. If they remade Fable III, the exact game, but with Fable's graphics (and more important, use of graphics)? It'd be fine. Tho the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥map, weird hero retreat thing, and those damned guild seals to unlock chests vs. the old xp system would still be huge marrs, I think we could forgive a lot more if the game had just been charming. I'm buying Anniversary because I have to see it first hand. . . but looking at the screenshots honestly reminds me of when I heard the interview about how they finally had the tech to render lifelike creations in Phantom Menace, and used that to make Jar Jar Binks. . . . . What you do with what you got matters a helluva lot more . .tho I never liked Star Wars as a franchise because it's aesthetic has never appealed to me (too much metal >.>), and all it has to offer is the EXACT Hero's Journey, in space, with Buddhism. No thanks. I'll go read Saiyuki.			"

But I also remember really enjoying it. I was very pleased when the Steam version was released. However I was dismayed to discover that it is still as unstable as I remember it being on my old Pentium 4 several years back. Despite having to give up on the game because of the endless crashes, I would still recommend this game to anybody that can get it to run without the frequent crashes to desktop that I have experienced on a system comprising of a 3GHZ i5 2500K, 8GB DDR3 RAM and an HD7870 2GB running Windows 7 64bit.I'm extremely pleased that the game is being re-released in the remastered Aniversary Edition that is due out in September of this year. I'm hoping that the updated version will be a lot more stable so that I can once again enjoy the quirky yet charming game that is Fable: The Lost Chapters.			"

												Just when I thought I was about to give up looking for a decent RPG to play (Skyrim was so good it's almost ruined any other game ever ;D ) I remember I had this installed. I figured I would give it a quick try and have been sucked in for the last 8 hours. If your from England the accents are humorously recogniseable, the story line doesn't feel particually recycled, the world itself is not huge but rich in detail and the gameplay takes minimal time to get used to.Great game, 8/10			"

												Awesome game. Personally my favourite game in the world. this game involves you deeply in the world of albion and putting you in the shoes of well... you. it is your choice to be a hero or a villan.(Good/Bad). if you chose the hero path your body will glow blue and a halo above you head and everyone loves you and applauds when you go near.If you choose Evil you will be feard by everyone they will cower in fright and the demon will come out with horns bursting out of your head. The character customization is astonishing with tattoo's and hair damn even the fasion is beautiful unless you are running around in your underware with the union jack on it. this game has small tweaks for your charecter like magic,strenght,allusion. No real skill trees but even then pulling a sword out of a rock has never been so hard without the phisque needed. This game is loved by millions and millions of people. i highly recomend this game to anyone. And if you have a Xbox and want this game try out the Remade HD Version. 10/10			"

												I only got this game recently and have spent several hours playing, but it is fantastic!  More than worth the sale price.  It's like a marriage between recent console elder scrolls titles, and 3D generation zeldas.  No controller support but it's not bad actually.  Screenshots don't do the graphics any justice (they look like crappy xbox screens).  Don't be put off by the lack of controller support and junk screens--this game is worth it and even more so if you catch it on sale!!!  Oldie but goodie  :)			"

												I loved this game when I had it on Xbox. I have heard and seen it as being one of the most disapointing games of it's time, but I loved it. I went into the game blind, and loved it. I think it was because it was expected to be much more, but I was very happy where it was. It had plenty of action, a good story, great characters, and a lot of humor. It had a quite ElderScrolls feel to the leveling up. Instead of like most RPGs, where you get EXP from killing enemies and used that to level up, Fable is a bit different. You do get EXP from killing, but you also get it from doing the killing. You shoot something with an arrow, you get skill EXP. Blast them with lightning, you get will EXP. Bash them with a hammer, you get strength EXP. They do not mix together, so you can't play as pure mage and have a high health. Not from Will EXP, at least. This is where the General EXP come in, the stuff you get from killing and quests. That can be put towards anything. Also, what you do in the game effects your appearence. Like to crunch on little newborn chickens (yes, you can do that) and kill people? A red mist will rise from your feet and eyes, you will become pale, flies will be drawn to you like the corpses you leave behind, and you grow horns (also destroying the majority of your hairstyle). People will run in terror from you, and hate you though your power will keep them from doing anything. But if you play as good, people will flock to, you will get a halo and a beam of light when you stand still. I think your eyes change color, though it has been a long time. Max out strength and you will look like a bodybuilder. Will will make you glow. I can't remember what Skill does. Fighting badly leaves you with scars.I could keep going on, but you should play it yourself. My only complaints are that the GuildMaster gets annoying ""Your health is low. Have you any potions, or food"", and I am having trouble getting the game to run on my computer even though it should be able to run it no problem. But once I get it up and running I won't be doing much else.			"

												When the original Fable title launched on the original Xbox console, I bought it and loved it so much that I recommended it to my friends. When the Lost Chapters version launched a year or more later, I traded in my Fable game and upgraded to The Lost Chapters. In 2009, I purchased the PC version at retail for only $10 to have it on my PC. I then purchased it again recently off of Steam (at a price only a madman would refuse to pay) to have a Steam copy always available. I also plan on buying the HD remake coming to Xbox 360 in 2014. I have purchased the game 4 times, and will purchase it for a 5th time. This game is fantastic, and is the best in the series. Buy this and give it a play through if you have not done so.

												Of the three Fable games I have played (TLC, 2, and 3), Fable - The Lost Chapters is by far my favorite. While the graphics are not as good as some of the later games I still find them to be nice. In my opinion, what makes this game better than the other two is the magic and the armor. In the other Fable games, there is no mana bar to limit how much magic you can do at a time before needing to resort to something else or use a potion. I also like that armor actually has a use in this game to help with damage resistance. I strongly recommend this game.			"

												This remake and extension is second to none.  The graphics for a game from (technically) 2004 are extremely good and fit the entire aura the game tries to create. If you're not familiar with the Fable franchise, you essentially experience the life of a hero but also mould and shape his reputation and stature within the town. You are faced with many problems that need solving either through being 'good' or 'bad'. These decisions affect the story-line, those around you and even the town itself. The Lost Chapters offers new content as the story continues from where the game ended in the original version, giving you hours of fun. Not only is the playability of this game exceptional, it also has a great feel to it and feels natural when in combat etc. This makes combat fun and not tiresome despite some repetitve enemies and repetitive movements. The AI in combat are actually pretty smart which adds to the fun, they can dodge, block and counter, often making it difficult to hurt them... not too challenging, but challenging enough for a fun battle with every encounter. The length of the game is not bad at all, it should take you around 10-11 hours to complete the game with minimal exploring... whilst this is significantly shorter than the following titles, this captivating story is definitely worth at least a run through. It's the sort of game you want to play again and again, doing things differently each time and seeing how that affects your hero and also those around you. I'm currently on my fourth time round this game (just on this platform) and not bored even in the slightest. In regards to the other Fable titles, I'd say they're all equally awesome and enthralling. If I had to pick an absolute favourite it would have to be Fable 2. Yet, this game is almost up there and transitions you well throughout each game if you follow the titles from the start up, seeing the development of this game is very rewarding. I just hope Fable 2 is released on Steam, that would be rad. The look and feel of this game is beautiful, a well designed game with everything thought out well. The world in which you immerse yourself is visually stunning and very light-hearted, often bright and alluring, however, when evil forces are around the sky will turn grey and there will be a shift in atmosphere. The game creates atmosphere very well utilising the scenery, lighting and music. A nice touch for an aged game is the aging of your character over the course of the story and also his metamorphosis into an angel-like figure or devil-like figure (dependant on the path you choose). This really does immerse you into the game and gets you emotionally involved with your character and creates a synthetic relationship as you've essentially been with him is whole life and shaped the man he is today. A final note is the sound work with the game; excellent. Nice voice acting and nice sound effects and the soundtrack of the game is very fitting and gives you a nice warm sense of adventure as you delve into the world of Fable. Definitely pick up this game! Pros:-Visually stunning and captivating.- You shape how the game is played. - Enticing narrative which emotionally invloves you well.- Great voice acting and great atmosphere held throughout. Cons:-Not Fable 2.9.5 out of 10 for me.			"

												I had the original on Xbox (but had never played Lost chapters before recently)....STILL BEUTIFUL infact even better!, definately deserves its place as a true xbox classic, may not be as fluent as the others in the series but they do not come close to the story, comedy and true originality for its time. If you have not played this (including those who have only played the original version); Seriously consider even trying this game!			"

												This is a freaking amazing game. One of the first hardcore RPGs and a classic. For its time, it looks great, has complex combat and gameplay and remains challenging up until the mid/late game. Terrific variety of opponents and locations. Variety of weapons/armors/clothes leaves something to be desired, but is more than made up for by the incredible look of the legendary weapons and armor one can find around the map.			"

												TL;DR:The over hyped  Peter Molneux hero simulator. Kick chickens, participate in fight clubs, make black and white morality choices. Realize today why Fable 2/3/journey all suck compared to their grand dad. The new graphical update makes this somewhat obsolete now, so how much is pretty graphics worth really?Pre-face:Most of my play time is on the Xbox version of the game with nearly 13 playthoughs. So this is more of a review of the game, not the steam version.Interesting Tidbits:Peter Molneux started his amazing lying career here. Although, it is not baseless.Pros:(+++) Grow with your character, making him 100% yours(+++) Great sense of humor(+++) Non of that patch later ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, it was released nearly bug free.(+++) Rose tinted glasses(++) A fun morality system (More of a tongue in cheek system)(++) Best villain in any game I've played(++) Controler and keyboard support!(+) Your magica is low, watch that.Cons:(--) Fairly linear(--) The start of the ""one button"" combat(--) The stupid combat multiplier door(-) I have to murder the whole town to buy the realistate.Conclusion:A all time classic in my book. I'm as biased as it comes with this game, I know it, you know it. Grab this when it goes down to a few bucks and have fun chicken chaser.			"

												Okay okay, most people would think I'm Biased since I have one of the devs of Fable as my Film teacher. but I kid you not, I first played fable when i was 6 years old, probably younger and It is hands down the best and most original RPG Ive played In my life, and thats alot. Fable set the standards for RPGs of its time and only a few modern day games can compare to its Originality. play an Angelic Hero and do no evil, or Sneak around as a neautral Theif to make a living. Kill everyone in a village and Buy their Homes, then Raise the rent through the roof so the new tennants pay you your riches day by day. Its a great game and the PC experience is as good as the console, 38/1			"

												This is one of my favourite games of all time. Fable: The Lost Chapters, Fable II, Azurik: Rise of Perathia. Top three. I only wish Fable II had a PC version on Steam... Anyway. I don't know what my play time is on Steam, but, long story short, I played this to death on the original XBOX and the XBOX 360. I refuse to even begin talking about the features, because it's simple. If you like RPGs and dark humour, get this game. Now. Right now, if you have the money. If you don't, then wait until you do. And buy this. Forget your wishlist, get this game. If you don't like it, get yourself checked at the therapist. If you do like it, good, you're sane.			"

												One of the best games i have ever played. I used to watch my brother play it when i was younger and always wanted to play it. Once i got it for the original xbox i completed it over 20 times but never once did i get all the silver keys :3Basically its a role playing game where you can either pick the side of good or evil, every bandit you slay and every trader you punch in the face or cut up accidentally with the cutlass bluetane while trying to hit nymphs makes a difference in terms of weather your good or evil, you kill a bandit and save a bunch of traders through butterfly effect while doing so? You gain good points. You punch a trader in the face because he called you a *annoying runt*? you gain evil points.You feel very free in this game even though the world is reasonably small, The main story line (if you don't take your time like i do) Takes around 13 and a half hours of continuous play including the TLC after-story if its your first time, and only around 5-6 hours if your a pro and you rush it like sanic. The story may feel short but that's only if the story is all that you do, personally i run around killing bandits like a madman and even though i could rush the story if i wanted you don't really get your moneys worth if you do.The story line itself, story wise, is good. The developers clearly put alot of effort into it, unlike me typing this review, and even though its relatively short for someone like me who plays video games for the majority of there life, its long enough for the majority of the populous and the other things to do in albion (the name of the world) more than make up for the short story. To be honest i spent days on my first playthrough however i was very young at the time and after i completed it the first time i started to clear games quite quickly.I love the games mechanics, the combat system is fun and not to hard to use but reasonably difficult to master. The magic isn't over powered whatsoever and the way you level yourself up gives you an amazing sense of achievement even if (like me) your completing the game for the quadrillionth time. They really balanced it perfectly but the glitches really give you an easy time if you chose to exploit them.Now the bugs. The game is solid most of the time and it has a few loading problems every now and then but overall i don't take much notice to that. But the thing they really ♥♥♥♥ up on is the hero save system.Now if you have ever played fable before for longer than one playthrough you would have realized how bugged the herosave system is. Basically if your in the middle of a quest you cant save the game normally, you can only transfer your current hero to a previous save file as to not waste all the time you spent grinding experience in the current quest. however herosaving also transfers items...If you don't see the problem here I'm kinda surprised. By going into a quest and picking up an item of value and then herosaving to before you started the quest you can get infinite of that item. But don't get me wrong, i love this glitch, you can complete the game then herosave to before your first ever quest and complete it again with an over powered character and one shot all the bosses ;DBasically the only ""gamebreaking"" glitch in the game makes it better and most fans were horrified when they realized the remake had removed it.Its a solid game good gameplay good leveling system and good story. I have no problem with anything in the game except the aging system and as long as you don't abuse the herosave system that doesn't effect you to much anyway.Good luck fighting the final boss on your first run though. xDI rate 9/10, more content would mean the best game of all time for me. Oh yeh and if you know how you can get some of the best late game weapons before the first boss, the game developers really didn't think some of this stuff through.			"

Only if you're evil enough to do such a thing. You can choose between good and evil, you can change your looks, you can pick different weapons, learn different magical spells... You could go through the main quests rather quickly, or explore almost everything before you're even halfway through the storyline. I've heard the later games are great improvements on the first, allowing you to do more things and have more options.			"

												A classic RPG released on PC with extra content as Fable: The Lost Chapters. This is arguably one of the most immersive western RPG games ever. It's famous for its customization and immersion of the player into the world. You can do just about anything in the world of Albion as your choices have an impact on the world around you. If you perhaps choose to get married and retire your life of heroics for the life of a familyman, nothing's to stop you! Almost anything is imaginable in the world of Albion as you can choose to become a heroic warrior or an evil warlord as you set upon a path that will affect everything around you in one way or another.

												This is - by far- one of my favorite games of all time. If you enjoy any of the later Fable games, you have to understand that this is the foundation. In my opinion, this was the best of all the Fable franchise. I still remember the first time I went through the game and its many quests and options. I still feel nostalgia when slaying hobbes and innocent civillians. I probably loved this game most because of its morality system, how immersive it was, and how irresistable every quest was from start to finish. I guarantee that when you start and finish this game, you'll come back for more.			"

												A decent game which is good for most ages. Offering roughly 12 hours of gameplay (including side-quests), it's a fun game that you can play on a casual basis. The dialogue has its funny moments, though I have noticed that the same character can have multiple accents, which can be slightly confusing but hardly a game stopper. Personally I found this game really easy to get into and I think it may even have some advantages over its successors.Overall, it's worth getting.			"

												This game is amazing, I love the choices you can make that push you towards good or evil, how you update your stats (extremly simple and easy to understand). Its a fairly simple game to where a novice like me can play it with little difficulty, but the openworld experience makes up for how easy it is sometimes. All the little side quests and little things you can do on the side make for a game you can play for hours and not get bored easily.			"

												While the graphics may be dated compared to the latest installments of the Fable series, this was the first game I played as a child and the nostagia I feel every time I play it makes up for this fact. The flexiblity of gameplay and the variety of quests available make this an interesting game with a lot of replay value and overall one of my favourite games of all time.			"

												An amazing game with good and evil decisions. A older game being releaced around 04. Though still good graphics and very fun to customize your character's abilities. Also long and amazing story with a lot of hidden things to do, sometimes the side quests are just/ if not more fun then the main story. Always a delight to play and replay.			"

												Really interesting game, beautiful graphics for its age !The main quest is quite interesting (the first part of it really interesting, I was deceived by the second part...), maybe it is too manichean... That was the risk of the game to give points if you are good or not.Nevertheless, it was a real pleasure to play this game, it was wonderful to see how much the developers thought about details...I played my first game as a good boy, now, I want to try to be badder !

												Fable The Lost Chapters is an exceptional RPG adventure. You can customize your character to be, well, anything you want him to be. You can be an archer in robes. A wizard in full armor. You gain exp based on how you fight. You gain exp to level up your melee stats by using melee, ranged nets you ranged, magic nets you magic. Basic. The spells are vast and fun, and the swordplay is well done. My selling point is the archery though. While this game doesn't quite have as much visual customization, the combat and personality customization is unmatched. Super good? You get a halo. Evil? One foot long horns sprout out of your head and your eyes glow red. Yeah don't apply to any jobs like that bud. Won't get anywhere. Probably because there aren't jobs. You want money, get off your♥♥♥♥♥and beat the snot out of some monsters. Now THAT's work.			"

												Fable is an RPG that has a strong emphasis on choosing your path as good or evil.  Every quest has some sort of consequence that gives you points towards the two.  The fighting in the game, while sometimes frustrating, is enjoyable with many skills unlockable to the player.  The fighting, however awesome it maybe, also has some frustrations as I sometimes felt like the enemy could attack much faster than I ever could block or get out of the way.  The story is solid but expect a shorter than usual experience as this one only lasts about 16 hours - with the Lost Chapters adding about 2 - round the total for both the main game + expansion right at 18 hours.  The upside to this is it allows you to re-play and do the story through the other side of the coin and see how your actions affect the world and those you interact with.  Highly recommend!			"

												I owned fable 3 on my xbox a few years ago and unfortunately lost my xbox and moved over to ps3. For the past few years I walked by aimlessly without Fable in my life until a friend told me to download steam and gloriousy I see Fable:The Lost Chapters on for a very reasonable price and I couldn't resist. I was verydelighted when I started playing the game and remembered all the things I loved about Fable. The ridiculous lines the NPCs say in passing, the ability to kick chickens with a good bit of distance and of course the ability to do quests naked and get extra rewards for doing so. As I'm new to PC gaming it took me a while to get used to the controls but once I figured out how to handle it I got really into the game.			"

												Said to be the greatest RPG of all time, it lives up to it's praise. While not on the same level as Final Fantasy, is is still up there as an equal in it's own rights. What set this game apart from the rest is that with every choice comes a consequence. With every consequence comes a choice. And so the cycle repeats as you find yourself being drawn closer to the light of hope the world needs, or fall into the darkness that will change the world and how it sees you. Another key note is that depending on your good or evil actions, as well as your fighting syle, you will find not only your reputation change, but also your appearance as well. So take heed, hero, for the choices you make, you must live with the consequenes.			"

I have more than 100 hours in this game just on the steam account, not to mention the countless hours of play time on my original Xbox. Yet I still sit down and make a fresh new save file and start all over. I know the game like the back of my hand yet I still have more to do. Great, replayable game with a dark story with commedy splashed in. I havent got to play the new re-mastered version yet, but I can't wait for it. Highly recommend at least one play through.			"

												So one day my friend came over to my place with his Xbox and siad you have to play this game its awesome. that game was Fable and he was right.Fable takes the action-RPG game model and makes it so easy to get into you will want to play it over and over just to try everything out. You can do anything you want in Fable when it comes to building your character style, combat is fluid and moving from swordplay to magic to bow is seamless. The RPG elements are simple and easy for anyone to get into but at the same time no so simple as to be boring and tedious to manage. Where there is go there can also be bad, the closed paths leave you to adventure in a boxed world you can never find a spot that is new past your first playthrough. weapons are bountiful but limited, meaning you will find a lot of the same five styles but each sword is the same in the end. i have no complaints about the armor, being able to mix and match any kind of armor you can make your hero look just the way you wish. I reccomend this game to anyone who is new to the RPG world and is comming from an action platformer standing.8/10			"

Save the town and buy and trade like a good citizen, or kill everyone, buy every building, and collect rent to make money.My ONLY beef with it being on Steam for the PC, is that I have an Xbox controller specifically for games like this.

I loved the storyline, the side quests, the ability to change weapons/clothes/hairstyle...the map was also very easy to follow and I thought it was so cool that the hero aged.

												Hello there! If you're reading this, you're looking for a review on Fable: TLC, and i aim to please you with such.Fable - The Lost Chapters ( Fable:TLC for short) is the PC-Port of the game Fable 1 with added content & storyline, which also got released on the Xbox slightly after, the game focuses on being an action third player person view game which allows you to roleplay and costumize your character(hero) whether it be through skill, personality or appearance in various different ways.Throughout the entire game, you'll be given choices of which are categorized by beither either ""good"" or ""evil"", and by doing said actions, you gain points for each one, being evil will modify your character's visual look and make him look visibly like a demon, otherwise, by doing good, you'll have a halo on your head, and your hair will turn white alongside having butterflies fly around you.Do these actions actually matter towards the storyline? Yes, they do, you're given different cutscenes depending on what path you take and certain things change in the game as well as having different spells you can master.I'll be appointing each section a numerical value between 1 and 10 to make it easier and to allow quick TL;DR for those who don't really care for the in-depth review.-- Graphics --  (7/10)The game was originally released in 2004, then had it's expansion released in the later year of 2005, i'd state the graphics are very good for it's age and that they do not look bad at all, even if you think that way, the game is quite customizable and you can use mods to enchance your gameplay performance. ( There's also Fable:TLC Anniversary on Xbox now.)Are there any bugs regarding the graphics? Very little, you may experience some errors occasionally regarding character glows or weapon glows or entering a new area and the loading being awkward, but nothing out of the extraordinary.The game brings widescreen support so you also don't have to worry yourself about any of the screens bigger than 4:3 ratio.Some may be annoyed by the character's textures, but i think they look fine for the age of which the game was produced.-- Gameplay -- (7/10)The initial parts of the game hold very little action as it is showing you the storyplot, but as soon as you're done with the ""Wasp Queen"" quest, you'll start to frequently experience more and more action.The gameplay is very action-based and revolves around you as a hero focusing on the utilization of three main powerpoints, Strength, Skill(Speed, accuracy and stealth) and Will( Magical prowess), you spend points on these throughout the gmae in order to improve your character's statistics.Similarily to an MMO, the way to gain those points is by killing enemies, or doing quests, which will gain you ""experience points"", points that can be used to tap in all three of the major areas, or you can utilize specific points to each one.Ingame, you're given the option of going in full melee, sitting back with a bow or utilizing magic to enchance yourself, or a mixture of all of them, i believe that they did the variation very well and that there's no real downsides here, at times the characters may be able to hit you through awkward hitboxes, but that doesn't happen frequently.You may experience annoyance at the GuildMaster's constant bickering if you do not heal your Will/HP energy points up by either eating/utilizing a potion.NPC spawns are predictable and very rarely change with area when it comes to the enemy AI, they mostly repeat the same process over and over, HOWEVER, the AI is not to be underestimated as it is quite random and at times it will DECIDE to hit you when you least expect it, or block attacks and counter-attack you back, so it does increase the difficulty and i say kudos on this.For some, the game will be considered quite easy, and you will most likely not die a single time, the replay value in the gameplay is very high, so you can consider re-doing the game and even imposing challenges on yourself, or doing the ""boasting"" challenges that they grant you for each quest after the starter ones, allowing you to effectively increase the skill-cap required. ( Begins at the Orchard Farm quest).Weapon variety is high, from a numerous amount of 1handed weapons, 2 handed, and allowing you to even change between crossbows and bows for ranged endeavors, the modding is also well open and allows the modification of weapons to create new custom-content or even apply other character weapons into your own.Same applies for customization, you can customize your character in any way you'd like, ranging from tatoos, different titles, armor, mixing armor parts( boots, shirt, etc) and all sorts of fun stuff. IE: You CAN get drunk in this game or become fat, and there are various mini-games, easter eggs,jokes & Demon doors along the way so that the gameplay is not constantly filling your face with action, same for the side-quests which allow you to take a small break from the main one.You can abuse certain points of the game to get your character stronger than it should be at the current time or grab items that you otherwise would have difficulty having through the ""Hero Save"" option, or by utilizing a trader glitch that allows you to gain more everytime you buy and resell specific items at the early stages of the game allowing you to rack up a large amount of gold. But these do not necessarily break the game for me, and you can choose not to utilize them in the first place as they were player-created.More on the ""Hero Saving"", you have two types of save, a ""World"" save in which it saves your current position and everything you hold, and a ""Hero Save"" which saves your items currently held and puts you at the initial scene of the quest, you MAY not save your location ingame during an ongoing quest which may annoy some.A trait that may be annoying for some is the aging system which is based on your skill progress.(age increases as you level skills)Others may get bored out of the action-combat due to having too much experience with the game, however the replay value is great even then.   -- Performance -- (8/10)The game's performance is great, it works even on older PCS with outdated graphic cards, and it has many numerous options in order to tone down the graphics, i did not feel at any time any moment of which i had a drop of FPS.The game is compatible with different types of OS so you do not need to worry about having Vista, XP or Windows 7, as they all work.There is a slight problem in that the game will SOMETIMES CRASH unexpectely and for unknown reasons, or simply NOT play Audio clips at times it should, however it does have a safe-mode itself and you can usually run that if you run into any performance issues. -- Audio -- (6/10)The OST is decent, i feel as though it could've been better and it is lacking in a lot of fighting scenes / cutcenes, the ones that do have it are fitting though, nothing majorly special.-- General -- (7/10)I believe the game is quite legendary for it's time, even if you dislike it or hate it, it has created a giant fanbase and was one of the best prequels imagineable for the Fable series, many people to this day still prefer Fable:TLC over Fable II &  Fable III.I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a game with a lot of fighting & magic, but at the same time wants to roleplay, enjoy himself and fascinate himself with the good story plot that it provides, making full use of the unique story-dialogue cutscenes given to you.( they may be boring for some but i for one love them)It is a must-buy for any RPG-lover and if it's on sale i would definitely say get it as it's worth every penny unless you are not into the genre.Thanks for reading this review, and i hope that gave you a good idea of what the game is like, allowing you to reconsider and ponder your opinion on whether to get it.

												Ahhh yes... brings back some good memories.This games has always been fun, it's addicting and has lots to do.The fact that its ""Lost Chapters"" you got yourself alot more♥♥♥♥♥♥to do! Even once you defeat ""Ehem"" no spoilersThe graphics are... meh, but you shouldn't care any way, graphics aren't what determine a good game.The sound effects are fine, nuff said there.The gameplay.... oh my... I love it personally, i think its a bit bizarre at first, but once you get used to it, this game controls like butta! Smooth and slick!The storyline is good too, simple, not ♥♥♥♥ing ""shutter island"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, it's nothing amazing, but enough for you to actually grow towards some of the characters.Of course, the morale choices of the game and what not are fantastic, this is still hands down, the best fable game out there. The other fables are.... theyre not too bad, but they pale in comparison to this beauty.If this game had a ♥♥♥♥♥, I'd softly finger it8/10			"

												Fable is a franchise I've had a bit of a rocky relationship with. My first experience was Fable II (having completely missed the original), and it is one of my favorite games of the Xbox 360 era. Fable III, not so much. With Fable Anniversary coming out soon, the remake of the now 10 year old RPG, I figured why not just get a cheap copy of the original and see what it’s all about. The premise starts you as a young boy in the town of Oakvale in the land of Albion, who has a loving sister and parents. But that kind of story makes for a boring video game, so a group of bandits attack your village, kidnaping your mother and sister, and murdering practically everyone else, including your father. But before you meet your own demise, you’re saved by a hero named Maze, and are inducted into the Guild of Heroes. In the world of Albion, a hero isn't just a title but an occupation, something you learn by joining the guild. The game switches over to your teenage years for your guild training and then finally to adulthood after you become a true hero. This is the first neat trick Fable does, giving your character, and the world, a real sense of growth. Seeing the world change around you as you grow and make choices is neat, and gives everything a sense of place.Fable has the typical “your character glows if they’re good and pale skin and devil horns if you’re evil” that most games with morality like to do, but how you spec your character also affects them. If you put a bunch of points into strength, your character will become more bulky and muscular as a result, while if you put a lot of points into magic, you get glowing blue tattoos on your face. Unfortunately the options felt a bit too simple preventing me from having my character look exactly how I want. I like my characters to be a bit on the thin and scrawny side, probably because I myself am thin and scrawny, but there wasn't any way to go full on melee combat without forcing yourself to become a hulking beast. A little more variety on this front would have been cool.In combat your main tool will be your melee, of which you are given a nice selection of fast swords like the katana, something with a bit more punch like great swords, and even more massive weapons like hammers. There’s not much in the ways of multiple attacks, it’s rather simplistic with one button for attacking and another for using a flourish attack when you build one up. It’s all about timing and avoiding your enemies with blocks and dodges. Getting in hits and avoiding them yourself builds up your combat multiplier, letting you deal more damage. It’s a system that works but by the end of the game I found myself a little tired of it. The ranged combat, bows and crossbows, I found to be rather useless. It has its place in certain situations but you’re not going to want to spec your character into a full ranged one, which is a disappointment. Magic is by far the most interesting and varied. There’s a ton of spells all put into a bunch of categories. So if you want to go full on attack magic you can throw points into lighting, fire, etc. Even if you’re melee focused like I was, it’s worth getting spells like slow time, which I found invaluable during the later parts of the game.The core of Fable has you taking on guild quests, making choices, and being the ""hero."" The moral choice system is bit too black and white for my tastes. You’re never really given any grey area and it’s always very clear which is good and which is evil. Having a character say something like, ""you can go do this quest for this reward, or I guess if you were some sort of evil person you could always just kill me,"" doesn't really leave much to the imagination. One nice thing however is the game does provide full good and full evil side quests, usually having them be on opposite sides of the same problem. Will you take the quest the farmers put up to help stop the bandit raids, or will you take the quest the bandits put up to help with the raid. Stuff like that’s more fun because it lets you put your intentions forward right away rather than giving you some black and white choice half way through the quest.Another big component of the game is the interaction system with NPCs. You hero has a ton of different emotions they can express ranging from simple ones like laughing or saying hi, too more morality specific ones like flexing your heroic muscles or giving an evil laugh, too the ridiculously absurd such as farting and doing the chicken dance. Sadly I never found myself having any real gameplay reason to use them past their first time. For example you can flirt with NPCs and eventually have them fall in love with you. Cool idea, but no real benefit doing it. I didn't even have to try honestly. By the end of the game, every girl, and even some men, had a big enough heart above them that I could simply walk up to them, hand them a wedding ring, and be married before the sun set without even trying. The ability to interact with NPCs is a neat idea, and admittedly I got excited when they started to call me by my title I picked out and talking about past quests I did, but overall it feels more like a proof of concept than a fully implemented feature.The story does go to some interesting places and has a large focus on family, with the hero's sister and mother coming heavily into play. This does give everything a more personal feel to it and I found myself caring in the hero's journey and his seeking revenge. The antagonist, Jack of Blades, lives up to his awesome name by being a great creepy villain. My only wish was that is motivations were explained better as I was never quite sure why he was doing what he was doing other than to just be evil.It’s worth noting that I played the PC version, known as Fable: The Lost Chapters, which contains a bunch of extra characters, side quests, and continues the story after the final boss battle, which by the way was pretty weak. The extra content is cool, adding new characters and extra story that is welcome, but doesn't feel completely necessary. Also the new final boss somehow manages to be easier and lamer than the original.Graphically the game holds up pretty well for being 10 years old. Stuff like faces and character animations feel a bit old and outdated however it is saved by Fable's art direction which still shines though. The game goes for a very classic bedtime story fantasy look, hence the name, and succeeds at it well. It’s a world that takes itself very seriously one minute, and starts poking fun at itself the next. It all manages to work very well; making Albion a world you want to spend time in. This is also helped greatly thanks to the music, which is quite wonderful, perfectly capturing the whimsy the game is throwing at you.For a 10 year old game Fable one holds up surprisingly well. Moral choice in games has certainly grown in the years and in a lot of ways fable feels too simplistic in its decisions to a fault. But at the same time it all works well in the context of its storybook like nature. If you want a fun filled adventure where you get to be the hero, or villain, Fable is still a game worth checking out.			"

Only downside is that the sword of aeons has been severely nerfed in this PC adaptation so killing endless waves of Oakvale guards for exp isn't as easy. 9/10			"

NPCs are standard NPCs nuff said, but you can kill them all if you want. combat is simple and to the point. the weapons are well balanced.no glitches that can break your game.the save system is subpar but not badly.plus CHICKEN KICKING!!!  overall 100/10			"

												Fable 1 is arguably the best game in the franchise and all that was missing was some improvements here and there. Many would argue that Fable revolutionized how RPG sandbox games work and play which I don't agree with. However, I will say Fable 1 is more memorable in terms of characters, the story, the magic attacks and loot. While the choices in the game are very black and white, and the story itself never changes to appeal to your aligment, Fable 1 is still enjoyable. The PC version is much more diffucult than on the Xbox, giving what most gamers want, a challenge. I highly recommened this, but unless you want to deal with the clunky keyboard controls, get a PC xbox controller.			"

Now after playing this I understand why people hate Fable 3. I thought Fable The Lost Chapters was gonna be dull and boring, BOY WAS I WRONG!! This game is amazing in everyway. Great story, a bunch of classes you can choose from (knight, spellswarrior, battle mage, assassin, ranger, etc.). Its not too hard but no where near as easy as Fable 3. If your looking for a good game to play I would definitaly play Fable: The Lost Chapters, and if you dont YOU ARE MISSING OUT!			"

												Dobry, zły i niebrzydki.Bawiłam się przy niej doskonale. Fable: The Lost Chapters satysfakcjonuje, wciąga, bardzo szybko mijają przy niej kolejne godziny rozgrywki. Nie odrzuca mechaniką, syci walką, czary cieszą oko. W Albionie sympatycznie spędza się czas, bo jest to miejsce urokliwe i przepełnione humorem. Wprawdzie poziom trudności mógłby być większy, bo w tej grze trzeba się mocno napocić, by zginąć definitywnie. Bohater nie odzywa się ani słowem, jest kukiełką która wykonuje kolejne zadania dla kolejnych osób. Charakteru dodaje mu osobista wendetta, którą gracz chce uskutecznić. Ale nie tylko nasze sprawy popychają herosa do działań - do rozwiązania są duże problemy i małe dramaty. Albion potrzebuje Bohatera. Czy to Ty nim będziesz? Polecam, bo to znakomita zabawa.			"

There are a lot of shortcomings that make me wonder what the makers were thinking when the game was in progress.  The fighting system is pretty limited and at times felt like it was nearly impossible to land a hit without taking a good chunk of damage.  Not to mention that you are able to get the best weapon and best armor pretty dang early in the game.  However the storyline is pretty good and a lot of other game mechanics a fairly well balanced.Keep in mind that yes, I do realize this is an ""older"" game by our standards now..			"

												This is a game for Fable fans--I think it's actually superior to its console cousin and even Fable Anniversary.  If you've never played a Fable game, It's an enjoyable action rpg mixed with goofy British humor and charm.  Don't expect a ""Last of Us"" caliber story by any stretch, but if you're looking for some light-hearted questing mixed with a charming unique setting, this game might be for you.			"

												Judging Fable’s qualities as a video game, both then and now, is a relatively easy thing to do. But trying to come to a conclusion about this game as a whole is a lot more difficult. Playing the original game again the raw ambition is still obvious, but inevitably many of its best ideas have now been appropriated by other games. And, equally inevitably, most of those other games have managed to fashion a more consistently enjoyable experience out of them.I got this game mainly due to the fact I like RPGs and there are little available for the 360. Part of my gripe with Fable is largely due to the emmulation of the 360 console as opposed to the game itself however, Fable still has some irritating aspects which I'll cover first.On the subject of the actual emmulation, the game requires at least 2 or 3 updates to be installed every time I put the game on which is a bit annoying although undertstandable. However, the emmulation at time causes my game to freeze which takes me onto my next point regarding the game.The save procedure can be infuriating. While for the most part you can complete a ""world"" save which stores everything you've done you can't do this mid quest. All you can complete is a ""hero"" save which stores you're experience but not how far you are in the quest. Bearing in mind some quests are very long winded, and during this you do a lot of battling. What really annoyed me was getting half way through one, then going into a different area of Albion only to find my game freezes on the load page leaving me to restart the console. That also meant that I was back to square 1 with the quests.			"

												Score: 7/10I had the original Fable pre-ordered for XBOX and played it day one. The hype surrounding the game at the time almost totally ruined the experience for me because no game could live up to that kind of hype honestly. I enjoyed the game well enough for what it was. Looking back after having played Fable 2 I must say that I enjoyed the first one more. I honestly think in this case even though they didn't deliver the game that was advertised they did deliver a great fantasy world with enemies and weapons that were unique. The Lost Chapters perfected this game and honestly without the addition I probably wouldn't own a copy today. Some say this game doesn't hold up to the test of time and playing it is pure nostalgia driven, but I beg to differ. The only game I can compare the storytelling naration to is probably Trine.			"

												The first game in the Fable franchise, and my favorite. The gameplay can be compared to Elderscrolls, but with a more ballanced approach to gameplay. Stat's are raized by experience (divided up depending on how you kill your enemies), but farther along in the game there isn't really anything keeping you from specializing in all three areas (Strength, Skill (dexterity), and Magic). The idea of Good and Evil play's an important part in the story, allowing you to be either admired or feared. The Lost Chapters is an extention to your story, bringing you to a new land with new adventures. The comedy in the game is carried out through hilarious dialogue, while still maintaining a serrious main storyline. For those who long for a great Action RPG from the past, this is the one for you!			"

												Said to be the greatest RPG of all time, it lives up to it's praise. While not on the same level as Final Fantasy, is is still up there as an equal in it's own rights. What set this game apart from the rest is that with every choice comes a consequence. With every consequence comes a choice. And so the cycle repeats as you find yourself being drawn closer to the light of hope the world needs, or fall into the darkness that will change the world and how it sees you. Another key note is that depending on your good or evil actions, as well as your fighting syle, you will find not only your reputation change, but also your appearance as well. So take heed, hero, for the choices you make, you must live with the consequenes.			"

												This remake and extension is second to none.  The graphics for a game from (technically) 2004 are extremely good and fit the entire aura the game tries to create. If you're not familiar with the Fable franchise, you essentially experience the life of a hero but also mould and shape his reputation and stature within the town. You are faced with many problems that need solving either through being 'good' or 'bad'. These decisions affect the story-line, those around you and even the town itself. The Lost Chapters offers new content as the story continues from where the game ended in the original version, giving you hours of fun. Not only is the playability of this game exceptional, it also has a great feel to it and feels natural when in combat etc. This makes combat fun and not tiresome despite some repetitve enemies and repetitive movements. The AI in combat are actually pretty smart which adds to the fun, they can dodge, block and counter, often making it difficult to hurt them... not too challenging, but challenging enough for a fun battle with every encounter. The length of the game is not bad at all, it should take you around 10-11 hours to complete the game with minimal exploring... whilst this is significantly shorter than the following titles, this captivating story is definitely worth at least a run through. It's the sort of game you want to play again and again, doing things differently each time and seeing how that affects your hero and also those around you. I'm currently on my fourth time round this game (just on this platform) and not bored even in the slightest. In regards to the other Fable titles, I'd say they're all equally awesome and enthralling. If I had to pick an absolute favourite it would have to be Fable 2. Yet, this game is almost up there and transitions you well throughout each game if you follow the titles from the start up, seeing the development of this game is very rewarding. I just hope Fable 2 is released on Steam, that would be rad. The look and feel of this game is beautiful, a well designed game with everything thought out well. The world in which you immerse yourself is visually stunning and very light-hearted, often bright and alluring, however, when evil forces are around the sky will turn grey and there will be a shift in atmosphere. The game creates atmosphere very well utilising the scenery, lighting and music. A nice touch for an aged game is the aging of your character over the course of the story and also his metamorphosis into an angel-like figure or devil-like figure (dependant on the path you choose). This really does immerse you into the game and gets you emotionally involved with your character and creates a synthetic relationship as you've essentially been with him is whole life and shaped the man he is today. A final note is the sound work with the game; excellent. Nice voice acting and nice sound effects and the soundtrack of the game is very fitting and gives you a nice warm sense of adventure as you delve into the world of Fable. Definitely pick up this game! Pros:-Visually stunning and captivating.- You shape how the game is played. - Enticing narrative which emotionally invloves you well.- Great voice acting and great atmosphere held throughout. Cons:-Not Fable 2.9.5 out of 10 for me.			"

												This game is fantastic. Definitely one of my top 5 of all-time.The graphics are wonderful for it's time and even know. The voice acting is spectacular. The combat is insanely fun. And the story is wonderful. This is a linear world RPG game. It's not an open world like Skyrim, more like Knights of the Old Republic or Jade Empire which is very nice.In terms of combat, you can use swords and axes, bows and crossbows and lastly magic. The magic abilities are really awesome and some of my favorites of all-time. Unfortunately, there are no staves whatsoever for you mages out there. There aren't a whole of items in terms of apparel. I did not find this a problem, why? Because the few items you can get are AWESOME and very beautiful. Examples are mage robes, armour and basic civilian attire.This game is very easy. Not difficult at all. You will probably never die and once be stumped in this game. It is seriously just a hack and slash game. There is only one boss where even the least bit of strategy is involed to kill him. In a sense, making it a hack and slash, but it's not a bad thing at all because this game makes combat fun. Decapations and shooting peoples heads off are some of the best.You can get drunk, get married, own a ♥♥♥♥♥ house and even your own bar. Cool right? Right. Though these things don't have a huge impact on you whatsoever, this is one of the earliest RPGs that allowed you to do some of those things..well..,mainly the ♥♥♥♥♥ house. Ha. You can even rent your homes to people and get extra gold, cha-ching! If that's not enough, you can gain trophies from completing quests and show them off to raise your renown level!  Gold, health and mana are very easy to come by. It's very convenient. This is honestly one of the ONLY RPGs I was not afraid to be a spellcaster with. I usually fret in most games because you always seem to run out of mana at the most unconvenient times, am I right? Well not this game! They are everywhere and it's great. I loved killing the masses of undead heading my way with lighting, or using my infernal wrath to conjure up a circular energy on the ground to stop them in there tracks and completely obliterate them. It's the small things, ya know?The story is beautiful and you can't wait to see what happens next, even though the story is short. To 100% this game, it takes 15 hours max. Then again, I've beaten this game about 8 times. 100% also including upgrading ALL your skills (which again, a lot of games don't allow you to do that as well) collecting all the dolls from mini-games and books as well. In all reality, this game is very small, but it packs so much awesomeness that it's forgiveable.Becoming evil allows you to grow horns and have flies hanging around you 24/7. As fun as being evil can be, I'm not a big fan of the hairloss. Being good looks awesome as well, having a halo and a blue light surrounding you is nice. Speaking of which, tattoos and beards! These actually effect you in a big way. If you have that scary tattoo, you'll have the females and males yelping and bolting out of the sigh of your presence. Having a nice hair and stache and the ladies and gents will dig you, a lot. Sexual orientation is really awesome as well. You can really be  who you want..minus a female because you have to be a male in this game.Honestly, I could speak of how wonderful this game is for hours. It's just..for me, that game that I'll always be able to recommend and talk about. It's just a great experience and if you have a little over half a day or need to pull an allnight for whatever reason. Make this your go to game and go slave some balvarians and win the arena! Do yourself a favor and check this game out.			"

												I seriously recommend this game if you are a fan of Fable 2 and 3. It's great. It's user friendly for its age, the camera controls aren't as weird as the second game and everytime I play it I don't stop for hours. The graphics aren't as great as the second or third but there's just something about this game that makes me return to it. In this particular Fable you age as you play the game until you become an old man. I love that concept and I wish the newer ones integrated it. The only thing I don't like about it is that you can't be a female. If you have the money and like a game with rich lore and nostalgia play it. You won't be disappointed.			"

												Fable - The Lost Chapters is a game bases on a small kid that lives in the town of oakvale one night his town gets attacked by bandits and he tries to flee but sadly see his parents die before his own eyes he then wants revenge and joins the hero's guild I quite enjoyed the game,once you start playing you just need to keep going,it's like a good book! the story isn't the strongest part of this game although i quite liked it.The game is now 8 years old and the graphics do show that a bit but there are worse looking games the graphics are very colorfull though and the big magic attacks look pretty good,also it means that this game runs great on old systems my pc has a gt 545 and it can run this game on maximum like a breeze There is a decent amount of choice in weapons although the blades and maces are way better then the bows and crossbowsthere also is a nice amount of armour sets to choose from but i do think that the ''magic'' combat needs a bit more attention.attack and armour wise.This games is also pretty short (played it out in around 12 hours) but you can keep playing a new secondary story after you defeat the final boss,but i dont think that will take to long also there are a couple of things that to bother me in this game1.theres a glitch/exploit how you can get unlimited money so basicly you can beat the game without taking a potion or anything 2.the mouth anymations are really really bad.3.The game world is a bit small,and there are a bunch of loading screens,they don't take very long so it isn't a big complaint.If you can pick this game up for cheap i would reccomend it,especially for those who like rpg's and fantasy games. i would give it a (6/10)			"

I played through the game about 4 times on the XBOX, and even though i know almost everything i cant stop playing. ''The Lost Chapters'' adds some cool and funny stories to the main game, i really like the PC-remake in overall.Everyone who is searching for something to play on a rainy Weekend, something which he can dive into, he should definitely buy Fable - The Lost Chapters.

Especially the that whole good or evil decisions thing has been carved out quite consequently. A downer are the very restricted levels, some of which you have to pass several times, always fighting the same enemies.But then there is this absolutely wonderful soundtrack (if you don't know it yet, search in youtube) which makes every minute in the game feel like a reward.8.5/10			"

												 I have to say I wasn't to exited to play this game when I first started. I previously played Fable III and only bought the game after hearing the poplar complaint that Fable II and III had failed to live up standards of the first game. Firstly,  the opening tutorial was painful at times and the graphics are not the best thing this game has to offer, but once you get past that, Fable: The Lost Chapters is a truly enjoyable game. The combat system is fluid for melee, ranged, and magic alike, the leveling/experience system rewards you XP for not only defeating monsters and completing quest but also for which skills you used to do so. For explain, if I used magic abilities, whether they be combative or not, I would receive Magic XP, which I then could spend on buying or upgrading my magical talents.  Thus the more I use my skills, the better I will be at those skills. Another feature I liked was the ability to Boast. Just after you take a quest you have the ability to Boast about what you will do on said quest, for explain doing the entire quest with no clothes or without taking or doing damage, doing so increases gold you will receive at the completion of the quest while also providing a challenge for the journey ahead.  In order to truly get the Fable experience and better understand the series you must give this game a try.			"

												Fable-The Lost Chapters is a fantastic rpg for every type of gamer out there. You can become a gleaming white knight or a Blood gushing chaotic hellspawn that kills his own family members. Its all up to you how you turn out. The gameplay is somewhat simplistic, but perfect for newcomers. The music is nice and sometimes beautiful. What makes this game so awesome is the ""free will"" you have to do what you please on any quest. Whether it be keeping the eggs your collecting for the farmer or slaying your own sister to go from being the ultimate Holy Warrior to the most evil hellspawn in existence in the blink of a eye. I highly reccomend this game to anyone who is looking for a good time with plenty of replay value.			"

												The original Fable on the Xbox was an instant classic. When lost chapters hit the PC market with the ability to improve visuals and improve performance as well as give us all the new content it was pretty amazing.The PC version has perks, plain and simple. The modding community who adopted lost chapters pumped out some amazing modifications, overhauls and balancing changes. New trophies, weapons, rare drops like hero items, and I've even heard you could play as a Balverine if you wanted to.My point is, this is worth every penny they are asking. It may have been shallow in its alignment system, but the game itself is still a memorable blast.			"

												I played Fable on the Original Xbox almost a decade ago and back then I stated that Fable was ""the best game I had ever played""- of course, better games have come along since then and have swept that title away from Fable's grasp, but that doesn't demote the fact that this game is an absolute masterpiece not only for its time, but by todays standards too.I'm sort of nervous writing this ""review""- not because I fear the criticism I may get in return for creating it because I doubt they'll be any, but more for the fact that I want this game to get the good review it deserves as I absolutely adore this game, nonetheless, let me get into why. Unlike most RPG's that force you to go down one linear path, Fable grants you the freedom to set which moral allignment you want to persue which  will determine how you look visually and how people will treat you. If you chose to be evil, you will grow horns, flies will start to fly around you and villagers will boo and scream when they see you however if you chose to be good, you will grow a halo, butterflies will start to fly around you and villagers will cheer and compliment you when they see you- it's the tiny details that come together to make this game great. One thing I must critisize is the lack of sublety when making a moral decision, sometimes it can be so obvious that it's just ""press the LMB to be good and the RMB to be evil"", which although it's still nice to be given the option, could of be relayed in a better way to the player. The quests are actually interesting and never feel like a grind, gracefully not following the usual way of modern RPGs in the sense that all the work goes into the main questline and the side quests are just ""kill, fetch and return"". The characters are memorable and will stick with you throughout the game. The storyline, although starting to get slightly confusing halfway through, is still gripping. If you've watched any videos about Peter Molyneux preaching Fable by lying and building it up to be better than what it is, then I'd understand why you'd be disappointed playing the game, however if you haven't and have just stumbled upon this review either by accident or by sheer curiousity, I'm almost certain that if you're an avid fan of RPG's that this will become one of your favourites for life.

												If you want to play fable does not matter if your new to the game or played the other games fable the lost chapters is by the far the best fable game there is. The humor of the game is daft and it does not take itself serious too much. The combat has three things magic, ranged and melee you choose what one you want to main or go into all three the game lets you do that. Played this game as a kid loved it then love it now.			"

												This game is truly amazing, I freakin' love it! In my opinion, this is the only truly impressive game in the Fable series. In this game you play as The Hero Of Oakvale, a young child with dreams of greatness. The game sees you grow from a young punk, into a daring hero, dark warrior, or powerful mage. You can be anything you want in the game, you can even be a naked guy who runs around murdering people with a pic-axe! The game has fairly good graphics for the time, and I think they've aged fairly well.This game's soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks I've heard in an RPG! The theme tune was done by the amazing Danny Elfman, the same guy who did the music for the Spiderman trilogy and The Simpsons. The game allows true character evolution, as your character will evolve depending upon what skills you choose to focus on and your chosen allignment. For example, if you focus on building your strength skills you will become a big muscly giant. If you focus on being a good guy, you will look like Super Saiyan Goku. The game allows you to be whatever you want, and that's what I enjoy.The game does have problems though, and I'm going to avoid talking about the false advertising, because everyone has already bashed on it. One of the main annoyances I've had with the game is it's difficulty. It's way too easy, seriously! Five hours into the game and I'm able to bat everything away with zero effort! Almost all of the magic spells are overpowered and break the game. Do yourself a favor and avoid getting the Slow Time spell, it will kill any fun you can have. On top of that, there are various exploits in the game to get more powerful in a short amount of time. One such example is that the game features Ages potions, which give you a fair boost in EXP in a certain skill tree.The problem? If you have your combat multiplier up high enough and drink the potion, you'll get mad EXP for almost nothing! I had my combat multiplier at 14 and drank a potion, and got 14800 EXP in the will category! Also, the story was fairly predictable at times, and some of the characters seemed flat. I never really liked Briar Rose all that much, and Maze was just lame to me. I'd like Guildmaster more if he didn't pipe random advice into my ear every five seconds. And I found that some sidequests were either really lame, or didn't off much reward. One such quest is one where I have to acquire for blue mushrooms to cure a sick child, but the reward wasn't really that great in the grand scheme of things.Despite all that, I highly reccomend this game! If you're new to open-world RPGs and are on the fence of getting into these kinds of games, Fable would be a good starter for you. It isn't as large or as immerssive as Oblivon, Fallout 3, or Kingdoms Of Amalur, but you'll still get some bang out of your buck. Fable introduced me to the world of action RPGs, and I will never regret buying this game used back in the day. When this game goes on sale, I highly suggest picking it up. One final thing to note: This game does not have a difficulty slider, so you're stuck with the preset difficulty. Like said, it's easy but totally worth the price tag.			"

												I seriously recommend this game if you are a fan of Fable 2 and 3. It's great. It's user friendly for its age, the camera controls aren't as weird as the second game and everytime I play it I don't stop for hours. The graphics aren't as great as the second or third but there's just something about this game that makes me return to it. In this particular Fable you age as you play the game until you become an old man. I love that concept and I wish the newer ones integrated it. The only thing I don't like about it is that you can't be a female. If you have the money and like a game with rich lore and nostalgia play it. You won't be disappointed.			"

												At first glance this game just looks like your average RPG, but further research shows that it is much much more than that. First off in Fable every character has enormous hands and feet, don't let this turn you off, and really small teeth. The game looks great for something that was released 10 years ago that is if you're okay with original xbox level graphics. The game feels natural once you learn all of the controls but if you're playing on a laptop GET A MOUSE or else the game will be frustrating to the max. The music in this game is just generic RPG music so don't expect to be blown away by fully orchestrated tracks. Also the voices in this game are laughably bad for example many NPCs speak with a cocny accent which really grinds my gears, but that's just me. In addition to that whenever your health is low an old man nags you to eat food or use a healing potion, yeah I heard you the first time just let me live my life. While this game is no Zeld: Ocarina of Time it's a fun jaunt into an unoriginal fantasy world. Get it whenever it's on sale, you may or may not be sorry.			"

												played this not-quite-legally the first time around, but it's one of the greatest games I know so I had to buy it eventually.The story is epic, the music is just wonderful, and the choices you can make show the whole roleplay side of things. Most likely you won't see the plot twists coming, the twists and turns of the story are amazing. One downside, that isn't really a downside just side you can abuse greatly, is the economics. By realising that everything works in a supply and demand way, and that traders have infinite money, you can easily make over a million gold before even going through darkwood.All in all, I think the game is wonderful and would gladly recommend it!

												Very rarely do I play role-playing games and even rarer do I complete them. Fable, an above average game of that particular genre, is one that knows not to overstay its welcome.Like many other role-playing games that have come before and after, gameplay revolves around gaining experience by completing quests and slaying enemies. While leveling up, you may invest in one of three attributes: magic, melee, and ranged combat. It's always exciting to see your character progress from an underling to a skilled warrior of sorts.Unfortunately, Fable's combat system could use some improvements. The blocking mechanism seems completely useless as many enemies will give no indication of when they attack.Fable is the kind of game in which, to enjoy its full experience, requires at least two playthroughs. I'd expect good and evil choices to result in drastically different consequences. Maybe I'll update this review if I ever replay Fable. Nonetheless, this comes highly recommended!Grade: B			"

												Fable is a game about one thing - beating the snot out of everything in sight.  Many will say that it is supposed to be about choice, but in reality the choices don't matter aside from giving you specific weapons (or constantly having the village guards on you about simply existing).  Beat up enemies, search for relics to increase your power, do quests to increase your influence, follow the storyline.  Rinse, repeat.In terms of environment I'd prefer a game similar to Dragon Quest 8 or The Elder Scrolls for this type of gameplay.  The world is segregated by zones and paths between them rather than an open world you are able to get lost in, quickly quashing any feeling of freedom in exploration you would otherwise have in the game.Freedom in building your character, on the other hand, is much closer to the other end of the spectrum.  You can play as a melee weapon strength user, a ranged weapon skill user, or a physics-bending will user.  Or, if you want to put another 100 or so hours into the game, you can do all three and make yourself nearly untouchable.  Tons of melee weapons, ranged weapons, and spells make any of the three viable - but ultimately you'll be building these up by beating the snot out of everything in sight.			"

												Pretty good game with a nice combat system.  The game is fun and lets you make choices.  Even though the choices are black and white, you still have an impact on the world with your choices which is great because alot of games made recently that you make choices in, don't even let you see the fruit of your choices and consequences.  The game is priced well and I would recommend it to anyone.  It is also a pretty good port and reminds you of the old days of gaming.			"

												I seriously recommend this game if you are a fan of Fable 2 and 3. It's great. It's user friendly for its age, the camera controls aren't as weird as the second game and everytime I play it I don't stop for hours. The graphics aren't as great as the second or third but there's just something about this game that makes me return to it. In this particular Fable you age as you play the game until you become an old man. I love that concept and I wish the newer ones integrated it. The only thing I don't like about it is that you can't be a female. If you have the money and like a game with rich lore and nostalgia play it. You won't be disappointed.			"

												Fable: The Lost Chapters,  this game over all is a well put game, alough the game can become repitious and quite obvious on whats going to happen next it still brings the classic RPG feel to a 3D game. now with the added bit on the end of the story they allow you to contineu on with game making more choices and get better stats, alough i think this was more or less to allow players to go back and finish random side quests and to be able to use the swords you get from killing jack. now all they need to do is make the trilogy with all the dlc's on steam so we can play the entire trilogoy from the very start all the way to the end, experiencing the hard desicions and choices we have to make :) .... please give us the trilogy "

												This game is fantastic. Definitely one of my top 5 of all-time.The graphics are wonderful for it's time and even know. The voice acting is spectacular. The combat is insanely fun. And the story is wonderful. This is a linear world RPG game. It's not an open world like Skyrim, more like Knights of the Old Republic or Jade Empire which is very nice.In terms of combat, you can use swords and axes, bows and crossbows and lastly magic. The magic abilities are really awesome and some of my favorites of all-time. Unfortunately, there are no staves whatsoever for you mages out there. There aren't a whole of items in terms of apparel. I did not find this a problem, why? Because the few items you can get are AWESOME and very beautiful. Examples are mage robes, armour and basic civilian attire.This game is very easy. Not difficult at all. You will probably never die and once be stumped in this game. It is seriously just a hack and slash game. There is only one boss where even the least bit of strategy is involed to kill him. In a sense, making it a hack and slash, but it's not a bad thing at all because this game makes combat fun. Decapations and shooting peoples heads off are some of the best.You can get drunk, get married, own a ♥♥♥♥♥ house and even your own bar. Cool right? Right. Though these things don't have a huge impact on you whatsoever, this is one of the earliest RPGs that allowed you to do some of those things..well..,mainly the ♥♥♥♥♥ house. Ha. You can even rent your homes to people and get extra gold, cha-ching! If that's not enough, you can gain trophies from completing quests and show them off to raise your renown level!  Gold, health and mana are very easy to come by. It's very convenient. This is honestly one of the ONLY RPGs I was not afraid to be a spellcaster with. I usually fret in most games because you always seem to run out of mana at the most unconvenient times, am I right? Well not this game! They are everywhere and it's great. I loved killing the masses of undead heading my way with lighting, or using my infernal wrath to conjure up a circular energy on the ground to stop them in there tracks and completely obliterate them. It's the small things, ya know?The story is beautiful and you can't wait to see what happens next, even though the story is short. To 100% this game, it takes 15 hours max. Then again, I've beaten this game about 8 times. 100% also including upgrading ALL your skills (which again, a lot of games don't allow you to do that as well) collecting all the dolls from mini-games and books as well. In all reality, this game is very small, but it packs so much awesomeness that it's forgiveable.Becoming evil allows you to grow horns and have flies hanging around you 24/7. As fun as being evil can be, I'm not a big fan of the hairloss. Being good looks awesome as well, having a halo and a blue light surrounding you is nice. Speaking of which, tattoos and beards! These actually effect you in a big way. If you have that scary tattoo, you'll have the females and males yelping and bolting out of the sigh of your presence. Having a nice hair and stache and the ladies and gents will dig you, a lot. Sexual orientation is really awesome as well. You can really be  who you want..minus a female because you have to be a male in this game.Honestly, I could speak of how wonderful this game is for hours. It's just..for me, that game that I'll always be able to recommend and talk about. It's just a great experience and if you have a little over half a day or need to pull an allnight for whatever reason. Make this your go to game and go slave some balvarians and win the arena! Do yourself a favor and check this game out.			"

												One of my absolute favourite RPGs around.I originally played the Xbox version through 4 or 5 times, the story is nice, the affect you can have on the world is fun, and you can choose to play as a nice character, or an evil one.I was a bit hesitant to pick up the PC version, but from what i have played it runs smoothly, and looks just as good as it did in the Xbox version.It looks  a little dated now, but the art style is still very nice to behold, and the game systems still hold up and are fun to play with.

This game shaped me into what I am today. My love of everything fantasy, RPGs, and of course, British humor, stems from this game. Fable TLC stands the test of time, and every time I play it it's like going back again.			"

												Played this game a lot on the old Xbox, and got this for nostalgia's sake just recently, and I'd have to say that it still holds up pretty well.  Sure, Fable has problems. It was not the game that was promised, and some of the respawns between maps are irritating in the extreme... but there's a lot of good old-school action-adventure stuff in here.Three hours into the Steam version, and I've had no crashes or save/load problems (there were a few with the Xbox version) and I've not noticed any annoying glitches yet. If you enjoyed the original on Xbox and are thinking about this one, I can recommend it.  If you're just looking for a casual RPG/Adventure/Combat game and don't mind the dated (but still quite nice) graphics, then I'd also recommend it.This is a love-it or hate-it game, with its roots firmly back in the days when they didn't make such games too easy. Think of it as a bit like Overlord (without the minions) and you might be on more-or-less the right track.			"

Connect with all the characters, esoecially the highly british NPC's who never cease to make me smile, even when their dialogue is the same. ever. single. time.I love this game, I have ever since I was a kid.

												The original Fable on the Xbox was an instant classic. When lost chapters hit the PC market with the ability to improve visuals and improve performance as well as give us all the new content it was pretty amazing.The PC version has perks, plain and simple. The modding community who adopted lost chapters pumped out some amazing modifications, overhauls and balancing changes. New trophies, weapons, rare drops like hero items, and I've even heard you could play as a Balverine if you wanted to.My point is, this is worth every penny they are asking. It may have been shallow in its alignment system, but the game itself is still a memorable blast.			"

												The best Fable game. The morality system is among the best in any RPG, and the not having a level system is very unique. You just spend EXP on stat increases and spells. Sadly, not as in-deph as the other Fable games, but the most refined and fun.			"

												If you are looking for a classic RPG, this is definately an excellent option. It runs on fairly old systems like my 8 year old craptop. It has insanely oversized weapons and insanely fast aging. In 24 hours, almost strait, I beat the original campaign. One thing I wish this game had more of was mods. There is almost no modding community for this game at all.			"

												Fable: The Lost Chapters is a very fun fantasy RPG. You can choose to be a good or evil person and you actually age as you continue to level up your character and your age kinda shows on characters in game npc's notice it also. It has a great story to it and both main and side quests are fairly rewarding. You can choose to marry and can  you marry multiple people but not within the same town. Your character also gains fame with the more quests you complete. Overall it is just a great game.			"

												I chose to buy this vsersion for 10 dollars instead of the hd remake based on reviews that it works fine. As well as the visuals arent that great in the upgrade for 3 times the price. I cant comment on the upgrade but my only issue with this game is that the dialog audio would cut in and out at times during cut scenes. Sub titles made it not a problem.I love fable and this didnt disapoint. Of course it would be better with a controller so it made me seriously think of the steam controller for old school games like this one. Which are completely what im looking for. If you love fable and want to play an amazing game and story over again or, you want to play through a great story with great gameplay for the first time; this game is definately worth the price.

												Pretty good game with a nice combat system.  The game is fun and lets you make choices.  Even though the choices are black and white, you still have an impact on the world with your choices which is great because alot of games made recently that you make choices in, don't even let you see the fruit of your choices and consequences.  The game is priced well and I would recommend it to anyone.  It is also a pretty good port and reminds you of the old days of gaming.			"

												I remember buying this for the first time on XBox just like it was yesterday, The fantasy and nostalgia factor is high. For 10$, Honestly you can't go wrong. You've got a great adventure with a nice storyline on the side, With favorable gameplay mechanics and a wide variety of spells. Downside is, The game unfortunately lacks a bit of difficulty, Takes about 16 hours to clear the main storyline. Since you can choose your destiny, Good, Neutral or evil, The game has a good replayability value. This, By far IMO, Is the best Fable title out there and one of my favorite single-player RPG experiences. This game might have been considered ""Over-rated"", But it doesn't mean it can't be gold.

												Fable been one of the games that I have played all throughout my childhood. It has been a stable game that I have come time and time again to relive the story and my childhood. The fighting, the magic, the wonder, it has always been a part of my imagination, and I sometimes wonder where my video game habits would like if I never played Fable 1 on the Xbox.Now, time has come to pass for this game to come onto the PC scene with more of a storyline at the ending with slightly improved graphics overall. This game did not disappoint. Having played this sparingingly, I still have as much fun as ever when I am playing this game. Have I reached the storyline at the end? No. Has this game been fun, even though I haven't reach that climax. Yes.			"

												Love the classic games! I know this is one of the best fables out and never gets too old to play. Own it on xbox and xbox 360 and own it now on pc. The ending no matter what always gets me and makes me upset when i see credits play and no gameplay left. I wish that the games would connect with each other in some way but i guess that would be difficult in a way, i guess. I would buy this fable though and not the remastered one though. They added a few things on it but still isnt worth that much for this old of a game. If it goes on sale and is close to this price of this game then go for it, because then it is worth it but other then that, if you dont play a lot of fable get the cheaper verson and play or try it out on the cheaper verse when this game drops down to 2$ and use it as a trail and then maybe spend more on it. Over all loved the game but Ive always been into Fable series except for the kinect one that came out but thats a different game that no one should accually try, like ever. Pretend that never got made accually because thats not fable. But the fable 2, and fable 3 are games that anyone should play. Fable is a long game if your first starting out and do all the side quests and explore around. If you just run through the main quest about 9 hrs ish of that alone. I would give this game a 8/10 because this verse of fable still is old school graphics which are still nice but might bother some.			"

												One of my most favourite games. I essentially grew up playing this game. I cannot count how many times I've played it through. What I loved most about the steam release is that I could use my save file from 6 years ago, back when I had the discs. Can't wait to get back into my favourite character and kick some bandit butt!Very nice combat, for an older game. Tonnes of content with some serious replay value. Sure, only took 16 hours to get a maxed character, but those are some of the most fun 16 hours of my gaming career. Decent story, characters are enjoyable. Some of the choices are very hard to make and always lead to me replaying that level again to see what could've been.FEAR ME! I AM CHICKEN CHASER!			"

												JUST TO CLARIFY: I have played the Fable series for a long time on the Xbox, ever since it first came out. So my hours don't really reflect how much I have played Fable, let alone the other Fable games (2 and 3).This game has a lot of features and memorable moments (Wont tell you them, no spoilers here). First off, as an RPG, this game balances all the different attributes of a character and how to get them very well. It has a lot of items, a lot of quests, and the main story is over 15 hours, which is a lot more than most games now. The story is also designed very well, and has many memorable moments, as well as a lot of variety in the envirenments. Over all, in a review, I would have to give this game a 9.2/10, but now that it is a very low price, I would give it a 9.7/10 as one of the best singleplayer games on steam.Summary: If you can bear with the older graphics, this game has very good gameplay, story, and has enough side quests to keep you going for hours.

												You should take my review with a big grain of salt because I was only able to play it for such a short while. But the reason for clocking out so soon was that the spinning camera angles gave me a really nasty motion sickness / migraine combo, and that means I can never go back to this game. No game has managed this spectacular feat since the 90's, so it's a huge minus in my book. Probably not a good game choice for anyone who's experienced similar problems with FPS / third person visuals. It's possible I would have endured longer in a console version, but I doubt it.In terms of gameplay, I was also immediately disappointed with... well, pretty much everything. The main character annoyed me from the start and I felt utterly disinclined to watch him grow into an even bigger bundle of annoyingness. Most importantly the hyped moral system was so blatantly black-and-white that it's just a bad joke. Seems to me there's not that much you can do to branch out from that, and I suspect the character changes would be mostly cosmetic.			"

												Awesome game! One of the best RPG's I've played! Character growth is the most amazing part, can't compare it to any game of this age. The actual story is also really deep and governed by the characters personal choises. Even the choices the character takes define how others see him, physicaly and individualy. The only negatives could be that there are set paths to follow with a sizeable movement area, and that there is no character creation at the beginning. The character is a boy that grows into a man over the course of the game. The player can dress in whatever they so choose as to also have as many tatoo's or whatever hair style they want. This game has taken a special spot in my heart for most memorable RPG's!			"

												I've played this game before on the Xbox when it first came out.  For its time, the graphics were great, the puzzles were fun but difficult to some degree, and the multi-pathed options in the game were great.  Save the town and buy and trade like a good citizen, or kill everyone, buy every building, and collect rent to make money.My ONLY beef with it being on Steam for the PC, is that I have an Xbox controller specifically for games like this.  It's rather  difficult to play this game via mouse and keyboard.It would have been better if there was a control pad option for the game.			"

												8.1/10Fable The Lost Chapters is an amazing game, with over 60 hours in as of this review I can say that I recommend this game highly.Gameplay: Fable TLC is a third person view, action packed role-playing game. The combat in TLC feels quite refined for its time. Sadly though this game does not support controllers. -8.3/10-Graphics: The graphics in TLC are not bad, definitely not as good as the re release Fable Anniversary. 7.5/10Story: TLC's story is in my opinion very good, I don't want to spoil anything but all I can say is that you have my word that the story is great. 8.5/10Side notes: Something unique to the Fable franchise is the ability to either good or evil depending on your actions. The more good deeds you do you get a halo, you also start to gain reputation and people like you and will complement you, though if you're evil you start to grow horns and become basically a demon			"

												An excellent game, that's not too long, but long enough to be worthwhile. Fable stands out for its colourful, nearly cartoony look - for once a game with more colours than grey. The colour and the focus on being a hero means that this a game where you truly get to feel in control - you have power and you can do what you like with it. Graphics are starting to look a little dated, but they're still decent. The voice acting is great There are a few mods available, although they’re not the easiest to get up and running.			"

Now on pc it's the same story, great  environment, and a smooth 100hz locked in 2k makes this game suprisingly smooth and full of color, they allow for 8x anti aliasing, and since this game isn't very graphically demanding, everything just goes together really well. I like to play through this game for time to time, wonderful purchase. Get this version, not the remake.			"

												Lionhead Studios tried, and subsequently failed to a higher degree with each attempt, to recapture the charm and playability of Fable: The Lost Chapters. The first, and the best of the Fable series, this is a game that still holds up today and is every bit as magical as playing it all those years ago. Grab this version instead of the cashgrab remaster - benefits of doing this include receiving all the content you pay for as opposed to in game content being locked away as DLC. The gameplay, music, and story are all great, but the atmosphere is like no other. I highly recommend this game.			"

												Ah, Fable. One of the greats. Recently, I just completed a play through of Fable - The Lost Chapters (completed the original game twice back in October of 2004, being good and evil) and it brought back many good memories. This time around, I decided to go with being good again. Next time I will definitely do a play through as being evil. This is a very nostalgic game for me and that is another great reason as to why I love it so much. It reminds me of when I used to play the original Fable on original XBOX. Those were the good ol' days.10/10 Definitely recommend getting Fable - The Lost Chapters!			"

												On a personal note, Fable: The Lost Chapters was my first console game. I remember when I was eight years old, waking up on Christmas morning to the sound of the opening theme music playing from my TV. It remains my favorite RPG of all time, standing strong even over it's own sequels. On a much less personal level, the game is still outstanding, providing challenging gameplay, interesting and on occasion hilarious characters, and a beautifully told story. I tend to reccomend this game to pretty much anyone that enjoys the RPG genre.			"

												Ok, so I'm 14, when I was 10, my sister's boyfriend didn't want his Xbox Classic any more, so he gave it to me. On it were a bunch of classics, but my favourite game on it was always Fable. I played this for hours on end until one of my cats chewed a cord, so I couldn't play it. Last year, however, I noticed that it was on sale for $1. There was no way in hell I was missing out, so I bought it, and played it through, then, for the first time, played the DLC, and all my memories of joy came back to me.P.S. I did something really dispicable at the end of the game to get a sword (Those who've finished this will know what it was), then, a few minutes later, in The Lost Chapters DLC, got an even more powerful sword.

												The “Test of Time” Award? Fable - The Lost Chapters earned it totally. I need to play this game from start to the end like at least once a year. It's just astonishing. Try for yourself. You can play Anniversary edition as well; hard to tell which one is better - I'm in love with the original one, but Anniversary is much prettier.PS.

												Great game, I have played both Anniversary and TLC.Fable I has a great storyline and is totally worth the money. It has a few bugs tho.TLC is great for the oldschool feels if you have played it before, if you haven't played it ever dont worry graphics and sound are pretty good for the release date.Now what should you pick, TLC or Anniversary?- Anniversary has controller support, mods (not alot) and updated graphics. So if you love your controller and/or have never played TLC and have the money I would recommend you Anniversary - which can be found here: - For the oldschool players around: I recommend buying TLC, you are gonne have them oldschool feels... Anniversary has some differences from TLC you might find annoying, like different faces on your favourite characters, mobs spawning in later than usual, etc.Anyway, good luck and have fun in Albion "

												Fable is a game I've played several times, and at first I thought it was fantastic. I loved the story, the world, and it was really one of the first RPG's I really got into. I owned it on Xbox, and after losing it I thought I'd buy it again on steam. And after playing and beating Fable for the hundredth time, I've only just now began to realize this game is far from perfect.Don't get me wrong, Fable is still a good game, and decent RPG overall. The graphics hold up pretty well today, which is impressive for a game that's going on 12 years old. But that's really where Fable ends, ""Good"" and ""Decent"" The story has really weird pacing, the game's length is far from impressive, and the games lack of side quests really detract from replay value. Another thing I've come to dislike about fable is how simple it is. The game has very few deep and interesting mechanics, and some of the ones that are there are broken (ex. the morality and ageing systems)It may seem like I'm harping on it, but I would still recommend Fable to both casual gamers, and fans of action RPGs. While it may seem lack luster, Fable is still a solid experience with great combat, good characters, an interesting world to explore, and plenty of chickens to kick. It was a fantastic third person action RPG experience back in 2004, and while it has aged over the years, I think Falble is a purchase that you won't regret.			"

												If you enjoyed the original you'll enjoy this. Fable the lost chapters is a re-release of Fable for the oringinal xbox back in 2004. This version of the game not only brings you back to the original Albion but adds extra contant as well, The new content is as follows New Weapons, New outfits, New Jack of blades voice actor, and a continued story where the Hero takes on Jack in his dragon form. In the Oringinal, players where able to repeat the final mission again and again for there heart's content. In the lost chapters version players where stripped of that option to bring the extra story content. Even though the battle machanics are not like such others as Devil May Cry or God of War, it makes up for it being a story driven game focusing more on what the players do to change there apperance to shape the world around theme, Fable anniversy adds Xbox 360 graphics to this version but with the game crashing at a moments notice it won't be recemended here. Whiether or not you look at its up or downs, I give Fable The Lost Chapters an 8/10 slighty missing my seal of apporval. a must play game,			"

Anytime I start to think the game is actually getting good, it'll minimize for no reason, or introduce a quest that's frustrating without being engaging and it's just a massive disapointment. Fighting is unnecisarily hard to get a grasp on and isn't worth the time. Maybe the other Fable games are better?

												I remember playing Fable the lost chapters after having read in a magazine about all the cool stuff you could do. Unfortunately for me, I believed it was only for Xbox, which I didn't have at the time. I then turned my head in a Best Buy and my eyes widened. It was for Windows! I asked for it, as I was so excited. This was one of the few times my mom allowed me what I begged for. I asked if I could go to the car early just so I could look at the manual (I was that excited). As soon as I got home, I played Fable. Unfortunately, our computer's GPU could only muster the game on the lowest settings. The ground and sky was whitish (though contours of the ground were still visible). The effects were gone, and it was quite lifeless thinking back. However, what mattered at the time was the little adventure in there that I played for countless hours alongside the original Halo CE. This is a very good Action RPG. The ""good and evil"" aspect of it is pretty loosely tied with what actually happens or matters in the game. Whether you're good or evil matters very little beyond appearance. Personally, I consider it a classic game of it's time that's overshadowed by the pure mediocrity of it's sequels(however, fable II wasn't that awful I guess). The interface is a little limited, and suffers a bit due to it's age, however, when you're playing, who cares?It's still satisfying to shoot your overpowered (but well earned) magic, as well as swing around a weapon you just foundthat doesn't do as much damage, but just looks that cool. It's a game that accomplished what an action RPG involving a silent protagonist ( I think it would have been interesting to put in sex/race options, as building a character you identify with would be assisted by such options for some players). The writing's pretty crappy, and the world is somewhat unbelievable, but it is in that we can enjoy the camp of it. We can focus on the hilarity of quicksaving and slashing someone down in a quick strike and taking out the pretty pathetic guards that try to stop you raiding pie stores and weapon shops. There's something inherently enjoyable about that. It set the standard for me when it came to building a character in an ARPG (something that has yet to be truly exceeded, as most ones we play today are either first person, or have a preset character. You don't take the actualy character motivations seriously because the world is just too much like a storybook to care about anything more complex than a simple fight between good and evil (and there is no in between, and they treat it more like they support different football teams than a true moral dilemma). I think it's great for a first play through for both good and evil though, however I already played this years ago. Thinking about it, I wish I'd saved my money, as I don't see myself ever playing this one again. However,I don't know how well this has truly aged, or whether more seasoned RPG players will dig it. If you've never played, I'd pick this up on a sale, and give a simple, fun, immersive, and memorable playthrough. Otherwise, really think about whether you're going to play through this game again.

												Quick Review:This is the basic game I remember playing on the original XBox. Both fun and frustrating at times.Pros- Installs and launches flawlessly under Windows 7 Professional (my first concern, didn't see it addressed anywhere else)- Supports high resolution, AA, and high textures/details (just be sure to disable VSync)- No hesitations, hiccups, etc (unlike Fable Anniversary)- Has the original, cartoonish graphics that just go better with the atmosphere of the gameCons- Only (natively) supports the use of keyboard and mouse  ** You CAN get around this by using 3rd party keyboard to controller mapping (xpadder, CTK, JoyToKey, etc)- Saving is a bit screwy (I may be mis-remembering this though), see bottom of review for details- Does not have Steam Accomplishments/BadgesBottom line, pay the $10 for this version and you don't have the ""better"" graphics that actually make the game look worse. You won't have the slow-downs, stuttering, etc, You'll need to look into a keyboard to joystick program if you are dead set on using a gamepad, but the game is easily played with keyboard and mouse.A Note On Saving: This game has set savepoints that you must reach or your progress is lost. Examples:- Starting the Game: Finish a few quests to get Gold to purchase a gift... but if you complete only two of these quests and quit, you have to start over. You have to complete the town to get an ""Autosave""- Guild Training: Go through the basics and a few tests, but don't complete the final step of getting your badge? Too bad, even if you saved mid-level, you now have to start the training over from the very beginning.Basically, you need to fully complete quests to the point that you see the words ""AUTOSAVING"" (or something like that) appear on screen.BUY THIS VERSION AND NOT THE ANNIVERSARY EDITION!!! This one will never be on sale, but at $10... it's a steal!			"

												TL;DR: Great game. However, if Steam is on sale, consider buying the Fable Anniversary edition instead if you've never played the original. Better graphics.By the time this review is written, Fable Anniversary costs about $3, while Fable TLC costs about $9.------------Fable offers much in its story and world-building. It tells you of a boy in a quest of a revenge and discovery of his family background. Fable is built upon the wondrous land of Albion, clearly inspired from medieval England with fantasy twist. With its quirky humor and distinctively English feel (from its music and architecture), Fable offers an interesting gameplay for those interested in story-driven RPGs where you can influence the world.This is the game that introduced me to the wonder of freedom of choice in RPG. Coming from playing JRPGs, I'm used to playing RPG like reading a book: following one story after another with side-stories in-between, doing errands, taking cities and NPCs in the game as it is.When I played Fable, everything changed.I can flirt with and marry townsfolks. I can steal items from shops. I can kill ordinary NPCs. I can make my fame (or infamy) not just through errands, but through little actions I did in the game. And what I did reflects on my alignment: the bad thing I do reflects on my dark side; the good thing reflects on light side. The world responds to my action. This seems to be common today, but back then in 2003 such feature is a rarity. Great game. However, if Steam is on sale, consider buying the Fable Anniversary edition instead if you've never played the original. Better graphics.			"

												This game is a gem that you cannot pass up!Me and Fable have history, it was the first game that i actually worked for and bought on my own as a kid and replaying it on steam was amazingly refreshing.The graphics arent up to par with the games coming out now of coarse but for how beautiful this game STILL is is an amazement, it is 10 years up and still blows some games out of the water, it has a great story, amazing mechanics, currency sytem, rpg style leveling. and one of my favorites, the demon doors, which challenge your whit and strength to get access to valuable rewards, everything you do effects the gameplay, will people fear you? or love you?I would never pass this game up, if you havent heard of it, drop it in your wishlist and wait for it to go on sale, or just shell out the 10 dollars and be AMAZED with what this game has to offer!!!

												This is one of my favourite games of all time. Fable: The Lost Chapters, Fable II, Azurik: Rise of Perathia. Top three. I only wish Fable II had a PC version on Steam... Anyway. I don't know what my play time is on Steam, but, long story short, I played this to death on the original XBOX and the XBOX 360. I refuse to even begin talking about the features, because it's simple. If you like RPGs and dark humour, get this game. Now. Right now, if you have the money. If you don't, then wait until you do. And buy this. Forget your wishlist, get this game. If you don't like it, get yourself checked at the therapist. If you do like it, good, you're sane.			"

												The best Fable game in the franchise and probably one of the best RPGs I played in early childhood. As an adult I've been able to explore the other sides of the game I ignored and I am still impressed by how they handled the morality system along with player choice. I especially liked the ability to be a homosexual (despite marking the husband as my wife) considering the lack of options in games back then. Overall, this game offers a lot of side quests, weapons (no crafting), spells, and worthwhile plot that still has me in awe considering how much better Jack a villain was compared to the others in the franchise.

												Easily one of the most fun RPGs I've ever played, though not one of the most well-rounded. The gameplay is as fun now as it was when I played the original as a kid and getting a chance to run through it again was very welcomed. Coincidentally I've found since playing Dark Souls I rely a lot more on rolling. The sheer quantity of i-frames is a welcome pace step back from Dark Souls, which I consistently find myself comparing Fable and TLC to. I really think games with the depth and seriousness of Dark Souls could have come to be without the lighthearted path being laid out by the designers behind Fable. I still maintain that Fable: The Lost Chapters is the best game in the series, coming strictly from an enjoyability standpoint. What would be the point of gaming beyond that?			"

You have the option of being good or evil, and some choices can affect how the ending will be. nice movements, good graphics , good character development, and a decent degree of customization, with hair styles and tatoos, which also affect your alignment. A nice touch is how you notice the subtle changes as your character ages. Try it. You won't regret it.			"

												Okay okay, most people would think I'm Biased since I have one of the devs of Fable as my Film teacher. but I kid you not, I first played fable when i was 6 years old, probably younger and It is hands down the best and most original RPG Ive played In my life, and thats alot. Fable set the standards for RPGs of its time and only a few modern day games can compare to its Originality. play an Angelic Hero and do no evil, or Sneak around as a neautral Theif to make a living. Kill everyone in a village and Buy their Homes, then Raise the rent through the roof so the new tennants pay you your riches day by day. Its a great game and the PC experience is as good as the console, 38/1			"

												Oh boy. This game... I LOVE it so much! It has been a personal favorite of mine ever since I played it when I was younger, on the Original Xbox. Loved the game so much back then, AND now .  I LOVE the freedom of choice in the game, to make a character that YOU CAN shape in your own image. (except for gender. bummed me out there) You could be a evil spellcaster. or a heroic Swordsman, Or you could be a neutral adventure in general! The story / plot in this game was slightly overated IN MY OPINON , of course, but it was far more enjoyable then most games.  I absolutly love this game, and would recommend it toanyone. My Score? 9 / 10.			"

												This is one of those games that everybody needs to play at some point. However, I have yet to try the remastered version so I can't say whether or not this title is justified when you compare the two.I can absolutely guarentee its worth your time if you snag it for less than five bucks. Fable is a classic for a reason. You're always evolving...changing...exploring. It was my first taste at an ""open world"" back in the day and it will always hold a special place in my heart. It doesnt take itself to seriously and the progression system is fantastic. Nothing seems particularly broken and the humor is spot on. Those darn brits and their wits always get my jollies off.Also, hit the guildmaster just so he says ""I could break you"" lol			"

												Quick Review:This is the basic game I remember playing on the original XBox. Both fun and frustrating at times.Pros- Installs and launches flawlessly under Windows 7 Professional (my first concern, didn't see it addressed anywhere else)- Supports high resolution, AA, and high textures/details (just be sure to disable VSync)- No hesitations, hiccups, etc (unlike Fable Anniversary)- Has the original, cartoonish graphics that just go better with the atmosphere of the gameCons- Only (natively) supports the use of keyboard and mouse  ** You CAN get around this by using 3rd party keyboard to controller mapping (xpadder, CTK, JoyToKey, etc)- Saving is a bit screwy (I may be mis-remembering this though), see bottom of review for details- Does not have Steam Accomplishments/BadgesBottom line, pay the $10 for this version and you don't have the ""better"" graphics that actually make the game look worse. You won't have the slow-downs, stuttering, etc, You'll need to look into a keyboard to joystick program if you are dead set on using a gamepad, but the game is easily played with keyboard and mouse.A Note On Saving: This game has set savepoints that you must reach or your progress is lost. Examples:- Starting the Game: Finish a few quests to get Gold to purchase a gift... but if you complete only two of these quests and quit, you have to start over. You have to complete the town to get an ""Autosave""- Guild Training: Go through the basics and a few tests, but don't complete the final step of getting your badge? Too bad, even if you saved mid-level, you now have to start the training over from the very beginning.Basically, you need to fully complete quests to the point that you see the words ""AUTOSAVING"" (or something like that) appear on screen.BUY THIS VERSION AND NOT THE ANNIVERSARY EDITION!!! This one will never be on sale, but at $10... it's a steal!			"

The atmosphere is amazing, the music fits perfectly to situations, the fighting system is funny when you got used to it. It allows various playstyles for melee, ranged and magic. The ""leveling system"" feels well placed and not too much of a grind. The story is easy to follow and has a clear line but is somewhat short even with the add-on.If you're searching for a good old RPG who survived the test of time this is the one you'll want.			"

It has a few bugs tho.TLC is great for the oldschool feels if you have played it before, if you haven't played it ever dont worry graphics and sound are pretty good for the release date.Now what should you pick, TLC or Anniversary?- Anniversary has controller support, mods (not alot) and updated graphics. So if you love your controller and/or have never played TLC and have the money I would recommend you Anniversary - which can be found here: - For the oldschool players around: I recommend buying TLC, you are gonne have them oldschool feels... Anniversary has some differences from TLC you might find annoying, like different faces on your favourite characters, mobs spawning in later than usual, etc.Anyway, good luck and have fun in Albion "

												Fable: The Lost Chapters is a very fun fantasy RPG. You can choose to be a good or evil person and you actually age as you continue to level up your character and your age kinda shows on characters in game npc's notice it also. It has a great story to it and both main and side quests are fairly rewarding. You can choose to marry and can  you marry multiple people but not within the same town. Your character also gains fame with the more quests you complete. Overall it is just a great game.			"

												I nominated this game for the ""Best Use Of Farm Animal"" category in the Steam Awards. For my personal choice, it was between this or the Stronghold series, due to its ability to let you fling cows via catapults - however, I find that kicking chickens is a much less strenuous activity that garners a level of enjoyment near the same level, even if the townspeople call me strange names afterward.

												This is without a doubt, my favorite game of all time. Its a game that's alway shad it all for me. A nice story along with pretty good combat, as well as variance in the combat systesm. I've always loved this game, and was seriously disappointed in the sequels that I feel never measured up to the original. If you've never played this game, I highly recommend you do because even to this day it's a great game.			"

												Fable-Lost chapters is one of the best games, possibly my favorite game i've ever played. there is such a great story, and i played countless playthroughs on the xbox. Now on pc it's the same story, great  environment, and a smooth 100hz locked in 2k makes this game suprisingly smooth and full of color, they allow for 8x anti aliasing, and since this game isn't very graphically demanding, everything just goes together really well. I like to play through this game for time to time, wonderful purchase. Get this version, not the remake.			"

												I've played this game so many times, on a few different platforms, from a few different iterations.  Although this isn't my favorite version of the game, it is still Fable, and as such deserves the time and patience I originally devoted to it.  I highly recommend it to any new RPG gamer.  Who knows, it may become your favorite too.			"

												Lionhead Studios tried, and subsequently failed to a higher degree with each attempt, to recapture the charm and playability of Fable: The Lost Chapters. The first, and the best of the Fable series, this is a game that still holds up today and is every bit as magical as playing it all those years ago. Grab this version instead of the cashgrab remaster - benefits of doing this include receiving all the content you pay for as opposed to in game content being locked away as DLC. The gameplay, music, and story are all great, but the atmosphere is like no other. I highly recommend this game.			"

												The “Test of Time” Award? Fable - The Lost Chapters earned it totally. I need to play this game from start to the end like at least once a year. It's just astonishing. Try for yourself. You can play Anniversary edition as well; hard to tell which one is better - I'm in love with the original one, but Anniversary is much prettier.PS. Don't look at my record - I've played A LOT outside Steam.			"

												This was the very first action-RPG I ever played back in the original Xbox. It was the first introduction I had not only to the genre, but the medieval fantasy genre as a whole. This game shaped me into what I am today. My love of everything fantasy, RPGs, and of course, British humor, stems from this game. Fable TLC stands the test of time, and every time I play it it's like going back again.			"
