Disclaimer: Steam only shows the play time for the first episode.Short version: 87%The second season of Sam & Max is one of TellTale’s best point ‘n’ click adventure; a series that managed to elevate beyond the confines of its budget and the somewhat self-repeating TellTale formula to become one of the most definite nonsensical adventures to date.Long version:TellTale’s Sam & Max trilogy has a plethora of ideas crammed into it, but in the end, it still follows the classic trilogy formula: the second season mostly reuses the recipe of the first, only adds a little more of everything.In this case, everything means more wacky adventures and even crazier setups; from Santa Claus to the Bermuda triangle or outer space, the Freelance Police wreaks havoc wherever it goes in the typical Sam & Max fashion.These adventures are confined to the old engine, meaning only a handful of locations per episode and game mechanics restricted to a Use and Look button. The simplicity is compensated by typical Sam & Max puzzles, where things make little sense, but you can find the twisted, zany logic behind the tasks.Said tasks are somewhat held back by the typical TellTale game design, meaning each episode has the exact same structure: short introductory puzzle leading to the central plot, which then gets divided into a set of sub-tasks that you need to finish to start the final sequence. (The game also relies way too much on the triaé-and-error combination hunting puzzle type.)Because the developers knew they were repeating themselves, they did everything to hide it behind great writing that strikes a perfect balance between self-contained stories and arcing plot, creating one of TellTale’s best point ‘n’ clicks and a must-have game for Sam & Max fans.

												Sam & Max Season Two is made of five episodes and continues insane adventure of Sam and Max in this point'n'click ""old-school"" adventure game. ""Old-school"" stands for ""has nonsense puzzles"".It didn't make any big change to the series formula, still having same system. You will notice it in the graphics the most, as they are on same technical level, which would start to feel outdated in 2008. Then again, Season One was kinda outdated too. But hey, it still looks nice artistically.Positive thing that was added was hints system. You can choose how frequent you want to have main character throw hints at you, from none to often. They come from subtle to insultingly direct. Max may say to go somewhere else, he may hint you ""remember how we did it the last time"" or Sam may exclaim ""Ah, I get it, it's <something that directly solves the puzzle>"".It's still helpful to have them as rare.And well, the first half of season isn't exactly amazing. It's original, yet something you kinda expect from comedical adventure games, while it also has adventure games sin: mini-games! Thanfully, they are easy and nice. Most hate cheap'n'hard minigames in such games after all.Then as the second half of season comes, it completely throws mini-games away and focuses on much more exciting setting. No spoilers, but you will get some fun things to do. Wink wink, time.And episodes felt a bit longer than expected too.So, if you nejoyed Season One, it will be worth it. And worth it for others too. Almost. Puzzles are still stupid at times. Not as stupid as some ""classics"" though, it's still weird at times. And not always hinted. Well, aside from straight hints from main characters.			"

												Sam & Max: Beyond Time and Space (AKA Season 2) is a point and click adventure game made by TellTale Games where you play as the Freelance Police, Solving Crimes and Kicking Butt. At first, you have to go on a case about Santa Claus, but it gets far, far, Deeper. I will say that if you are going to get this instead of Save the World (AKA Season 1), Play Ice Station Santa through What's New, Beelzebub. Trust me, there is a Bonus at the final episode of the season that you get if you go through the order it was made for.While you are playing through the game, You can get rad Decals from the C.O.P.S and even upgrades to your DeSoto if you grab all the decals each episode.Sam and Max: Beyond Time and Space is an experence that is worth the ride. if you have 30 bucks and been wanting to buy a good Point and Click adventure, then by all means, get this.

												(Review counted as the Complete Sam and Max Series 1,2 and 3)Really entertaining and funny point and click adventure game. Though I admit I am a bit dumb when it came to puzzles in this game...often ended up looking up guides >w>  SHHHHH! In all honesty the puzzles (basicly everything you do in the game) are all well thought out so there isn't any super unrealistic answer to a problem that hasn't been hinted slightly in the game....Like pixel searching or using items together in a way that makes no sense to solve a problem.Get it if you love point and click adventure games because this is as good as it gets!! ^.^ As long as you dont mind 15 games appearing in your games library after only buying 3.....

												Season 2 of Sam and Max was even better overall than the first one.  The episodes are longer, the puzzles are  more challenging, and the stories are exponentially more ludicrous.  Although none of the episodes in this season top Episode 5: Reality 2.0 from the first season, as a whole season 2 is much improved over season 1.  Episode 4: Chariots of the Dogs is easily the best episode with extremely clever and satisfying puzzles. Both seasons 1 and 2 are well worth the playthough and should not be missed.			"

												I've played through all three seasons of these Telltale Sam & Max games now  and I really enjoyed them all. They all sort of blend into one another in my mind, but I think season 2 was the most humorous and it certainly upped the craziness in terms of plot and the locations and situations that Sam & Max find themselves in. This season also introduced many new characters and started to phase out Bosco, who was really becoming tedious and tiresome for me over the course of the first season.Backing up a bit: these episodic games from Telltale are point-and-click adventure games with quirky characters and surreal humor. If you know anything about the Sam & Max characters, then you should already own all three seasons as you will most likely enjoy them.My one complaint about the games overall is that there is a little too much going back and forth between the several locations that comprise each episode, trying to solve the main puzzle (or puzzles) in each location, in order to get something you'll need to go solve another location's puzzles. When you get stuck, you do a lot of visiting each of the locations, looking for the one thing you missed that will let you proceed.			"

												The Next 5 Monthly Episodes of the Entire Sam & Max Trilogy. Sam & Max Beyond Time & Space (Season 2) delivers the best in Point & Click Adventure Games. The connection between the episodes is more loose and complicated than in the first season. Season 2 builds on Season 1 with more dynamic NPCs, an updated engine, a hint system, support for widescreen monitors, more realistic animations & more minigames within each episode. Season 2 features a calibration assistant when first run, which allows the player to set their graphics and difficulty settings before playing. Help Sam & Max on their exciting Adventures as they go Beyond Time & Space!In Episode 1, An ancient and bloated pagan god AKA Santa Claus sends a bloodthirsty war robot, The Maimtron 9000, to destroy Sam & Max.In Episode 2, Sam & Max travel to the tropics where they try to stop a volcanic eruption.In Episode 3, Sam & Max crash an emo European vampire's nightclub to stop a zombie apocalypse. In Episode 4, Sam & Max work with Flint Paper to discover what happened to a missing Bosco.And In Episode 5; The Season 2 Finale, Sam & Max travel to hell to confont Satan and retrieve Bosco's lost soul.You can get Sam & Max Season 2: Beyond Time & Space for the Xbox 360's XBox Live Arcade/PC/Mac OS X/iPhone/iPad/Wii & on the PS3's PlayStation Store.

												What's with the sudden proliferation of mini-games in this series? The first episode sends you off on a hunt for 4 special items, at least half of which are won via stupid mini-games. This does not bode well for the rest of the season. It's as if the game is tired of coming up with puzzles for me and is now resorting to handing over the solution so long as I can do a simple pushup every now and then. If only the laziness ended there! Well at least the main characters are still funny.			"

And if you thought they couldn't go further than season 1... you will be surprised.Note: You really need to play these games in order. The story builds, characters are introduced, and if you haven't played previous games, you won't understand the backstory.Hilariously imaginative, well-written, and adorable.

												So I just got finished playing this Season and I've have to say, I regret NOT having a PC back in 2008 because to have each episode delivered monthly would have kept me guessing for new episode. Season 2 is a much better improvement over Season 1, bringing more witty and classic humour back to the table and giving me several well spent hours of enjoyment. Sam and Max really bring out the best of themselves and show how close their friendship really is while the games deliver an amazing story line that all ties in from Episode 1 to Episode 5 outrageously and seamlessly. Good job to the Sam and Max dev team! I would totally reccomend this to anyone who is interested in buying! Make sure to buy Season 1 though so you don't have spotted info on everything that's going.			"

												Not too much changes gameplay wise from season 1. It’s continuing to be a linear storyline driven point-and-click adventure where you have to solve puzzles, and fit pieces together by revisiting locations.Story-wise, this game went even more out there than the previous season (which I adored), this season went more in-depth with older characters, introduced a whole lot of new ones. And in whole, tied up A LOT of loose ends from the first season. Telltale knew their ♥♥♥♥ back then too.From the technical side, a lot of improvements was made here. Mostly in the engine, which now allowed me to play at my native resolution (1080p), and added functionality to use the arrow keys while in the driving sequences and stuff. Other than the game looked much better and was slightly better to navigate, not much was done to the feel of the game. It was played exactly like the previous season, which wasn’t a problem. (According to the steam discussions, this doesn’t work with Win10 either. You have been warned.)I’m really liking the Sam & Max Series so far, it’s exactly my kind of humor. Recommended.			"

												Quality. Great Point-and-Click Adventure game, it's a shame this genre is dying, especially with gem games like Sam and Max. I guess this genre just can't compete with the whizz bang flash generic action/fps crap the industry puts out every year with the same cover across 40+ games. Anyway the writing and comedy in this game is superb and though some innuendo is present it always remains tasteful. The ridiculous storyline that doesnt have a hope in hell of making sense comes full circle and suprises you. Playing Season One first is a must. Sam and Max's often sarcastic banter is always fresh; add in some quirky characters and the breaking of the 4th wall every now and then and you have one hilarious adventure. The only bad thing i can pick out about the episodes is some of the incredibly tiny details they expect you to find/piece together to progress, while otherwise many puzzles can be solved relatively easily (But what Point-and-Click game isn't like that?). Buy it.			"
