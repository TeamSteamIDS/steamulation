												It pains me to not be able to recommend this collection because the games themselves are fantastic. However, they simply do not work ""out of the box."" The launcher presents the player with a menu that allows him to select which game to play. Zero out of six of them will work. Zero. Having said that, I was able to figure out what was wrong and get the games to work on my own, bypassing the launcher, within five minutes. That is only because I have extensive experience with DOS. Most people have little to no experience with that antiquated beast and simply will not be able to figure out how to get the games working on their own, nor should they have to. It is simply unacceptable for games that do not work to be sold as if they do work. It is quite literally five minutes worth of work for Activision or Valve to get these games working. It is not the responsibility of the buyer to fix the lazily misconfigured junk that is being sold here. If people pay money for a working game, that's exactly what they should receive.			"

												I loved playing these games growing up! Try not to get frustrated when you (inevitably) die several times before you can move past an area; quite often the death scenes are just as entertaining as the puzzle itself!You must resist the temptation to read any sort of walkthrough or watch any Let’s Play videos… at least until after you’ve beat the game. All of the fun of these games comes from the challenge of figuring out the puzzles. If you start reading hints online, you will inevitably spoil something for yourself, and once you know the solution there’s no going back.So do yourself a favor: Make sure you save your game often, die in as many ways as possible, and enjoy the victory knowing that you conquered the challenge with only your own intellect!

												Space Quest is an excellent adventure game series that is a recognized classic. While it's not consistent throughout the series (mostly SQ VI, which isn't bad, but isn't great, either), the highpoints are tremendous. My favorite is easily SQ IV, but SQ I-III are also fantastic with the same sort of humor (I haven't played SQ V enough to rule on it).It's important to mention that this collection is missing the original version of Space Quest I, which is an EGA version with a parser instead of point & click. I personally missed it since I have nostalgic memories of playing it. It's also important to note that this collection has compatibility issues. EDIT: I believe this has since been fixed. The non-Legacy edition worked on Windows 10 for me. I still prefer downloading ScummVM (a client program which allows you to run old Sierra & Lucas Arts games) and manually adding the games that way. ScummVM has plenty of options if you're a stickler for various graphics & sound options (it can emulate the Roland MT-32, a legendary sound device back in the day, however, you will need the ROM for it). You can also get the GOG version which has the original version of SQ I instead of the point & click remake.			"

												Great. Whoever put this together can't even make DOSBox work right through a simple launcher, making the game require manually going in and configuring things correctly to get it running. Goodbye convinience factor.Also, what the hell with not including the original non-VGA SQ1?			"

												Space Quest was the very first PC game I ever played. I was addicted the moment I got it for Christmas way back in the 80s.  Since then I was a huge adventure game fanatic and the Space Quest series were awesome. They had humor, fun puzzles, and good eye candy for the time.  I have a lot of great memories spending all day at the computer playing the Space Quest series.			"

												Space Quest Collection on Steam is a digital rerelease of collection from 2006. It had 6 main Space Quest games in it, brutal comedy Sierra adventure games that have excellent humor but you probably should use walkthrough and many saves. Spans from 1986 to 1995, so you will see a bit of evolution here. But it's not complete compilation.It doesn't have the original EGA version of the first Space Quest, only VGA remake version. And Space Quest 4 that is included here is a CD version. It also comes with shortened manual of SQ1 to SQ6 which is important as some of them have copy protection that requires reading manual. If forget that it doesn't include the second manual ""Popular Janitronics"" for SQ6 that contained important instructions for in-game puzzle. Just Google it out.It was 2006 collection, so it doesn't come with any Space Quest extras, like game that includes every mini-game from the series. No development video. No other fun videos. No cheaply done CGI teaser of Space Quest 7, you will have to YouTube it all out. Oh, and search for Space Quest 3 Promo while at it, it's a good fun.Instead this collection's main catch was that it was supposed to work perfectly on Windows XP. By licensing DosBox. Which is outdated by now and not configured properly.Maybe I could write a lot on technical info of how bad this is, but you know what. Just check Steam Guides and find the one that links you to fan update for this DosBoxed collection. Even though you will not be able to launch games straight from your Steam, your life will be easier.As for games themselves, those are mostly credited as being job of Two Guys from Andromeda from Sierra, will have you follow Roget Wilco, a janitor and idiot who is clearly not a responsible adult. And he has dumb luck. And series had one great humor to it, coming from announcer and death messages. Yep, lots of death scenes in this one. Not to mention that games were generally good for Sierra games, with nice world and nice puzzles here and there. But it's Sierra games which means that it aged. I mean, it's fun to have death scenes, but having dead ends because you forgot item around hour ago is a big no-no for me. So eh. I just used walkthrough in this one.Still more fun and safer than King Quest though. Hm, collection of that one went off Steam recently though. Anyway, off to drop quick comments on each game.Space Quest 1 VGA:A pretty short adventure on very few locations with no ability to backtrack. In this one you will have to rescue Star Generator from hands of aliens race. Well, this one is VGA remake from Space Quest 4 era. Sierra tried to remake a few of first games of their Quest series. Yes, it has dead ends. At least it helps that you have icon interface instead of text parser. Remake even has cheat-device to make annoying gambling part impossible to lose. Yes, original included machine on which you had to gamble and try to get a certain amount of money.And hey, humor is there. And death messages humor. And somewhat gory deaths occasionally.Don't forget about copy protection in manual. And don't forget to pull catridge back after you use it in the middle of a game.Also, it has strange bug with speed setting. It doesn't affect everything in the game. You have to crank it up to be able to overrun walking droid mine in desert area.Oh, and there are 3-issue comics that were made by Malibu, I think. Can be worth to track those down. No, it's not in-game thing.Space Quest 2:Came out in 1987, this one will show you the meaning of retro adventure, with parser command and walking with arrows. Actually, it will show you all the bad about them too. No regret of using walkthrough. It has dead ends, deaths, having to navigate through maze with pixel-accuaricy or die, having to guess with no big hints what to do, obscure puzzles, tedious walking, barely any characters, boring locations and huge maze where you can see small area around your character, oh my. Oh well, death messages are there. And you are now stopping a new villian, Sludge Vohaul. Stopping him from ending civilization by sending salemans. Yep, it got a bit less serious.Space Quest 3:Came out in 1989, was one of the first games to use Sierra's new engine that at this state allowed dumb straight movement by mouse, had a lot of cool effects for EGA game and was one of the first games on PC to use soundcard, with nice music here and there. The thing about this one is that it feels a bit like developers were running out of inspirations and just decided to do straight jokes. I mean, you can read easily from manual that you are supposed to save two personas of two main developers from evil ScumSoft corporation. Well, less Space, more jokes.From one point it has some interesting setting and stuff, like getting chased by Arnoid. Or having to play horrible arcade game. But then you are also often left wandering around aimlessly at some point of a game.It also has most gory deaths in series. I couldn't giggle at message because I was feeling too squishy.That, and I would have never figured out to grab something that is few times bigger than main hero and isn't even visible in the current screen.Space Quest 4:It's time to be Time Ripper and kick butt of Sequel Police. Wait, you should be afraid of them actually. Anyway, this is beautiful VGA game now and has icon interface. Came out in 1991. Ask any fan, and they point at this part as their favourite. Though in this case, for every good thing, there is a bad thing somewhere else in the game. Still, most important thing, humor is at the peak there, alright. Actually, since it's CD version, you will be able to hear speech. And that announcer has one awesome announcer. Even ""don't touch it!"" will make you smile. Though they say that CD has slightly worse graphics than floppy, less animation, they say.Sadly, it has painful parts. Not sure about dead ends now, there may be some. In one case, you are punished in the beggining at some point because you took one item some time ago. I know that announcer keeps warning how bad this item is, but we are potty-trained to grab everything. Also, Skate-O-Rama. Save tons of times and try to move in zero gravity in such way that police will miss you. Good luck.Space Quest 5:A little more on parody of Star Trek, this one was given to Dynamix to make and release it in 1993. It was floppy only release, so no speeches this time. And oh my, this one steps up in adventure games design. I am still not sure about dead ends, but this one has interesting narrative, that will actually make you interested to go into various place and progress in the game all time, as you command fleet and stop mutation. Humor is still there, althrough not as extreme. That first puzzle feltd hiralious for me. Old comics style is awesome.Just don't forget to look into manual for coordinates.You know, I actually could recommend it to modern gamer and almost regretted using walkthrough... Until I got to the maze part.Dammit Wilco, you dummy-butt, you was so close at being best!Oh well, you are just a janitor.Space Quest 6:Released in 1995, this one was done almost without original developers. Which means that a lot of puzzles had no needed hints and were obscure. That, and art style will turn off many people, looking like high-animated Microsoft Paint characters drawn on top of early CGI. And you would start in the dark ugly area with no directions and not much interesting parts. And try to solve obscure puzzle where you really should know what to do to begin with.Ehh, it's not awesome. Get a bit better and a bit worse.Actually, it has a glitch at tape worm screen near the end of game. Have to disable scrolling in options there. Vertical scrolling messes up.Don't forget to find ""Popular Janitronics"" manual for puzzle.It also had demo version that has different plot. Can be worth to check out.Anyway, use walkthrough, but play these.			"

												I recommend SQ3&4 but better to get the collection on GOG - you have the option to only buy half, it uses a better version of DOSBox (albeit still misconfigured just as here, but it runs best in SCUMMVM anyway). It's also not region locked on GOG as it is here. Most importantly, the GOG version can be more easily accessed on alternative platforms.			"

												Very sad to say that none of the games will work. I loved these games when I was a kid and was really excited to see the whole bundle on sale. Unfortunately they are not configured to work on any modern PC. It is possible to work around this and load them through a properly configured DOS Box, but this takes some effort. It just relfects pure laziness and negligence on the part of the dsitrbutor who could have done so with minimal effort but preferred to just take peoples' money instead.			"

												This Space Quest collection is a great buy for anyone who grew up with the games.  For anyone who is curious about these games but has never played them I would warn you that they haven't aged too well in some aspects.   The copyright protection areas are likely to confuse players who are completely new to these games.  Also some of the maze areas are a total buzz kill.  It's been years since I've played these games and there were even a few areas in the game I had no idea I could traverse because of the way the art is displayed.  Space Quest 5 was particularly notorious in that aspect for me.   Some things can be a bit too vague also.Still these games have great dialouge and jokes and they're a great trip for those looking to relive those old school memories.			"

												Such an amazing trip to nostalgia land. I picked up the Kings Quest collection as well. There is a common graphical error (pink,green,lines,etc.) that is easily fixed without downloading anything from sierrahelp (my computer thought that download was a virus, anywho). I am not entirely sure if it is localized to Windows 7 or what, but my machine is running Windows 7 64-bit and I got the horrible pink/green/lines overload and thought I had just wasted my money, but a little digging and I fixed it quickly and easily, so I shared the fix on the discussions.Check the discussions for the easy fix and don't rob yourself of this incredible throwback experience.

												I'm not normally one to post reviews, but the Space Quest Collection is something different and worth sharing.First things first, this is actually a collection of games, all of which were published around 1987-1995, way before I was even born. How I got into these games is that one day my dad was talking about some of the games he played way back when: DOOM, Duke Nukem, Leisure Suit Larry, and Space Quest, among others. Now, this last game was his favourite and seemed the most interesting to me, so I did some searching around and found this collection. So, following its purchase, my dad and I would play an hour or so of one of these games each night. I may have 20 hours played on record, but that's just online. At least double that number and you'll get how many wonderful hours I spent with my dad.GAMEPLAYThey are all text-based/point-and-click adventure games. I don't want to give away too much about these games, but you walk around, solve puzzles, complete segments, earn points, and die in horrible ways. It can be amazingly trolly, but rarely in a rage-inducing way. For the age of the games, they can be amazingly detailed in their settings and animations.PROS+For my dad, this was one great big nostalgia explosion, and for me, it was amazingly fun in its simplicity compared to modern games.+Genuinely hard puzzles that have you scratching your head for ages.+Subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) humour and references abound in these games. Example: There's a town called Ulence Flats. Also, in one of the later games, you have the option to uninstall Leisure Suit Larry from an in-game computer and you get points for it.CONS-The very first, original Space Quest game is not included; however, the 1991 remake of it is included in its place. Personally, I prefer the remake, but some people would like the original. ~EDIT~ The original game IS included! Maybe I'm just blind, maybe they added it in, but both the original and VGA remake are included. If you want to play the orignal game, select ""Play Space Quest Collection"" upon launch; for the remake, select ""Play Space Quest Collection Legacy.""-This is my biggest gripe: Not all the games are playable as-is. As an example, I had huge issues with colours being weird and games not saving. If you do a bit of digging in the Steam forums or online, you'll find the solutions, just like I did.-Even though I absolutely loved the first five games included, when I got to number six, I just couldn't play it. Not because it was broken; it worked fine. But because it was plain awful to play. The interface was garbage, the action was unexciting, and it was just plain meh. At least the other five made up for this one bomb.-There is no replayability. Once you solve the puzzles, the game is over. The only real option is if you keep replaying the games to find all the secrets and get the highest possible score.TIPS~Make sure you look at the virtual manual upon launch! There are ""firewalls"" in some of the games to combat those who got the game illegally back in the day; if you didn't buy the game legitimately, you wouldn't have the manual, so you wouldn't be able to play the game because you wouldn't know, for example, an encrypted in-game destination included in the manual.~Open up each of the games in turn to see how well they function. Do they look fine? Do they save? If not, do some searching on forums and you'll find a solution which can be implemented in ~5-10 minutes.~DO NOT LOOK UP PUZZLE SOLUTIONS! You lose the joy and sense of accomplishment of actually discovering where you went wrong. That being said, there is a point when you should look at a solution to save your sanity, and there are solutions available online.TL;DR1) Did you play any of these games when they came out?2) Do you like vintage games or have a thing for pixel art?3) Do you like trolly text-based/point-and-click adventures?4) Do you like pounding your head against the wall for hours trying to figure out a puzzle?If you answered ""Yes"" to one or more of these questions, get the game, especially if it's on sale.Solid 8/10.

												I just finished replaying all six of these games in the form of this collection (though I only took a quick look at the second game), and overall, this version of them is quite good. I would have liked it if alt-tabbing to Windows didn't mess up the graphics to the point the game isn't playable without closing the game and starting it again, though, especially since Space Quest 1, 4, 5, and 6 all have some form of copy protection which requires that you either look at the digital manual in Windows away from the game, or Google the copy protected solutions on another computer or Smart Phone. Also, Space Quest V freezes up randomly when you sit in your command chair. It's random so just save every time before you sit in it. Lastly, Space Quest 6 (they didn't use roman numerals...go figure) has awful performance unless you go to Sierra's site to download a patch for it which updates the Dos Box to the correct version to run the game correctly, among other fixes.The games themselves, though...Space Quest III is probably the first video game I ever saw in my life, when I was six years old; months before I ever got an NES. It is literally impossible for me to get more nostalgic for a video game than Space Quest III for this reason. But I digress...I need to review these games in order!Space Quest I: Its gameplay and graphics have been improved upon to feature Space Quest IV tech, meaning full mouse support with no typing required (except to name your save files). This game has a simple but legitimate save-the-galaxy storyline with some intense moments, a few decent puzzles, some laughs, and just a very nice package. However, this may be the easiest Space Quest game to get stuck and have to start the game over as a result. The plus, however, is that the entire game can be completed in under two hours if you go in options and make sure you have the speed set to maximum. This is one of the most solid Space Quest games in terms of difficulty, story, and humor. Since it has Space Quest IV's tech, it is that much more solidified as one of the best Space Quest games.Space Quest II: I highly recommend not playing the version included in this collection. I do recommend loading it just to see what the game looks like as soon as you have control of Roger, though. It is hauntingly awful. I understand the technological limitations, but a free, legal version of Space Quest II has been completely remade by fans at a site called infamous-adventures.com/sq2remake  It has voice-overs, Space Quest IV or V-quality graphics, full mouse support to play the game, and is superior in almost every way than the original. You can even destroy the vine monster instead of having to set the speed to slow and tip-toe through vines for forever! The game's maze is much shorter, and it's just better; so much better. My only complaints are that I didn't like one voiced thing involving creators from the team that made the remake, and I didn't like how difficult it is to find a few of the paths in foliage. I had to look up a gameplay video because an exit from one screen to another was impossible to spot early-game. I gripe a lot, so view this as a glowing recommendation for their version instead of the original. The story is garbage and a bit silly compared to the original. I think Space Quest I is far better than II. Lastly, you can get stuck by missing items, but the game is so short that, like with SQI, it's not the end of the world if you have to start over.Space Quest III: The music. Wowzers, I love the music in this game. It isn't just nostalgia talking. This game has mouse support, but you still have to type to do things. It's difficult to figure out a few of the puzzles (well, it would be if I didn't remember every solution from my childhood, including those my dad had figured out on his own way back then and he'd told me about them), though I have to appreciate the D&D-style way you type ""look"" and it describes things around you. Then you can type to look at the specific thing and you figure things out easier that way. In all honesty, I wish I had that option in Space Quest V and VI, because they're a bit vague at times. This game is graphically okay, but definitely a bit cringey. The humor is great, but the story is one of the most fourth-wall-breaking and cheezy in the series. I do love it, though. Ah, and I don't believe it's possible to miss anything to get permanently stuck in this one.Space Quest IV: This game has some very good music as well, and the full mouse support is so nice. I would dare say it has the most interesting and epic storyline out of all six games, though the game is very punishing without good cause. Did you just climb out of a sewer? Okay, walk a few pixels to the north and you get shot. Walk a few to the south and you get shot. You have no way of knowing this will happen. Things like this come up at various parts of the game where you just have to move in a way the game wants you to without you having any way to know what's needed of you. It's a very good game, but this element can be frustrating. Finally, the only way to get permanently stuck in this game is to miss an item on a dead body after you personally initiate time travel yourself for the first time, or if you don't write down/screenshot two codes displayed on screens you find.Space Quest V: This one is 95% Star Trek parody, which was fun, but if you aren't the least bit familiar with old Star Trek, a lot of the game's jokes will be lost on you. Commanding your own ship is interesting, and you get to travel all over the galaxy. The massive downside, however, is that every time you want to travel, you have to look in the manual to get a different five-digit ""coordinate"" which corresponds to each planet/space station you want to visit. This was copy protection for back in the day, and it's just absurd. It's the most invasive and offensive copy protection I can recall, especially since alt-tabbing wrecks the graphics, so you have to close the game, meaning you need to either close the game every time you're going to go to a different planet to look up the code, or you'll have to print them off or look them up on a smart phone. This game feels a bit weird at times...I can't put my finger on it, but over all, it's a good entry in the series. It has a stronger story than some, though the motivation of the enemies is a bit unclear. I know -what- they want to do; just not -why-.Space Quest 6: This does the same thing Final Fantasy VII did wrong: 3D when they weren't good at it yet. The 3D aspects of SQ6 are mostly very awkward-looking in what are otherwise great backgrounds, and the cartoony-looking characters actually worked pretty darn well in my opinion. The 3D rarely looked decent and with the exception of a couple of scenes, could have been left out entirely. This game has more interpersonal dialog between characters of any SQ game, and had a really likable female character. Unfortunately, some of this game's puzzles were nigh-impossible to figure out without simply resorting to sheer trial-and-error. It's a good game, but it has moments that feel more ""off"" than any of the other SQ games, particularly in regard to its pacing and exactly where the game wants you to click when clicking the same object a few centimeters in a different direction could lead to you thinking your functional solution isn't the right thing to do when it -is- the right thing to do. Also, the copy protection puzzle in this game is a pain in the rear. I like the game, but it's got issues. So in summary, these are all enjoyable games, though keeping the copyright protection stuff in the game is to its detriment, and Space Quest IV-6 have some frustrating issues. If you loved these when you were younger and are a sucker for nostalgia, they're still very fun to play through again, especially if you get this collection on sale for five or ten buckazoids.			"

												Apparently, there is a hardcopy decoder that shipped with the CD waaaaaaay back in the day when this game was new. No one bothered to tell Steam about it, or to provide it to the player. As a result, I can't get past the first few steps of the first game. MAJOR FAIL. That's just ridiculous.Playing Space Quest I, I can't even get out of the ship before it blows up. I tried EVERYTHING. I even resorted to trying every combination of wierd symbols on the cartridge device. In the game, there is a guy that dies and his last words are supposedly tied to this cartride retreival system that has some buttons with symbols on it. Presumably, the player has to enter the symbols that correspond to the words (and there's several words that are cycled through as you restart. over and over and over again). HOW IN THE EFF AM I SUPPOSED TO TRANSLATE THE WORD INTO WHATEVER SYMBOLS?I finally caved and Googled the walk-through. That's when I found out about this decoder that shipped with the CD as some ""copy protection"" wierdness. Luckily someone out there saved it and I can decode the message.,,,, Just ridiculous. I haven't even bothered to continue the first quest outside the ship - this whole debacle leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Steam should have known about the bizzare feature of the game and provided a PDF or something.,,,			"

												This game brought back many good memories, but, does not work. Very unhappy about it. Steam should warn buyers that a bit of work needs to be done to run the game and that it will not work through steam. 'Naughty' for making a quick buck.			"

												I only played SQ2 back in day, so I decided to pick up this collection on sale.  Pretty enjoyable classic comedy adventure games, totally worth the price.Being pretty old, I wanted to post these tips on how to play these games with optimal graphics and particularly sound/music.1. If you plan to play the games in DOSBox, SierraHelp.com has a patch for the collection that sets up a newer copy of DOSBox than is included (highly recommended), adds configuration programs that are missing, tweaks configs for optimal graphics and sound, and adds shortcuts that launch the games in DOXBox.  Highly recommend only for SQ6 BECAUSE...2. Space Quests 1 - 5 are supported by ScummVM, and it's by far the easiest/best way to play them.  Saving and loading games come with screenshots and unlimited slots.  Speed bugs are fixed.  Runs efficiently and natively on a number of platforms.  Even adds mouse support to SQ2.  ScummVM will warn you if you patch the games as mentioned above; I had to revert the patch to get through SQ5.3. Graphics and sound effect settings are handled optimally by default with either of the above choices.4. Music gets a bit trickier to do ""right"".  General MIDI/SoundFont can be chosen to taste, but most games created at the time targetted two top-tier music modules: the Roland MT-32 and later the Roland SoundCanvas. A) SQ2 is the oldest, and supports PCjr/Tandy 3-tone sound in addition to PC speaker.  You can try both settings in ScummVM to hear the difference.  Default is the better Tandy mode. B) SQ1 remake, SQ3, and SQ4 were composed for the MT-32.  ScummVM comes with MT-32 emulator that is nearly spot -on.  You need to add a couple ROM files to your ScummVM to enable this, Google for details.  You'll see a ""INSERT BUCKAZOID"" message once you have it working.C) SQ5 and SQ6 were composed for SoundCanvas/General MIDI.  You can use FluidSynth in ScummVM with a SC SoundFont or one of your choice.  For DOSBox, you'll need to add a software MIDI driver to you system.  Virtual MIDI Synth is recommended, and their website is a good place to get SoundFont recommendations.A little bit of effort can give you the best experience playing these Sierra classics.			"

												Like many who would be interested in this collection, Sierra games were my childhood.  I'm not even sure if I can objectively review something like this; I mean, these games are what I played on my first personal computer back in the '90s.  They were everything back then.  But I'll try anyways.This collection seems to be mostly functional, and it's a blessing not to have to install a stack of 3.5 disks for hours.  I'm not sure if all the necessary documentation is provided ('90s anti-piracy measures) but anything that's not included can easily be found with a Google search.  I do miss having the big awesome boxes loaded with stuff in them, but for such a low price this digital collection will do just fine.Now, on to the games.  If you fancy point and click adventure games, you really can't go wrong here.  Space Quest V is my personal favorite in this pack, but the others are awesome as well.  I loved playing through I and II as a kid (I never owned III or IV), even their EGA versions where you had to type everything instead of using a mouse.  They really engaged your imagination and creativity, trying to come up with words and phrases, sometimes in a hurry.  These games are mentally challenging, humorous, and clever as hell.  Space Quest is basically a Star Trek parody.  If you're a Trekkie, you'll probably love these.I know there are still point and click adventure games being made to this day, and many are enjoyable, but none can compare to the '90s era where Sierra and Lucasarts dominated.  Back then, AAA companies were making these games, and it really shows (sorry Indie devs--you guys are still great).  While the graphical technology and resolution are primitive, the animations and pixel art are still awesome.  It's also great to hear these games the way they're supposed to sound.  Back then, I didn't have a soundblaster card so I had to listen to ""PC Speaker"", which was incredibly basic and grating ""bleep bloop bleep bloop.""Just about all of the Sierra games in the '90s had so much charm and they're so well made that this review could easily apply to the King's Quest series, Quest for Glory, Police Quest, Gabriel Knight, or Leisure Suit Larry as well.  In my mind, they're all equal and I have such fond memories of playing all of them.  But historically, Space Quest is where it all began.  The first game was revolutionary for the time, and oddly enough it's still pretty enjoyable to this day if you give it a fair chance and throw out all modern day conventions.If you're at all interested in the history of gaming, this (and all the other Sierra games) is an essential collection.  Long live Roger Wilco.			"

												A classic series of adventure games produced by Sierra On-Line during the height of the genre's popularity.  Each one brings plenty of laughs and nods to various science fiction franchises.  Pick this up and give them a try.The Two Guys from Andromeda, the duo that created this fantastic series, are also coming out with a new game in the same style.  They are still accepting donations through PayPal.  Check out their SpaceVenture project here: http://guysfromandromeda.com/.			"

												Yes, I remember having to upgrade the RAM in our Tandy PC in order to run SQ1.  I owned several of the games over the years but re-purchased this set to get them all, and to avoid having to pull out the 5.25"" floppies.  Do the games stand the test of time?  Not really.  Although I am sure the early text-entry episodes would tax some gamers today.  But are they still great?  You bet.  Give me some Roger Wilco humor, sit back, and enjoy the pixels!			"

Anyway, if it works for you, it is a great collection of classic games. I don't have much time tracked here on Steam, but I have put many hours into the Space Quest games over the years. I don't care how you play them. Get it on GOG or wherever you can. This is awesome gaming goodness.			"

												First time playing the game and it seems quite interesting, challenging and very funny.Some of the posts complain about not being able to crack the codes => Read the manual.Initially it wouldn't run on my Win8.1 PC after installation - it would seem a bad dosbox configuration or possibly an issue with the emulator?Anyways - if anyone else has the same issue, these steps might work for you as well.  1. Right click the game when in your Steam Games Library > ""Properties"" > Click the tab, ""LOCAL FILES"" > Click ""BROWSE LOCAL FILES...""  2. Open "".\dosbox-0.63\dosbox.conf"" for editing in notepad..  3. Find (CTRL+F) ""core="" and change the value from ""dynamic"" to ""simple"" and save your changes (CTRL+S)..  4. Launch the game.			"

												You can buy this game collection to own the games legally and most of them are quite good, in part hilarious. Unfortunately in doing so you pay for software that simply doesn't work without you updating and configuring DosBOX. The website ""Sierrahelp"" holds some patches you may want to install which aren't installed in the Steam version of 2016 even though they were released years ago; they also help with proper DosBOX setup, however you still may want to manually tweak the configuration files.Beware, parts 2 and 3 from this collection are not available in VGA and require keyboard controlling instead of mouse support which is a bit too ""classic"" for my taste. However, there is a fan-made VGA version of Space Quest 2 that is really well made and even has acceptable voice acting!To beat Space Quest 6 without an online walkthrough you require some extra manual (used as a form of copy protection) that was forgotten to include in this collection! So, have fun spoiling parts of the game with a walkthrough!All things considered the games are funny and worth playing even decades after their inception, but this collection is so badly executed it means you buy tedious work.

												I'm a huge Sierra fangirl, and I loved the Space Quest games growing up, but this review is for the collection as a whole.  There is one major thing missing from the manual PDF:  a book that was included with the original Space Quest 6 that is the only way you can solve the datacorder puzzle.  So if you don't have that book anymore (or in my case, I never originally purchased Space Quest 5 or 6 so I never had the book to begin with), that puzzle will need to be solved by searching for walkthroughs on the Internet.  It's unfortunately just not a good implementation all the way around.That being said, I still recommend it for Sierra fans who loved the games like I did growing up.  Even despite frustrating pixel hunting and many, many deaths and failstates, these games are great granddaddies of adventure games as we know them today.  And for that, I love them.			"

												So nobody will read this as the game is around 20 years old or something.However i'd like to write that it is a disturbing trend that ""old school"" games are being rejuvinated and made available to the modern gamer and tagged with a rather hefty price too.Was this game (or series of games) worth the value? Absolutely not. Why did I buy the game then? You may ask this rightly and the answer is entirely sentimental. I loved the genre of game in its hayday and played this series of games with a fondness that is nearing reverence. As such, reliving some of my lost childhood was probably justifying the price paid for the Space Quest collection.Imagine my deep disappointment then when trying to start any one of the games in the collection only to be met with the void of game failure. That's right folks, the games don't work. I'll reiterate for clarity: they do not work!As a result of this I have come to the very sorry conclusion that no longer will I ever provide Valve a penny to relive some of my lost childhood memories. The price is already ridiculous and the value to cost ratio is further pushed towards a level of disgusting by the fact that the games simply don't work.Feel free to return my money steam - i'll give you the game back.So. In summary:- game collection is too expensive- game doesn't work- ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t			"

												Space Quest originally came out in 1986 -1995, so computers today were much too fast to emulate the games properly assuming you still had copies. This neat little collection brings these classic EGA and VGA hits to Windows XP/7. The 6 games included follow the tales of Space Janitor, Roger Wilco, and his quest to (somehow) save the galaxy, single-handed! Presented in Graphical Text-based to Point-and-Click, these adventure games are sure to bring you some good fun (and some frustrating times figuring out puzzles.) Being a major fan of Sierra Adventure Games, I definitely recommend this. Also check out Kings Quest, Quest for Glory, Police Quest, and many more great hits from Sierra of old.			"

Also, if you know pretty much what you need to do, the games go by quickly. Don't look up walkthroughs. Play these games the way they were made to be played: with much frustration and many player deaths. There are so many unique ways to die in the game. It would be worth buying for the pant-load of humor stuffed inside. Over 20 years later and I'm still finding funny things in the game.Highly recommended.			"

												This is a classic bundle of Sierra point-and-click games- a serious piece of gaming history. (Sierra is also known for the King's Quest and Police Quest series, among others.) If you like point and click games and aren't deterred by the pixelly graphics (you shouldn't be!), this is a great collection to add to your library.One warning- much like King's Quest, you can make a mistake, forget to pick up an item, or do something in the wrong order, and mess up your whole save. Save the game often, so that you can pick up where you made the mistake instead of having to start from the beginning!Playing with a walkthrough is only recommended if you care more about beating the game than about the journey of completing it.

												Man, this brought me back. Starting up my favorite Space Quest game, wondering... why is the screen all stretched out? Then exiting the game and searching online for solutions, diving deep into the system files to change parameters, then coming back to see if it's all working. Not the kind of nostalgia I was looking for.Is this company SO lazy that they can't even make a graphical tool to customize the DOSBOX settings? Do people over there think I want my 4x3 game stretched out to 16x9 by default? Well I don't!Come on, whoever slapped this together! Give us a break! Can it be that hard to make a tool that does that? And DOSBOX has so many other settings that would be wonderful to be able to tweak, like the rendering mode and the ability to change up the sound. (Thanks also for choosing the crappiest sound by default.) Or at least maybe MAKE THE SETTINGS CORRECT WHEN YOU SHIP IT instead of defaulting to a distorted picture mode, rendering it INSTANTLY ugly and weird-looking.Mac already has this, it's called Boxer and it's FANTASTIC. Way easier than this.			"

												It is so good to rejoin Roger Wilco and The Two Guys From Andromeda after so many years!For those that are new to Space Quest... It is a series of stories about a young ane brave space janitor, Roger Wilco, as he struggles through the galaxy to fight aliens and save the universe.. again and again. The games are set in clasical adventure game concept from 80s - 90s from using your keys to move and typing command for action - to point'n'click interface. As for story, it is one of the best I know, and You can be sure You will have a looooot of fun with this game. Don't be discouraged by old interface or pixel graphics - the game is worth it, and even if some puzzles are difficult, You can always find the solutions on internet. But try solving them by using, talking, moving, combining, etc.. everything with everything :DAs for some problems with launching the game, as I read in some other reviews. I just installed the game on my ASUS X53S i5-2430M, Win10PRO 64, 8GB RAM with GeForce GT 540M. After lunching the game, You will see a menu which allows You to choose one of the 6 games to start. I tried lunching everyone of them and everything works perfectly. No problems with graphics, sound or interface. No problem with Win10. I strongly recommend the whole Space Quest series for everyone!			"

												I was so happy to see this offered on STEAM because I played the hell out of these games 20+ years ago. Yet when Ioaded them up.. they all looked worse on my new computer than my old 25 year old copies of the same game.WTH?? Why are the graphics so messed up. They looked better on my 16 color EGA! Even the VGA Sq1 has severe graphics glitches. Is there ANY way to fix this?			"

												I have played the non legacy versions (which I assume are the more modern versions?) of 1, 4 and 5.Space Quest 1. Could not play, it looped the intro over and over.Space Quest 4. If there is loading it takes forever and there is a lot of loading. Also the cursor keeps flickering. Played it for a few minutes and then got annoyed.Space quest 5. See 4, same loading issues but a little bit less often and long. Same cursor issues. I have played this for 2-3 hours and it seems like a very fun game but the loading is taking to long (there is sometimes even loading when just looking at an item or wall!) Also in general you can not change resolution or scaling. So you are either stuck on full screen with horrendous pixels or stuck in a very very small window. If you alt tab and tab back again the game goes in windowed mode. There is no button to switch. (alt+enter switches)Fix the loading, cursor flickering and give me a scaling option for windowed mode then we talk again. Right now, I deem this unplayable.			"

												Space Quest games are my favorite Sierra Quest games (then Goblins, then King's). They can be so hilarious. 4 is my favorite, but beware; you need to write some things down.The collection runs great. No speed up or freezing due to age. I believe the first game is the VGA version, though, so I suggest downloading the older version elsewhere. It's just not the same. The VGA graphics of any Sierra remake (always the first game I think) are just kind of ugly. As much as they try to look better, nothing beats the classic, retro look that I first played. Plus, when you play the second game, the graphics reduce in colours/quality again, so there's really no point in playing SQ1 VGA.Other than that, nothing bad applies here. You need a bit of patience, of course. The games are a bit slow (unless setting the speed faster, but not recommended), but if you're playing these, you should already be a fan of walk & type, and/or point & click. Criticizing the gameplay is like saying that speakers shouldn't make sound. For their days, they look fine and play fine. The stories are also great, and like I said, funny. Buy now if you like these kind of adventure games.			"

												Have you ever had that game(s) that you just really wanted to like but couldn't it?  Well this was one of those for me.  Before I forget... played on a Win 7 32-bit OS, all 6 games played, sound, (insert usual computer specs that make me sound like I have best gaming rig ever or it's only a step up from grandma's dinosaur computer you stole from the nether regions of her basement)... blah blah.. it plays just fine for me.  Collectively, these games' initial learning curve is significant if you haven't played the style-genre from this era. The manual is useless.  Seriously, google the games on gamefaq.com or watch some gameplay videos at youtube.com.  If you do youtube approach, stop after you get a sense of how to interact with everything.  The core mechanice / fun of these games is discovery.  The humor is also a bit odd.  The more you are into ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"", ""Dr. Who"" style of humor mixed with Star Trek / Star Wars; the likely you are to love these games. The premise of the games is awesome.  The hero / protagonist of the game is a janitor.   As opposed to, you are some orphaned child who grows up to be the guy that saves the world after finding out his parents are some god / king.  Better yet, someone who has this tragic backstory to overcome… aka Mommy and Daddy died due to some terrible, natural disaster (planet blowing up); killed by some evil (shot by random person A outside of a movie theatre) or (insert your favorite character defining moment here).While I love the new BBC Sherlock and the humor in it, I couldn't get into this game.So in short... plays fine on Win 7 32-bit OS with GeForce GTX 960.  If you like British style humor and are willing to invest to get past the initial learning curve... this probably a great game for you.  If not... buy the game, try and request a refund in less 2 hr gameplay if not for you.  This way if you ever are confronted by some retro-enthusiast and they ask you... did you ever play ""Space Quest""... you can say ""yes"" and they will leave you alone.  If you don't answer ""yes"", be prepared to endure while they express all the virtures of this game and why should play it otherwise you will die a terrible, horrible death because you never had this one game experience.  Nevermind the myriad of required, retro game experiences that you absolutely must have besides this one in order to not experience before mentioned death.			"

												well, back when competition was null and void, this used to be fun. Now, though, this is utterly outdated and painfully crappy. There is no nostalgia here. You do not need to see this collection. Kappla! Engage the ♥♥♥♥ away from this. Do you think I talk too much? I don't think I talk too much.

												Space Quest Series are heavy on story, characters and puzzles. But Sierra adventures are different because they add a sense of action, danger and realism to the mix. In Space Quest you take the role of Roger Wilco, a rather mediocre space janitor who finds himself in some very impossible situations. But Roger always manages to come through. The games features some very well written humour and science fiction parodies as well that have come to make the series not only famous but stand out amongst their fellow ""quest series"" siblings.If you like point and click adventures, this collection is for you. The graphics are dated but the story, humor and puzzles make up for it.			"

For the most part the games play just fine, and are every bit as fine and dandy and fun as they were 20+ years ago. Be patient and get ready.			"
