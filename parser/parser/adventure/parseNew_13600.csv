												This game is a classic. Years after its release, it is still one of the most engrossing games, which also leaves you nostalgic. The combat is fluidic and the story in itself is solid. The game has its own problems of camera misalignment at times and the occassional glitch, but it's a must buy for any and all gamers.			"

												The game that changed my life forever. This masterpiece has it all:- Amazing Story. (The plot is just a marvel.)  10/10- Great Graphics. (I still can't believe this game was released back in 2003.)   10/10- Fantastic Music. (The whole soundtrack was stunning. Perfectly scripted for every situation and utterly magnificent. Stuart Chatwood quickly became one of my favorite music composers.)   10/10- Charming Voice Acting. (Yuri Lowenthal's voice alone was enough for the top score. The whole adventure is so beautifully narrated, so full of great ideas and outright perplexing figures of speech...)   10/10- Addicting Gameplay. (A great mix of combat, acrobatic free-running and a some tricky puzzles.)   10/10- Character Progression. (The game constantly updates the player with new powers, weapons and even clothing.)   10/10- Diverse and Unique. (This game has some of the most beautiful surroundings I ever seen. Lots of unique enemies and  locations to discover.)   10/10This game is pure gold. The characters not only look amazing but they also feel... Alive. Totally different, each with it's own moral standing and their way of thinking. There is this good feeling when playing this game. Both the Prince and Farah are behaving as natural as it could get. They are very distant at the beginning, unmoved, cold. But as they make progress, they develop this feeling of mutual respect. Later on they become good friends. Joking and taunting each other in a very loving way. Check this monologue here:""She said my love... I know she did. I didn't dream it... at least I think I didn't... It's quite natural really, her Kingdoms' conquered, she has nothing, no one to protect her. She needs me! I can see it in the way she looks at me. All I'd have to do is... Reach out and, take her hand... And she'd be mine! Why am I talking to myself ?!""I have beat the game at least 5 times. Don't mind my Steam playing time. It was before I had purchased it here. And I don't regret a thing.This game offers and unforgetable adventure. If you haven't still played it, do it. The best game in the franchise in my opinion. 10/10 "

												The Gold Egg of the trilogy.Time travel, parkour, and puzzles. This game does those 3 best. The combat is fairly simple and straightfoward, you can swing your sword, use your dagger, block, jump over enemies, and whatnot. Puzzles are fairly straightforward and challenging.And then you have several time altering powers using the Dagger of Time, you have your:Recall: Reverse time for up to several seconds, usually for saving you from heavy damage, screwing up on a jump or puzzle, or instant deaths.The Eye of the Storm: Slows down time and makes combat and some puzzles/platforming/parkouring easier.Enemy Freeze: Renders an enemy frozen in time and much easier to kill.Frozen Time Assault: Freeze time and go into a badass Omnislash-like frenzy on multiple enemies and wreak havoc.All time powers require either a sand tank, or a halfmoon depending on which power it is. You fill up sandtanks and halfmoons by finishing enemies with the Dagger of Time.One of my favorite parts in the game I remember is the bats, who always retreat in groups of 3 when you kill a bunch. My brother would always yell ""THREE RETREAT!"" and I would always laugh.Man... I wish I would of kept my Gamecube copy of the game I got back in 2003 that my dad got me for Christmas... because... them nostalgias.The PC version of this game seems to hold up pretty well (at least on XP anyway).It's a classic game and is pretty badass in general, give it a try sometime.

												Bought this game on Nov-2015 as a thank you for the good times I had playing this game long time back on Windows XP. Good story. Very engaging. Best played with a controller though. One thing I noticed while playing recently on Windows 10 64bit Home is that if FOG is turned on in game settings, then full display goes white. So had to turn off FOG and play and it worked fine. I totally recommend this game.Last played on:GPU: NVIDIA GeForce 820M DDR3CPU: Intel Core i5-5200U @ 2.20GHzRAM: 4GB DDR3Game Resolution: 1024x768, 60HzOperating System: Microsoft Windows 10 64bit HomeController: Microsoft Xbox 360 Controller for PC			"

												Do I recommend this game? No! I strongly Insist that you should try it!The ""Prince"" was one of the best titles even in 90's, but its 3D re-vision I am talking about - is definetely a mind-blowing piece of art! We've got a perfect mixture of both simple and catchy story, and a veeery enjoyable acrobatics, with tons of multi-levelled obstacles to climb, enemies to bring down...Game is perfect!Well, yeah, it's dated 11 years now, so we have visuals of PS2-era... But it was fascinating back then, and still looks pretty decent even on big screens. And it's the only dated part. Story - still fine, acrobatics (and control of it) - kicks asses, music - eternally fresh. 9/10 in my book.PS Yeah, there is ""fog"" issue you might meet, if at first start all is blue and you don't see anything... worry not, just turn off that ""fog"" feature in video options and you'll be fine.

												Honestly one of the best games I have ever played, The story line was magnificent, the atmosphere, it all drew you. However the constant changing view points have resulted in my death in the game quite a bit, nonetheless magnificent scenery and captivatng story. The gameplay was a bit shakey but very wonderful, leaping through the air from beam to beam tends to exite someone, and this game created that feeling.  The addition of the sidescroller prince of persia minigames was excelent.There were a few issues with playing on steam however, I noticed that it lacked the ability to ""shift+tab"" while in game. The ability to ""alt+tab"" still remains however it is a tedious thing to tab out of a game for the purposes of a message.I did enjoy the soundtracks but there were some moments where it would not play during a fight and then start again at random intervals. Nonetheless this did not make the fighting less intense.In summary a very well made game, it is astonishing to believe it has really been ten years since I have played it on the ps2.I recomend this game for anyone who likes a good story over graphics.

												Is there a better ""remake"" game than Sands of Time? Maybe the new Tomb Raider? This game revolutionized platforming in many ways. The controls are so fluid. You just want to make the acrobatics fast and flowing. Get it wrong? Just rewind. These mechanics were revolutionary at the time. I loved this game when I played it on the GameCube way back when. Its still a fun romp through amazing puzzle platforms. A+.			"

												""Most people think that time is like a river, that flows swift and sure in one direction. But I have seen the face of time, and I can tell you, they are *wrong.* Time, is an ocean in a storm. You may wonder who I am, and why I say this. Sit down, and I will tell you a tale like none you have ever heard.""And thus begins the game that defined my childhood. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time feels more like a playable fairy tale than just a normal, run of the mill video game. You play as the titular Prince, a young, proud, IMPOSSIBLY AGILE warrior from Persia who, with his father's army, ransacks an Indian Palace and seizes the legendary treasures within to gift to the Sultan of Azad: An hourglass filled with the (also titular) Sands of Time, a mystical substance that can affect the flow of time itself, and a crystal Dagger of Time that can capture and channel the Sands. Ever prideful, the Prince is tricked into releasing the Sands of Time unto Azad, twisting and corrupting those without the Sands' complementary artifacts into mindless abominations.It is up to him, and Princess Farah, the daughter of the Maharajah, to undo his fatal mistake.This game is packed with entertaining combat and mind-bending puzzles set to a pleasant pseudo-Persian/Arabian/Indian soundtrack composed by the talented Stuart Chatwood. In addition, this game is arguably the one that popularized the use of parkour, which you will use to navigate the crumbling and booby-trapped Sultan's palace. And that isn't even all; to this *very day,* Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time *still* has the best time-manipulation physics in gaming of all time. Voicework for the Prince is done by Yuri Lowenthal. Yes, the same man who voices Ben Tennyson (Ben 10) and Sasuke Uchiha (Naruto). It might just be bias, but that honestly makes it better in my opinion. The character development is quite solid as well. The dialogue between the Prince and Farah is witty, funny, and nuanced, and due to the poor Prince not having anyone else to talk to when he and Farah get separated, the game is also filled with deep, ponderous, or funny and meta monologues on the Prince's behalf. The love story between the Prince and Farah is also well written, and you can't help but root for the duo.If you can handle the occasionally difficult Sand Creature battle, tricky parkour, annoying as hell Sand Scarabs and Vultures, conserving your Sands, avoiding having Farah repeatedly peg your a$$ with arrows in the middle of a fight in a tight corridor, and navigate a time-consuming puzzle involving axles while being screamed at by a Persian guard with a thick Scottish accent and *NO CONCEPT OF VOLUME CONTROL* then this game is definitely for you!This game has endured for me, and if the speedrunning community is anything to go by, then we're *still* discovering new things and new ways to play the game more than a decade after its initial release. For that reason, and because of the game's mastery of time-manipulation... and because of the general theme, this game most definitely DESERVES the ""Test of Time"" Steam Award!			"

												This game is a true classic, all the way back from a time when ubisoft wasn't a♥♥♥♥♥♥tier studio that barfs out half-baked Assassin's Creed clones which run like a nightmare on moderately good hardware. But I digress, the reason why this game is nothing short of awesome is the insanely well executed platforming. In a word... the platforming is just thrilling, its really tight and rewarding despite the sometimes wonky camera. However what makes it a bit of a flawed gem in my opinion is the combat. In theory, and for most part in practice the combat is actually great, way more fun than AC. The main issue I have with the combat is just how when you get knocked down on the ground, which will happen a lot with later enemies that you cant vault over(but you cant help but try to because the vaulting and jumping is the same button but depends on the direction you're pointing towards) its going to be really hard to get back up and so you end dead before you know it, since you'll always have at least 4 enemies constantly hammering you while you're desperately trying to jump back up on your feet. I also wasn't a fan of how each time you kill an enemy a new one spawns out of nowhere to replace it, this padding felt really grindy to me and ended up feeling much more frustrating than challenging so I found myself wanting to get through the otherwise excellent combat to get back to that oh so sweet sweet platforming action. Other than that the gameplay is just perfect. The setting, story, music and the decade+ old graphics all still hold up really well today.Regarding the technical stuff, you'll need to patch it for high res. support and disable the in game fog option if everything looks grey. I noticed some voice overs skipping and very rarely some weird physics happening @ 144hz, it didn't really detract from the gameplay though. Also It has partial controller support only, so I recommend using xpadder fill in the missing keys that will allow you to save and toggle walk with your controller. Thats it...Play it/10			"

												I'm writing this review just as I've nominated this game for the ""Test of time"" award. Pun intended.This game came out in 2003. 13 years later, I can:- Run the game on my Windows 7 and 10 PCs that run multicore CPUs. The max resolution is 1024x768, granted, but the game runs fine. Little or no glitches.- Enjoy graphics that, although outdated, are still gorgeous and evoke that distinct ""Arabian nights"" feeling.- Listen to an amazing soundtrack that blends oriental and heavy metal, two genres that are viewed as standing as far from one another in my home country, yet Stuart Chatwood has seemingly done the impossible.- Stand in awe as I look at the end credits and listen to ""Time Only Knows""; and can't help but feel empty as one of the most captivating stories has come to an end, and the characters I overcame so many obstacles with have to part ways.- Rewind time again and again just to see the prince's expression as he jumps out from an abyss.Looking back at this masterpiece, I can't help but wonder: Ubisoft, what the hell happened?

												A very solid and fun puzzle platformer, re-envisioning the old classic. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is one of the most successful revivals in gaming history, and it is well deserved for having done so. The game is a third-person platformer interspersed with action segments featuring melee combat. A time-rewinding mechanic is present to assist both in combat and platforming, which can be recharged by defeating enemies.The platforming is the focus of the game, and the combat serves more to break up the puzzles - the controls for combat are not as tight as those for platforming, so those sections of the gameplay can be a little less interesting/more frustrating.The puzzles themselves are rather imaginative, and require some acrobatic moves in order to complete them.While the graphics are starting to show their age, the game itself holds up. If you enjoy puzzle platformers, you would be doing yourself a disservice by not playing this game.			"

												Pros: highly addictive. Challenging but not frustrating. Acrobatics are incredibly fun. Puzzles are interesting without stopping you dead. Fighting is tight, responsive, and gives you a fine amount of attacks, dodges and the like. Good balance of how much time you spend on the different gameplay types herein: acrobatics, dodging traps, fighting, and solving puzzles. The score is cool, rock music with a Middle Eastern touch. Likeable characters. Engaging story. The graphics hold up rather well, albeit the pre-rendered cutscenes show the limitations.Cons: some find the fighting too restrictive. The camera does get in the way, albeit using Landscape Cam, letting it ""stick"" to the current area for a clear view, can help. Roll and Jump are on the same key, which does mean you'll sometimes do one intending to do the other. You'll also sometimes accidentally run up a wall when you meant to run along it, and vice versa. If you play for half an hour and you don't think it's varied enough: you *will* not find the game overall to be. No collectibles, only one difficulty setting and no way for you to affect the story means little replayability.(please ignore how little time it says I've played - I've completed it several times, just not via Steam)I recommend this to any fan of fast-paced action-adventure.

												This game truly is amazing. I was playing Assassins Creed Syndicate around the same time I was playing this, and Sands of Time kept me more engaged and interested in the gameplay then Syndicate did. The platforming is fantastic. You wall run and backflip in order to solve puzzles, not just for the sake of looking cool. But damn you look cool.It's been what, 14 years since this games original release? Because of this there are some things that haven't aged too well. At times enemies can be extremely annoying, circiling around and stabbing you every time you manage to get off the ground. It also annoyed me at first that after every battle the prince had a little cutscene of him putting away his swords. At times this became useful in knowing when all enemies were dead, but it is still a pain. Dialogue (mostly from Farah) is sometimes very faint and hard to hear. But really, other then these few things I feel like the game has aged well.To all those stating this game has no controller support and is a poor port: My Xbox 360 gamepad worked fine, I just had to bind everything and use mouse for the main menu. There are a few issues with graphics and glitches and to fix them you can find guides in the community hub. The main issue is just that you need to probably enable vsync.I would defintely recommend this game to anyone interested in the series. The ending surprised me at how good it was. Time to play Warrior Within.			"

												*Warning* possible spoilers aheadPros: +Excellent platforming based puzzles. These are usually pretty simple to work out once you realise most of them have only one path but when you consider how they work as a whole they are pretty ingenious and will challenge you're platforming skills and timing.+Great atmosphere and art direction. The Persian setting is unique and rarely done. Even in 2014 this game looks excellent. The character models haven't aged well but the environments have for sure.+Ability to rewind time and use it in battle is an excellent idea+First person view allows you to offset the terrible camera+Varied enemies force you to engage combat in different ways+The Prince. Although it happens infrequently, when the Prince does chime in it's usually something humorous and entertaining.Cons:-The camera is a pain whether you're doing platforming or you're in combat. During platforming the camera will frequently move into undesirable positions forcing you to guess what you're supposed to be doing next. In combat it does the same which quickly becomes tiresome when you're unable to see the enemy attacking you from behind. It also struggles hard when you're in tight spaces and the camera has to contend with walls :S-You're companion is kinda useless and it feels as if you're partnership is a one way deal. During platforming she will stand there and let you do all the work aside from when she has to go through a few cracks or pull a few triggers (to Ubisoft's credit they use this as a point of humour which is much appreciated). In combat she is the same. The AI refuses to move from a certain position unless you stray too far from her which means that when there are multiple enemies attacking her she is essentially a sitting duck which wouldn't be too bad but she has very low health. Oh and her arrows can harm you. She killed me once when I had one enemy left to kill and a number of times her arrow has hit me stunning me for a number of enemies to take away my remaining health. Her voice actor is also very poor.-Combat encounters take far too long on occasions. You would expect combat to last about a cpuple of minutes at the most but sometimes they take double that making those encounters tedious to go through.-Fall heights are deceptive. There are essentially 3 fall heights. Twice you're height which the prince can handle. 2-3 times you're height the Prince will lose a bit of health. Anything above 3 times you're height and the Prince will die. This becomes incredible frustrating when you have what appears to be a manageable fall and yet the prince cant take it. What would have been useful is a more lenient falling system where you took larger damage rather than outright dying for higher drops.-The story. It feels as though everything is rushed. You never get a chance at the beginning to digest what is actually going and then suddenly you're on this Grand Adventure. What's worse is that at no point aside from the end of the game is the story truly developed, which is a shame because the concept is excellent. There are points in which the subplot with you're companion is expanded but it feels so contrived especially since she is so damn unlikable.Misc thoughts:=You're companion would be far more likeable if she was controllable. Frequently during the game there are situations only she can deal with like crawl into narrow spaces etc. I stand by my point that she is still useless as you tend to do 95% of the work but being able to control her would have enabled more complex puzzles and allowed there to be more variedplatforming challenges if creative enough. In combat it would allow you to experience a different combat style and allow you to better position her to reduce damage if you were primarily going to play as the Prince. I belieev this would also help you better engage with her as a character (although thevoice acting is still terrible)=It would be nice to have a larger variety of sand based abilities to use.=Controller support on PC would have made the game much more easier to control but as it is it's still very much playable.Final thought:Get the game if you enjoy excellent platforming and puzzles but pass if you're buying it for excellent combat or story.

												I can highly recommend this game to anyone who liked the original and would like to see a more modern iteration of the same type of gameplay. The puzzles and platform sequences are great fun, though the camera can sometimes cause a bit of confusion.My only main complaint about the game is that there's just a tad too much hack and slash gameplay versus the 'sand of time zombies'. The original barely had any swordfights and mostly consisted of just evading traps etc. This game, when playing on hard such as I did, you'll sometimes be facing 5-6 enemies in a room who will also keep respawning 2-3 times. The developers should have understood they were making PoP, not a God of War game. So as it stands I give it an 8,0 out of 10 (would have been a 9,0 without the excessive combat sequences that pop up every now and then).But definitely, buy this game and enjoy its great gameplay because it's so worth it!

												Absolutely awesome game, the story line throughout this game is just fantastic. The fight engine is a little limited and can be frustrating to use on PC occasionally and the camera angles can be a♥♥♥♥♥♥but they are more only complaints and they are really minor. Esepcially as the sequals fixed these issues. But, the story itself and the complexity of the puzzles and boss  fights makes this into an absolute gem of a game that has inspired many games after it's time.			"

												The Sands of Time when it originally came out boasted some of the best graphics and fluid 3D animation in games.  By today's standard, the graphics still look great and animation is even more fluid with the advance of video card speed.  The platforming is well executed.  The levels can be massive at times and requires you to go through a maze of wall runs, jumps, and many other acrobatic maneuvers in order to reach your goal.  The game almost runs like each major room is a level and you need to reach its objective/goal in order to move on to the next level.  The action can feel rather repetitive, however, some of the enemies do require a different approach and strategy to take down and kill.  However, the game is well paced to keep the actions repetition from annoying the gameplay too much.  Overall though, the fight scenes are well choreographed and your character looks really cool in action.  The introduction of the Sands of Time and the knife that allows you to rewind time if you fall to your death or get killed in battle is a really cool gimmick that works and fits very well in this game.  The storyline is great, especially when you realize how the beginning and the end come together to completely understand the story.  This is a classic, just as much as the original 2D Prince of Persia is a classic as well.  If you've never played this game, you should do yourself a favor and pick this up and play it.			"

												One of the best platformers ever made. Great parkour sections, well animated and challenging to boot. The sequels never managed to top this one, neither in gameplay or story (though the sequels vastly improved the combat system, I'll give them that).Has aged relatively well, though I don't remember the game having such awful washed out colours on PS2 as it does on PC. Get a good SweetFX setting to resolve this.  Only fault of the game is the repetitive and simplistic combat, but the controls are simple and it's animated with grace well enough as to not be TOO annoying. Just figure out how to cheat the combat system so you can get to the platforming, which you'll mostly be doing anyway.			"

												I love this game so much, I can't get enough of it. It's one of my all time favorites.I wasn't used to PC controls, seeing how this is probably my first game on it, but surprisingly the controls are perfect.What I like most about it is how enchanting the settings is, and how they kept the soul of the pop classic such as regaining health while drinking water. Everything about our prince is cool from his design, to his charater,to his fighting style.The puzzle are well thought of, and if you thought platforming could get tiresome, you're wrong here.I'd recommend this game to anyone anytime.

												Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a 3D platforming game that modernizes the classic Prince of Persia game that some of us remember playing when we were kids. The music and graphics sound and look great and all fit the theme perfectly. The platforming and puzzles are not too difficult, however there are some areas that can become frustrating due to the clunky movement (so many times the Prince jumped in the wrong direction to his death...) and camera controls. Also the combat is pretty straight forward but is also pretty clunky as there is not much strategy and there are times the fights are frustrating as the enemies just mob up against you and keep attacking you in the middle of your animation and also harass your partner which can prematurely end fights because your partner has fallen. All in all, the game does a good job as a platformer and lasts about 7-8 hours long, however it does have some issues with the controls and frustrating fights. If you are willing to deal with a little bit of frustration you will find an enjoyable 3D platformer in the start of Prince of Persia Trilogy.			"

												The game is an old classic, and a damn good one. I mean, it does have its drawbacks. The camera, for one, is horrible and at times can really mess things up, especially during combat. And this particular version of the game has a few strange bugs, but nothing game breaking (except for one at the end of the game which forced me to reload my last save). Those things aside however, the game is really solid. The gameplay is fun and quite a bit challenging, there are lots of platforming sections and environmental puzzles which are fun to go through. The story is... all right, nothing earth shattering but engaging enough and well executed, in my opinion.If you haven't played it already, please do so, you will most likely enjoy it. Anyone interested in platforming should give this game a chance. And if you're not interested in platforming, give it a shot anyway, who knows, you might get into it!			"

												An amazing platforming experience! More than 10 years have passed since this remake of the old Prince of Persia classic came out and it still is a great game: epic story and music, cool battle system and parkour action and innovative time rewind system were what made this game unforgettable, but most of all I liked the interaction, romance and comedy moments you got with the female lead, Farah.For me it was what gave the game a ""heart"" and distinguished the protagonist from being another ""bot"", as it happens in many other games.It was also the game that set the foundations for UbiSoft's ""battle horse"" of today, Assassin's Creed.Lastly, if I had to write down some flaws, I would name the graphics, which could be considered cartoon-ish and simple (but I personally liked, since I think fitted well with the whole fairy tale atmosphere) and the repetitive battle system (though I didn't notice excessively, because the mix of action and music was really awesome), but in the end even these flaws get overshadowed by the game's sheer brilliance and innovation, so if you haven't played it yet, DO waste your time with The Sands of Time.

												I'll try and keep the nostalgia aside in this review... so, if you look past the bad port, this game is amazing; the storyline is great with an excellent plot that gives the characters depth as they progress; the gameplay is cool with fantastic and revolutionary platforming elements such as the classic wall running as well as other acrobatic skills that allow the prince to reach seemingly unreachable points. The stunning and addictive sountrack topped with the picturesque scenery makes this game feel like it really is set in the time of the great Persian Empire. But most of all... you have the ability to reverse time: you know that feeling when you just wish you could go back and try something again... this game gives you that luxury as you harness the power of The Sands Of Time!

Besides all that the game is very solid, the story is great, and the graphics still hold up (albeit barely).By today's standards, the game is certainly not amazing, but definitely better than many modern AAA titles.

												This was the first computer game I ever owned, besides the pack that came with my dad's Dell and included Total Annhilation, Gex: Enter the Gecko, and Tomb Raider. At the time, its graphics amazed me; the flame seemed so realistic, the landscapes so beautiful. Its graphics are no longer impressive, but its art design is still beautiful, and what I loved about it so much has remained unparalleled in games since: Sands of Time is /beautifully/ written. Its story is moving, its characters are fleshed out with excellent arcs that are both central to and essential in the overall plot, and the unnamed Prince is a charming character.The puzzles were hard and often frustrating, and the combat was also often difficult, but to this day, Prince of Persia has the best writing I've seen in a video game, and the way the story and the gameplay intertwine is magical to behold.Buy this game, play this game, and beat this game.

The game kinda tapers off towards the end, though, but the beginning and middle more than make up for it. The game is very playable on keyboard/mouse, for those that don't own a gamepad.

PROS:+ awesome fairy tale story+ great work with narrative+ save point system+ puzzles, especially the ones with Farah+ parkour with dagger time rewind+ cutscenes+ no uPlayCONS:- graphical glitches- clunky combat- after a while the guard fighting gets repetitive- really REALLY wobbly camera- audio can go out of sync in rare occassionsComment:An epic, although sometimes clunky, introduction to the classic Sands of Time trilogy. For me also introduction to Ubisoft games. And I really liked it. The story is awesome and has that fairy tale feeling to it. This is especially due to the fact that the game is mostly played in the past and is a story told by the narrator. So if you die the commentator says that this is not what happened and starts from a checkpoint. I love this and it makes it unique. The combat is fun for a while but having to battle guards over and over can get repetitive. But this game is more about the jumping, platforming, climbing and dodging. The parkour here is only flawed by the VERY weird camera shifting that killed me more times than enemies did. Luckily there is the dagger of time so you can rewind those mistakes. However it needs to be recharged so you have a limited number of tries. Overall a very cool game that has some bugs and annoying parts which mostly fade next to the epic story telling and puzzles. Recommended!P.S.: the low game time is due to playing this game way back and just trying it out here if it works, which it mostly does although I had to disable Fog to see anything...			"

												I really wanted to enjoy this game and give it a good review. The Prince of Persia Trilogy are some of my favorite games of all time, and I enjoyed them quite a bit on both PS2 and the original Xbox. Also, PC generally tends to be the most backwards compatible platform out there, and really the place to go to in general for those of us with a bit of a nostalgia kick. I've been able to play the original Doom, the original Diablo, Quest for Glory 1, King's Quest 1 (remake), Dune 2, and countless other older games on my new computer (core i7 with SLI GTX 980s, 32 gb ram, and 5 ssds in a RAID on Windows 10) over the past year with little or no issues.There are far too many technical issues that ruin the experience here to make it worthwhile though. With having to set up resolutions outside of game to get it to even start to show up on modern monitors, a white out/fog glitch that makes it imposssible to see anything (and I mean anything, the prince, ground, walls, enemies all invisible), no real controller support, and the issues go on. Yes, most of the issues have solutions in the forums, and I probably would have been okay with one or two issues, but that there are so many. I have to go to too many different forum topics and edit ini files to get this game to the start of a playable state, makes it so I just can't recommend this version of it.If you want to play or replay this game, do yourself a favor and get the PS3 version off Playstation Network. It supports modern resolutions, widescreen, runs smoothly, and even supports active 3d if that's your thing. All with much less work than this version. I feel like if Ubisoft wants to continue selling this on steam, it needs warnigs about it's issues on the store page, or some serious patching love.			"

I had to force myself to play it, and it only took an hour for all that charm and clever design to hook their juicy tentacles into me.  The PG, fairytale style is eerily mature when put up against its direct sequel, and for a game with such a minimal sense of  progression, the story and characters are richly layered.I only wish I never bothered to play the game's sequels.

												I grew up partially with this game, I remember when it came out on PS2 years ago and just loving this game to pieces, it's not your usual linear adventure, it actually holds an interesting story with great character development and incredible gameplay, especially for the time it came out. Words can't describe how amazing the soundtrack is by Stuart Chatwood, really immerses you in the experience with catchy music overall, even though it's all instrumental. I really recommend this game to anyone looking for a great game to play. Honestly gets a 10/10 from me. Probably an 11/10.			"

												Overall Score: 8/10Abstract: Solid 10 hours long Prince of Persia game, with well designed platforming / parkour settings, fun and challenging combat system and great aesthetic and atmosphere despite the dated graphics (launched in 2003 and reviewed in 2014). The story is quite linear but the ending is simple yet amazingly well done.Presentation: 8/10 Great aesthetic and atmosphere. Good looking levels and character motion. You're likely forget you're playing a 10+ years old game once you're in. Not a single bug was found through the entire game. Voice acting is a bit silly sometimes, but it doesn't hurt the experience. There's no native support for HD resolutions or X360 controller. The camera control got me annoyed sometimes.Gameplay:  9/10 Tight controls in both platforming and combat. Movement is fast and fluid, puzzles are simple and rewarding. The combat system is fairly simple (very similar to found in Batman: Arkham Asylum) but fights can get tough sometimes. Its combat core mechanics lacks of depth given that the player can only attack, dodge and block. Overall level design is well done.Story: 7/10 Predictable from the beggining and slow paced through the game. As the game is platforming driven with combats filling in between, the story take place mostly in background. The last hour of the game is filled with more interesting facts that lead to a very well written climax at the end of the game, that left me wishing to play the sequel.			"

												Jordan Mechner managed to do what few franchises can do: reboot the series with a game better than the original. The Sands of TIme is a masterpiece in video game design, story telling, puzzling and a somewhat functioning combat system. If you get used to the combat of dodging, wall jumping and frog jumping over enemies to defeat them, then you shouldn't have a problem, yet the combat is the weakest part of the game. It can be frustrating and you may ask yourself, ""How many ♥♥♥♥ing sand soldiers are there?"" as they seemingly respawn for an infinite amount during the fight sequences. What is truly remarkable about the game is the character development of the Prince and his ability to grow affectionate for a sworn enemy. Now, if you do play this game on Steam, I highly recommend using a controller and binding the keys/actions in the games options, as the Keyboard and Mouse controls are clunky and extremely frustrating where I really wanted to quit playing the game, even though I was so close to beating it. Great game, terrible PC controls, use a controller.9.6/10			"

												OVERALL 9.6/10Prince of Persia: Sands of Time is a story rich action-adventure game. It was originally released for major platforms (at the time) in 2003. Age has only made this game more of a gem. For those who have played Prince of Persia games in the past, and even this one, I would definately reccomend this, it is worthy as one of your many games in your steam library. This game is vastly better than Prince of Persia: Forgotten Sands 2010. To all newcomers to the franchise, I believe that this is the best Prince of Persia game there is. It is perfectly priced as a cheap but reputable price: £6.99 (although I did buy this during a sale at 50% off, I would reccomend buying at its full price too).STORY 10/10The story is very immersive, you virtually become the Prince of Persia, as he parkours and fights is way through the palace. The well written story and script adds to the characters' personalities and emotions. As the Prince's emotions grew, I became more empathetic of his lonliness and suspicions. It took me approximately 7 hours and 30 mins to complete, it will keep you hooked towards the end where the story becomes more intense and close to an end. For a game of its time, this is HUGE. It definately will take many sittings to complete, as it has many save points to allow you to save and ""Continue my story from here...""GAMEPLAY 10/10Superbly varied and stylish combat, enemies become progressively harder, but base mechanics still apply. Few minor glitches do occur rarley however. Smooth mechanics of using 'The Sands' to travel through time to correct errors. Movement is fluent and fun, especially when doing parkour puzzles, and backflips during combat. The graphics are very ahead of its time, and there are some colossal areas to explore and mount during the game.PORT 9/10Runs like a dream, I had no problems running this on Win 8 and Win 10. I would drop it a point due to its lack of (1st party) Xbox One controller support, but using keyboard+mouse was seemless and after the first 30 mins of play feels natural and intended. Using keyboard does cause minor ♥♥♥♥-ups during parkour, but its nothing to ruin the experience.			"

Blocky keyboard controls and random camera swingingangles definietly take a bit away from this masterful platformer that spawned both the Persian and Assassin series.

												Prince of Persia is an old game. That much is obvious. However it is more than worth it. The first to bring up the idea of rewinding time to fix your mistakes in parkouring instead of killing you instantly. Like plenty of platforming games of its' time a single mistake would normally send you to a quick death. With the time mechanics of PoP if you have the available resources you can go back and fix those mistakes. The combat is simple yet satisfying when you survive a horde of sand monsters. With a unique health recovery system of drinking water stumbling upon a basin of water or pool is like finding an oasis in the desert. While Prince of Persia is a classic game it has a few problems. The biggest one is sometimes the controls don't work too well on a mouse and keyboard. With the health system you can go a long time with low health and end up suffering a few frustrating deaths multiple times. There are also a few enemies that are lackluster (crows, scarabs) that get annoying. This is compounded by a short animation that plays of your character putting his weapons away that you can't skip. The last con is that save points have you seeing a vision of a possible future. While it is a neat way of giving you hints there are far too many that are close to each other. To sum it up Prince of Persia is the start of a good series that hit a home run despite the few problems it has. If you want a classic platformer this is the game for you with crazy contraptions and fun applications of platforming. This game is plenty of fun.			"

												I love this game.  So much that I bought it on PC even though I own it on xbox.  It's immensely fun, the story is gripping, the characters amusing and endearing.The PC port is garbage.  There are several graphical glitches, such as the pervasive thick as tar grey fog problem.  The fact that controller support is a ""hidden"" feature (Mass freeze doesnt like it when use the triggers.)And the point that once you get down into the ""well"" there is a game breaking physics bug where you just may not be able to jump to a rope to progress the game.  Or you can, its literally random chance.  Don't buy this game on PC.Purchase a PS2 copy and download an emulation program.  Or download it on your console marketplace of choice.It breaks my heart to say it, but its true.Don't.Buy.This.Port.			"

												Reminds me a bit of Tomb Raider, for obvious reasons, but with more combat too.The combat works quite well, but if you mess up, you can reverse time an increasing amount of times as you progress, making it less and less likely that you'll run out of reverse power. If you do manage to run out, the game is very forgiving in its checkpoints and save points.The only thing I would change about this game is the fact that you're escorting a character pretty much throughout the entire game, which can lead to a lot of annoying combat situations and deaths. All I shall say about it is ""You have a bow, stupid NPC! Learn the meaning of RANGED COMBAT!""Overall, a decent fun game, I actually want to play it again already after having only just beaten it. Just make sure you use a controller if you get this game, it's not often good for keyboards.			"

												Even after 13 years this game still looks and plays quite well. Just be sure to turn off fog and configure your controller (double click with mouse in options menu). HOWEVER, some jumping is woefully inaccurate, the camera can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥sometimes, puzzles are 90% easy, but 10% of the time you wonder just where the hell you are supposed to even go.And now my biggest bug bear - combat: It would have been better to just remove it completely, because it is SO bad. You get to fight 10-20 enemies in each encounter. They respawn if you don't kill them quickly (a dagger finishing move you have to perform on every beaten enemy). They teleport after you, they swarm you and surround you, and when you're down on the floor you're as good as dead. That being said, most enemies are cannon fodder and dispatched easily enough, but some enemies (blue ones) can't be vaulted over, and they hit hard and fast, compared to the rest of the enemies. These are insanely frustrating since they make up most of the enemies encountered after the first quarter of the game. Combat is uninspired and irritating. As if that wasn't reason enough to hate it, you also have to keep an eye out on your companion, who inexplicably is NOT AT ALL able to move out of harm's way, meaning she will not move...at all, and frequently die, because she thinks she can take on a 3 meter sand monster with her bow and arrow in close combat...*sigh*. The game would be easier without her ""help"".Apart from that it's still an entertaining, albeit quite old, game.			"

												I wonder why parents of planet Earth still haven't sue Ubisoft Montreal for such horrible camera and extremely sheety combat system due to phychological damage to their children.Movements of the Prince are attached to THAT camera; and everything would have been alright, if THIS camera had been relized not by means of crooked♥♥♥♥♥♥! When you entering a room pressing ""S"", THAT camera immediately chooses such position forcing you to go back where you come from. Or even better: The Prince jumps from one wall to another, and as far as he climbs up THAT camera could change its position, and after that in 99% the Prince will never jump anymore.The combat system is terribly annoying. Because fights are long, tiresome, and not funny at all. Especialy when four guys surround you, and one of them punches you to lie on the back, and after it three guys performing a combat attack of two-three movements. Sometimes it worse than Dark Souls, but correct me if I wrong; this game is created for children ! Not for 50 shades of grey fanbase !These two things completely outweighting pluses of the game, but it has someting which cannot be corrupted: its wonderful atmosphere of fairytale, little time travels, light oriental metal music, and very very charming beautiful credit song.If you like Dark Souls franchise or you are the lucky owner of ""Hunt is my mistress"" achievement, this game created special for you.P.

												Just bought this game back and end it in a couple of days. I had it in my childhood and it feels so great to play it again. A bit buggy sometimes but you can finish the game anyway. 18/20. Great atmosphere, rich gameplay and story. Not the most original but a strong classic to put in the millenial games pantheon			"

												Great game but terrible PC port with a shocking number of issues:- Gamepad controller support is terrible, doesn't even detect Xbox One diagonal inputs without using XInputPlus, even then it still feels ""off""- Have to disable fog just to see anything you're doing- Have to change the default VSync option to prevent glitches where ledges send the prince flying into the air- Cutscenes play at more than 2x speed with the dialogue lagging behind- A lot of minor control and graphical glitchesThis is truly the worst PC port I've dealt with thus far. If you want to play the original trilogy properly, you'll have to do it on console unfortunately.			"

												I used to really love this game, and thought I'd go back and play it. Man it really doesn't stand up.The camera is the games worst enemy. It seems to think where you want it as more of a suggestion than a hard and fast rule. Same with the movement. Want to dodge away from an enemy? Game thinks it's better to roll around them, right into the next enemy's swinging sword. Want to jump to that pillar? The camera will move at the last milisecond, and now you're jumping into a pit. Sure, you can rewind to undo those, but it's still annoying that you have to.Also, I don't need to see a close up of the prince putting his sword away after every little fight. The story is great, and so is the music. It's a little annoying that there's no widescreen mode, but that's to be expected from a game this old.The final straw is that the game doesn't like my Xbox controller, so I have to play with keyboard and mouse. Which I wouldn't have a problem with, except the  game is clearly made with a controller in mind.I kind of wish I never bothered, and just left this game with my nostalgia goggles on.			"

												I loved the original game that came on PS2 & then remastered on the PS3. I bought the trilogy edition on both platforms. My only complaint is that, binding the keys to an Xbox 360 controller is not user friendly & is down right frustrating. You would think that the devs would do a better job at doing better controller support, for an old classic that came on the consoles. I feel the console versions are more superior than the Steam version & its highly reccommended you play with controller than with keyboard & mouse. Despite trying everything to resolve my issue with binding the analog sticks to the camera controls, I requested a refund to show how disappointed I was with the lack of proper controller support!I recommend you buy this from else where rather than buying it from here.

												Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a 3D action puzzler that cleverly combines ingenious puzzle design with a very intuitive time control function. The one thing that completely blows my mind about this game is it’s puzzle creativity. Forget Assassin’s Creed free roaming puzzles, PoP:SOT takes a♥♥♥♥♥♥on AC’s creativity. The combat in PoP:SOT, while fun, isn’t very complex, you dodge, slash, repeat.The one thing that may tarnish this game’s enjoyment is the epic fail camera controls. Even at maximum sensitivity, I barely spin a whole 90 degrees with maximum mouse movement. Also the stupid cutscene that plays every single time your Prince character sheath his saber will surely annoy you by the 50th time you see it. Regardless of these few issues, PoP:SOT is still one of the better games in my steam collection, and I highly recommend it.			"

												This game is a classic, and definitely still deserves to be played... if it's free. The frustrating overabundance of short cut scenes that aren't skippable and often affect time in-game. These scenes likely take up more of the game than the actual play time and make passing milestones feel tedious. The controls would be great, but a nausiating camera that rarely feels in you control constantly wreaks havoc on the controls relative to which direction you want to go. I found that this lead to most of my frustrating failures.This game had its day, and some features are fun to look back on, but it isn't worth more than a nostalgia trip.			"

												This is a classic game that could have once been an example of innovative game design.   Unfortunately, your biggest obstacle will be the camera angles in the game.  Just moving around and getting from Point A to Point B is an annoyance when it works at its best.   The wall running and jumping was cool, but made frustrating when trying to use early on in the game.I was ready to uninstall it before I could even get the Sands of Time.  This may be a shoddy port like all of Ubisoft games these days, or this game has just aged horribly.Either way, I don't recommend it.  At least, don't buy it on Steam.  Try finding an old console system copy of the game from Gamestop or something.			"

												Omg I love this game. My fav Prince of Persia. 1 major issue, how the game reacts to the gamepad controller (360). When you use it and map your controls to what ever button you want, it forces you to walk. I've tried pretty much everything. When you want to run around and feel like you can't, it's frustrating. If they can fix this, it would get 10\10, but as of now the bad controls just takes away from the experience and I don't really want to play with a keyboard and mouse.			"

												Have only played this game for 30 minutes and have given up.  The game seems fantastic with excellent graphics and story, and i really loved giving the parkour side a run but the game is very difficult to control.  I made it to the wall jumping section for the dagger but found the control seems to almost randomly jump between mouse view and platformer view (ie: still camera view with  left, right, forwards, and backwards).  This seems to be most common when near walls and can make it near impossible to line up a wall to parkour across.  I wont even mention the button mashing to get up the chimney like walls to the dagger.  Unfortunately this has detracted greatly from the fun of playing the game and i will be giving this one a big miss for the future.			"

												One of the worst, if not THE worst, ports to PC that I've ever played. This game has so much potential but I haven't been more frustrated with a game since the N64 days when I was 12. The god-awful combat sections are enough to say you should pass this game over, but I could also add things like: The audio system is terrible; crank dialogue up to 100% and everything else to 10% to hear anything. The anti-success camera seems to intentionally do exactly the worst possible thing at any given moment, making control almost impossible. The movement controls are really buggy, in the sense that you will find yourself constantly doing the wrong thing for the buttons you pressed and the situation you were in (hold northwest to go south?). Get used to playing the same 10 minutes over and over for an hour, so you can move onto the next hour-long 10 minute chunk.This game LOOKS like it should be good, and the reviewers loved it. They're obviously not reviewing the same version of the game.			"

												I had a lot of problems with the PC port of this game.-I had slowdown because I was using a dual core. I needed to let the game run on a single core to make it run better but it still has slowdowns from time to time.- You need to configure gamepad controls yourself, there are no gamepad controls in the menu.- Changing the volume of my pc changed nothing about the volume of the game.- I kept fighting against the camera. My mouse barely moves it.EDIT: I made the game work by using an older PC and using the gamepad for controls instead of mouse + keyboard (still no gamepad controls in menu).The platforming is very enjoyable, unfortunately the environment doesn't change too much. I think the pacing is also a bit off even though the game is pretty short. You get banter between characters but there are many, many rooms between story progression that I feel could've been cut out.The combat is very simplistic and the battles took way too long to complete which made it quite tedious.I very much liked the ending, which kindof made me ignore all the negative points? I'll be checking out the sequels and see how they change.			"

												The combat in this game is absolutely atrocious. Endless waves of copypasta enemies swarm the player constantly, the only way to dispose of them permanently is to knock them to zero hp and then perform a long animation in which you absorb them into your dagger (in which you're prone and anything can attack you to interrupt it). The parkour is impressive at first, but it all boils down to you looking around the room for the next ledge/pole/alclove to jump towards. It's a where's waldo of eyeballing the room, almost as bad as the recent zelda games.  "

												I really wanted to like this game. It has that wonderful Arabian Nights vibe and wall-running, so how could it go wrong? Well, it manages to, mostly due to its age. The camera gets in the way, the puzzles are dull, the combat is repetitive (and dull), the auto-aiming is horrid, and some of the basic controls are finicky (e.g., wall-running and time-control). I'm sure that if I had played this when it came out on the original Xbox, and had I been 13 at the time, I would have loved it. It's unfortunate, though, that I've played too many games that do too many of the things this game attempts - but better.			"

												If you're planning on buying this game for the sake of understanding the Prince's timeline, be my guest.  However, be warned. The amount of rage you'll be incurring will be close to herniating. At the worst possible times, terrain restrictions will change your camera angle to one that is completely unreasonable and then leaving you to your fate of jumping off cliffs, wasting Sand, etc. Also, the number of time enemies will reject you from standing up are more than necessary, and you'll find yourself dying several times too many. I understand that this is an older game, and that these things should already be apparent, but it doesn't hurt to further your information.			"

												I played the demo for this way back in the day and decided to revisit it. Why was this considered innovative again? The combat is nonsense. When you start a fight, there's no indication how long it could go on, because enemies spawn in waves, and how many is anyone's guess. Their AI is mindless. They just crowd around and jostle you and each other while attacking every few seconds. Frequently your character will be blocked from view by this. Allegedly you can aim your strikes by using WASD while attacking but in practice it's a crapshoot, and even worse with the dagger.The platforming is pathetically easy, except for when you drop like a rock in the middle of a totally legit jump because the game has another route in mind for you to take. The environments are sprawling, homogenous and arbitrary; half of them have no apparent function but to be filled with booby traps. The puzzles look daunting but ultimately are paper tigers.Instead of playing this, why not track down the first three Harry Potter PC games? Basically the same mechanics, and they were as wretched as this one too, but there was a charming humility about them. You got to play as Harry Potter and explore Hogwarts and collect beans and magical trading cards and interact with your favorite Harry Potter characters and stuff. It was goofy and kind of cute. This game's shortcomings combined with its pomposity make it just that much worse.			"

This happened so often, that I finally gave up on the game. Perhaps they added the rewind mechanic to make up for non-precise controls, but that just isn't good enough for me.Add to this resolutions that can't get anywhere close to today's standard resolutions, and you'll have serious problems if you're using your TV as your monitor. Luckily I have a computer monitor, but today's times call for 720p, or 1080p as a minimum. This game doesn't deliver on either.All the same, resolutions aren't the most important thing, it's good controls in a brawling, and adventure/puzzle game, and this game cannot give you those.

												This is a terrible game. Combat is mediocre. The story is boring. and the graphics are bad. And the most important aspect, platforming, is completely cut and paste. this game will remind you of the type of game you found in ""9'99 or less"" baskets in Gamestop during the 2000's.The game is insanely linear. The entire game is a rinse and repeat cycle. You go from point A to point B in a serious of platforming stunts, then you enter a room with endlessly spawing enemies where you must block or attack or dodge for about 10 minutes. There is no feeling of progression, you dont get cool weapons or armor or anything to make you want to keep playing.My advice is to stay far away from this. The entire Tomb Raider series does this type of precision platforming style so much better. Even the original 1996 Tomb Raider is so much better than this.			"

												One of the greatest games Ubisoft has ever given us, the original Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time has aged well enough. Crazy acrobatics permeate both the puzzles and combat, still intact and as fun as they used to be, and they're easy enough to execute as well. You'll be running across walls and jumping over chasms like you were born to do it. The Assassin's Creed series owes a lot to this game. Come on in and see how it all started. Definitely one of my personal favorites.			"

												This game is one of the greatest games of all time. It was pretty much revolutionary when it came out in 2003 due to its focus on using acrobatics and agility as a playstyle to help traverse the imersive puzzle rooms. The game has a very good story that will keep you enticed for hours.If your like me then this game brings back good memories. I recommend this game highly, it should be in everyones game libary.			"

												As a first time player, I can understand why this game has a good reputation but if I were to sum up my feeling of it it would be this: Feels fluent yet clunky.By clunky, I mean the controls. They're minimal, sure but I keep finding myself trying to jump off a wall or dodge in a particular direction but more often then not I wind up jumping the wrong way and rolling straight into enemies. This gets amplifed by the fact the direction depends on where the camera is facing and I have to wrestle with said camera ALL THE TIME. It doesn't help that the game oftens moves the camera on you and you have to guess which direction is the one you want to go. It's unbelievably frustrating.However, if you can bare having to deal with the camera switching directions on you, the game can be quite fun. Running off walls, flipping switches, fencing with... undead sand people, etc. You'll even eventually have a companion with you that helps out along the way. Said companion will frequently comment on what the player character is doing during gameplay such as being initially scared of you using a save point and eventually learning that it's harmless.If you want to see what the fuss is about, I say get this game. Just be aware of the annoying camera issues.			"

												Just a heads up: if you're going to play any of this trilogy you need to play all three, and in order. Okay. Sands of Time is an absolute gem of a game and it is by far the best of the trilogy overall. The characters are memorable, the story is novel, if not truly unique. The gameplay is elegant and flowing, and the eponymous Sands of Time fits perfectly into it. Among other things the Sands allow you to rewind up to ten seconds to retry a jump you missed or combat you messed up, which is both constantly handy and occasionally hilarious. However, the puzzles can get frustrating, and the other games improve vastly on the combat and platforming.			"

												This game launched the Sands of Time Trilogy, which spams through 3 games with an incredibly rich story. Graphics: Bear in mind it's an oldie, the graphics are not great now, but they were pretty good at the time. Music: Not as good as ""Warrior Within"", but still good and atmosferic. The voices are pretty good too, humorous at times.Gameplay: The platform part of the game is great, sometimes you need to think things through, other times you need to be fast.One real problem of the game is the camera. It gets you killed. A lot. You need to jump from platform A to post B and you press the direction key and the camera changes at the same time and there you plunge to your death. I also find the lack of response to dodge orders while in battle a bit of a problem, but it might be me...Overall, I recommend it, specially if you get the Sands of Time bundle :)			"

												Ever since this game was released in 2003, I have been hooked into this game series. The Sands Of Time is one of, if not the best game, in the POP franchise. The incredible storyline accompanied by the relationship with the Prince and Farah, offer people a world which they can get lost in. The enviroment is amazing, as it shows us the wonders of Azard but also the Baths, Zoo and the Palace, which is amazing considering that the game is 11 years old. However, in this installment of the franchise, the combat system is average,it is simply to break up the huge amounts of puzzle solving, on the other hand the enemies are similar yet creative.I would rate this game 9.5/10			"

												I love this game, it really captures the fun of PS2 action-platformers. The platforming is simple, yet incredibly fun, deceptively addictive and challenging at times. The voice-acting is excellent and the Prince is a pretty cool character to play as, the story is great as well. The visuals are low-quality compared to today, but that's because it came out a full 11 years ago. My only gripes would be the wonky camera that sometimes gives you these terrible angles when you want to jump from place to the next and trying to fight monsters, it's just annoying. The combat is not very good as well, it's rather repetitive and unspiried. You can do some cool moves like kick off walls to do a leap strike or vault over a monster, but after a while, the euphria of it all wears off. Monsters will surround you in these large mobs then knocking you down on the ground, and because the getting up animation is so long, they can just combo you to death without you even getting a chance to hit back, it's pretty rage-inducing. You can work around the combat, just be sure to use the dagger of time and don't let yourself get mobbed. These flaws, however, do not detract very much from the overall game and can be overlooked pretty easily. Prince of persia is the perfect game if you're looking to get into action platforming or hoping to revisit the good 'ol days when we used to play Mario, Jak and Dexter and ratchet and clank and the like.Recommended to anyone. Highly Recommended to those who enjoy action-platformers in particular.			"

												The first game in perhaps the best ""action adventure platformer sword combat"" trilogy ever made. The combat in this particular iteration was not as deep and satisfying as that in Warrior Within, but it has wonderful puzzles and platforming is an absolute joy. The time related mechanics keep the game from being too punishing without making it easy (the game would keep more or less the same level of difficulty if they were removed, but they keep it from becoming annoying). Also, the game is filled to the brim with charm. Everything from the visual art direction to the music makes you want to lose yourself in the game world. I highly recommend the Sands of Time trilogy to anyone that likes puzzle platformers with good combat systems and a wonderful story.P.S. It's amazing how the same team that created this also created Assassin's Creed which has extremely dumbed down combat and platforming (comparatively at least). I love the Assassin's Creed series but every time I play one of those games I can't help but think that it would have been a better game if more of the mechanics were similar to the Sands of Time trilogy.

												I mostly recommend this game as a counterpoint to its terrible sequels, PoP: Warrior Within and Two Thrones (I never bothered playing Forgotten Sands due to WW and TT). PoP 2008 as a reboot is a different thing and I do give it a proper actual recommendation.I played this game originally back when it was released a decade ago, and had a blast. The rewinding time mechanics were truly a wonderful technological and gameplay innovation. Playing through a second time recently was a bit of a challenge due to things such as terrible camera angles and changes that are barely controllable (it must not have seemed so bad then, but is nearly unforgivable now), combat is simple and a bit enjoyable but seems mostly to be a grind to refill time sand used to rewind time. The time rewinding mechanics are still fun and neat, but now just seem more and more like a limited use and poorly implemented quicksave and quickload or checkpoint system. It just seems punitive when bad camera angles, blind jumps, and controls that do not always do what you want cost you time sand over and over. Other modern issues to tackle are unsurprisingly difficult support for modern monitor aspect ratios and resolutions, but they are not horrible with a little tweaking. The story, character interactions, and wit are just about as good as ever. Though the voice audio is annoyingly quiet at times compared to the rest of the games volume.			"

												Prince of Persia: Sands of Time is a classic, and the series as a whole is definitely something to check out, if you haven't.  That being said, this is the first one, meaning they hadn't necessarily caught their stride yet.  Its definitely still worth the play, but not every mechanic is well done.  Only one comes to mind, when I say this: combat.Combat feels awful: its wave after wave of the same enemies, for no real purpose.  It doesn't really make it hard, just frustrating; the idea is, eventually between the 30 baddies we throw your way, you're going to slip up and get hit.  If you're really unlucky, it will be in a cluster you can't hope to escape. Oh, and to make sure its possibly to get you in that cluster, we're going to give you someone to protect, so you better engage everyone.  Finally, that combo you just pulled may have knocked him down, but the final blow still needs to be dealt, and good luck getting that off with 3 enemies clustered around you.  If I could, I'd yank out every instance of combat and throw it away, and the game would be better for it.Platforming is really where the game shines: it basically invented modern day 3d platforming, and those mechanics still feel tight.  This is what I play the game for, and where most of the fun will come.The puzzles are nothing special, for sure.  Its your standard ""pull the switches in this order"" or ""redirect the beams of light"" puzzles; uninspiring for the modern gamer, but it gets the job done.All in all, its a classic: you should probably play it at least once. The story is solid if a bit uneventful, and even the dialog isn't terrible.			"

This more or less plays like a very clunky Assassin's Creed, probably because its old and because Ubi decided to just focus excessively on that formula in its games that came after.  I'm only an hour in and I'm not sure how much I care to finish it, discovering that.  A few people have told me that its a great game but it's going to be hard to enjoy the early iteration of a game whose design I have already played enough of without seeing any real innovation.			"

Posted: November 7, 2015
												Just to make one thing very clear right from the start: This game was one of my first full 3d games (besides Prince of Persia 3d, actually, but well, we all know how that game looked), and actually was one of my first very own games. Got it for my 8th birthday, and it took me forever to finish it because I was really bad at games and was scared of the sand monsters. Naturally, with a history like this, I am deeply, DEEPLY biased towards this game, so you should probably take my review of it with a huuuuuuge grain of salt.Well, with that out of the way, let's begin, eh?Just some fyi history for those interested:This game is actually the fourth in a series that started back in 1989. The original game was a 2d sidescrolling-ish platformer-ish based entirely of (for its time) realistic movement and 1v1 sword duels. It was a pretty big success, and it spawned two sequels. The first one was just like the original in design, just better looking, longer and more cryptic. I haven't beaten it without cheats to this day, and especially the last level is very unintuitive, though also very memorable.Sadly, the third game was made in a time where EVERYTHING had to go 3d. Though originally intended as a 2d game just like its predecessors, it was ground through the 3d meatwolf. Though I personally loved it, it wasn't a big success (understandably so), and the series went dead for a few years. Eventually, Ubisoft got the rights, and with the help of the original developer Jordan Mechner, they created a new Prince of Persia game, with a new character, and a semi-new setting (it's still Persia obviously, just somewhere else in Persia).So what's the story? A young persian prince is riding with his dad, the king of Persia, to conquer and raid an indian palace. With the help of a traitor on the inside (an evil vizier, what a shocker), they get through the gates and storm the palace. The prince gets into the (unrealistically huge) treasure chamber, where two mysterious and powerful artifacts are housed: The hourglass, and the dagger of time. The prince claims the dagger for himself, and the persian army moves on to the kingdom of Azhat (Azat? Ahza... I don't even know if it's a real place, something like that anyway), where the evil vizier tricks the prince into ramming the dagger into the hourglass. That wasn't such a great idea, as it turns out, as the magical sand blasts out of the hourglass, ruining the palace and corrupting all living things inside, turning them into immortal zombies. No matter how many times you strike them down, they just pop back up. Unless the prince rams his dagger into their bellies and sucks the sand out of them, then they die for good. So now it's on: the prince and Farah, the daughter of the indian Maharaja, team up to fix the terrible mess that was caused. You spend a lot of time around Farah actually, and she is a very great character to be around. Helping you out in battle with her bow and arrow, crawling though creaks too small for the bulky prince, helping him solve puzzles, and being an allaround believable and likable character. She's one of the few companion characters done right, and I say that even though you sometimes have to protect her during battle, which is, as we are all aware, the worst thing in gaming. The game builds a very nice atmosphere too; it's just you and Farah in a ruined, but still beautiful world. Moonlit gardens, waterfilled caverns with flickering reflections, great halls and massive towers; the architectural design is as unbelievable as it can get, but it never takes you out of the moment since the game oviously has no pretends of being realistic; it's a fairy tale, 1001 night with time zombies, and even to this day, it's a beautiful looking game.Gameplay is pretty fun, though the games following after it improved on the combat, it's still very solid. You swing your sword, you block, you counter, you can do some fancy jump maneuvers over enemies heads and off of walls. Most uniquely though, you can wind back time for a bit using your dagger, That technique is equally useful during combat as it is during platforming. You don't have to start back at the checkpoint every single time you die that way, which is really nice. Also, you can slow down time during combat, or freeze an enemy in place and then chop it to dust; ooor you can unleash a very strange finishing move where all the enemies get frozen and you zhip around between them, chopping em all up. It's nothing too special, but it's entertaining nonetheless.So that's about all I can say about the game without giving the story away. As it stands, the only real problem I have with the steam release is that the ingame steam overlay doesn't work. But here's the strangest part: when I installed the game off the old disc version I still had lying around, and added it as a non-steam game, the overlay worked fine. What's up with that? I would've just stuck with that technique, but then I had to leave the disc in the drive the entire time, which is annoying. So I don't know what's up with that bug; it's not too bad, but I wish it wasn't there.TL;DRPros:-great story-amazing fairytale-esque atmosphere-likable and unforgettable characters-goodcontrols-solid and fun gameplay and combat-rewind mechanic makes platforming a lot less frustrating-the game still looks beautiful to this dayCons:-steam overlay doesn't work ingame for no real reasonNostalgia overload/10			"

												This game is one of my favorite games and one that I basically grew up on in a sense. This is one of Ubisoft's better, if not best games. I would suggest it to basically anyone. Albeit, yes, there are times that it is frustrating, however, that's what the rewind mechanic is for, so if you screw up, you can fix your mistake. Just be careful about absorbing stands because that resets your rewind meter. Over all. 10/10. Great story, great gameplay.			"

												An hour in, and I realize that Ubi did not stray far in these past years.  This more or less plays like a very clunky Assassin's Creed, probably because its old and because Ubi decided to just focus excessively on that formula in its games that came after.  I'm only an hour in and I'm not sure how much I care to finish it, discovering that.  A few people have told me that its a great game but it's going to be hard to enjoy the early iteration of a game whose design I have already played enough of without seeing any real innovation.			"

												A fun hack and slash/jump quest/puzzle game with a twist: You can reverse time to fix a mistake.Pros:- Environment is unique and new- Runs on low-end computers- Puzzles are a lot of funCons:- Absolutely horrible, horrible combat controls. If you get surrounded by multiple enemies that knock you down, you will stay down. You can get knocked back down while you're getting up, which takes time, making some tries just pretty impossible. And if you're able to figure out this, there's still an AI that suffers from the same problem, ending your game just the same.- Story end is kind of meh.			"

												I'm a sucker for time travel related games, and while I think the platforming is good it will not make up for the terrible combat.  Not only does the game give vague hints on new attacks in the form of premonitions, when you actually try them out in combat it can be quite hard to perform what it is you saw because no button inputs are given and half the time these new attacks are neccessary to kill a new enemy.  I got so sick of the combat I uninstalled the game probably half way through to make way for better games like Skyrim and System Shock 2.			"

												Surprisingly enough in this day and age the king of the early 2000s generation of games has aged quite decently, decently enough to be considerably better than other (probably most) 3D platformers currently out in the market. Price of Persia: The Sands of Time has a completely different formula from many other games you will play, it is still difficult to find games with new mechanics as intuitive as the time mechanics in this game back when it introduced them. It made platforming and puzzles funner despite being brutal without this mechanic, and the story created around this mechanic is absolutely amazing. The setpieces set in ancient Persia are absolutely gorgeous, and you are going to climb through all of them, even the furthest mighty tower is a tower you will platform through and feel like an absolute badass. Not only that, but you actually have a legitimate reason within the story to be going through all these setpieces, having a naive yet skillful prince grow as his journey continues with probably the best supporting character ever, who has one of the funniest yet completely natural relationships with our heroic prince. It all feels organic, you feel like a badass and you have all the right to. The only bits where the game manages to dwindle on it's greatness are a few bits of combat that drag out for way too long, but even then, it is most likely followed by an amazing platforming section and story bit that will make you forget it completely. This game was a legend and still is, buy it, at any given price buy it, because I can guarantee that you will never have such an amazing experience that feels new and interesting as you will with this marvel.

												Just to make one thing very clear right from the start: This game was one of my first full 3d games (besides Prince of Persia 3d, actually, but well, we all know how that game looked), and actually was one of my first very own games. Got it for my 8th birthday, and it took me forever to finish it because I was really bad at games and was scared of the sand monsters. Naturally, with a history like this, I am deeply, DEEPLY biased towards this game, so you should probably take my review of it with a huuuuuuge grain of salt.Well, with that out of the way, let's begin, eh?Just some fyi history for those interested:This game is actually the fourth in a series that started back in 1989. The original game was a 2d sidescrolling-ish platformer-ish based entirely of (for its time) realistic movement and 1v1 sword duels. It was a pretty big success, and it spawned two sequels. The first one was just like the original in design, just better looking, longer and more cryptic. I haven't beaten it without cheats to this day, and especially the last level is very unintuitive, though also very memorable.Sadly, the third game was made in a time where EVERYTHING had to go 3d. Though originally intended as a 2d game just like its predecessors, it was ground through the 3d meatwolf. Though I personally loved it, it wasn't a big success (understandably so), and the series went dead for a few years. Eventually, Ubisoft got the rights, and with the help of the original developer Jordan Mechner, they created a new Prince of Persia game, with a new character, and a semi-new setting (it's still Persia obviously, just somewhere else in Persia).So what's the story? A young persian prince is riding with his dad, the king of Persia, to conquer and raid an indian palace. With the help of a traitor on the inside (an evil vizier, what a shocker), they get through the gates and storm the palace. The prince gets into the (unrealistically huge) treasure chamber, where two mysterious and powerful artifacts are housed: The hourglass, and the dagger of time. The prince claims the dagger for himself, and the persian army moves on to the kingdom of Azhat (Azat? Ahza... I don't even know if it's a real place, something like that anyway), where the evil vizier tricks the prince into ramming the dagger into the hourglass. That wasn't such a great idea, as it turns out, as the magical sand blasts out of the hourglass, ruining the palace and corrupting all living things inside, turning them into immortal zombies. No matter how many times you strike them down, they just pop back up. Unless the prince rams his dagger into their bellies and sucks the sand out of them, then they die for good. So now it's on: the prince and Farah, the daughter of the indian Maharaja, team up to fix the terrible mess that was caused. You spend a lot of time around Farah actually, and she is a very great character to be around. Helping you out in battle with her bow and arrow, crawling though creaks too small for the bulky prince, helping him solve puzzles, and being an allaround believable and likable character. She's one of the few companion characters done right, and I say that even though you sometimes have to protect her during battle, which is, as we are all aware, the worst thing in gaming. The game builds a very nice atmosphere too; it's just you and Farah in a ruined, but still beautiful world. Moonlit gardens, waterfilled caverns with flickering reflections, great halls and massive towers; the architectural design is as unbelievable as it can get, but it never takes you out of the moment since the game oviously has no pretends of being realistic; it's a fairy tale, 1001 night with time zombies, and even to this day, it's a beautiful looking game.Gameplay is pretty fun, though the games following after it improved on the combat, it's still very solid. You swing your sword, you block, you counter, you can do some fancy jump maneuvers over enemies heads and off of walls. Most uniquely though, you can wind back time for a bit using your dagger, That technique is equally useful during combat as it is during platforming. You don't have to start back at the checkpoint every single time you die that way, which is really nice. Also, you can slow down time during combat, or freeze an enemy in place and then chop it to dust; ooor you can unleash a very strange finishing move where all the enemies get frozen and you zhip around between them, chopping em all up. It's nothing too special, but it's entertaining nonetheless.So that's about all I can say about the game without giving the story away. As it stands, the only real problem I have with the steam release is that the ingame steam overlay doesn't work. But here's the strangest part: when I installed the game off the old disc version I still had lying around, and added it as a non-steam game, the overlay worked fine. What's up with that? I would've just stuck with that technique, but then I had to leave the disc in the drive the entire time, which is annoying. So I don't know what's up with that bug; it's not too bad, but I wish it wasn't there.TL;DRPros:-great story-amazing fairytale-esque atmosphere-likable and unforgettable characters-goodcontrols-solid and fun gameplay and combat-rewind mechanic makes platforming a lot less frustrating-the game still looks beautiful to this dayCons:-steam overlay doesn't work ingame for no real reasonNostalgia overload/10			"

												I first played Sands of Time when it came out on the Gamecube and a few years ago I replayed the Xbox version.   Now replaying it again I can still say it was one of my favorite games of the 00's; however it is beginning to show it's age.  SoT still has great level design, an interesting although simple story and platforming that holds up really well.  Traversing the environments feels very fluid and provides a sense of accomplishment.  It's not all good though, there are two glaring issues one being an awful camera and the other being some of the most tedious combat you'll ever experience.  The fighting is extremely simplistic and not all that hard; but they will spawn upwards of 20 enemies to fight through in spots which really drags down the pacing of the game.  As for the camera, I'm using a widescreen patch and playing at 1920 x 1080, so I'm not sure if there is some bugginess with my setup; but I've found the camera to be really hard to orient, especially during fights.  It'll often get stuck behind scenery or zoom in too close.  Most games solved camera issues about 5 or 6 years ago so to go back to a game with a glitchy camera feels even more frustrating.Overall though if you can look past the dated mechanics you'll get to experience a great game that many consider a classic.

												The game that brought back one of the best gaming heroes of early PC gaming.  I was a huge fan of the original Prince of Persia game, so I was very skepticle if a decent new game could be accomplished.  What set the original apart was its fantastic animation of the main character.  Well, they did it.  The prince's animations in this game are not only fantastic, but functional.  He has a host of awesome movement and combat moves which are brilliantly rendered.  While the combat is not too difficult to master, it is the puzzling out how to move through each area that will make playiing the game fun.  Learning how to use all of the Prince's many acrobatic moves and when is challenging but rewarding.  The story is superb and original and the way the Prince narrates, even while playing, really helps place you there.			"

												The Sands of Time is a game I have played several dozen times or more on my Nintendo Gamecube. It's brilliant. The time-control mechanics were (in my opinion at the time) revolutionary and I had never come across a game that could exploit and make such use of this feature. In a nutshell: this game is a must have. The story can be completed in an average of 6 hours but the characters are lifelike, the gameplay is very smooth and fast (and will remind you very much of a pre-generation Assassin's Creed), the visuals and music are fantastic while the whole experience in general being pure fun.The Sands of Time series are far better than the current iterations of the Prince of Persia series.

												Hands down the best Prince of Persia game out there. The time control mechanics are amazing, and the storytelling is great (you die - ""No no, wait. That didn't happen!""). Think Assassin's Creed minus assassinations and open world plus time control, lots of puzzles, and satisfyingly ridiculous combat. Only nitpicks are that not only is it an old game, but the PC version is a port of the console version which means limited options and imprecise keyboard/mouse controls.

												I meant to play this back in the early 2000s, but I somehow forgot about it.  Having now played it, I can safely say that it's an extremely fun (and for its time, highly innovative) game, fully deserving of its ""classic"" status.  The graphics have aged a bit, but fortunately it's one of those ""clean"" looking early 2000s games, not one of those yucky muddy ones.  The combat is a bit sloppy and in general, astoundingly difficult for an acrobatic platformer, but you eventually come to grips with it.

												Despite the clunky controls and a camera that will not always follow your orders this game brought me the good old experience the original game gave me on the ps2. I have to warn about some bugs I encountered during the playthrough: in a couple of occasions the prince decided he would not be able to make the jump to the ledge on the other side and fall down to his doom. Only on a second or third try he had enough of dying and made the jump. The absence of subs with the VERY low voice audio at times will make you miss out on some dialouges.In the end despite its flaws if you are looking to relive the adventure of the prince you wont be disappointed but because of some annoying audio issues and clunky camera/controls I will give it a 7/10.

												Prince of Persia, The Sands of Time.Quite easily the ancestor of Assassin's Creed, and in my eyes, this experience was actually much smoother than Assassin's Creed was.In this game, you are the son of King Sharaman, only known as ""The Prince"" and in the beginning, you fight the armies of Azad, with the help of their traitorous vizier.Seeking honour and glory, you head for the Maharajah's treasure vaults, claiming the dagger of time as a trophy of war.A harsh lesson is learned by the prince, Never trust a man who has betrayed his own kin, as he'll betray you himself.The vizier tricks you into unleasing the sands of time, creating twisted facsimilies of what were your comrades, your father, and the rest of reality.You must fight to survive, using your superior agility and prowess in combat, with the aid of Farrah, daughter of the Maharajah you had previously defeated.It makes you think on your feet, and mastering the combat allows you to be both majestic as well as deadly.It's a great game, and you'd appreciate it if you ever play it, it's a masterpiece.

Its story is very great and addicting and it MAKES you want to watch the cutscenes and follow the story otherwise through diverse random comments made by allied NPCs. Considering how old it is, it still looks at least decent and works like a charm on the older computers as well.Pros:+Great story+Decent graphics+Action-filled+Platformer+Difficult puzzles+Works perfectly with high graphicsCons:-Does have some serious bugs every once in a while-Sometimes the jumping is hard and you have to repeat a frustrating part from a very distant saving point.

												I loved playing the game on my XBOX, however this version is horrendously buggy.  I would be better off just loading it back up on my XBOX.  If it played as smoothly as it did on the console I would reccomend it, however, I have a hard time reccomending a game that is glitchy to the point of being unplayable.			"

												This would have to be one of the greatest games I've ever played. The storyline is gripping, the characters' interaction seems very natural, the gameplay is fun and very well paced. I never really got people's complaints about the combat as the Prince even in the original game was never much of a fighter. Combat in this is all about timing your dodges, just like the very first PoP.			"

												This is one of my all time favorite games. Though it suffers a bit from camera issues every now and then, the gameplay atmosphere, music and visuals are top notch. The combat is pretty simple but the platforming is amazing and fun. It's very well narrated by The Prince himself. All in all, it's an amazing game worth trying out.			"

												I first played Sands of Time when it came out on the Gamecube and a few years ago I replayed the Xbox version.   Now replaying it again I can still say it was one of my favorite games of the 00's; however it is beginning to show it's age.  SoT still has great level design, an interesting although simple story and platforming that holds up really well.  Traversing the environments feels very fluid and provides a sense of accomplishment.  It's not all good though, there are two glaring issues one being an awful camera and the other being some of the most tedious combat you'll ever experience.  The fighting is extremely simplistic and not all that hard; but they will spawn upwards of 20 enemies to fight through in spots which really drags down the pacing of the game.  As for the camera, I'm using a widescreen patch and playing at 1920 x 1080, so I'm not sure if there is some bugginess with my setup; but I've found the camera to be really hard to orient, especially during fights.  It'll often get stuck behind scenery or zoom in too close.  Most games solved camera issues about 5 or 6 years ago so to go back to a game with a glitchy camera feels even more frustrating.Overall though if you can look past the dated mechanics you'll get to experience a great game that many consider a classic.

												Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is one of the great classics, and it is that for a reason. Aside from the compelling plot and memorable characters, Sands of Time features some of the best puzzle-platforming you'll find in any game. Fluid acrobatics across the rafters of ornate palace rooms and along the sides of immense towers combine with the perfect safety mechanism - the ability to briefly rewind time and undo that disastrous jump or ill-timed leap into a rotating saw blade. The rewind ability is limited in use so that it doesn't become a crutch or make things too easy, but remains effective at helping to curb the frustration that would result from, for instance, a single mistake at the very end of a run of successes. Combined with the brilliant and challenging level design, intuitive controls, and enough hidden secrets to make it worth playing over again, Sands of Time is an extremely satisfying game.			"

												One of the greatest games Ubisoft has ever given us, the original Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time has aged well enough. Crazy acrobatics permeate both the puzzles and combat, still intact and as fun as they used to be, and they're easy enough to execute as well. You'll be running across walls and jumping over chasms like you were born to do it. The Assassin's Creed series owes a lot to this game. Come on in and see how it all started. Definitely one of my personal favorites.			"

												A decade later this game is still one of the best in its genre, with fun puzzles, challenging platforming sections and beautifully cinimatic, and extremely smooth and intuitive combat. In fact, this game has been one that I have continuously compared modern games against and found them lacking in comparasson. The game also has a clever sense of humor and a reasonably good story. My only complaints are that Fera is not the most interesting character, and that the final boss was underwhelming and felt mundain compared to the rest of the game.			"

												This game launched the Sands of Time Trilogy, which spams through 3 games with an incredibly rich story. Graphics: Bear in mind it's an oldie, the graphics are not great now, but they were pretty good at the time. Music: Not as good as ""Warrior Within"", but still good and atmosferic. The voices are pretty good too, humorous at times.Gameplay: The platform part of the game is great, sometimes you need to think things through, other times you need to be fast.One real problem of the game is the camera. It gets you killed. A lot. You need to jump from platform A to post B and you press the direction key and the camera changes at the same time and there you plunge to your death. I also find the lack of response to dodge orders while in battle a bit of a problem, but it might be me...Overall, I recommend it, specially if you get the Sands of Time bundle :)			"

												Just a heads up: if you're going to play any of this trilogy you need to play all three, and in order. Okay. Sands of Time is an absolute gem of a game and it is by far the best of the trilogy overall. The characters are memorable, the story is novel, if not truly unique. The gameplay is elegant and flowing, and the eponymous Sands of Time fits perfectly into it. Among other things the Sands allow you to rewind up to ten seconds to retry a jump you missed or combat you messed up, which is both constantly handy and occasionally hilarious. However, the puzzles can get frustrating, and the other games improve vastly on the combat and platforming.			"

If you get surrounded by multiple enemies that knock you down, you will stay down. You can get knocked back down while you're getting up, which takes time, making some tries just pretty impossible. And if you're able to figure out this, there's still an AI that suffers from the same problem, ending your game just the same.- Story end is kind of meh.			"

Not only do you collaborate in puzzles, but she also reacts to your actions in a very lifelike manner. This is a must see.The parkour inspired, ""vertically unchallenged"" acrobatics and the exploration of the interrelated environments in the castle (you can see the last building from the first building) also make this game priceless. Part of it is inspired from ICO, but the Prince is a much more polished experience - one of the best games, featuring exploration and environmental puzzles.			"

												The game that brought back one of the best gaming heroes of early PC gaming.  I was a huge fan of the original Prince of Persia game, so I was very skepticle if a decent new game could be accomplished.  What set the original apart was its fantastic animation of the main character.  Well, they did it.  The prince's animations in this game are not only fantastic, but functional.  He has a host of awesome movement and combat moves which are brilliantly rendered.  While the combat is not too difficult to master, it is the puzzling out how to move through each area that will make playiing the game fun.  Learning how to use all of the Prince's many acrobatic moves and when is challenging but rewarding.  The story is superb and original and the way the Prince narrates, even while playing, really helps place you there.			"

												To start: I used to add a header to these reviews, but since it often made the review too long to sumbit, I've opted to leave it on my Backloggery page.Gameplay: Sid Meier has a development mantra he calls the ""Covert Action Rule,"" which goes, ""It's better to have one good game than two great games."" While this isn't necessarily a perfect way to continue into this game, it's the best one I've thought of. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is one you probably already know about. If you don't, then what you should know is that this game is half parkour simulator and half sword-fighting game; the latter of which I found to be incredibly infuriating at times, but I'll talk about that part later.The platforming in this game is really, really fun. There's a slight bit of puzzle to the platforming sections, but usually never to the point where you've gotta stop for a minute or two to think about how you're gonna tackle these jumps. Those are saved for the actual puzzles in the game, of which there are about five puzzle areas. The first one is of the highest quality in my opinion, but that's not to say that the later ones are bad; it's just that the first one is really well-designed. As far as the controls go, there's essentially a ""magic parkour button,"" (you should definitely use a controller for this game, by the way) and most of the actions are done automatically. This can lead you to throw yourself off of a ledge more than a few times when you're starting out, but thankfully you've got the ability to rewind time once you get the Dagger of Time.This brings me to the combat, which I feel is both far too simple and far too complex. It's far too complex, since there are apparently 50+ combos that you can do in the game, of which I only ever really needed one (attack attack attack attack etc.), and there is no documentation in-game for the combos. That's not to say that having combos are a bad thing; I'd just like to know what they are. The game does no tutorializing as far as combos go, and in fact I only learned about this vast number of combos because I looked it up. This is one of the main reasons why the game can be very frustrating; I'm assuming that these combos are in the manual or something, but the Steam version doesn't come with a manual. Even then, the combos really should be in game in a menu somewhere. Also, there were many times in which I found myself stuck on the ground and unable to get up. It turns out that if you are blocking while you're on the ground, you can't get up. The game doesn't tell you about this either. Another reason why the game is too complex for its own good is that there's only about six different types of enemies throughout the entire game, and they all pretty much have the same AI pattern of ""surround player, stunlock to death,"" which sure does suck whenever your  only real way of getting out of that situation is jumping over enemies, and the type of enemy surrounding you are ones that can't be jumped over.The game is also far too simple, partly because of one major sin: automatic lock-on. If you are even pointing your analog stick in the directon of the enemy, you'll magically be attracted to that enemy for a while, even if you're pointing away from them. It's really annoying, and can lead to many times of getting surrounded. Trying to roll through a tight gap to avoid getting surrounded by un-jumpable enemies? Too bad; you're jumping on the un-jumpable enemy. Trying to attack a once faraway enemy that you're getting closer to? You will if you get lucky enough that the Prince stops ogling at an enemy you were attacking prior. Even beyond the frustrating bits with the controls, there's the fact that every single enemy is defeated in the same way: attack until they fall on their stomach, use the dagger to absorb them. Also yes, if you were wondering, the lock-on can mess you up with this as well, leading you to use powerups on enemies you didn't want to when you were just trying to absorb some sand.And then there's your game-long escort, Farah. Notice how I said escort and not partner? Intentional. She's an absolute idiot in combat. She comes with a bow, but constantly insists on standing statuesque directly in the fray, even when being attacked, when a much simpler solution would be for her to get to some dang high ground. There's loads of it around, so there's really no excuse for it. Also, if she dies, the game is over. What does she offer to the game as a whole? The ability to crawl through small gaps. Yes, in the grand scheme of things, she's about as useful as a puppy, mouse, or other small animal. She's about as useful in combat as well, actually. You see, she can't actually kill enemies. She just stuns them every now and then when she's not looking around in random directions admiring the architecture as though the idea of stone buildings is the most amazing thing ever. Long story short, she's absolutely useless and is more of a liablility than anything else.Speaking of the architecture (and something positive), the level design is fantastic. I'll go more into detail in the graphics section, but for now, I can definitely say that they did an excellent job creating a world that feels natural for the most part. There are a few pretty contrived places here and there, but who knows what those crazy architects are up to anymore, eh? Apart from that, though, that's all I really have to say about this game's gameplay. The platforming is super fun, but the combat just really brings the game down in my opinion. Then again, maybe games like Metal Gear Rising, Bayonetta, and Devil May Cry 1 have led me to expect too much from these kinds of games. I still stand with what I said at the beginning; this game would be so much better if it were two games: a game focused almost entirely on platforming with maybe 5% of the game being combat, and another game being 95% combat (with a more-developed combat system/enemy variety) and 5% platforming. As is, you've got one really good thing and one really frustrating thing which kinda makes me not wanna play this game again. If it weren't for the combat, this game would easily get a 10/10 from me, but with the combat, it drops to a 7/10. Great at times; absolutely miserable at others.Story: You may have gathered from that one paragraph that I don't like Farah all that much. You'd be right. To be honest, it still doesn't really make sense why she comes along at all; she's useful for being small and that's about it. All this being said though, she's not a badly written character; just an okay one. She is a love interest of the Prince, which again feels pretty contrived to me, and to be quite frank; I think the Prince is insane for wanting her. Oh well; I couldn't possibly hope to understand what goes through the Prince's head. As for the prince itself, he's pretty much straddling the line between hero and anti-hero. He wants to do good, but he's a bit of a selfish prat at the same time. Then again, he *is* a prince, so you can't expect him to have had the greatest socialization experience growing up, so fair enough. Apart from Farah and the Prince, everyone else is just a minor character. The premise and delivery is pretty cool, too; it's being told in terms of a story, and as such, has the ablility to go back and forth, as does happen with the story and the gameplay. It's all quite clever, I must admit. While the character arcs may not be the most amazing thing ever, I can appreciate the clever nature of the delivery and the premise enough to give it an 8/10.(I actually have run out of space; time to put the rest in the comments again!)

												Great game with fond memories of playing with my brother. The game still holds up even now. The game itself runs well but using my gamepad it does have trouble registering button hits when trying to use certain sand powers. Not sure why it had trouble but at least for me it didn't take away from the experience.			"

												One of the best puzzle platformers out there, even after all these years.GFX: Getting old now.SFX: Good music and sound effects.STRY: Compelling narrative with an acrobatic prince and cheeky lil princess, told in an interesting manner.GMPLY: The fighting can get a little repetitive once you know all the baddies patterns but the platforming is tight.5/5tl;dr: One of my all-time favorite games.

												As one who has played this game way back around 2003, I found it a very nostalgic experience.  After reviewing other reviews, both the good and the bad, I have come to a fair conclusion:Most people think this game is amazing, due to nostalgia, or hate it because they felt that the nostalgic audience were completely wrong.  In my opinion, I think the game good, not exellent or fantasic, but just good.  (8/10)Why is this?  Well, going over the facts, nostalgia, although present in my opinion, is not the entirity of it.  There a few glitches here and there, most of which wont be found unless you play like I do.  Nothing too game breaking either.  The camera, which many complain is very bad is actually extremely good most of the time.  If you are right in the center of combat, especially with bird enemies, it starts spinning out of control, but it is still managable.  Most jumps may have ""difficult"" camera angles until you realise that most are marked with shadows or moss.  The game, although seeming easy at first, escalates throughout the story at a decent rate.  This being an old classic, does have great graphics for its time, although some do seem a little lazy as well.  Most of the animations are smooth as well, although if you are playing for animations rather than the puzzles and combat, I would suggest a game that is made a little later than 2003.  The story may seem a little short, but is executed well and is great considering the limitations of console memory back in the day.  Lastly, the soundtrack and effects are executed quite well throughout the game.All in all, this game is overrated by most who have replayed it and underrated by the ones who chalk up hating the game because ""it is only for nostalgic people.""  I think it desires an 8/10 considering that it is relatively functional and has a great story and system of play behind it. I highly recommend a controller, since this was originally a console game.  I am guessing that some of the people who hated either didnt take the time to lay out a gamepad (controller) or didn't have one.  If you dont have one, this game may seem more of a 5 to 7/10.To finally conclude after such a long rant, it is a classic that recieves mixed ratings that are mostly bias and uncritical.  It is worth the price, and even more worth getting it on sale.  Dont drop it the second things dont go your way, that is what is suppose to happen in game in the first place!My final and official rating: 8/10			"

												The story is presented as a tale being told by the prince.The Prince is tricked into unleashing the sands of time, turning everyone except the Prince and Farah into sand creatures, also unlocking the ability to alter time itself with the dagger of time. This is the games main gimmick. And it's a fun one, using his powers the prince must undo the damage he's done, aided by his AI companion Princess Farah. She's a capable partner in the many different puzzles and combat sections. And the Princes love interest. The pair have excellent chemistry and it does a lot for the games story. And the ending is still pretty good. It's not revolutionary. But it was a satisfying enough conclusion for me.The game runs like a dream. It didn't crash a single time for me. There are 3 tweaks to enhance the graphics. A widescreen patch, and forced anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering. And one fix for a commmon issue on modern hardware.Now texture quality is about as consistent as the aim of a stormtrooper with alcoholism, having some of the all time muddiest looking textures I've ever seen and a few very sharp ones that aged well. Some of the glow and particle effects still look pretty good. Water has a wierd pixellation that's awful to look at. Each area is very unique and detailed. The textures might look like♥♥♥♥♥but you can see what they were going for. And it's beautiful. The two characters animations are solid. The amount of detail on the prince is downright impressive. Most of the enemies still look very good. Their animations telegraph certain incoming attacks and despite each enemy type being only a copy of it itself, I feel like these aged just fine. Creatures like beatles and birds still look pretty good.I'm terrible at judging sound and voice quality. But generally I had no problem believing the two main characters as they delivered their lines. The rest of the sound does a decent job with all of the sound effects being believable for me.The music is great.. but I didn't feel like it was used enough. Sometimes the absence of music is a good thing, but here it just feels strange. I found myself wondering if I was having a bug with the music not playing. When you do hear it, mostly during combat, it's exciting and I enjoyed each track. They all fit their moments pretty well for me.The Prince can run on walls, jump across pits filled with spikes, and climb crumbling ledges to traverse the enviroment. This is the games greatest strength as it throws platforming puzzles, traps and sometimes flying enemies at the player while you're climbing. The platforming sections feel very rewarding, and each one is a thrill to complete.Combat is fast paced and controls are handled well. Balacing when its right to strike, block, dodge or use the dagger to kill enemies who are knocked down. The game usually throws packs of different enemies at you at once all with different strengths and weaknesses to keep the experience from getting stale, Unfortunately it ends up being hindered by overstaying it's welcome. Almost every fight goes on a longer than it needs to and the combat began to feel repetitive because of this. I found myself just wanting to get back to the next platforming section halfway through each fight. You do get one ability that helps with mitigate this a little, but it isn't enough.There isn't really replayability here. After you've finished the game you won't have the desire to play it again. At least not for a while.The controls themselves still work great. And you'll get used them quickly. All of the controls can be rebound, but I didn't feel like I needed to. Platforming and Combat feels good, responsive and smooth as long as the camera is cooperating.Is it still fun? Yes. Absolutely. It's a blast. Thanks to it's fantastic platforming, solid puzzles, interesting story and characters and excellent soundtrack. It manages to not get dragged down by its faults. In many ways it is showing it's age. But after 13 years I have to say Prince of Persia : Sands of Time still holds up.My video review :
