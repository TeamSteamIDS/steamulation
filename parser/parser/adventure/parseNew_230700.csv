												A very hard, very deep and very fun metroidvania. I've never seen another game in this genre as close to perfection as this.Be warned though, some puzzles can be very, VERY obtuse and often puzzles will have components in completely unrelated areas to that in which you are solving a puzzle.Of course, this game makes no secret of reveling in unfair and brutal design. May God have mercy on your soul if you attempt the Hell Temple on Hard mode...			"

												La-Mulana is two things: a profound work of art, and a monumental ""screw you"" to every modern game design philosophy.The game does not ease you into experience; it demands your full attention and investment from the moment you turn it on. It then throws you, a small and powerless character, into a huge, dangerous world without any sort of guidance or sense of direction, forcing you to spend dozens of hours reading text, deciphering cryptic riddles, memorizing the map layouts, and learning the world's lore if you wish to progress.To call the difficulty ""retro"" would be a disservice; the gameplay consists of all the worst parts of Castlevania backtracking, Myst puzzles, trial-and-error gameplay, and punishing NES-style platforming. Every room is filled with the most irritating enemies imaginable. The main character's controls are stiff and terrible, resembling Donkey Kong or Speulunker. You lose complete control of your movement when falling or taking damage, so one wrong jump or a hit from an enemy could knock you down several screens and force you to do everything all over again. Sometimes the game will drop you through an invisible trapdoor to the same effect, and expect you to remember where it was, or an enemy will hit you immediately after a screen transition, and you will just have to learn to enter the room from a different way next time. The gameplay can only be described as emotionally draining, and it only ever gets harder and never apologizes for itself.The rules and physics are not even consistent, as puzzles will often involve illusionary walls, invisible platforms, unclear objectives, mysterious event flags that trigger under arbitrary conditions and don't tell you what they changed, specific items or weapons you aren't guaranteed to have discovered yet, the understanding and abuse of the minute physics of said items and weapons, rooms which wrap around to other parts of the map in non-Euclidian ways, familiar objects that don't work the way they always have, inconspicuous background decorations that are actually important, and the ever-classic instant-death traps. Your only hope to solve the puzzles, aside from just ""try everything"", is to look for hints that could literally be anywhere else in the entire game with no rhyme or reason to their placement. The key hint could be on a tablet you might have read hours ago in another area. Sometimes a puzzle will require a dozen hints that are literally strewn all over the entire game. Your time means absolutely nothing to the game; the game assumes you have all the time in the world to study it like a college course, practice until you can defeat erratic and unfair enemies, perform long sections of brutally frustrating platforming, and bang your head against the wall as you wander around for hours because you have no earthy idea where to go next. And yet...If you stick with the game through all of the hardships, you will be rewarded with one of the most intricate, creepy, and powerful stories ever to be portrayed in a video game. The story starts out with perhaps hundreds of cryptic hints that will make absolutely no sense, until halfway through the game when some key revelations come to light. Suddenly, everything just clicks into place as the backstory becomes a stunning mosaic. Your mind might be blown as you realize that everything, from the position of every area, to the contents of nearly every room, to the words of every strange character and cryptic tablet, to the placement of every decoration, is there for a reason relevant to the narrative. Even the main character, as he stumbles clumsily through the cluttered and deathly labyrinths of the ruins, becomes relatable as he bears witness to the remnants of something ancient and tragic. There really is nothing else like La-Mulana's story in the way it is conveyed, and it must be experienced firsthand to be believed. It might even leave you hungering for a second playthrough just so you can breeze through the challenges with a sense of foresight and appreciate all the details you might have missed the first time.Just be warned, it is not a game that expects you to beat it, to enjoy it, or even to play it in the first place. The motivation to push forward must come entirely from the player, as the game certainly has no regard for valuing your time or stringing you along with promises of fun and reward. But it demands to be witnessed, appreciated, and analyzed, much like a thick Shakespearean play or a picture in an art museum. If anything, it is deeply fascinating both as a work of art and as a bold statement about gameplay design, and it is highly satisfying to unravel and conquer its mysteries. But above all, it is definitely not for everybody.			"

												Lamulana is a game where half-Japanese Indiana Jones goes into a temple for worshipping a lovecraftian elder god. He stays in there for months upon end and teleporting is the LEAST weirdest thing he has to do every few minutes.Lamulana is a game where you MUST, and I mean MUUUUUUUST, write down EVERY glyph you find and EVERY conversation you have with a dead skeleton lying on the ground on a sheet of paper and tape it all onto the walls. Yes, your real, physical walls. Arrange them into a map based on WHERE in the La-Mulana ruins you found each note. Ready some strings and pins because you're going to need to make arbitrary connections with two notes in entirely different locations with possible relations.Oh, the La-Mulana ruins? It's non-euclidean. That means it's full of distorted/repeating space connected by portals all over the place that doesn't make any sense at all. It drives a lesser man insane. BUT NOT YOU. NO. You note that all down, too! Oh, and you want to be able to fold each area so it'll become a 5x4 square, btw. Don't think about it too hard. Just keep that in the back of you're head because you're going to need it at the end game. Just saying, every area in the game might be shaped like a 4D donut with varying directions of gravity.I went and took a sheet of paper and listed every lamulanese characters and its english equivalent. It took forever and I have no idea why I have no life and am such a loser. I was actually having fun. What is wrong with me. I learned to write an entirely fictional language.http://i.imgur.com/WNFxC2s.jpgMe decyphering ancient tablets by hand. [Edit: link is dead, so here's video of someone doing a La-Mulana speedrun. https://clips.twitch.tv/raindropdry/ZanySeahorseArgieB8 ]I disabled the glyph reader. It's a waste of virtual MSX laptop's memory. I can just read it right off the tablet. Both normal and inverted.tl;dr La-Mulana is a pretty hard game, but you'll have so much fun pushing yourself to survive it all.			"

												You read the description, you think: ""Oh alright it is going to have some pretty tough puzzles but it is a 2D slasher RPG/Metroid thing...I'll eventually fight my way through.NO.NO.You will die, you will be lost for ages. You will forget which way is up, what progress feels like, and dream of air control when jumping straight up. I played this game for 40+ hours, WITHOUT using a guide once. I eventually broke down and looked up the very next step I had to take. After that, I progressed and got stuck AGAIN. Looked up the guide for one more push and got stuck AGAIN. I felt defeated as when I found something out and moved forward, I would be stuck for another countless amount of hours.I challenge anyone who reads this and hasn't played the game: Attempt the game without using a guide for as long as you can and truly feel what is is like to be helpless. I say to you, as a gamer this:I personally believe one CANNOT beat this game without ever using a guide for assistance no matter how small the step.The music, presentation, pull, exploration is top notch however!

												This game man, I had a lot of fun with it. If you want to play a metroidy style game that has tons of puzzles and riddles and such to solve? This game is something you should seriously pick up. If you don't want to take notes/screenshots/etc though? You should probably look for another game. For the most part, all of the puzzles are pretty fair, but there are a few that kinda made me go ""...really?""If you're looking for a good challenge, I can not recommend this game enough. My only regret is that I didn't hear about it soon enough to get in on the kickstarter for the sequel they're working on.That said, I admit to getting frustrated at the very end and succumbed to having a friend give me a few tips xD After 90 hours I was just ready to be done, ya know? It was kinda frustrating, but as a whole, I still love the hell outta this game <3			"

												In two words: hard and japanese. Perhaps, that wasn’t eloquent enough. Excruciatingly, unbelievably hard and amusingly delightfully japanese. And if you think it’s “Dark Souls hard”, think again. La-Mulana does to Dark Souls what Dark Souls does to your typical AAA-game. It is an impossible cocktail, where a tiny drop of pleasure is dissolved in a full glass of pain. So you have to work your way to your reward and it will be more of a faint tone than a full-scale experience. But it’s still worth it. Even though you’ll have to deal with those impossible wall-jumps and remorseless bosses, and complete vagueness of the right direction to go. Such outright brutality is so old-school that the game becomes not just an homage to The Maze of Galious like UnEpic did, but a proper successor. This uncompromisingly torturing game-design is a perfect match for an originally freeware game for Windows, made by two enthusiasts inspired by MSX era in gaming. It’s that level of difficulty that accepts a placing of an unkillable (until you find a certain item of course) boss just a few screens to the left from the starting point. But then again what would you expect from a game that tries to recreate an atmosphere of obscure predecessor of modern metroidvanias? If you think now that La-Mulana has a suitably absurd fantasy story, you’re only half right. It still has its background, one of a very grim mythology, but on the surface it’s the story of an archaeologist named Lemeza Kosugi. He’s wearing a fedora, carrying a whip and a revolver and is going inside a prehistoric underground tomb. Of course inside the tomb he will find all sorts of dangers, including venomous snakes, aggressive bats, walking skeletons and all kinds of deadly traps. So, yes, it’s Indiana Jones, but with some additional weirdness. The deeper you venture inside game’s vast dungeon the more horrible truths you will discover about the world’s history and (seemingly) inevitable doom. This doesn’t mean though that there won’t be a whole bunch of comical stereotypic japanese NPCs with their humorous dialogues. They’ll always cheer you up just when you’re about to be soaked in a muddy swamp of depressing events of the past. Of course I mean game’s fictional past, not your pathetic chain of events called life (or mine for that matter).About how the dungeoneering is made I must say that it looks fairly simple on the surface. You can move in four directions, jump like someone recovering from a car incident and whip those nasty snakes and bats ‘till they die and (hopefully) drop some gold coins. Then there’s the inventory screen with lots of frightening empty space. And a special tab for software management of your notebook. No, not that real one, but an in-game one, which Kosugi uses in his adventures. There’s lots of different software throughout the game that you will pick up in dark corners, but only few may be active at a time, because Mobile Super X has only 1 gigabyte of storage. Player has to choose from such stuff as map display, email client for receiving messages from certain NPC or even decrypt ancient glyphs. To make things even worse, there are 12 program combinations with extra properties like additional invincibility frames after receiving damage. And believe me, you’ll want those frames by the time you’ll get both so-important apps.Actually you’ll want anything that’ll help even a bit. Oh, those precious bullets for your gun, that almighty destroyer of bosses, they’ll cost a pretty penny, but are so worth it. So, you’ll save and collect, get better weapons, protective items, learn better tricks. And every bit will seem so tiny and insignificant, but in the end you’ll face the hardest challenges and overcome them. And that will be rewarding. La-Mulana isn’t something I would recommend to a stranger. It’s easy to overlook the game’s virtues, especially when learning curve is rather steep. Nonetheless it’s a masterpiece on its own merits. Engaging story, gloomy setting, stupendous world and painstakingly hard puzzles make a combination so monolithic and grandiose, that I just have no other choice but admire it.			"

												To be honest, this is a ""mixed feelings"" review. I've enjoyed La-Mulana to an extent, but not nearly enough to recommend it to anyone. You can get a good idea of how this game's like from the other reviews and I doubt I'll be able to change your mind about anything, but I do have some points that I feel haven't been emphasized enough.The game itself is easy enough to understand: it's a Metroidvania title with heavy emphasis on exploration and puzzle solving; save for the bosses, the enemies are only there so you have something to whack as you explore the place. However, while most games hand you a cake and tell you to have fun with it, La-Mulana gives you the cake recipe in Hebraic, divided into 4 sections whose order you're not quite sure, and actively tries to stop you from getting the ingredients. La-Mulana is maddeningly hard, though very little of that difficulty comes from the actual gameplay - it's easy enough once you get used to the purposefully clunky controls. The true beast are the puzzles. The first few areas are manageable and straightforward enough, and it's a blast to figure out a hard riddle by yourself, but as the game goes on, the game gets astoundingly open-ended, the map is of little to no use, the puzzle clues become more cryptic and spread farther apart, sometimes not even in the same area as the puzzle they're referring to, vital items are hidden behind unmarked walls, certain items can be lost forever... The great feeling of working out a couple of mysteries by yourself is slowly but surely supplanted by the feeling of being swamped by barely coherent riddles and absurd moon logic, not to mention the fact that some of the solutions require off-the-wall stuff that you have absolutely no reason to even think they'd be feasible; one of the puzzles requires you to press Down on an unmarked spot, the riddle of which mentions ""you should have the courage to get down on bent knee to look for a single item"", and another requires you to equip a woman's statue and do nothing on a room with a mural of a man for about 30 seconds, upon which the statue will magically get pregnant. The reasoning? ""Woman within the man should be with child"". Look, I love me some puzzles and puzzle games, Layton is one of my favorite series for that reason, but La Mulana quickly devolves into nonsense that I'm pretty sure NO ONE in their right mind could possibly figure out on their own. There's ""tricky"", and then there's ""old Sierra game logic"".			"

												If you've ever wanted a game where you absolutely need a pen and notepad to keep track of clever and well thought out clues you find on your adventure, this is for you. With that said the game is a huge challenge that many wont make it through. You will get stuck on a boss, you will get hopelessly lost, you will be thinking of clues when you're not even exploring.La-Mulana offers a truly great and fulfilling gameplay experience to any player that dares enter.The is a remake, the original is out there for free.

												La-Mulana is the truly realized potential of the adventure genre. The story is strong and the lore is rich, but none of it is forcibly shoved down your throat. The puzzles are deep and meaningful, and every puzzle in the game has a hint or two hidden away somewhere among the game's many ancient tablets, but nothing is ever spelled out completely. The variety of intimidating bosses are tough and require practice to beat, but there's always a way to make them easier if you're stuck, by exploring and finding items that give you an advantage. The controls are restrictive and will require effort to master, but the platforming never demands anything unreasonable.That's the key word when it comes to La-Mulana: effort. Absolutely nothing is given to you for free. Anything you get out of La-Mulana, even how much fun you have playing it, is dependent on how much effort you're willing to put into it. And no game rewards effort quite like La-Mulana. When you finally solve that deeply meaningful puzzle that spans the entire ruins, you feel like a genius, and when your reward is an incredibly powerful weapon, you feel like a god. When you finally obliterate, yes, obliterate the guardian of that treasure, you feel like a boss, and when your reward is nothing less than the second half of the bloody game, you feel like you really are the Chosen One.La-Mulana is not just an adventure, it's a full-scale epic. This is one of the longest indie games you'll ever play, yet it remains engaging throughout and retains its replay value without leaning on any rogue-like elements whatsoever. The game's art and soundtrack embrace this, making everything seem larger than you, but also setting a very driving and elevating mood. If you're a master of Metroidvanias and think the game is too easy, there's a kinda sorta but not really hidden Hard Mode, and an actually hidden optional dungeon, recommended for masochists only; that's not a facetious remark. Luckily for most of you, you don't miss out on any of the game's good points by passing it up.Often, you'll see people describe any indie platformer that's even slightly harder than Mario Bros. as being like ""2D Dark Souls."" It's stupid, I hate it, and I stop reading reviews when I see it, but if there ever were a game that deserved that title, it would be La-Mulana. But unlike Dark Souls, I would recommend everyone play this game, not just people who want to be able to brag to all of their internet non-friends about how they ""beat 2D Dark Souls.""			"

												Not Recommeded doesn't mean the game isn't good.Now that I finally beat the game, I can say I HATE it.I tried my best not to.At first the puzzle is really fun, and it got harder and harder; by harder I mean the game give me less clue for the next puzzle, eventually to the point where I start to randomly do stupid things and hope it trigger some random switch, and I'm pretty certain some of them are clueless, it become more and more unfair I just can't enjoy it anymore.I spent around 70 hours try to beat this game without reading a guide, to the point I start to hate it; I decided to read some, and then hate it even more.Some of them even I read the guide I still not quite understand how it works, even in the wiki said you have to read game manual to understand them; that's how unfair it is.It means if you really want to play a blind-run you have to do something like use some item in every part of the map.My only advise if you really want to try this game out is; don't restrict yourself from reading a guide too much, it will eventually ruin your fun at some point. If you can't figure something out, and you think you waste too much time trying to solve it, just read some guide, you might end up love the game instead.I complete 80-85% without a guide and I don't feel proud at all, I just feel stupid, I should've start reading a guide sooner.These puzzles are not impossible to solve, I know I can do it myself but it would takes 20+ more hours, it's not worth the effort at all.But as I stated above, this game is nowhere near bad. I'm pretty surprised how detailed it is.Intersting characters and story, map is interesting to explore at all stage, etc.			"

												La Mulana is.... an unfortunate game. It is very interesting and has a lot of potential, but it commits many gaming sins that can't be overlooked. This is a NES era kind of game that is designed to force you to use some kind of guide when playing it (think castlevania 2). If you respond to this, don't just say 'the game is supposed to be hard'. Dark Souls is my favorite game; I know the difference between a game that is difficult because it's designed well, and a game that is difficult because it is designed badly. -Very little feedback is given for many of the puzzles. Many times if you solve a puzzle, the game simply doesn't show you what exactly you unlocked, or where. Sometimes solving a puzzle in one area will unlock a door or something in an entirely different area. -Although clues are given, many aren't helpful or refer to something in a later area. Once you get to that area, there is no indication that you needed to use a clue from earlier.-There are several points in the game where no clues are given for progression. Several times it is necessary to walk through illusionary walls, or break floors/walls to continue, with no indication you need to do so. You are left jumping around constantly attacking everything in the hope you will accidentally solve a 'puzzle'. -The above point wouldn't be a problem if the game didn't frequently PUNISH you for trial and error. Yes, there are many rooms in the game where, if you attack random walls, lightning strikes your character and does a substantial amount of damage. The game teaches you quickly not to attack random things, but then at other times the only way to continue is to know where to do it. I have died many times, just attacking random walls to see if they would crumble, only to find out that I was indeed supposed to attack a specific part of a wall; but no indication was given to do so. -Unfair instant death traps and rooms that you simply become 'stuck' in. There are many rooms that just kill you, and other ones that just trap you, forcing you to restart from your last save if you don't have specific items. -Some puzzles don't reset. Make a mistake and you can never get the item. There are only a few of these, but there isn't any indication that the puzzle will be like this. Once again, the game punishes trial and error. Fortunately, I think they only do this with non-essential items. -The game doesn't control well enough for some of the fast-paced action segments they throw at you. Boss battles typically aren't hard for any reason other than your character moves slowly and doesn't control in the air well. If anyone ever tells you that they beat this game without ever consulting a guide or asking for help, they are lying. I really wanted to like this game; thematically it is amazing, and I love this style of metroidvania action-adventure. I find myself being forced to use a guide all too often, and it really ruins the gaming experience (seriously, some of these 'puzzles' are just impossible unless you know exactly what to do beforehand). If you really like games like castlevania 2, or don't mind having a guide open during your playthrough, then La Mulana might be for you. Otherwise, stay away.			"

												La-Mulana is a mix of heavy platforming, Metroid-esque map and exploration and Indiana-Jonesing ruin exploration. With a penchant for PUNISHING you for the slightest mistakes.You get items to progress, have to decipher codes and solve riddles to open new areas, find secret places and doors (which are REALLY well hidden), place weights on switches and not get crushed by Montezuma's face/a smirking sun statue/boulders/stone hand sentries/et cetera. All the while trying to eat a curry bowl and whip a freaking bat while throwing ninja stars.Did I mention you shouldn't get crushed?			"

												I finally beat it. Steam says I have 110 hours played. There's an in-game clock, too, which says 25.5 hours on one file (which I abandoned a few years ago when I got stuck) and 30.5 hours on another file (played through to the end).That leaves 54 hours unaccounted for. That time was spent:- dying- searching for answers but not getting anywhere- writing extensive notes & maps, in what ended up being a 40+ page Google doc- transcribing every tablet, and every name of every room, because it's often important- reading and trying to make sense of those notes- reading the manual... again- learning and translating La-Mulana script- getting utterly frustrated and resorting to a walkthrough in a few places, even though I didn't want toAnd it was all worth it. Despite the cryptic hints and the wandering non-linear structure, it feels wonderful to solve those puzzles and beat those bosses.No, it's not for everyone, but it's unlike any game I've ever played and I highly recommend it. If you're still interested after reading all that, then give it a shot. The ruins are waiting.			"

												'Be sure to play through, or clear in hard mode, or give up.' --excerpt from La-Mulana manual This is in a nutshell what the devs think about this game and about you, the player. They don't care if you give up or dislike their game. They made their piece of art and it's up for grabs. Take it if you can stomach it. Game is hardcore and doesn't hide it's true nature in any way. Game even tricks the player to activate HARD MODE if players behave 'business as usual' and ignore warnings and instructions.  Many times the game anticipates the reactions of players and taunts you accordingly.  As for me i seriously doubt i will ever complete this game. i have beaten just 2 guardians and even then it was tough as nails and paid a heavy price for it which might just mean i won't be doing so well with later bosses. (revolver ammo is life)Game is a very JPN thing even though protagonist looks and behaves like Indiana Jones. Punishing game play, punishing bosses show you that this is no cake-walk modern gamers are used to. And do you really think you are a good puzzle solver? this game will put you to the test. better bring your pen and paper as some notes are just so cryptic and they are all important in some way or other. In this level or the one next to this one.  "

												La-Mulana is brutal.  It will do nothing to help you if you are stuck; everything you need is in the game in the form of tablets marked with obscure riddles or prose that you either need to find or need to decipher in the same manner as an actual archaeologist would.A great example is how I played the game for about 10 hours on my first playthrough without having found the warping item (which is in the very first area) that's absolutely necessary for decent progress.  The game didn't stop my progress and inform me that I was missing something.  In fact, aside from one dead end, I could have stumbled through the whole game without this warping item (and I'm fairly certain that with planning you could even circumvent this).Even in the midst of those 10 grueling hours (where I had to grind on enemies to heal instead of warping to the hot springs which heal you fully), I still felt La-Mulana was something very special, and that feeling greatly intensified when I started a fresh second playthrough and went further into the game.  I think it might actually be my absolute favorite 2D adventure game, and I say that as a very encompassing statement (including all your Zelda's, Metroid's, etc.).It made me think more than even any cut-and-dry puzzle game I've ever played has made me think.  I couldn't solve all the puzzles on my own- I will readily admit that.  It doesn't do anything to diminish my opinion of the game- everything you need to solve anything is available if you have the brain and willpower to figure it out.  Some of it is incredibly obscure and difficult to figure out, but I'd imagine if you asked an actual archaeologist how hard his job is, they'd say it's a lot harder than La-Mulana (maybe this is actually a sim game?)Add a layer of amazing combat and action on top of that, with lots of huge boss battles, and it's what I'd consider perfection.  People criticize the jumping mechanic.  That would be like criticizing the jumping in Castlevania; it's a short-sighted complaint, because the game is 100% built around the limited control.  Everything in La-Mulana is hand-crafted beauty, please buy this.			"

												La-Mulana is an exploration based sidescroller platforming Metroidvania that was the inspiration for one of my favorite games, Spelunky, so I knew I had to give it a play.After a fairly slow start I found the game to be pretty engaging. The controls are very strange, with movement being very jerky and not my usual thing, but I got used to it and was enjoying it despite. I was happily wandering the ruins, solving puzzles, and slaying monsters.I fought a boss while riding through caves on a cart, Ellmac, which was pretty difficult and frustrating but I figure that was my fault for doing it (probably) so early with such poor gear, so it gets a pass. I die after him though in the new area so I figure I'll come back later.So far the game was shaping up to be better than I expected! I was wondering where I should go next, so I figured I'd head to the Temple of Moonlight. I'd found it before but always died early inside it, so I was putting it off.In I go and I get to dungeoneering. Can't attack while inside? Got it. New items, puzzles, and all that jazz... great! But where's the save point? I was very close to death when I finally found it. Phew!Now how do I get out of this place? I spend maybe an hour or so wandering the areas I'd already been, finding a secret weapon, but can't for the life of me figure out how to escape. I love playing games blind, so I leave the game for a bit to ruminate on the area and see if I can think of something I missed.When I come back, I explore everything one last time, smacking all the walls and trying my best to find anything I missed. Eventually I break, and I have to look up what the deal is. It shouldn't be so hard to leave the area - after all, I have the map, so I know where all the rooms are...I'm permanently stuck in the Temple of Moonlight because I didn't pick up the Holy Grail earlier. Apparently there are several locations in the game where this can happen. In a game about exploration, you can get permanently stuck for apparently exploring in the wrong order. The game doesn't indicate that one area should be explored before another, or that you have to have this item before you should continue on. The item is hidden too, a puzzle that I had seen but was unable to solve and put off until later.How is this acceptable design? I was enjoying the game despite the other flaws, but that crosses a line. Maybe it's a fundamental difference in the way Japanese and Westerners design and enjoy their games, but I don't have the time or want to be forced to restart a long-winded game due to game breaking scenarios that are beyond my control.If you are new to La-Mulana, get the Holy Grail before you explore anywhere, or your game might just end early... and you'll be left very wanting.

												Your usual Metroidvania platformer on the outside, much more inside.La-Mulana is extremely hard. Not even do you require good platforming skills, but you also need to be good at puzzle solving. Taking notes on your adventure is highly recommended, even if some things don't seem to be important.With that being said about the game, let's go a little more into detail:Story:  There's barely anything to say here. You play as Lemeza Kosugi and explore ancient ruins. You find a few people close to the ruins, but only talk to their elder ever so often, he provides some advice, and later explains a few things. But there barely is more to say about the plot. But there's a lot of additional lore, and nearly every single area of the ruins has their own story to tell, if you're careful around your surroundings. After some game time, you find out that you have to kill the 8 guardians and apparently the ""Mother"", and that's about all you get as your target.Gameplay:  Lemeza Kosugi controls pretty precisely, once you get the hang of it. Only downside is that if you walk as you jump, you can't control the jump at all anymore. If you jump while standing still it's possible though, so once you get used to it, it's okay.Over the course of the game, you'll find different upgrades, such as a double jump, stronger attacks, new weapons and sub-weapons. The usual things you can expect from a Metroidvania.There are no lifes, once you die, it's game over. The only way to refill your HP is by either resting in the hot springs, or collecting a certain amount of life orbs, and once that life orb meter fills completely, your HP are filled up completely, and your orb meter is back to 0. You also need to collect more orbs the more HP you have.There is no such thing as Experience Points and level ups, the only way to get more HP is to find their respective upgrades.The normal enemies, and the areas aren't too difficult, especially once you get the ability to teleport, and you can always teleport back to the first area and refill your HP in the hot springs, though it is a little annoying.Speaking of teleporting, you can teleport to certain checkpoints, where you can also save your game, pretty early in the game, so it helps moving through the ruins, since backtracking is also quite a thing here.There are many mini- and mainbosses, and most of them are really, really challenging.Enemies also drop gold, and you actually need it to buy necessary items in the game.Those are your usual metroidvania things, but there's more here:First of all, you've got a virtual computer with you. and as you play you find software for it. You can only activate a few softwares at once. Those softwares allow simple things such as having a map, or being able to read the ancient language, up to helpful things as having more invincibility frames after being hit, or doing more damage with certain weapons.Then there are puzzles... They start off from rather simple things as destroying walls to reach new objects or your usual switch puzzles... up to things like understanding the ancient language partly yourself. And that's rather difficult. And saying any more would be spoiling too much. Let me just say, some of the puzzles can be extremely cryptic, and will take some time to figure out, especially because you need to solve nearly all of them to finish the game.Graphics:  Nothing special, but it all looks very well done in the 16-bit style the game is.Sound:  The background music is very nice and sets the tone for each area and situation. The sound effects aren't anything special, they're okay.The game will probably take about 30-40 hours in your first playthrough if you don't look anything up.So, if you like the genre in any way, I'd recommend to try La-Mulana at least out for the rather cheap price!

												The fact that games like this can still exist in this day and age fills me with nothing but gratitude. Here's a game with copious amounts of content, hard bosses that actually surprised me with their quality, gorgeous retro graphics that I just eat up like so much curry, and detail detail detail. Unfortunately, this is the kind of game where discovery and puzzle solving is a big part of the experience, which means you'll have the most fun on your first playthrough. Subsequent playthroughs will likely lose some of the enjoyment. But hey, that's why we're getting La-Mulana 2 soon!My only other small gripe is the music. I love the tunes, but the majority of the mix is sustained notes that really tend to wear on the ears after awhile. They're also kinda short, so they'll be looping quite often. However, they do a great job of pumping you up for these dangerous and mysterious ruins. I just kinda wonder if the game would've been better with an ambiatic soundtrack. I suggest turning down the BGM to around 30 or so. No doubt, the game is worth full price. Highly recommended.  "

												If you enjoy metroidvania style gameplay and absolutely maddening puzzles, this is certainly a game you will enjoy.  As much as it made my head hurt from trying to decipher all the cryptic clues and figuring out how to progress, I enjoyed the steep difficulty curve this game's puzzles provided, for the most part.  The teleporter mazes can just go die in a fire, along with the penultimate puzzle of the game (and it was toned down from the original version too, so that really says something abou its difficulty), but other than that I had a blast with the game's puzzles.  The areas themselves aren't too bad in terms of surviving, but the bosses will push you to the limit of how well you've mastered the game's mechanics and combat.  By the time you reach the third boss, the kiddie gloves are off and it gets real tough, real quick.  If you like your games very non-linear with brutal puzzles and some really tough combat, you'll enjoy this game.  It's kind of like a 2D Dark Souls in a way, drops you into the ruins with little to no information, and you're on your own from there.If spending hours retracing your steps looking for what new paths that upgrade you just picked up opened up, or just what that seemingly useless item does isn't something that sounds like a good time, then this may not be the game for you.

												Not necessarily my particular cup of tea, but a friend recommended I try this game, and I have to say that this is one of the hardest yet addictive games I have ever played. So with it being on sale this week, I wanted to say that this one is worth every penny.It's a platform adventure game where you are exploring the ruins of La Mulana, and basically starts you off with very little. So there is a very high learning curve ---- but if you take your time and look around at everything very carefully the secrets will reveal themselves so that you can begin to move forward in the game. Just requires you to be patient.Controls are tight and very crisp yet demanding, and the art work is excellent.A very good game that will absolutely consume your time ---- it can be as hard as you want it to be ---- well worth a look, especially at this week's sale price.

												""Obtuse"" is a word that another reviewer used to describe this one, and it could very well be a one-word review. Anyhow...La-Mulana is a beautifully made game (esp. environment art, music, boss design) and has a lot of fun aspects, but in my opinion it ultimately falls victim to its own sense of smugness. I actually didn't mind the control scheme, which is essentially a modified version of Castlevania's, with weapon-specific timing, pushback when getting hit, and unalterable directional jumping (except when descending from a standstill jump). It's pretty easy to get used to if you've played enough games of that era.I also don't mind many of the ""puzzles"" (which I think could be more accurately described as riddles). What ended up nudging me toward not recommend the game was the implementation of the riddles. After about the third or fourth areas, you start finding heaps of increasingly cryptic clues that won't be introduced for nearly another whole half of the game and often refer to far-off places (also true for many diases and events which trigger distant environment changes that you subsequently have to hunt for). This is the main design element that necessitates the tedious manual note-taking that the developer gleefully encourages. It also has the effect of (rather artifically) increasing the game's perceived difficulty. To me, this didn't really have the seemingly intended effect of inspiring the required devotion of time and manual energy to figure out most of the game on my own, but instead kinda transformed the experience into what increasingly felt like a menial task. Very glad that there are a variety of guides to reduce the tedium, otherwise my patience would have worn off long before finishing the game.Glad I got it on a good sale. For now, I'm having more fun just challenging the bosses in the time attack mode.			"

												I want to like this game and I actually did for the first 25% of it, but it eventually becomes clear the idea of ""difficult"" in this game is ""needing a walkthrough"". From using items on random objects to pushing certain walls at certain times holding certain items, this game has a plethora of ""well... what now?"" style puzzles.It seems aggravating that you will have to traverse and back track every room you have ever visited because you may have collected an item which will now allow you to push a generic background brick. The game has its entire lore which never really comes into much of the logic needed when handling these nonsense puzzles. The most steadfast fans of this game laud these puzzles as only for the most hardcore, but I'm not particularly sure that is so much a positive attribute of this game as it is being an apoligist. You do not succeed in this game by being intelligent so much as just having a lot of time on your hands. The puzzles simply do not make sense and the game does not include enough information to go on. I would suspect this game was sponsored by GameFAQS if I didn't know better.On the plus side, it has great music and really does play well. The graphics are decent and the entire game story is a clever one. Everythnig about this game is great but is spoiled by the horrible puzzle design. I really don't know what to say. I cannot recommend it because while the first quarter of the game was actually fun and I really enjoyed the experience, it is quickly spoiled by the unfair and questionable ""puzzles"" that dominate the latter portion of the game. If anything get this on sale, as most people will probably get frustrated and give up and I don't think that is worth full price.			"

												To be honest: I've never finished the game. Er, I've hardly managed to beat three bosses. I got countlessly stuck, killed, frustrated.Still, I strongly recommend this game.It is an ultimate embodiment of the Metroidvania genre, probably one of the kind. Compared to it, nearly all of titles you can find with this tag are oldschool straightforward platformers. La-Mulana collects all defining staples and takes them to the extreme. Non-linear exploration, where nobody direct you by hand and you are free to choose your own walkthrough. Uniquely designed and atmospheric locations, with few features used more than once. Puzzles, not limited to ""move that crate to this button"", but requiring to look for scattered hints and think of undocumented abilities. Tons of monsters, items, skills, traps, secrets. An absolute feel of being an adventurer, a discoverer, a researcher.It's a wonderful game. It leaves you with your own skills and challenges them in every way possible. It's definitely not for everyone, and seemingly not for me, which saddens like an one-way love. Ruins of La-Mulana shine in all their cruel beauty, and a strong gamer will be worthily rewarded.			"

												I recommend La-Mulana with a lot of caveats. Keep these things in mind before you buy:1) This is a deliberately difficult and infuriatingly obtuse piece of software. A lot of people say this game is ""hard like Dark Souls,"" but that's not a very accurate comparison. La-Mulana is not Dark Souls hard, it is old school NES game hard. And when I say NES game, I mean stuff like Castlevania II: Simon's Quest and Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. Games with tough jump controls, NPCs that spout ""hints"" that are actually utter nonsense and puzzles that require you to do completely random stuff like stand in front of a wall for ten seconds until a tornado comes to whisk you away. La-Mulana REVELS in that sort of thing, and 70% of your time will be spent trying to figure out just what the heck the weird phrases on the stone tablets in each level mean.2) This is a game where you're going to need to take notes. I mean in a notebook, like it's 1988 all over again. And even if you're taking the best notes in the world, after a certain point in time you'll probably need to consult a walkthrough. Technically you COULD bumble through and figure everything out on your own, but if you want to save yourself stress and a whoooole lot of time, a walkthrough is necessary. I recommend a guy named Highwang on YouTube who's uploaded an excellent and very comprehensive Let's Play for this game. (It's worth watching even if you decide to not buy La-Mulana.)3) This is not a game that you can play for a while, leisurely put down for a few weeks, and then come back to successfully. Case in point: I was playing it heavily a month ago but then I went on vacation. Now, I have NO effing clue where to go or what to do, because the notes that I took aren't detailed enough. (I was using my phone, rather than pen & paper. La-Mulana requires a damn Moleskin, seriously.) While I probably could get my bearings if I rewatched all of Highwang's videos, a lot of my motivation to finish this game has sorta died. Ultimately, I DO like a lot of what La-Mulana has to offer. I love how it's an intentional throwback to the days when people spent months on a single game, sharing strategies with their friends and consulting Nintendo Power for secrets. The graphics are wonderful, the tributes to the MSX are charming and the fact that the main character is a Japanese Indiana Jones is great. I think everyone who was born in the 80s, thinks modern games are ""too easy"" or likes banging their head against the wall should give this a try at least once. I just don't know if I'll ever have it in me to finish it.			"

												La Mulana is a fabulous game. I wouldn't say that it's for everyone, but it was well worth my time.Before you start playing, I would recommend reading the manual or  watching their tutorial video before playing. There's a few things that frustrate new players that they cover.La Mulana expects you to bring a notepad along, but there is a shortcut--you can take screenshots, and look them over when you are trying to figure something out. Once you've left the first area, there are very few tablets that are not referring to some puzzle somewhere. Even the lore tablets usually come with something relating to a clue.If you ever find yourself stuck on something, or wondering if you need something, and don't have any friends to ask for minimal spoilers, I cannot recommend using Cheshire's Hint Based Guide to La-Mulana enough. Unlike resorting to the wiki, where you are practically guaranteed to have the puzzle solved for you, without explanation why that's the solution, Cheshire put in a lot of work to make the guide have hints, with multiple levels of spoilers, including a text dump from the relevant tablets (if they aren't near by), until actually telling you what must be done after a few spoiler tags.

The riddles are hard. The controls are somewhat hard to learn at the beginning, but if you're getting a hang on it, it's not a big deal. Consider playing the game without a guide for the first time. Even though it's hard to know what you need to do next, it feels rewarding as soon as you hear that beautiful chime of the Shell Horn. What are you waiting for? Get the game and go, explore the gigantic ruins of La-Mulana.			"

I dont think I have died this may time in any other game (may be equal to Super Ghouls & Ghost). I have to admit, it was so satisfying to see the end credits!! This is a must play for any hardcore gamer who likes old platform games. La Mulana has very hard puzzles to solve. READ ALL the TABLETS. I bet most casual gamers would hate this game, it is NOT forgiving. This game is like Dark Souls if it came out 20 years ago on Super Nintento. I highly recommend you take notes as you play and even draw simple maps on paper with the exits. The ""ingame"" map is very basic, the exits are indicated with red arrows and does not tell you what the exit is. The levels in La Mulana are huge and it is very easy to forget where the exits are. I spent endless hours wondering around to find the ""New"" exit somewhere that was unlocked.  I give this a 10/10. Atmosphere, music, controls and story are amazing!! La Mulana 2 is on its way...... I cant wait to die and get lost again for hours on end.			"

												Don't buy this game if you like completing games, because you wont. That's not a challenge, it's a warning. You won't beat this game. Ever. You won't even make it to the 35% mark. Not even if puzzle platformers are your fave genre. This game will remind you why you prefer to start on easy-mode and cheese bosses. This game will remind you that your place is in the kitchen and not on the list of global steam achievements.Pretty sure this game was intended to be a community effort. You absolutely need a guide to get anywhere in this game. It's competely filled with puzzles you'd never solve on your own. Yea, really. I don't care how clever you think you are it'd take you years of journaling and backtracking to finish this game without help. Even using help online this game is still a major challenge. At nearly 70 hours I'm only beginning to recognize the scope of this game. It's enourmous and complicated. I can't recommend this game to anyone except the insane and the insanely curious. La Mulana is a well-crafted and finely polished puzzle platformer/metroidvania-like on the grandest scale.. but it's just too much. They went too deep on this one. A little dissapointed and salty that I had to put it down, but congrats to the devs for having the cojones to sell a game that an extremely small number of people could beat.			"

Falling into traps and nearly making it out by the skin of your teeth.La-Mulana is BALLS HARD and it is not for those who don't know how to stay on track or easily lost.

A professional....Well, not as Professional as your dad but you will get there in time.Collect relics across your journey deep within the ruins. Power your character up by destroying enemies and collecting green orbs left behind. Only way to heal a wounded adventurer in this game is a one simple hotspring and trust me. If your a newbie at this game. You bet your♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that its going to be the #1 spot to go to when your one hit away from death.Also don't be ashamed at saving alot. You are going to have to. You see further into the game about 30 mins in you would get your first relic that lets you teleport to the Save Points Tablets hidden throughout the game.

												La-Mulana is one of my personal favorite games, and probably one of the best designed games I've ever played. It is meticulously detailed in every nook and cranny, gorgeously diverse areas with a wonderful pixel art aesthetic, and sublime mythology. And a ♥♥♥♥ing incredible soundtrack. It is clear to me that this is a game born out of love for the medium. It is an incredible experience for anyone willing to give it a shot. In La-Mulana, you play as an archeology teacher named Lemenza Kosugi, and you explore a metroidvania style labrinyth called La-Mulana. La-Mulana is not an easy game, but not in the conventionally difficult manner that you expect in mechanics driven games like Dark Souls or Dustforce. The puzzles are the hard part, not the combat (though the combat does have some pretty difficult battles it's nothing compared to the puzzles). La-Mulana asks an awful lot of the player's critical and abstract thinking skills and is best played with a notebook next to you jotting down connections between what a puzzle tablet tells you and how it relates to another environment of the ruins. It's best to take a record of every tablet you come across that seems like it could answer a puzzle, as it cuts back on backtrack time. The game is tailor made for intuitive individuals; by this I mean people who easily draw connections between ideas and easily see 'hidden meaning' behind related strings of text or imagery. It's a game that asks the player to view it holistically- you must understand the iconography and backstory of the labryinth to progress further into the game. You can't get by with just combat prowess. If you're looking for a Metal Gear Rising, this is not it. La-Mulana's combat isn't complex.Once you get into the mind-first groove of La-Mulana, it becomes an experience so ridiculously satisfying and detailed that it's hard not to fall in love. The first hours will throw you off because the game feels fairly unconventional, but once you learn to think in riddles like the game wants you to, its absolutely wonderful. La-Mulana is a game made entirely of 'Aha!' moments that happen every 15 minutes. If I were to sum up La-Mulana, I'd do it like so.La-Mulana is a game that will reject you, kick you in the face, spit on you, laugh at your failure, giggle as it throws cryptically worded puzzles at you, and congratulate you for finally figuring out how its cryptic puzzles operate. And then it makes the puzzles much more complex and laughs at you again. But it's all in good fun! Difficulty is what makes games interesting. If a game is not very hard, you'll probably get bored, right? I will warn that La-Mulana is not a game for the impatient gamer. The game is around 40-45 hours long, and much of that time will be spent in anguish that you're missing a crucial detail of a puzzle or failing to comprehend a sentence. If you're not willing to sit down and understand how the game works, it's going to be an absolutely terrible experience for you. It's not going to be fun at all. If you're the type of gamer who doesn't like often obtuse directions, then La-Mulana will be infurating and you'll probably trash it within 4 hours. You might even go on a message board and say the game isn't even worth a dollar, but we both know that's not true! I implore the impatient to stick with it. It's ♥♥♥♥ing great. Better than Super Metroid great, and it takes an awful lot to be better than Super Metroid. Play it. And not for a dollar like they offer in sales either, pay full price for it. It's worth it. If there's one thing I don't like about the remake compared to the original, I'd say the soundtrack is slightly weaker in the remake. Perhaps that's because I'm biased to the bleeps and bloops. It's fixable with some modulation and a quick google search, however.			"

												La-Mulana is the absolute best metroidvania game out there, but it only really opens up to those who really get into it. The game isn't especially difficult due to tough platforming or boss battles, but instead its intricate riddles that revolve around the game's world-design. On one hand the feeling of getting stuck without knowing where to go or not understanding a riddle might be discouraging, but the rewarding feeling of truly outsmarting the game is almost unparalleled. I could go on and on about the soundtrack, the polish in world design, the amount of content and all that jazz, but if the core part of solving riddles doesn't appeal to you, or you know you lack patience/attention span to really get deep into a game, this might not be a game for you. P.S My first blind playthrough took 104h.			"

												The word “difficult” gets thrown around a lot, but La-Mulana is not difficult. La-Mulana is simply obtuse. I went in expecting deep, challenging combat and mind-bending puzzles. This game has neither. Stuck on a puzzle? The solution is to have the right item, located five zones away.That's the entire game really- Collect item A to get item B to acquire item C. This is nothing but a daisy chain of fetch quests. I got 35 hours into it before I burned out. Boss battles and mini-bosses are fun, but not very complex. Bosses are always best defeated with slow, boring attrition, and mini-bosses are easily killed by spam.TL;DR: Not hard. Obtuse grind disguised as depth.			"

This is. By far. The single hardest game I have ever played.Not because of the platforming.Not because of the bosses.But because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ puzzles.Ever watch Indiana Jones? Everyone remembers three things: The fedora, the whip, and the ridiculous archeological puzzles.You see, Indie is an archeologist. Lemuza is an archeologist. YOU are (probably) NOT an archeologist.And even if you were, the (extremely well written) mythology is entirely made up.You will NEED a notepad. You see, there is a reason why the best guide for this game is a wiki. I cannot imagine a single person ever figuring this game out by themselves.This is the kind of game that will tell you some obscure mythological hint about, for example, where to find a key. The key is ""where the woman points to the star."" You will find ANOTHER tablet in ANOTHER zone that will say ""the goddess of the sun shows herself as a snake."" And yet it an ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ZONE you will find ANOTHER mural of a snake pointing towards the sun, which is a star. BOOM. That's all the help you'll get, then of course you need to navigate to where the hell you're going to get that item. You might need three items to break the block to reveal the murals that need to be read in a specific order in an entirely different made up language.You see, I clocked in 14:44:26 hours... in game.My ACTUAL time was 40 hours. 14 hours is a testament to how many times I died/had to reset.However. This is one of the top five games I have ever played. There are many routes to the same ending, it is the ultimate example of a metroidvania. METROID isn't even nearly as good level design as this game. It is, by all means, flawless.I highly, highly, recommend this game. It is long, it is hard, but it is one of the most rewarding and fun experiences I have ever had.			"

												I've been putting this review off for such a long time that the .txt file on my desktop has been gathering dust. But that's just the thing: This game, despite my utter hatred for it, still left a deep impact (or stab wound rather) on me and it has become essential for me to voice my opinion. What is there to say that hasn't already been said about the controls? They're downright awful. Lemeza floats like a butterfly when he jumps, but carries the momentum of a cannonball when you flutter over to the next screen. Often times, this led me to smash the arrow keys in the opposite direction in a futile attempt to correct my ever so graceful jump and avoid unforseen hazards. Unfortuantely for Lemeza, he would only look the other direction as he was flung into a lava pool or spike pit. However, strangely enough, if you jump straight up into the air, then use WASD mid jump, you become liberated from these cruel forces of momentum. Apparently, Nigoro wasn't going for realistic jump physics then, so what's the point of punishing the player for taking mandated leaps of faith?I could go on about the controls (frequently, I would reset from my last save point than try to get out of water or lava. It was just simpler than trying to jump out of the liquids) but I need to talk about the actual origin of this game. You see, I'm with Nigoro for bringing back challening, MSX-era puzzle platformers. I love games like this. However, if you want to resuscitate the genre (and do a remake no less!), there's no need to keep primitive controls, limited save points, unforgiveably bad physics, and, possibly the worst offender, long walks back to boss fights. When I lose to a boss, I want to get right back into the fight, not drag my knuckles in shame across seven screens (Usually taking damage before the fight, and maybe failing a few platform jumps) to have another go. There is so little polish in these details that it's offensive. They are hideous warts on an already dead and bloated frog.As long as I'm talking about boss fights, why is it that they feel so unrewarding? Most games of this genre will offer you a new weapon or health upgrade after sticking it to one of these big baddies. What's the usual boss reward in La-Mulana? An unlocked door in a far flung corridor, or a shortcut leading to somewhere you've already been. Not to mention that nearly every boss in this game is a variation on ""Equip best weapons and whack them in the face"". Sure, the bosses are visually appealing and they terrifyingly tower over Lemeza, but when I can scour the ruins for all the health ups (or just use the ♥♥♥♥ing gun! Why on earth would you include a super powerful weapon like this? Once the player farms money, they can pay their way through boss fights!) and fling myself over and over at the guardins until they submit, it doesn't feel rewarding in the least. In fact, it proves again how little polish went into this game. I don't want to talk about the puzzles in the La-Mulana too much; The game itself certainly doesn't address them. If you want to solve most of these esoteric and far fetched enigmas, you're probably going to wind up on the FAQ, which, in adventure games, I consider to be the equivalent of inviting a sweaty man from the internet come over and help you pee. It IS indeed an apt comparision because puzzles should flow naturally into the game, not impede you until you figure out the solution. I get that this was common in past eras of gaming, but we've since grown up. It's another blemish on the bronze aged face of gaming that can remain in antiquity. And when you do cave to use the FAQ, the solution to the puzzle in your way will cause you to exclaim one of two things:""That's so simple, how could I not figure that out!?""Or""How are you supposed to know this!?""All in all, La-Mulana will make your blood boil and fill your swear jar. It's not a game: It's a chore. A highly complicated chore that just doesn't feel worth doing. Like giving a playground bully an emergency appendectomy only to have him kick sand in your eye afterwards. Play the original game on an emulator; You'll conserve a lot of time and frustration by using save states. Not to mention that the original has throwback graphics and 8 bit music. These are the things from old gaming that have actually aged well. And get this: With simplistic graphics, some of the puzzles are actually easier in the original version since there's less clutter. They're still hard, but at least you'll feel like you're walking through a piece of history than play this version. "

												One of the best metroidvanias of these days. It has a lot of places to explore, dozens of puzzles(some will feel unfair but you can solve them if you have really good memory and time to revisit all the places you've been before). There are good jokes and the game has a few very good boss fights.The best part of the game is that you can go wherever you want and no one will stop you or tell you you're doing all wrong.			"

												This is on my top... 3 games of all time. It's definitely not for everyone. Its a great action platformer, and a great puzzler, but the combination of the two is what makes it genius. If difficult, often-bizzare puzzles are not for you, the game stands on it's own as an action platformer, as you can just look up the solutions to the puzzles (this should be avoided though, if possible - the puzzles are part of the greatness).The music is gorgeous. The artwork is gorgeous (particularly minibosses/bosses). Animation is great. Writing is great - game is both very dark, yet full of humor. This game is literally worth $200. $15 is a steal. If you enjoy platformers, and don't mind putting on your thinking cap (and bringing along a pen and paper to take notes!), you should stop reading this and just buy it, you won't regret it.There are not many games of this genre that truly last 30-50 hours. I cannot think of one. The value is immense.Edit:So 9 months later - oh my god. La-Mulana. The greatest. Still, I wanted to touch on something that I briefly mentioned in my initial review, but didn't elaborate enough into.[/b] When it comes to La-Mulana, you either 'get it' or you don't. Now don't get me wrong - it's got nothing to do with how ""sophisticated"" one's tastes are or anything like that. Those arguments are always meaningless. Rather, La-Mulana is a flawed game in many aspects.I know plenty of people who don't dig the game, and they can usually list off a bunch of minor (but valid) gripes. Sometimes, someone might even have a major criticism regarding the design of the game. I'll be honest - I end up discounting those opinions of just not 'getting it', since they're usually related to the fundamental design of the game (""It's like, too big and confusing, and they don't give any direction"").While I'm not a fan of those crticisms, I absolutely can acknowledge others. It is true - the game is not for everyone, like I said at the start. You might not like it for perfectly valid reasons. Now if you do like it? You will love it. It'll literally blow your mind, like it blew mine. It seems to me that most people either play 4 hours or less of La-Mulana, or they play 30+ hours. Again - you 'get it' or you don't. Movies and other forms of media can be the exact same way - some people will walk out of a film that others will watch hundreds of times. On top of that, this is a cult classic we're dealing with. Expect most fans who love it to rave about it, and nearly everyone else to not understand what all the fuss is about. As far as raving goes, here's mine: Think -  have you ever loved something so much that you're almost frustrated that more people don't understand how incredible it is? Movies, books, songs, games... you name it - I'm sure there's something that you feel that way about. That's how I feel about La-Mulana. To me, it is the most incredible, genius, outstanding, ""best game of all time"" contending game I've played in years. I implore everyone to at least check this out (ideally when it's on sale for like $3, even though I think it's worth $200), see if it's for you. Most people probably won't be into it. They  won't dislike the game - they'll just be indifferent. ""Eh, it's good, but I don't see why it's the greatest game of all time and could possibly be the messiah in gaming form."" Perfectly understandible - but if you are among us few who's brains are for some reason wired to adore this twisted monster of a game, it might literally change your life.			"

												Indiana Jones simulator. Explore ruins, find items, solve puzzles, fight hordes of monsters and wake ancient guardians up only to put them into eternal slumber.La-Mulana is extremely hard (and even harder with hard mode active), unfair, unforgiving and even punishing at times. And that's why it is loved. The controls, the graphics and the soundtrack are all pure gold and can't get better than this.All puzzles are solvable with the hints in game. Pay attention, take notes, scan everything! Too bad sometimes the hints are way too vague (or just blatant lies) and you will end up resorting to a walkthrough at some point.Using a gamepad is advisable.			"

												La-Mulana is a side-scrolling platformer game that pits you against a sprawling, convoluted temple filled with monsters, traps, and puzzles. This game requires patience, determination, memory, and puzzle-solving skills above all else.The combat is simple but solid; Initially, you are only provided with a whip with which to dispatch a vast array of enemies and bosses, but later you unlock many different sub-weapons and main weapons with different attack styles.The way you learn to move your character, Lemeza, over the course of the game becomes a refined art. It feels odd at first, but once you get used to the quirks, you learn how to use them to your benefit and further explore the ruins.Solving puzzles in this game feels incredibly rewarding, because often the solutions are only presented to you if you are paying very close attention to everything you encounter. It pays to have a pen and paper available to jot down every little thing you see.A word of warning: Throughout the course of this game, you may very well find yourself stuck and in need of guidance - and that's okay. It's happened to me, plenty. If you find yourself in this situation, rather than find a complete walkthrough, it's best if you use it to find the solution to one or two major puzzles which will hopefully then point you in the right direction to continue your adventuring unaided. You can always backtrack later, once you've gotten well and truly stuck again.If you purchase La-Mulana then you should keep in mind that it can be very frustrating, especially at the beginning, but if you persevere you will find that this is actually a beautifully constructed game with plenty of love and attention to detail poured into it.Definitely worth getting.

												Hoo boy; what to say about La-Mulana... (TLDR see bottom)There is no question in my mind that this game is very well polished and complete in its entirety. It has an awesome soundtrack, excellent platforming elements, a wide-array of weapons, and the few characters in the game are very loveable. La-Mulana puzzles are deliberately unfair, obscure, and require either a RIDICULOUS amount of hours (I am talking like... 100+), or the use of a FAQ to finish without going insane. It is a Japanese Platformer, meaning the game requires utter devotion from you, or some outside knowledge to enjoy completely.Let me outline this for you - unless you want the make La-Mulana the thesis statement of your life you WILL NOT beat it without a FAQ or without help - here's why:-The game starts off completely solvable (I managed to clear many of the first areas without help)-Puzzles remain contained AT FIRST, limiting solutions and ""cause and effect"" action to within zones-The game VERY long for a platformer.Things obscure as READING something in one part of the ruins may unlock an entire way to go in another part. It's true, the game drops all sorts of hints and things, and it is definitely possibly to trace some sort of information to almost every puzzle... but let's face it - are you really going to remember a sentence of text you read at hour 5 for hour 55? Of course the logical solution would be then to write it down - I did that... my word document is roughly twenty pages (single spaced) long. Even Ctrl-F can't save me from my own notes!But at the end of the day I can't really dislike La-Mulana for being frustrating... that's kind of why I bought it in the first place. One thing that drove me crazy is that although you have awesome platforming abilities in the game, it is ultimately a puzzle game, meaning those abilities are often left on the pause screen while you pull out your hair thinking of how to progress further. On the bright side, all of the bosses and enemy placement seems to be excellent.So if you are in the mood to spend endless hours (I am serious... 100+) wandering some virtual hallways jiving to some catchy music, you may just be THAT person who beats La-Mulana without a FAQ. Or... being rational, you can swallow your pride, progress as far as possible alone, and then use a FAQ whenever hope is lost.I enjoyed this game; but I wouldn't only recommend it the majority with the use of a FAQ.TLDR: Game's really long, esoteric puzzles, good music, good enemies, tediously frusterating.

												An excellent but difficult metroidvania. If you like that sort of game, you'll probably really like this as long as you're fine with the increased difficulty. If you're not a fan of that sort of game, definitely pass on this one. If you're not already a big metroidvania fan, I think it's unlikely that you'll enjoy playing through all of this game.I should've listened to the negative reviews. Before buying, take a moment to read through what people have to say about this, and trust what they are saying.First of all, you need pencil and paper in order to play this game. If that doesn't sound appealing to you, give this a pass. You'll need to do a lot of writing down everything you read. If you don't, you'll probably forget a vital clue and waste a bunch of time wandering around, stuck. I think it's unfortunate that the game doesn't do a better job of helping you keep track of what you read. There are a few in-game items that can help you slightly, but you can miss them and they only keep track of a small number of things you read.You will get stuck a lot in this game. When you're stuck, you have to wander around. Most of the hours I spent on this game involved just wandering around and exploring and trying to figure out what I need to do to progress. For me, that's just not very fun. I think the main thing that makes puzzles so difficult in this game is that they are spread out so far. I am a big fan of puzzle games, but I am not a big fan of the puzzles in this game. Because they involve having to traverse around the map and try different things and read things, they end up taking a lot of time to solve, and quite a bit of that time is just not fun - going through the same areas over and over and killing the same enemies and hearing the same music.Even when you know what you need to do, you still may end up spending a lot of time bored because of the amount of time it can take to move around the game world. There are certain areas later in the game that you do not have the ability to warp to until you get a certain item. So they are essentially telling you that your reward for getting the item is that you don't have to waste as much of your life traveling around. I find that sort of situation telling of this game's design philosophy. They don't seem to be too concerned about players having to spend time doing things that aren't fun. I come to games to have fun so that's a problem for me.I think the developer of this game focused more on just building an intricate, mysterious labrynth first and giving you the experience of an explorer trying to make their way through that structure, and I think they delivered on that. As part of achieving that, it's totally understandable why there's lots of moments where someone like me gets frustrated and bored. The game doesn't care about my moment-to-moment level of entertainment, it cares primarily about achieving that vision. But when I'm playing something, I'm constantly asking myself ""am I having fun? is this how I really want to spend my evening / weekend? At the end of the day, will I be satisfied with how I spent my day if I keep playing?"". With this game, I found the answer to all those questions ended up being ""no"". Just think of everything you could be doing instead of spending yet another 5 minutes backtracking to the last place you died so you can make another attempt at the boss.Also, let's talk about the music. By itself the music is great, but we are playing a game here. Good game music has to respect the fact that it's not the only thing going on. This game makes the mistake of so many other indie games where they have a short, loud (musically speaking, not talking about sheer volume), busy song played way too often (on loop). With the amount of time you end up spending in the same area, you'll probably start to get some serious listening fatigue. Take super metroid as a good counterexample. They save the busy stuff for short, intense moments in the game (boss fights, escape sequences). During the actual exploration the music becomes much more atmospheric with long notes and moments of quiet. I think this fits the game a lot better and prevents you from hating the game because you're sick of the music.So, if you're someone who can put up with lots of the things that you find in metroidvanias - backtracking, corpse runs, wandering around with no clue where to go, you'll have a great time with this game. Otherwise, if you're someone like me who isn't necessarilly a metroidvania fan but just wants to have a consistently fun experience, look elsewhere. There's so many games out there that provide consistently better fun / hour. I value my time too much to justify what this game asks me to do.			"

												Spelunky, I Wanna Be The Guy, Milon's Secret Castle, Montezuma's Revenge, and just a little bit of Castlevania and Shinobi went into making this game. How delightful it is to blunder upon the next method of progress, and yet at times I find myself asking ""how would anyone have naturally come across this necessary step to progress the game?"" There has to be a better way of making these games than cryptic clues that spawn switches that alter the level several screens over. You can get walled by your ineptitude but more often than not it's because you lack an obscurely placed yet crucial item. The Birth Seal is on the surface for ♥♥♥♥s sake buried in waterfalls on a small platform that requires you to make a blind jump over a moving target that will throw your trajectory off it if collides with you. Not to mention the absurdly comvoluted steps you need to take to engage the collosus. As the game progresses I'm certain to run into even more problems of this sort, but it's nothing the internet can't help me out with. Better design would incorpirate non-obtrusive hints into the game's patchwork, maybe a certain NPC could give you the gist of where an item you need is hiding as opposed to having me aimlessly wander around combing every single room for the few areas I can access with whichever new item I just recieved. That said it has a wonderful lack of sequence, there is a tremendous variety in the order you can do things. This can backfire though when the first boss you run into is actually supposed to be the third and is thus stupid hard (in a game that's already stupid hard). I was really pumped about the music for the first few hours or so but having to revisit and comb over every sector so meticulously has caused the tracks to lose their charm. There's a magnificent amount of interactivity with the environment, at a depth I would not ever expect in what was a free game. Expect to die and get hit fairly often, this game is no stranger to instantly killing you on a careless spiteful whim. I hope you enjoy going to the same hotsprings about 100 times, since potions aren't a thing in La-Mulana country. I pity anyone who gave up on this title after just a few hours.  "

												Edit: To those who disagree, please comment. I honestly want to hear how I'm wrong about this.La-Mulana is a fantastic platforming adventure game that does not hold your hand. ""The adventure begins"" and that's all you get. The video on the Steam store page helps quite a bit, giving you the basic essentials to starting. From there, you spelunk a massive ruin with many cultures mixed into a great, nuanced, satisfying story.I really want to just say that I love this game, everyone should play it and learn how to be a real gamer. However, there were some frustrating points that ultimately made me drop it. That's not to say that everyone will find the same things frustrating, but I wanted to give fair warning at least.La-Mulana has a very well designed difficulty curve for quite a while, but right around the mid-game, things get very overwhelming. A number of puzzles at that point have given you so many clues and you have so many places you can go that it becomes impossible to filter between what you can and can't solve without meticulous note-taking. I found the sheer number of things that you have to keep handy just in case a tablet somewhere hints at a room somewhere else to go beyond intimidating to the point of not being fun.A lot of things are hidden behind one completely unremarkable wall among hundreds or trial and error. At the same time I've had the most legitimate challenge that I've had in any game. I wish I could give this a neutral to say ""be prepared for masochistic gaming or a walkthrough"", but this is probably the closest I can get considering the majority of people. Also, my playtime is not what it appears, I've been playing collaboratively in offline mode with a friend.			"

												Really fun platformer with many puzzles. Platforming and combat both feel great but at the same time feel like a slightly more free castlevania style of movement where you are commited to your jumps with very little mid air control and your whipping (and other certain weapons) have a sort of delay too them.The puzzles in this game are so ridiculous. I mean it's not like they're impossible, but to do them you will actually need to write down every single piece of information in the game. Every hint you get and the location you got it, the names of rooms, then solving the riddles too, it's all just incredibly hard and a lot to keep track off.I had a great time playing through the game, though I sadly did need to look up a few things  like the temple of the goddess and the gate of illusion (because what even)  but I still had a enjoyed every minute I played. If you do purchase this game do try your best not to look anything up because when you realize how solvable the puzzles actually are it really makes you regret looking at guides.			"

												Probably the most difficult game I've played, in terms of raw puzzle solving.  The enemy combat can be easy at times yet you may find yourself dying by accident.  The controls take some getting used to but are rather intuitive once you've learned them.The puzzles are obtuse, you'll place weights and wonder ""what the hell did I just do?""  You'll discover it another 20 minutes from then.  There's something satisfying about beating the game and finding tons of secrets that you didn't know about.The achievements (if you enjoy those) are certainly challenging to obtain and add a breath of new life into this game once you've finished it a couple of times.The soundtrack is the best part of this game.  The music is wonderfully composed and adds an atmosphere that matches what you see.10/5 would recommend			"

												La-Mulana is a 2D Action Platformer Metroidvania game. In here, you're playing as Professor Lemeza, he's an archeologist who tried to solve the mysteries of the ruins. This game is huge and vast, and as this is a metroidvania game, expect a lot of backtrack. There will be a lot of unsolved stuff behind, and even though it looks impossible to do, it's not, you'll able to do some crazy feat once you progress. That's one of the beauty of this game. So, now on to the review !(+) Positive- The progressive feels real, you starts with totally nothing, but once you unlocks stuff. It actually impacts in a great way.- Interesting puzzle and riddle, and most of them are fair, logical and there's a hint for them.- The soundtracks are great, really fits the atmosphere.- A lot of secret, for those who likes treasure hunting.- The place is vast and huge, great for those who likes exploring, you may find difficulties at first though !- The boss fight is really challenging. Man, beating them feels great.(-) Negative- At the beginning, this game is kinda dull, since you're really limited. And it's kinda nuisance to go back to the first place just for healing. But later in the game, this will no longer become a problem.- Beware, while most of the riddle is fair, some of them are not. you might get stuck.- The death traps, yes, there are some in this game. There's a trap where you'll get killed instantly. Also, there's a trap that get you stucked and you'll most likely dead if you don't have a necessary item to get away. Trial and error i might say.So, if you like a challenging 2D Action game, and don't mind dying a lot. This game is totally for you ! But just a reminder, it's not for everyone, really.			"

												Are you into genuine puzzle platformers and think FEZ is too pretentious? Then La-Mulana is for you.Don't let the cute retro-style deceive you. There is deep lore hidden behind the surface, and you have to understand it in order to progress. Read all the stone tablets that are spread throughout the game, and take notes. There is no shame in asking other players for directions or even using a guide, if you have been hopelessly stuck for hours. But you will feel like an idiot afterwards, when you realize that the clues had all been laid out for you. You just didn't take them seriously. The platforming and fighting can also be very challenging at times, especially some of the later guardians.There will be lots of backtracking, of course, but traveling through the different areas is still fun. Each area is unique. Each guardian bossfight is unique. And every puzzle is unique. You'll find yourself putting lots of weights on daises, but how you get to them is always different. Many puzzles require you to figure out clever gimmicks, only to never see them again. For other puzzles you'll have to do something in one area that affects something in a different area. The game world is also structured in a non-linear fashion. For example, you could skip the first guardian and fight the third one first, if you like (or if you simply haven't figured out, how to get to the first one...).Let me just give you one tip for the sake of your enjoyment: In the first area, the Gate of Guidance, is a treasure which allows you to warp to savepoints, and you can get it immediately. It will save you a lot of traveling time.			"

												This game is -meant- to be difficult, hard, completely unapologetic about these features, and with minimal hand-holding.We live in a time where this can be an option. No one needs to argue that ""games have to cater to all audiences"" because there are too many games - enough to supply anyone's tastes.With that said, the same applies to this game. This supplies the tastes of people like me who are not bothered by the difficulty and take it up as a challenge. Plus, for all intents and purposes, the game does escalate in a fair fashion - the difficulty raises at a rather steady pace. The issue for some people is that it already starts at a grueling difficulty.As far as ""Castlevania"" games go, this is one of the best. With a very interesting plot, very different locales, dozens of enemies and bosses.... this is what, to me, a game should feel...An adventure.			"

												La-Mulana is proof that a game that makes you want to tear your hair out in frustrated confusion can also be one of the most rewarding and satisfactory experiences in its field. A lot of love and effort went into this product, and it shows not only through the striking visuals and great soundtrack, but also through how truly fleshed out the ruins turn out to be. Not a single pixel seems to be wasted, each and every bit is part of a larger picture, another puzzle. The rabbit hole goes deep in this adventure, and you are equipped with the means of just barely being able to deal with it all.La-Mulana is not for everyone, its sense of scale and pacing craves your attention and commitment on a level few products made for entertainment dears to tread, but it also makes sure that your hard work is worth it.

For all the voice overs, Graphical lens flares, blooms and facial emulations in the world, they just can't replace challenging side scrollers with head-scratching puzzles and some cheesy 16-bit midi audio background music to boot.$3 well spent.

If you consider a game too hard if you have to talk to other people about the game to learn what to do, don't play this game. You don't like La MetroidVanias and by buying this game you would just like them even less.

												Solving the cryptic puzzles and mysteries is great once you get into it but there are so many frustrations throughout, I struggle to say if it's worth it.There's terrible hitboxes on the bosses, which are insanely difficult without getting the extra secret upgrades and weapons (even then they're still really difficult).The jumping mechanics are weird and imprecise, which wouldn't be so bad except a lot of the levels and enemies/bosses are designed in such a way that you have to be precise.And the game loves to throw insane annoyances at you, like how about a room which is really hard and annoying to get to even once you've worked out how to get there, so every time you need to go there you have to spend ages trying over and over to get in there. Then let's have a really hard mini boss in there so every time you die you have to go back and do it all again. Then once you've finally beaten it, have an insta-kill trap in the next room. There's a fair bit of that in La-Mulana, and I get that the game seems to pride itself on dicking you over but you can do that without necessarily feeling unfair.I don't even mind most of the insta-kill traps. You can usually see them coming and avoid them if you're cautious and pay enough attention, and they're usually close enough to a save point that you can just laugh them off and continue.If you think you can put up with all that and you really enjoy big adventures and cryptic puzzles that'll have you taking lots of notes then it might be worth it for you. Despite that I'm not recommending this game, I did enjoy it well enough, it's just a deeply flawed game that really isn't for everyone.If you do decide to play it, here's some words of advice:The game has a manual (you can access it by right clicking the game in your library), you'll have to read it to solve a puzzle early on because as far as I'm aware, the solution isn't even alluded to in the game.I would of course recommend avoiding using a guide as much as possible but you'll probably end up needing a guide at some point. I recommend ""Cheshire's Hint-based Guide"" on the steam guides as it'll allow you to get hints to parts you're stuck at without having the solution outright given to you.After you've beaten the first boss you'll be able to gain access to three separate bosses without actually having to beat any of them. You should get to that point, and then use the previously mentioned guide to help you find the Axe weapon and make sure you've gotten as many life orbs as you can. Without those you're going to have a really hard time with the bosses.			"

												A tough-as-nails Metroidvania with no sympathy for those that don't want to take notes, La-Mulana is a love letter to the bygone era of games that expected the player to progress purely through exploration, investigation, and experimentation rather than hand-holding.La-Mulana's primary gameplay focus is exploration and puzzle-solving, though the bosses are nothing to scoff at, especially if hard mode is enabled. The ruins of La-Mulana are absolutely massive, riddled with puzzles, traps, and bosses, and paying attention to the environment is essential to progress. Background objects can be examined, giving you vital clues about the world and the puzzles that can be found within, and note taking is highly encouraged as the hints you find may apply to puzzles on the other end of the ruins.La-Mulana controls a bit like an early Castlevania game. Your control over your jumping trajectory is limited, and knockbacks can be brutal. You start with a whip, but as you progress through the game, you'll find lots of different weapons and subweapons you can equip, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.It is not a game for everyone, and the very beginning of the game can be especially tough if you don't know what you're up against, but if you desire a massive world to explore and a game that can give you the satisfaction of solving complex riddles without the game shoving the solution in your face, then La-Mulana might be for you. There's no shame in checking a guide every now and again, especially when you get near the end of the game, which is when the puzzles start to become quite complex, but you'll get the most enjoyment out of La-Mulana if you try to solve as many of its mysteries as you can by yourself, armed with only your wits and a collection of notes.If you want to try La-Mulana, I definitely recommend reading through the manual, as well as watching the ""Beginner's Guide to La-Mulana"" video on Youtube.

												A 2D Non-Linear Exploration Action Platformer, or as many call, a ""Metroidvania"". La Mulana is one of the few games which could be considered a work of art - that is, we aren't just talking about story and graphics here like many games lauded as art are praised for - the entirety of this piece of work is a masterwork of the craft of game design. Gameplay will challenge and push players to their limits, and encourage discussion among peers to discover it's many secrets. Graphics and story are basic yet without any glaring flaws. Music is catchy, and captures the mood of every location and event perfectly.Controls may seem stiff at first, but the even a casual player will be able to get used to them, especially since the levels are designed around them. Some puzzles may be too tough to solve solo, and while taking notes down old school style is encouraged, some may be discouraged by the lack of taking in-game notes (bar the ability to log down a number of clues). However, none of these minor setbacks add up nor will bog a player down for long.All explorers, Metroidvania fans, and fans of ""hard"" games will surely enjoy this remake of the classic indie.			"

Posted: August 21, 2016
												Never did I have a harder time writing a review than before. What should I do? I think I will look at the different aspects of the game.Story:The basic premise: You play Lemeza Kosugi, an archeologist who wants to explore La-Mulana, also known as the ruins. So you are doing exploration. Lemeza doesn’t have much character and frankly, he doesn’t have to because what makes this game good is the story behind the story.If it was for the story alone, this game would earn full score and a recommendation because I love the creativity behind this. Graphics: Given that it is a retro game, the graphics look great. The different parts of the ruins are all beautiful and can be easily distinguished. At parts I just stopped to take in the scenery. The animation of the enemies is smooth and they look also pretty great, especially the bosses.If it was for graphics alone, I would also give a recommendation.Music:Alright, here I’m indecisive. When it comes to dungeon music, some pieces are repetitive and too short for my taste. Then there are themes that start to get on my nerve after a while (e.g. hell temple). However the boss pieces fit their respective fights perfectly. Tiamat’s and The Mother’s music pieces are the best of the bunch. Also the theme of the true shrine of mother is something I could listen for hours.Gameplay:It is so weird. If you look at my profile you will notice that I’ve got more than 70% out of all the possible achievements. On the one hand, if you manage to figure something out and solve a puzzle, it just feels great. On the other hand, the way there. Let me tell you how my first time with La Mulana went.I got inside the ruins and started to investigate them. I explored them and eventually got to the mausoleum of the giants. I got the save point there and scanned every tablet. Eventually I stumbled upon one that warned me to read it again. Eager to see what would happen, I looked at it again and started Hard Mode. Without a holy grail to teleport from tablet to tablet, without anything. It was hard to get out of the mausoleum and to the hot springs on the surface again. Then I tried it again, entered the ruins and this time got to the temple of the sun. Here my journey ended. I didn’t have enough weights to open the doors. At this point I gave up and watched a playthrough and learned that you can get the grail at the very beginning and that it is basically required to beat this game. This angered me so much. I respect that La Mulana gives you the chance to go wherever you want right at the beginning (like you can go to the giant monster protecting the feather and die there if you feel like it or to the waterfall at the other side and die in the water). HOWEVER too much freedom can alienate players to the point where they will just give up. First impressions are very important for certain people and this wasn’t a good impression. I dare say there should be a beginners’ mode to help players get what they need at the beginning like the Holy Grail before making the game world open to explore as you like.Speaking of the grail, I am not done yet. There is a problem gameplay wise and that’s Lemeza’s laptop. Let’s say you have found the tablets of the main areas like the mausoleum of the giants or the gate of guidance. Later on you find other areas like the tower of the goddess or the tower of ruin. Can you teleport there with the Holy Grail?Yes, if you install special software for it.WHY?!Why would you need that?! Why does it work with the main areas but not with the special areas unless you use software? Why would software make an ancient artifact do that?! I’m sorry, this just hurts. What does a piece of software do to an ancient artifact to make it teleport Lemeza to places it didn’t before?! My suspension of disbelief is gone here. But it goes on with this problem: So our hero has found a map of a specific area and you press F1 to look at it. Can you see it?No, you can’t: You need to install a specific piece of software to see it. An additional kind of software to gain details. So you need the map, the software to display it AND additional software to see details. Sorry, why? If it was only two steps (like most games do like Zelda: You need a map and a compass to get the most out of it) I would accept it, but three?However the worst part: Some of the software you gain doesn’t even tell you exactly what it does. Why?Overall I didn’t like the part with the software. If all of it told me what it does and if there was a list of software combinations to look up, I would like it. But how it currently is? No thanks.Yet another problem in this game is healing. What can you do to heal yourself? First: Finding hot springs, jumping in there.Second: Gaining enough experience points will restore HP. This is done by collecting green energy balls.Third: Finding a healing fairy (which have a 50% chance to appear)That is all. You won’t get healed at save spots and you don’t have healing items.This makes this game much harder than it needs to be. For example GBA Castlevania games are much more forgiving: You have dangerous places but you can buy and use healing items and getting to a save spot restores all your HP.Speaking of save spots, they are too far away from the bosses if you ask me. Especially when I was about to face the final boss, that took way too long. Or Bahamut. Furthermore: Lemeza is a bit stiff to control at the beginning. Until he gets some decent equipment like the feather or the software that makes him go faster (however this is supposed to work in reality), he is a pain to control. Especially the jump at the beginning is hard to control.Also, what bothered me from beginning to end was the knockback. When Lemeza gets hit, he flies back two blocks. Let’s say he falls down a deep chasm. He will fall and fall and fall after falling back two blocks. This can be very frustrating, especially the first time in the inferno chambers where the lava drains away health like no tomorrow. In conjunction with not buying the item that lets you open the laptop in lava this can lead to a game over very fast for one simple mistake.Speaking of mistakes, sometimes I couldn’t believe what mean tricks some ruins pulled. Like the gate of illusion where you need to teleport by walking into certain walls. Oh, and instant death traps. Some that can’t even be predicted. This can be super frustrating. So what I did: My first run left such a horrible taste that I stuck to a speedrunner video to play through this game. I have to say, the endgame is better than the beginning. Lemeza can double jump, moves faster, is versatile… and I had enough motivation left to beat the hell temple after finishing the game.However 72% is the farthest I’ll go in this game. Beating final boss gave me a hard time and I’ll never fight her again. Not under the current circumstances.Given that not even 5% have actually finished the game, here are some suggestions now that I’ve heard that La Mulana 2 is in the making:First: More guidance in the beginning. Second: The healing issue. It is just so bothering. I suggest save spots that heal and having healing items to ease it up a little. Third: The software gimmick needs to be revised. Like secret software actually telling what it can do.So what should I do? Bash this game for making my first time with it a nightmare? Praise it for its other aspects that come midway through and at the end?Well, I am 52% pro and 48% contra so I will give it a pass. The way La Mulana is currently, I can only recommend playing it with a guide until you get the Holy Grail and then investigating on your own if you want to play it the way it’s meant to be. It’s just to spare you the frustration I had at the beginning.However I do love the backstory of this game and look forward to see what the developers will do with the sequel.  "

												With very elaborate puzzles and difficult bosses, this game is not for the weak. If you like games that teach you everything you need to know in minimal details, you should not play this game. At times, you may be completely lost/clueless on what to do next. Or you'll be stuck on a boss, dying over and over. That said, the game does provide several tips through an exploration experience, you will need to take notes in order to succeed.			"

												One of the most fun games I've ever played. It took me a long time to try it out, but it is absolutely worth a play for anyone who enjoys exploration and puzzle solving. Not as cryptic as its reputation lends it to be, but still requires quite a bit of thought to solve the puzzles.Take notes and challenge the ruins!			"

												Welcome to the ruins of La-Mulana, a place where the mother lays to rest, where traps wait for you at every corner and an epic adventure will take place. You slip into the role of Lemeza Kosugi, an experienced archeologist who wants to explore the ancient ruins to find what is spoken of as ""the secret treasure of life"".The game is filled with ancient stone tablets. They're everywhere and provide the player with background history and puzzle hints. Just make sure you have a scanner and your translation software to read them. I have to say, this game is a pure gem. The controls are nice, the gameplay feels kind of like Metroid and the setting reminds of Indiana Jones. It's an interesting mixture that works surprisingly well. Also, the soundtrack. THE SOUNDTRACK! It's so good! All the areas and bosses have their own tracks, which gives them their own personal feeling. It's definitely one of my all-time favourite video game soundtracks.You can tell the game was created with love and attention to detail. La-Mulana really got a place in my heart, it is my favourite steam game and will probably stay in my top three forever.In terms of difficulty, the puzzles range from easy and kind of obvious to extremely hard and cryptic. So completing this game without a guide is incredibly hard (attempting it can lead to frustration). So please consider having a look into the wiki or a guide, if you're stuck. The game is too good to not finish it.Also you'll die. A lot. Have fun!			"

												This game is excellent! If you love the thought of playing Indiana Jones exploring a huge series of varied places solving puzzles, avoiding traps, killing monsters, and finding the elusive shiny treasures, this game is for you!Yes, you will probably get stuck in certain places and die a lot, but don't lose hope! This game has my #2 spot for most hours played out of any game, and I'd dive back into the place again in a heartbeat!Thanks, Nigoro! I hope the sequel is just as awesome!			"

												This is probably the hardest game of the 21st century. It doesn't follow the rules of games, it follows the rules of actually investigating an ancient, archaeological ruin. If you make a mistake, if you set off a trap or fall down a pit or♥♥♥♥♥♥off some ancient gods without warning, you will die. But the difficulty doesn't come from the combat, it comes from exploration itself. The entire game is just one massive system of extremely discreet hints and puzzle pieces. If Ninja Gaiden needed you to develop borderline ninja reflexes and senses to win, this game asks you to have the patience and memory and problem solving skills of an expert archaeologist and anthropologist. This game can literally take years to complete without cheating, and is basically the Finnegans Wake of video games; you'll die before solving a fraction of it on your own.			"

												I decided to write this review after playing it for 10 hours. I'm not sure whether I will play it again or not, but right now I really feel like taking a rest and stay away. In the future if I'm asked to present some of the greatest metroidvania games La Mulana will surely stay on my list. But I would not recommend it because this game is ONLY made for hardcore players who probably have nearly infinite patience and zeal to really dig deep into this game. Frankly speaking as a metroidvania fan I was really fancinated by this game at the first few hours. The music is great, and the art style is brilliant. The controls. As a platformer the controls are unforgivably clunky. The doctor is the character that has the greatest inertia I have ever seen. For most of the occasions the game is too hard just because you can't control it well especially when jumping. The character simply has the most clumsy jump I have ever experienced. And sometimes you are so easily knocked back by a too-well-designed bat or some other moving objects, and you will keep falling down like 3 screens then you need to climb back, and most likely to be knocked down again, and again. And the mosters are delibrately designed to knock you down which can be borne at first, but soon gets extremely annoying. Every time you jump you must be extremely careful and make your movements as precise as possible in order not to climb back and try again and again. A small mistake will cost you much patience and you will soon have non and feel like chopping your hands off.I have only played 10 hours and it hasn't come to the part when I might be annoyed by the puzzle solving issue which many other reviews wrote about. Castlevania is sometimes hard too but you know you just need to gid gud and finally you will make it. There is a great difference between a really well designed hard game that offers you the challenge , and a game that is hard just because it's poorly designed. But as I say in the beginning, this game is not for everybody. Those with a strong heart and enough patience may find it entertaining.3/10 GG bats			"

												im going to do it im going to write a review on the best game in my steam libaray. This game is amazing one of the best games to play. While the first time i saw it was a walkthrough and i did need a guide several times to get to the end. I havent beaten the game yet though its one of the only games ive taken the most time to complete due to how long it is and how much i just love replaying the beggining stages of the game. The game is hard its real hard but its not like ""we wont tell you what to do."" To people who in the negative reviews say ""your lying the game totally doesnt give you any information."" You ♥♥♥♥ers arent reading the tablets that tell you exactly what to do. Many skeletons do the same thing. Ill give a few examples of puzzles ive seen that have been complained aboutFake wall puzzle: in the first area of the game there is a wall that is walkthroughable that leads to another area to help you press a switch and do stuff. Negative reviews state that this is not mentioned and is just poor game design even though a tablet and a skeleton mention the wall. Hell the skeleton thats leaning against the wall is the wall you can walk through.Dance of life: chamber of birth in a lower section of this holy ♥♥♥♥ this is a confusing map there is a raised platform that you must do a dance of life to summon one of the mini bosses. Complaints that the game gives no indicators of this dance even though i think..3 tablets tell you what to do. One in the fire zone tells you the dance of life. I think a tablet in the illusion area reminds you of it and the chamber of birth tablet tells you to do it here.  Loosable items: Now im pretty sure theres only one item in the whole game that is really looseable permantly. I believe its the chain whip in the fire area. Two pillars on either side you have to take one up to put a weight on a pressure thing and jump to the whip. If you dont then your stuck and cant get the item unless you load a save. You could ask why im not mentioning the most powerful whip well thats only because if you do ♥♥♥♥ up the puzzle the first time you can defeat one of the bosses and get a retry while the other its just gone man.  Little brothers shop: Lots of people complain that the game never tells you that you need to buy an item 4 times from little brothers shop to get the special item in big brothers shop in the twins map. Thats true it doesnt but a tablet does ♥♥♥♥ing tell you that essientially to buy to gain favor from little brother to get an item. Now it doesnt tell you how many items but it does say ""hey buy♥♥♥♥♥♥from him."" Im sure there are other puzzles complained about but literally most of them can be solved by skeletons and the tablets. The only thing you can get me on is how ♥♥♥♥ing hard it is to get to the tower of the goddess since it requires a few things that are barely stated. As said though most puzzles the complained about puzzles are explained in game if you can stand to read. If you dont have the patience to actually learn and use said knowledge you wont like the game. But if you like to take your time and enjoy and learn the lore you will like this game. "

												This is hardcore Metroidvania, a great hardcore Metroidvania.The game starts you off exploring in a rather limited area, so you will soon stumble upon the first dungeon, which are called fields in this game. This first field also serves as an old school tutorial: you will learn the mechanics of the game within it, to recognize some traps and to doubt others. It's also really great as you can complete almost everything in the first field without ever going elsewhere, even beating its boss.Once you've beat the first boss and completed most of the field's puzzles, it's time to branch out into the real game. Now you will begin the real exploration! You will need to visit many areas before being able to complete one, only stopped by a lack of tools or by too powerful enemies. The hints, which were pretty self-contained in the first field, will be found pretty much anywhere.This game is really great and I heartly recommand it. Warning tough: the jumping controls are stiff and need a little adaptation. You might also want to consider a pen and paper to take note of some hints early on - until you find an in-game software you can use for that. Besides the accumulation of orbs, the hot spring is the only way to regain health.What I think is the most amazing thing is how understanding the lore is primordial to understand and solve the puzzles. Through its tablet hints and other environmental cues, the game has a lore to tell and recurring themes that become more and more the key to find some of the later solutions. The ""second"" field, Mausoleum of the Giants, introduce the concept quite forcefully, even though most of its lore puzzles can be brute-forced without much trouble.As usual with this kind of game, you start off really weak but if you commit yourself to find everything, you will become almost overpowered by the game's end, so don't be put off by the initial difficulty (or maybe you should come back with a better weapon or more health).

												A heartful remake for a finely crafted freeware gem. You play as an explorer, armed with only a whip, an Indiana Jones hat, and a strong drive for exploration. And my gosh, you really succumb to wanderlust. Diving into the ruins is rewarding in terms of music, visuals, content, and ~that warm feeling~ of nabbing yourself another sweet item/weapon/powerup to add to your ever growing arsenal. No room is used simply for the once, while this encourages backtracking, it also makes the ruins of La-Mulana feel more organic. And that's fantastic. The antagonist of the game is the game itself, you want nothing more than to beat it to a pulp, and steal its dinner money. La-Mulana is a very unforgiving game with little to no hand-holding, and I adore that. Every accomplishment your character makes, you are responsible for. You FEEL like an honest-to-god explorer. And I haven't even mentioned the puzzles. I love this game so, so much. I can feel the love and care that went into this title, slavishly improving on every aspect that was already great about the original, and it's bursting from the seams with quality content. One of my favourite games of the past decade.			"

Together with great gameplay, incredible sprite work and an amazing soundtrack, it creates a game that is definitely worth playing to the end.			"

												Everything about it is great; the humor, the music, the action, the graphic style, etc. But it’s so cryptic that it’s almost unplayable without a walkthrough, and using a walkthrough for the entire game would be boring. I gave up a few hours in, once I could no longer make any progress by myself. La-Mulana gives you almost no instructions or directions at all, just very cryptic hints that are usually impossible to understand. Some of the more annoying puzzles include invisible floors, or breakable walls that look like normal walls.  The world is so massive and has so many path branches that you’ll be backtracking for ages before you figure out what you’ve missed or where to go.Even very important key items like the map and warp system are fairly well hidden!I probably wouldn’t have found them for a very long time, but I checked the wiki when I got trapped in a dead-end room. There’s actually traps that force you to load your last saved game! And they don’t even tell you that you’re perma-trapped! So you have to sit there like an idiot for 15 minutes trying to get out.Ugh. It’s a shame. I really would have liked to finish the game. Cause it would be awesome if it was actually playable. If I wanted pointlessly difficult games, I’d pull out something for the NES.But who knows, maybe I’ll give it another try someday.			"

												I gave this game more than a fair shake and i will never finish it and i don't recommend it. I was hoping to find a game with fun and engaging puzzles and that is pretty much what i got in the first 10 hours or so. But eventually you will get to a point where it is literally impossible to solve some of the puzzles without looking stuff up on the internet. I have 38 hours played, so i was probably stuck for 20+ hours trying to find a way to continue but what i had to do to progress was ""stand in random spots and press the item button"", sure you could argue that there were stone tablets that gave me hints how to get into ""eden"" but what about the gate of illusion teleport puzzles, or the location of the book of dead, or the fact that a random gate appears on the surface after killing a random boss. After getting through eden/the gate of illusion with a guide i decided that i'm done with this game and i won't finish it. The gameplay isn't very enjoyable, the bosses in the early game are all easy (despite me accidently playing on hardmode) and the bosses in the mid-lategame can almost all be cheesed with the lamp.I eventually watched a video of a speedrun for this game and in the later parts you have to do a lot more random stuff for example in the tower of godess and in the shrine of the mother. One of the puzzles is stand 45 seconds in a room for the doll to change, another is randomly look at the upgraded map at a specific location in the shrine of the mother and i don't even want to talk about the final puzzle.I don't mind hard games, i don't mind difficult puzzles but this game has too much random stuff without reasonable hints. I wouldn't have complained about cryptic puzzles for bonus items and whatnot, but a lot of the unreasonable puzzles are required to progress and finish the game.			"

												An excellent but difficult metroidvania. If you like that sort of game, you'll probably really like this as long as you're fine with the increased difficulty. If you're not a fan of that sort of game, definitely pass on this one. If you're not already a big metroidvania fan, I think it's unlikely that you'll enjoy playing through all of this game.I should've listened to the negative reviews. Before buying, take a moment to read through what people have to say about this, and trust what they are saying.First of all, you need pencil and paper in order to play this game. If that doesn't sound appealing to you, give this a pass. You'll need to do a lot of writing down everything you read. If you don't, you'll probably forget a vital clue and waste a bunch of time wandering around, stuck. I think it's unfortunate that the game doesn't do a better job of helping you keep track of what you read. There are a few in-game items that can help you slightly, but you can miss them and they only keep track of a small number of things you read.You will get stuck a lot in this game. When you're stuck, you have to wander around. Most of the hours I spent on this game involved just wandering around and exploring and trying to figure out what I need to do to progress. For me, that's just not very fun. I think the main thing that makes puzzles so difficult in this game is that they are spread out so far. I am a big fan of puzzle games, but I am not a big fan of the puzzles in this game. Because they involve having to traverse around the map and try different things and read things, they end up taking a lot of time to solve, and quite a bit of that time is just not fun - going through the same areas over and over and killing the same enemies and hearing the same music.Even when you know what you need to do, you still may end up spending a lot of time bored because of the amount of time it can take to move around the game world. There are certain areas later in the game that you do not have the ability to warp to until you get a certain item. So they are essentially telling you that your reward for getting the item is that you don't have to waste as much of your life traveling around. I find that sort of situation telling of this game's design philosophy. They don't seem to be too concerned about players having to spend time doing things that aren't fun. I come to games to have fun so that's a problem for me.I think the developer of this game focused more on just building an intricate, mysterious labrynth first and giving you the experience of an explorer trying to make their way through that structure, and I think they delivered on that. As part of achieving that, it's totally understandable why there's lots of moments where someone like me gets frustrated and bored. The game doesn't care about my moment-to-moment level of entertainment, it cares primarily about achieving that vision. But when I'm playing something, I'm constantly asking myself ""am I having fun? is this how I really want to spend my evening / weekend? At the end of the day, will I be satisfied with how I spent my day if I keep playing?"". With this game, I found the answer to all those questions ended up being ""no"". Just think of everything you could be doing instead of spending yet another 5 minutes backtracking to the last place you died so you can make another attempt at the boss.Also, let's talk about the music. By itself the music is great, but we are playing a game here. Good game music has to respect the fact that it's not the only thing going on. This game makes the mistake of so many other indie games where they have a short, loud (musically speaking, not talking about sheer volume), busy song played way too often (on loop). With the amount of time you end up spending in the same area, you'll probably start to get some serious listening fatigue. Take super metroid as a good counterexample. They save the busy stuff for short, intense moments in the game (boss fights, escape sequences). During the actual exploration the music becomes much more atmospheric with long notes and moments of quiet. I think this fits the game a lot better and prevents you from hating the game because you're sick of the music.So, if you're someone who can put up with lots of the things that you find in metroidvanias - backtracking, corpse runs, wandering around with no clue where to go, you'll have a great time with this game. Otherwise, if you're someone like me who isn't necessarilly a metroidvania fan but just wants to have a consistently fun experience, look elsewhere. There's so many games out there that provide consistently better fun / hour. I value my time too much to justify what this game asks me to do.			"

												A remake of a very retro Metroidvania-style platformer! Think of it as if Castlevania, Dark Souls, Pitfall, and every single anime cliche stepped into a teleporter pod at the same time and La-Mulana came out alive in a shambling mass from the other pod.So be warned; La-Mulana is not for the faint of heart. This game will challenge you with NES-hard difficulty and complex puzzles that both punishes and rewards the devoted gamer. Monsters and bosses are tough nuts to crack, but many of them have set patterns and drop XP that can fill your health bar to full whenever you collect enough. There are a lot of hints and clues scattered all throughout the game to solve almost every puzzle, either through tablet stones lying around, murals in the background, or dialogue with NPCs. However, the clues are very cryptic to grasp and most clues are for puzzles you'll run into hours later, making it really easy to be stuck in a certain area for extensive periods of time. But you know what? That's what gets me hooked onto La-Mulana; it's the authentic archaeological experience to solve ancient riddles and avoid booby traps along the way. And when you finally solve a major puzzle or get past a difficult spot, that sigh of relief feels like heaven.All in all, La-Mulana is a very fluid and heavily underrated masterpiece that takes platform gamers to the limit. Many people might find frustration with the game's tough puzzles and enemies, but to the indomitable spirited gamer, La-Mulana will offer a very thrilling and unique experience not found in many games of yesteryear or today.+ Interesting platformer with large non-linear levels, a deep story, cute characters, and endless challenges+ Retro-style indie game that does more than imitates classic games that preceded decades before it+ Beautifully detailed graphics compared to the original+ Completing most challenges and defeating bosses can occur in any order; La-Mulana's non-linear structure makes getting to the very end obtainable from many different paths+ Perfect for those who love to solve intriguing puzzles, battle unique bosses, and just straight up play a challenging but rewarding game+ Will enrich your cultural knowledge with mythological folklore borrowed from the real world!- Hard-as-balls default difficulty with an even harder one that could be unlocked during gameplay- Jumping mechanics are difficult to nail down for beginners and takes much practice to master- Most typical La-Mulana puzzles are more obscure to solve than the meaning of life itself- No seriously, this game will kick you straight in the butt crack; there's no shame in using community guides for this game!

												This game is HARD! I thought I could beat this game in a single sitting, but after 2 hours and beating the first 'dungeon', I decided to watch a speedrun.JUST WOW! I only scratched the surface! La-Mulana is Dark Souls-styled hard. It's a game that rewards patience and pays off handsomely. Although I gave up after 2 hours (I'm not very patient), I still recommend La-Mulana. Tight controls (use a controller!), pretty pixel graphics, and a really deep world. I wish I didn't have a dayjob and could play video games all day.			"

												Cold Review: A side scrolling whip 'em up metroidvania. Chock full of really tough puzzles, bosses, and a spralling labyrinth. It's a good one, but requires time and dedication to really sink into it.Hot Review: Where to begin? This game is a true marvel that is very challenging, yet also satisfying. It presents you with a large labyrinth of ancient mystery, that is ripe with danger, mystery, and treasures. There is this nice old school charm to it, with a new age hardcore feel to spelunking. The games difficulty is similar to that of Dark Souls. It's a world that throws curveballs and, ""Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥.. Didn't think that would happen"" situations at you. But despite all the death, it's fun to brush yourself off and venture back into the ancient temple. It's a long game as well, and will take a first timer awhile to get through it. However, once you are watching the ending credits... You have this awesome feeling of satisfaction.Verdict? It's good. Frustrating, but one of those rare indie games that offers quite a lot, especially for it's price.			"

												if you are into metroidvanias and riddles please please PLEASE get this game. Its got lots of crazy puzzles to solve for clever thinkers and some good action to help filter out that stuff a bit. the music kicks so much butt i could listen to most of the tunes for hours, i especially like the weird guitar synth. albeit one very important thing, i used i guide through this game. the thing is, although the puzzles are interesting they are very confusing as is the whole game itself honestly you will get lost, you will at least once. if youre daring enough give it a shot, but if not, dont feel guilty. even if you do go without a guide, be sure to watch the beginners guide, they made it for a reason. honestly just get this game, if its too hard use a guide just, PLAY IT OK, SCAN EVERYTHING, PUSH DA BLOCKS, GET THE SUB WEAPONS, FALL IN LOVE WITH LA MULANA.....................

												I'm going to start this off by declaring that I used a guide when I got stuck, and had a map open half the time.I just beat La-Mulana. This is the most fun I've had playing a Metroidvania game in quite some time. The controls are crisp, even if the jumping will definitely feel off at the beginning. The graphics are done well in a retro 16bit style, with some throwbacks to the original release of the game that you'll see later on in it. The soundtrack however, is fantastic. Very catchy tunes, with each area having its own music. I've held off on listening to the soundtrack in full, but it's going to be a joy to listen to it having beaten the game.Gameplay is traditional Metroidvania, with a twist. You don't actually level up, instead relying on various items you run around in the ruins to get more powerful. ""Leveling up"" instead refills your health, which is much needed. The game is also puzzle heavy, which is why I ended up using the guide (some can be rather obtuse, and some near impossible unless you remember a specific thing or can figure out the crazy Japanese logic used in their creation.) The difficulty of the game is something I had heard about before I started, and I can agree, it's definitely a difficult game. However it's a very fair difficult for the most part. If you get stuck in an area you can learn the patterns of the enemies or bosses, or even come back later after exploring other areas. There were several rooms that I did get frustrated in, but that was due to the nature of my skills not matching up with what the game asked of me. When you die you can typically learn why you died and then find a way to not die next time.If you like Metroidvania games and don't mind a tough but fair game, you owe it to yourself to play this gem. Even though the puzzles are obtuse at times, if you don't want to use a guide the game does give you plenty of tools to help you to figure them out yourself. You can record conversations to read back later, try various combinations of items, or simply brute force if needed. The puzzles are essentially the only flaw I found in this otherwise sterling game. I'm so glad I stuck with it after getting my♥♥♥♥♥kicked at the beginning.Oh, and you have a whip.			"

												I really suck at this game, and clearly I'm not the targeted audience, but I still acknowledge how rich La-Mulana is. It is very cryptic, but contrary to other games of this kind, it is well done: everything is here to help you solve its mysteries. It is very subtle and will make you think differently from any other game. It's really a hit or miss: it can either be exactly what you're looking for (and almost no other game will provide you a similar adventure, so that's really your only chance of getting that), or your worst frustrating and confusing experience ever. I recommend it because, like I said again and again, it really is a unique experience, it does what it does very well, and so it's a good addition to the video game landscape.			"

												So good I've bought it 3 times now.  It's one of, if not the best Metroidvania games avalable.  Think Castlevania: SotN meets Indiana Jones meets Myst.  The side-scrolling action is challenging, not punishing, the graphic/aesthetic are beautiful 32-bit pixel art and are detailed and diverse, and the puzzles will make you rip your hair out (but with some wicked intuition and a pen and paper for notes are all fair and solvable).  If you want a challengeing game (read: not punishing, but makes you work for your victories), there isn't anything liike La-Mulana out there.  New entry into one of my favorite games of all time hall of fame and of course highly recommended.  Even if you have to resort to a walkthrough (I had to on a couple parts, and then kicked myself for it), the game is solid and worth playing.			"

												Not since Super Metroid have I been so engrossed in a game of this type. La-Mulana is a classic style action adventure in the 'metroidvania' designation. A befuddling and old school experience evocative of the games that inspired it. It has no shame in allowing you to wander around its treacherous halls with only the snippets of guidance left behind on ancient stone tablets and the final thoughts of previous adventurers already taken by its depths. It makes me feel like an actual archaeologist, having to unravel the mysteries of an ancient civilization. Almost no handholding, and the little that is there is teasing or completely ignorable. Brilliantly realized visuals that remind me why I so love pixel art, even in the modern era, and a fantastic soundtrack that wouldn't feel out of place in a classics collection. If you have any interest at all in this style of game, I emplore you to check it out. But beware... the insidious traps are not for the faint of heart.			"

												If you're looking for a really hardcore Metroidvania type game, this is a good one. The quality is spot on there's practically no bugs or crash conditions in the game either it's just like playing an old game. It also has a fabulous soundtrack. Do be warned however that the difficulty of the puzzles is absolutely insane and using a walkthrough to complete it for many players would not come as a surprise.			"

												Greatest of all time/10. My personal favorite metroidvania. Yours too if you play it. Probably the funnest exploration game to come out ever. The music is incredible, with an epic piece for over 18 areas chances are you'll find a track to add to your music collection. The remake has beautifully updated the graphics from the old and sexy 8-bit style. To new a cool modern day take on side scrolling style. If you like metroid, castlevania, Gun Girl II, Iji, or any other 2-d exploration  game, you'll love La-Mulana.Just don't try the Hell Temple.			"

												It is very difficult and rewarding. Be prepared for very cryptic and obtuse exploration/puzzle elements. If you are familiar with old games such as Milon's Castle or Simon's Quest this is the best example I can think of to compare it to. However it is a step up from old titles such as these thanks to the enhanced art style and soundtrack, plus, from what I can tell, it is a much larger game world as well. I played this with a gamepad and it worked really well. It took me about 50 hours to beat this game and I had to use a walkthrough to get out of areas i was stuck in around 10 times. Good luck.			"

												For the love of all that is holy, take notes! As someone who has played this game a ton and even re-bought it on steam (to show support), you NEED to take notes to fully enjoy this game.It isn't hard to have a little notepad off to the side, make sure you write down every little detail you scan from tablets, and where you found it! It doesn't take as much effort and will save you tons of pain!For those who haven't wussed out by now, congrats! You have one of the most fun and rewarding experiences in gaming ahead of you!Just remember, if you get reaaaaaaally stuck, rather then getting frustrated, just get some help, just try not to spoil everything, or you will deprive yourself of the joy of discovery.As a side note, if you are interested in the metroidvania combat and exploration in this game, but hate super obtuse and hard puzzles, don't feel bad about using a guide. One of my friends did that and still enjoyed the game immensely, because the game has some really good mechanics and super good boss fights.			"

												Fiendish, evil, difficult and punishing. But over anything, marvelously crafted. For me, this is a masterpiece. A very underrated masterpiece.This game is like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of Super Metroid, Indiana Jones and Spelunky. In a certain way it feels like a far away cousin of Cave Story... but even the hardest places in CS will look like a walk in the park. You'll learn, with brutality, your place in this world again. Graphically speaking, this game is flawless. The sprites, in a semi chibi style, are charming enough and the backgrounds are very nicely drawn. This is essential to solve some of the puzzles. The ""hud"" is very unintrusive (Except in a couple of places where it covers the punishment eye) and everytime you equip or use something, you can see it reflected in your big photo in the items screen. The controls are good, and unless you're trying to beat the bonus unlockable dungeon, you will never feel the need to throw your control far away.The music is amazing. It gives the perfect feeling wherever you are, and is good enough to be purchased separately. The sound effects are okay for the things you must do and even the sound of the horn is different depending on if you solved a puzzle or triggered a trap.And speaking about traps... Like I mentioned before, the main detail about this game is its sheer difficulty. This game is hard due to the puzzles. Every single puzzle is solvable if you pay attention to the in-game clues. And you'll have to pay attention to everything, because even the smallest picture of a snake in the background can be the key to solve a puzzle.The regular enemies are very easy to kill (most of them fall with just one or two hits of your weapon), but you'll have to play conservatively and keep your health: Replenishing it is difficult, and your only ""healing ponds"" are in the surface and in a place some hours inside of the game after solving a puzzle. Bosses are a different tale. They look imposing, very frightening, and the latter ones are extremely difficult. But as difficult as it is, this is one of the most rewarding and satisfying games that I've had the opportunity to play. Definitely recommended, even more if you find it with a discount.If you play this game, I cant stress enough the need of a copybook where you can take notes. Trust me, you will need it. If you've ever felt that you are good enough, that you can solve all the modern games and the pitiful challenges they give to you, this will make you fall on your knees. The only requirements for this game are a normal computer/laptop, a bit of ability with the controls, intelligence and ability to solve riddles. The last two ones are absolutely essential.10/10.PS: Read the manual before playing. it contains the solution to get the first and one of the most essential items in the game, the only solution not hinted inside of the game itself.

												I really suck at this game, and clearly I'm not the targeted audience, but I still acknowledge how rich La-Mulana is. It is very cryptic, but contrary to other games of this kind, it is well done: everything is here to help you solve its mysteries. It is very subtle and will make you think differently from any other game. It's really a hit or miss: it can either be exactly what you're looking for (and almost no other game will provide you a similar adventure, so that's really your only chance of getting that), or your worst frustrating and confusing experience ever. I recommend it because, like I said again and again, it really is a unique experience, it does what it does very well, and so it's a good addition to the video game landscape.			"

												Oh La-Mulana, you are so many things... La-Mulana is an Indiana Jones/Metroidvania that takes back the old school difficulty with todays gameplay. Slow to start, depending on your puzzle solving skill, the fun really picks up once you have momentum. There are several key features in this game, puzzles and traps. The traps will kill you, the puzzles will stump you. The difficulty of the puzzles give a great sense of satisfaction once you figure it out, and the traps keep you on the edge of your seat often.La-Mulana is rich with archaeologic referances and has an indepth story through discovery. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzles and platforming. However, there are a couple breaking bugs that may be encountered. Specifically in the Moon and Hell temples. There is a glitch that can get you stuck into the floor if jumping into a platform or floor a particular way. Failure to escape will warp you to the surface. Not usually a problem to be sure, however, if you are fighting a boss and this happens, you will be unable to warp or resummon said boss. Despite that, it is still a blast to play, and I loved every bit of it, even though it has made me hate everything and everyone sometimes.			"

It provides everything a gamer can ask for : Good graphics, Good music and SFX, good story, A LOT of gameplay the game is very long so expect to spend days and nights , A LOT of puzzles and the good thing about the puzzles is that they are all different, Backtracking guaranteed and i love that.My advice: read everything , everything , everything and try to think out of the box to unsolve different puzzles and don't forget that the solution for some puzzles are in a totally random different place, so be aware of that in advance.Highly recommended for the fans of the genre.

Somehow, it's all still charming enough to make it a good time for awhile, but eventually I just stopped.  I'll probably come back to it at some point, but it is only recommended with reservations.  Sixty-ish hours in and I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.You'll do everything you can not to Google solutions to tough spots...  then you'll break down and do it anyway.  Then you'll quit for long enough that you can't even remember where you left off and it becomes difficult to even use Google to cheat.  You'll genuinely love it.  Until it breaks you.  Then you'll still feel like saying nice things about it, but you may not want to play anymore.  Recommended for the smartest folks in the room and people who absolutely hate themselves.			"

												La-Mulana prides itself on being difficult. Difficult controls. Unclear objectives. Obtuse puzzles. However, the game promises a deep adventure and a sense of accomplishment whenever you are clever enough (or lucky enough) to force your way deeper into the ruins. Right from the very beginning, you will realize how dangerous your enemies and enviroment are, and the game will become a battle of attrition. Always proceed cautiously, save often, and take notes on any clues you uncover. Most of all, enjoy the game for the uphill battle it is and revel in the classic, 16-bit styled graphics and sound. La-Mulana is a gem, but it is not for the weak-hearted.			"

A challenge so hard the game not only kicks you in the balls, but also spits in your eye and laughs at your misfortune?La-Mulana might just be your answer to all three.La-Mulana is a Metroidvania-esque puzzle platformer following the adventure of Professor Lamenza in search of his father in the ancient ruins of La-Mulana. It's your job to not only find your father, but uncover the secrets of La-Mulana.This game features lots of devious, head scratching puzzles, tough and challenging boss battles and enough dubious traps to make you think the game REALLY doesn't like you.

												Addictive, sprawling, and extraordinarily difficult, La-Mulana is one of the most unique games I've ever played.There is an absolutely zero level of hand-holding, and you have to figure out the majority of game mechanics, mysterious puzzles and the way out of devious traps yourself. The game is fair towards the player most of the time, but there's a few instakill spots you have little to no chance of knowing about prior to encountering them (an example being a boss that instakills you at the beginning of the battle by jumping on you from the background). Luckily, quicksaving becomes available very early on, and the amount of progress lost by dying is usually not greater than a few minutes. In the meantime, you enjoy a fairly big health bar that gets increased as you're playing, and an ability to instantly warp out of most situations (bosses being the only exception I've seen so far) into the safety of a healing spot at the beginning of the game.The sense of freeform exploration of huge, otherwordly ruins, combined with nearly flawless character control and the unusual atmosphere created by a very dynamic soundtrack and great art direction keeps me wanting to return to La-Mulana and find out more about the story, solve more puzzles and beat more bosses.If you want a game to dedicate several tens of hours to, solve puzzles, explore old ruins, and face enormous boss entities, this is the game for you.

												Hmm, I might read a walkthrough and come back to this game, but as it is this is not even remotely fun to play for me. Reminds me a bit of Rick Dangerous with puzzles. Eventually I just have no clue what to do and while the game does a great job with the 8-bitish presentation, I'm just not motivated enough to try harder. Plus the game mechanics are not 100%, so you have to really put some elbow grease into it to not die that often. Overall certainly not bad, but unless you search for a serious challenge and have a lot of spare time to try things out, it might be not the MetroVania experience you're looking for.			"

												La-Mulana is one of the greats as far as metroidvanias go. In this remake of the original freeware game from 2005 La-Mulana you play as Professor Lemeza Kousgi who sets off on an adventure to explore the fabled ruins of La-Mulana. Be warned though: this game is tricky. Even the best players might find themselves referencing guides on occasion. It's no small wonder why people call it the “Dark Souls” of 2D platformers.In true Metroidvania fashion you collect collect mystical objects from throughout the ruins. These can be anything from new weapons to new abilities to something that just makes it a little easier to survive. With every treasure you collect you feel yourself grow a little stronger, and it's a great feeling to behold. Conquering challenges you never thought possible and scaling to new heights and exploring new areas feels great. Did I mention the music? A++ music... in fact even if you're not getting the game I suggest you go to a website called “Bandcamp” right now and look up “La-Mulana”. You won't be disappointed, trust me.There are some complaints I had about the game though. Sometimes the puzzles and platforming sections just feel “Cheap”. Like the answer to a puzzle was so obscure you HAD to look up the answer to get past. Or you HAD to die on that trap at least once (or be able to see the future) to avoid it. The controls are stiff as well... but reasonable, and once you learn what you can and can not do Lemeza becomes a lot easier to control. Overall I would say this game is a must have for anyone looking for a challenge or any fans of metroidvanias. The puzzles are hard, the platforming is brutal, the bosses are relentless, and the adventure is fun from beginning to end... and it was worth every second and every penny paid.			"

												This game is one of the best games of its type I have played. I will say, this is one of those few games where reading the Maunal[la-mulana.com] really is helpful. This game values thinking out of the box. Clever use of boss mechanics, and item mechanics can make the impossible, really easy. There are secrets upon secrets layers deep. Every bit of lore is important. Almost every boss and mini-boss is a mytholigical beast, angel or demon. You start out so weak in the beginning, and it feels at times like its just crazy how difficult it is. Then you start to find items, and you go back to areas you really felt were just too hard, and find the tricks and ways past things, and every area is rewarding. Most of the puzzles that are really tough really value paying attention to everything. Ill say it again, some key mechanics involve items mentioned in the manual, you might really miss something easy like how fields are actually laid out. (hint: the in game maps are misleading) ... If you like side scrolling action adventures, with item collection, clever game mechnaics and deep puzzles and story, you will like this game. Just be prepared, pay attention to the little things. (Hmm that lamp isnt flickering? odd, are those walls glowing... thats an odd mark on the floor, looks just like this thing in the manual)			"

												This game is balls-to-the-wall difficult; In the sense that the walls are placed closely together like a vice, and behave uncannily similar to a meat grinder. Seriously though, the game is great, ingeniously difficult (Yet totally solvable) puzzles are littered in practically every room of the game, they just require you to do a little detective work and thinking outside the box using the tools on hand. If you can tolerate (Enjoy) the old school art, and manage with the archaic (albeit smooth) controls that the player has over Lemeza, the puzzle solving aspect of the game will have you hooked for hours inbetween whipping some fools and taking names.For fans of side-scrolling platformers, if you're sick of artificial difficulty thrust at you in the form of pixel perfect jumps/bullet hells then this may be the game for you. IF however you prefer your hand held lightly throughout the course of the game, coming to La-Mulana is certainly barking up the wrong tree. 8/10 - Game brings to mind Dark Souls, the overwhelming pressure of unfairness cracking under the relief of any progress.

												I still remember to this day having played the original, a free game meant to resemble the MSX games that were popular in Japan during the course of the 80's.  This remake retaines all of the 'real' difficulty present while cutting out the fake difficulty, and makes it feel more like a Super NES game than a MSX game.   The controls are remappable and are responsive, althought the jump physics take time to get used to, being Mega Man Physics for standing jumps and being more like Castlevania I-III for moving jumps.  The game's puzzles are fun, but tricky and some can be failed for the remainder of that run so be very careful and do not rush.I have to give this game a positive review.  It's a good Metroidvania that is welcome after the dissapointments in the two big names in that Genre, and I eagerly await the sequel.			"

												This is without a doubt one of the most enjoyable games I have played in recent memory. La-Mulana is an exploration-based platform game in the tradition of MetroidVania style games. You guide the hero through an ancient ruin, gradually able to explore further inside using items and abilities you collect, and will uncover the many secrets the ruins have to offer. The environments are interesting and it's the kind of game where you will always want to push forward just a little further before you stop playing..The way forward is not always clear though, and this game is very, very hard. Some of the puzzles have very obscure solutions, and you should expect to become stuck on more than one occasion. This is very much in the 'old-school' of games that very deliberately don't hold your hand (unless it's to throw you off a cliff...). Unless you look up a guide online (there are several) you will probably feel quite lost and unsure of where to go, or what your objective is at times. Whether you can deal with that will play a big part in whether or not you enjoy this game.Overall though, if you like games such as Super Metroid or Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, but wish they were ten times harder, you'll probably enjoy this. And I would recommend at least trying to go without a guide unless you're reeealy stuck, it will feel all the more rewarding when you do finally figure out how to move on.			"

												La-Mulana is HARD. It's REALLY HARD. With that said, this game is a 2D metroidvania platformer with an outstanding sense of open-ended progression. There is a definite beginning and ending, but what you do between those points is very much up to you. Like most metroidvania-style games, you'll come across new kinds of weapons and items which allow you to explore in new ways, opening new areas and making more puzzles available to the player. Have I mentioned the puzzles? Your wit and attention to detail will be pushed to their limits if you hope to complete this game. As for the combat, be prepared to have your butt handed to you on a silver platter later on. Enemies are vicious and unforgiving, and you'll need to figure out the best way to deal with each one if you want to safely make your way around this massive game. Everything about La-Mulana screams ""challenge,"" which makes every victory, even small ones, super satisfying. I highly recommend this game to anyone who can put up with a legit challenge.If you're on the fence about it, try the freeware version first. This is a remake of a free game by the same name. The free game was made to look, sound, and play like a game belonging on an MSX computer, whereas this version is more akin to a Super Nintendo or Playstation game that managed to get away with higher resolution and better special effects. There are some notable differences in combat and the puzzles you solve between the freeware game and this remake, so you could actually play both if you wanted to.			"

												What can't I say about this game? It has brought me nearly to tears of agony as well as joy for as long as I have played it. The intrepid archaeologist (this is you) finds his way into the lost tomb where his father was last seen. Riddles, puzzles, traps, agrivating enemies, traps, exploring, adventure and death all await you within the ruins of La Mulana. I have much experience with La Mulana and it's spiritual predecessor, Maze of Galious, and for this perhaps have a greater appreciation for what La Mulana really is. This game tests your reflexes and mind constantly in a sprawling labyrinth of traps and monsters with a story that puzzles and intruigues. Think you know what you are doing? You are probably wrong. Think Eden is the safest place to be? You must be a fool... it is just the begining...			"

												I didn't beat this game yet, or am I even close.  This game takes you back to the good ol' days when games had a challenge.  This game is entirely beatable without a guide of any sort, using your ingame scanner to obtain clue and solve puzzles.  With a good variety of areas, monsters, puzzles, bosses, and much, much more....this game is going to get a lot more time with me.As a huge fan of metroidvania games, this game has it perfectly.  It's like dark souls, metroid, and castlevania were all like ""yo lets get together yo"".  This game even has some humor which helps cope with the difficulty.  The soundtrack and sound effects are very pleasant to the ears.  The graphic style is pleasant to the eyes, and reminds me of Castlevania games on the gameboy.  I love when a game doesn't hurt your eyes after playing it too much, compared to some other games I own. If you enjoy old school fun, grab this game.    I picked mine up for $1.50 on a flash sale(which is a steal if I've ever seen one), when it's on sale it's typically $3.74, and when it's not it's only $15.  $15 might seem like a lot for a remastered version of a game from 2005.  Honestly, this rates up there with cavestory.  It's great.  Seriously. Buy this.  Alright, now that I'm done talking about what's great...let me be honest.  The jumping takes you back to the older castlevania days.  Do you remember how in mid air you couldn't move?  Well, this game lets you move...but it has sort of a delay.  Jumping in this game is more old school than anything, which can be annoying.  This game, similar to castlevania, also has a lot of knockback once you are hit.  This usually isn't too annoying, but in the Spring(water) level, you can easily get knockbacked by a fish over and over trying to traverse the elevators.  The game...at first will also confuse you.  I recommend trying to solve as many puzzles as you can in the gate area of La Mulana, as it will grant you the most useful item in the game.Besides slight annoyances which you get used to, this game is a solid 9/10.

												Do you love old-school platforming and adventuring? Miss the days when you needed a guide just to figure out what to do next?Well, this game has that. It feels like some kind of mix between Castlevania and Tomb Raider or...something like that. And it's hard. Like, really hard.But it's also really really good.Sure it's not for everyone, and the sometimes-brutal difficulty and obscure puzzles may put a lot of people off, but this game really feels like a love letter to the days when you had to spend four hours and thirty tries to figure out a certain level, but it sure does feel AMAZING when you finally make it.I actually stumbled across this game almost on accident, and believe me it's a hidden treasure. The controls are responsive and the soundtrack is so catchy I had to go buy it. I do recommend playing with a gamepad though.All in all, a wonderfully-crafted old-school game.

												Hightly recommend this game to everyone how likes action platformer games and Metroidvania style games with RPG mechanics.The game has a nice 16-bit look to it and the soundtrack is pretty awesome.I should note the game does get a little difficult as from what I can tell you have no health potions and healing springs are few and far between. Save and save often when you can make it to a save shrine.The one gripe I would have is the jumping in the game is kind of stiff and you can't control your jumps like you can in typical platformer games, so your jumps need to be timed more precisley and be deliberate.Killing monsters will sometimes grant you XP orbs and money and sometimes weights used to drop on switches to open doors and treasure chests.Overall if you are looking for a SOTN type game on PC then you should definitley pick up La Mulana.I give the game a solid 8/10.

There's probably no way you're not finishing this without a guide given some of the puzzles, but part of the fun in my opinion is seeing how far you can get without it. Cautious play and critical thinking are musts; charging around and whipping blindly in areas you haven't explored before is a sure way to die. All in all, a fun, challenging game and a breath of fresh air; excellent if you're a fan of 2D exploration platformers like Metroid and SOTN-style Castlevania.			"

												Having already beaten the origina MSX-style version, I can safely say the remake did everything I hoped Cave Story+ would have done. Outside of small item changes, the only issue I hate about this is the addition of instant-death traps. The point of the original was you could explore the many halls of La-Mulana and search all the corners without much punishment. Adding instant death parts makes for painful backtracking, ESPECIALLY near a CERTAIN ITEM UPGRADE.Otherwise, fresh game. Music has received a major upgrade, graphics add atmosphere, and Lemeza only looks slightly less fat.			"

												Was playing this on and off now for a while before wrapping it up recently and I've had a love/hate relationship with it. You feel really good when you are making progress and figuring out whatever BS puzzle/riddle the developers throw at you, yet really frustrated when you are stuck wandering aimlessly, grinding your wheels, then having to cave in bring up the guide for the umpteenth time. I'll unashamedly admit to using a guide to get through portions of the game, but I think all but the most observant and meticulous wouldn't be able to complete it without one. The game requires a lot of dot connecting between unrelated areas. While the puzzles/riddles are pretty structured, they aren't all partitioned and neatly laid out for you from area to area, so you essentially just need to write things down.Overall, I enjoyed my time with it, but it is a game that requires a lot of patience and perseverance to finish. I can see why several gamers of today would be repulsed by it. It is a deceptively deeper game than it appears to be, and aspects of it are ""hardcore"" enough to make Dark Souls seemed restrained. It you stick with it though, I think there is a lot of fulfilling stuff here. I'll all in for the sequel.			"

												This game is not well-liked by a lot of people, but it is because they do not understand how the intricacies of this game make the true experience. First of all, you are told that many have challenged the ruins, but none have come out. That is why you need to be cautious and it is possible to be stuck in the game forever without restarting the save file completely.This game requires you to live inside it like using Emacs as a browser. This game is never an escape from the stress of the world until you understand yourself better and patiently sympathize with the ruins as a genuine experience.My favorite part of the game is Time Attack. It has been declared impossible, but I plan to beat it.Every boss has a true strategy (or a few), but some require such deep knowledge that they appear unknowable foes. Perhaps, the same could be said for all of La-MULANA.....By the way, the valley in which the game starts out in is based upon Bahrun Valley of Nepal, where it is believed that an immortal race of humans lived. Now, it is uninhabitable, being to high in the mountains to remain in that place for long. There are many things to examine in this game which will deepen your appreciation for mythology. Without this game, mythology was almost impossible for me to grasp. It still is pretty hard to grasp, though.....			"

												This game is... so difficult, and not to mention incredibly frustrating. I have died so many times and been stuck at so many puzzles, but I just keep playing! Awesome bosses and great atmosphere, no matter how much you will hate it, beating that boss or solving that puzzle is immensely satisfying.			"

I highly recommend looking up a Wiki to find the Holy Grail for the first thing in the game because it completely changes the game from being frustrating backtracking and getting trapped to being playable and awesome.

												la mulana shares a lot of the design sensibilities i love about the king's field series. it opens with a brutal difficulty that eases up as you get a grasp on the mechanics and logic behind the game, features secrets behind secrets while punishing you for searching too randomly (spear traps in king's field, divine retribution in la mulana) and an undercurrent of comic sadism that isn't overdone to the point of becoming irritatingi think my favorite puzzle involves getting the key sword, which isn't actually a puzzle at all and forces you to disregard the pavlovian instinct of Don't Touch That the game had been instilling in you up to that pointthe remake itself is largely an improvement.  the fields and puzzles are easier while the bosses have been made more challenging.  i didn't care for the new bahamut fight, but the revamped baphomet and tiamat are incredible and definitely make up for it.  although the new soundtrack is good, i prefer the original music, and it's possible to swap it back in with a little looking			"

												La-Mulana is quite possibly one of - if not the - best Metroidvania title ever created.  Unlike others in the genre, the game's open-ended exploration is genuinely nonlinear in progression, and up until the very end of the game there will always be more treasures to discover, new areas to explore, puzzles to solve, and bosses to beat, at your own pace.  It's challenging, but fair - you'll not only need good platforming and action skills, but also an extremely perceptive eye and a sharp mind in order to find the secrets and solve the incredible number of puzzles in the ruin.  It's also capped off with incredibly detailed lore and a hand-drawn world full of detail, and accompanied by some incredibly memorable music.The end result is a game that leaves you feeling like all of your progress is specifically your progress - your achievement, your success.  Every little step, every puzzle you manage to solve and new area you explore, feels like a victory, from beginning to end.			"

												What can't I say about this game? It has brought me nearly to tears of agony as well as joy for as long as I have played it. The intrepid archaeologist (this is you) finds his way into the lost tomb where his father was last seen. Riddles, puzzles, traps, agrivating enemies, traps, exploring, adventure and death all await you within the ruins of La Mulana. I have much experience with La Mulana and it's spiritual predecessor, Maze of Galious, and for this perhaps have a greater appreciation for what La Mulana really is. This game tests your reflexes and mind constantly in a sprawling labyrinth of traps and monsters with a story that puzzles and intruigues. Think you know what you are doing? You are probably wrong. Think Eden is the safest place to be? You must be a fool... it is just the begining...			"

												La-Mulana is HARD. It's REALLY HARD. With that said, this game is a 2D metroidvania platformer with an outstanding sense of open-ended progression. There is a definite beginning and ending, but what you do between those points is very much up to you. Like most metroidvania-style games, you'll come across new kinds of weapons and items which allow you to explore in new ways, opening new areas and making more puzzles available to the player. Have I mentioned the puzzles? Your wit and attention to detail will be pushed to their limits if you hope to complete this game. As for the combat, be prepared to have your butt handed to you on a silver platter later on. Enemies are vicious and unforgiving, and you'll need to figure out the best way to deal with each one if you want to safely make your way around this massive game. Everything about La-Mulana screams ""challenge,"" which makes every victory, even small ones, super satisfying. I highly recommend this game to anyone who can put up with a legit challenge.If you're on the fence about it, try the freeware version first. This is a remake of a free game by the same name. The free game was made to look, sound, and play like a game belonging on an MSX computer, whereas this version is more akin to a Super Nintendo or Playstation game that managed to get away with higher resolution and better special effects. There are some notable differences in combat and the puzzles you solve between the freeware game and this remake, so you could actually play both if you wanted to.			"

You could spend days, and I have, trying to figure out what is needed for a puzzle, boss fight, the next location.

												I didn't beat this game yet, or am I even close.  This game takes you back to the good ol' days when games had a challenge.  This game is entirely beatable without a guide of any sort, using your ingame scanner to obtain clue and solve puzzles.  With a good variety of areas, monsters, puzzles, bosses, and much, much more....this game is going to get a lot more time with me.As a huge fan of metroidvania games, this game has it perfectly.  It's like dark souls, metroid, and castlevania were all like ""yo lets get together yo"".  This game even has some humor which helps cope with the difficulty.  The soundtrack and sound effects are very pleasant to the ears.  The graphic style is pleasant to the eyes, and reminds me of Castlevania games on the gameboy.  I love when a game doesn't hurt your eyes after playing it too much, compared to some other games I own. If you enjoy old school fun, grab this game.    I picked mine up for $1.50 on a flash sale(which is a steal if I've ever seen one), when it's on sale it's typically $3.74, and when it's not it's only $15.  $15 might seem like a lot for a remastered version of a game from 2005.  Honestly, this rates up there with cavestory.  It's great.  Seriously. Buy this.  Alright, now that I'm done talking about what's great...let me be honest.  The jumping takes you back to the older castlevania days.  Do you remember how in mid air you couldn't move?  Well, this game lets you move...but it has sort of a delay.  Jumping in this game is more old school than anything, which can be annoying.  This game, similar to castlevania, also has a lot of knockback once you are hit.  This usually isn't too annoying, but in the Spring(water) level, you can easily get knockbacked by a fish over and over trying to traverse the elevators.  The game...at first will also confuse you.  I recommend trying to solve as many puzzles as you can in the gate area of La Mulana, as it will grant you the most useful item in the game.Besides slight annoyances which you get used to, this game is a solid 9/10.

												La-Mulana is one of the greats as far as metroidvanias go. In this remake of the original freeware game from 2005 La-Mulana you play as Professor Lemeza Kousgi who sets off on an adventure to explore the fabled ruins of La-Mulana. Be warned though: this game is tricky. Even the best players might find themselves referencing guides on occasion. It's no small wonder why people call it the “Dark Souls” of 2D platformers.In true Metroidvania fashion you collect collect mystical objects from throughout the ruins. These can be anything from new weapons to new abilities to something that just makes it a little easier to survive. With every treasure you collect you feel yourself grow a little stronger, and it's a great feeling to behold. Conquering challenges you never thought possible and scaling to new heights and exploring new areas feels great. Did I mention the music? A++ music... in fact even if you're not getting the game I suggest you go to a website called “Bandcamp” right now and look up “La-Mulana”. You won't be disappointed, trust me.There are some complaints I had about the game though. Sometimes the puzzles and platforming sections just feel “Cheap”. Like the answer to a puzzle was so obscure you HAD to look up the answer to get past. Or you HAD to die on that trap at least once (or be able to see the future) to avoid it. The controls are stiff as well... but reasonable, and once you learn what you can and can not do Lemeza becomes a lot easier to control. Overall I would say this game is a must have for anyone looking for a challenge or any fans of metroidvanias. The puzzles are hard, the platforming is brutal, the bosses are relentless, and the adventure is fun from beginning to end... and it was worth every second and every penny paid.			"

The depth is incredible. It can be excruciatingly difficulty but always FAIR in that the combat is never cheap and the puzzles (which account for most of the difficulty) always have 'hints' or 'clues' in the form of left journals or stone tablets.

Save and save often when you can make it to a save shrine.The one gripe I would have is the jumping in the game is kind of stiff and you can't control your jumps like you can in typical platformer games, so your jumps need to be timed more precisley and be deliberate.Killing monsters will sometimes grant you XP orbs and money and sometimes weights used to drop on switches to open doors and treasure chests.Overall if you are looking for a SOTN type game on PC then you should definitley pick up La Mulana.I give the game a solid 8/10.

												Was playing this on and off now for a while before wrapping it up recently and I've had a love/hate relationship with it. You feel really good when you are making progress and figuring out whatever BS puzzle/riddle the developers throw at you, yet really frustrated when you are stuck wandering aimlessly, grinding your wheels, then having to cave in bring up the guide for the umpteenth time. I'll unashamedly admit to using a guide to get through portions of the game, but I think all but the most observant and meticulous wouldn't be able to complete it without one. The game requires a lot of dot connecting between unrelated areas. While the puzzles/riddles are pretty structured, they aren't all partitioned and neatly laid out for you from area to area, so you essentially just need to write things down.Overall, I enjoyed my time with it, but it is a game that requires a lot of patience and perseverance to finish. I can see why several gamers of today would be repulsed by it. It is a deceptively deeper game than it appears to be, and aspects of it are ""hardcore"" enough to make Dark Souls seemed restrained. It you stick with it though, I think there is a lot of fulfilling stuff here. I'll all in for the sequel.			"

												I still remember to this day having played the original, a free game meant to resemble the MSX games that were popular in Japan during the course of the 80's.  This remake retaines all of the 'real' difficulty present while cutting out the fake difficulty, and makes it feel more like a Super NES game than a MSX game.   The controls are remappable and are responsive, althought the jump physics take time to get used to, being Mega Man Physics for standing jumps and being more like Castlevania I-III for moving jumps.  The game's puzzles are fun, but tricky and some can be failed for the remainder of that run so be very careful and do not rush.I have to give this game a positive review.  It's a good Metroidvania that is welcome after the dissapointments in the two big names in that Genre, and I eagerly await the sequel.			"

												Having already beaten the origina MSX-style version, I can safely say the remake did everything I hoped Cave Story+ would have done. Outside of small item changes, the only issue I hate about this is the addition of instant-death traps. The point of the original was you could explore the many halls of La-Mulana and search all the corners without much punishment. Adding instant death parts makes for painful backtracking, ESPECIALLY near a CERTAIN ITEM UPGRADE.Otherwise, fresh game. Music has received a major upgrade, graphics add atmosphere, and Lemeza only looks slightly less fat.			"

												I got this in a bundle some time last year and only now found it. Boy am I sad I waited. This is an incredible Metroidvania meets Spelunkey platformer. The upgrade system is well paced and looks like it leaves a lot of room for customizing (your computer is your upgrade system, it's neat). The movement is tight and consistent. It leaves out things we take for granted, like leaping on to ladders, now you have to start form the bottom and can't leap off adding a nice bit of tension to many situations. The puzzles so far are reasonable, although the game throws you in and doesn't explain a thing so sometimes it leaves you wondering if there's something you can do or if you're just running around the map swinging your whip like an idiot. Overall, this game is more than worth your time and it's a shame it hasn't been advertized more heavily.			"

												A combination of Dark Souls, Indiana Jones and classic platformers, this gmae will chew you up. With only 4 ways to tediously gain health, unforgiving enemies and evironments, and the utter frustration of being sent back thirty minutes for making the mistake of going in the wrong room, this game is one of the best adventures that I've played in ages- if you're up for the challenge, and boy it's a doozy. For anyone who is a fan of grinding their teeth through being dropped into traps a thousand times over, this game is a very well thought out adventure of fantastic agony. the only real downside to the game I've seen so far is figuring what the heck is going on at the start, but that is of course is part of the journey. I'd highly suggest this game for those up for the challenge. My few bits of advice: pay attention to every bit of information and your environments (I'm keeping information in a text doc), don't look up a walkthrough for a real, enduring challenge, and don't trust anything to not try and kill you.

												'A treasure chest looms across the room across a pit of spikes and above it lies a pyramid with an insignia of a hieroglyphic eye, which must signify some mystery waiting to be revealed.  I defeat the animated skeletons easily with my whip and take the time to decide what to do next.  If I played any other game I might just throw myself into the spikes to see what happens, but I think better of it.  Perhaps I need an item or a switch to press?  I manage to spot a stone tablet.  With my new hand scanner, together with translation software which I bought for a modest price, I read the ancient glyphs from the tablet: ""Courageous one, embrace the power. If thou seeketh power, prove thine courage.""  I decide to take heed and leap carefully down...  I land on the floor, unharmed by the spikes; they were merely an illusion, put in place to weed out the cowards.  I place a small weight on the pedestal beyond the spikes and await my prize...'Sometimes I find myself sick of playing a new game only to be 'hand-holded' through a tutorial or an area where I am repeatedly being told what to do and how to go about things.  It feels scripted and restrictive.  In the good old days, you got a paper manual with your game, which contained little tidbits of information to get you started, but after that anything could happen.  If you died, you asked yourself why and next time you were more cautious, deciding carefully next time whether to pull that switch or prioritise killing the smaller baddy before the larger baddy.  Games ::tested:: you, sometimes to the limit of your ability, right from the beginning.  You get frustrated, feeling like the game is laughing at you for your failure, but you either give up or rise above it.  You could always try and look up a guide on your crappy 56k internet connection, but it was more fun to discuss strategies with your friends.This game pays homage to that era with its 16-bit-era artwork which, if released 20 years ago, would probably best the majority of games on those systems, with slick images, animations and particle effects.  The controls are also excellent and fluid.  You jumped and missed the platform, only to fall to your death?  You have no one to blame but yourself.  The music is also excellent and catchy.  Overall, the game feels a little arcady and possibly a little cutesy, but beneath the shiny veneer is a challenge unlike any other.Weapons range from your trusty whip (which can later be upgraded) to shurikens and flares, which are useful for also lighting dark areas and solving puzzles.  Your inventory will eventually fill up with more ancient artefacts than you would expect to see in most other metroidvania-style games, giving a wide range of different uses, some which are pleasantly surprising and not the usual double-jump affair.  The boss encounters are epic, especially later in the game, and will test your wit and your agility as well as your reaction time and brute force.  After a few initial starting areas, you will find yourself in an increasingly complex and enormous dungeon, with secrets galore and clues distributed everywhere.  Nowhere is safe.  Research is your friend.It is true that this game is very difficult, but there is a seeming will to every solution in the game and the difficulty generally increases with duration of play.  It is unforgiving, punishing the weak, the clumsy and the mindless.  Trial and error will not work to solve the enigmas of this sacred place.  It is filled with a plethora of ancient creatures and mysteries that seem obtuse and seemingly bizarre.  However, do not be mistaken; intelligent minds carefully pieced together this sublime and monstrous challenge of your gaming skill.  Feel free to hide behind your cries of poor game design, because the truth is you just didn't try hard enough.  No one ever wants to admit to being beaten by a game and no one is here to hold your hand if you fail.  You give up... only to return back to give it another try because you thought up of a possible solution on the bus to work.  You eventually figure out that puzzle, or look it up exclaiming to yourself ""oh yeah, wish I thought of that"".  If only I had my 56k connection instead of broadband...I believe this game is an absolute indie treasure, a rubik's cube in your library that taunts you back for more glorious punishment.  It is the rosetta stone, massively complex and begging for a truth to be revealed.  It is a multifaceted precious gem, in a sea of kind and forgiving experiences provided by other games, which on occasion deny the very nature of the dangerous labyrinths and haunted corridors they were meant to portray.  This game is ::definitely:: not for casual gamers.  You have been warned.			"

												Wow. Just wow. Easily one of the best games I've ever played in my entire life. For starters, this game isn't for your casual audience. It seems it was developed more in mind for people who appreciated the classic style of platformers where the game doesn't hold your hand and tell you exactly what to do in lame man's terms. Story is great if you pay attention and read whats around in the game and put the pieces together.For starters, the music is top notch amazing. Each zone has its own tempo that really blends well in the scene or time in the game. Gloomy places have that mellow tempo while the starting zone has a very upbeat tone going. Same goes with the end game zones with their more climatic tones or feeling of eminent death. The whole game is a giant puzzle platformer where you go to and fro trying to solve puzzles reading tablets spread troughout the ruins while reading these also in turn explain the story. The game takes no time in tutorials or anything, it trows you straight into the game and its up to you to deduct where to go and what to do. Skipping clues or not reading what is in the background items or remembering what was said earlier will have you running around forever and I love this factor. Makes you pay attention and get into it. Traps everywhere, death around every corner and a puzzle just waiting to be solved or a boss to be figured out. Nothing is easy and thats how a game should be.Its also a great game to speedrun. Theres no real exact order and its not linear at all so if you want to try a method of beating the game one way that someone else didn't do, its completely plausible. You can go dungeon by dungeon beating each boss or you can fly trough the dungeons and fight the bosses all later. Its all up to you. Its a metroidvania style world so there are many zones that interlink and many ways to get around doing something in them.If its your first time playing it and you have no idea what your doing, this game can easily run you a good 20-40 hours of gameplay while if you want to speedrun you can also blaze trough in under 4 hours. Many ways to play it and well thought out on how to have the player engaged whether its your first or 5th playtrough. This is a game I highly recommend for people who love challenging games or love games in a style of games back in the earlier times of gaming.			"

												This is without a doubt one of the most enjoyable games I have played in recent memory. La-Mulana is an exploration-based platform game in the tradition of MetroidVania style games. You guide the hero through an ancient ruin, gradually able to explore further inside using items and abilities you collect, and will uncover the many secrets the ruins have to offer. The environments are interesting and it's the kind of game where you will always want to push forward just a little further before you stop playing..The way forward is not always clear though, and this game is very, very hard. Some of the puzzles have very obscure solutions, and you should expect to become stuck on more than one occasion. This is very much in the 'old-school' of games that very deliberately don't hold your hand (unless it's to throw you off a cliff...). Unless you look up a guide online (there are several) you will probably feel quite lost and unsure of where to go, or what your objective is at times. Whether you can deal with that will play a big part in whether or not you enjoy this game.Overall though, if you like games such as Super Metroid or Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, but wish they were ten times harder, you'll probably enjoy this. And I would recommend at least trying to go without a guide unless you're reeealy stuck, it will feel all the more rewarding when you do finally figure out how to move on.			"

												La-Mulana is one of the best games to come out in years. It has an incredibly deep and meaningful plot, crazy awesome boss battles, a top-notch soundtrack, incredibly satisfying puzzles, and an unbelievable attention to detail. The old freeware version had a pretty user unfriendly UI and the graphics, no matter their charms, could make a lot of things hard to notice. The remake pretty much clears up all of that and makes a few of the more obtuse puzzles slightly friendlier.La-Mulana is still incredibly complex and difficult though, and you need to be paying attention to everything if you want to get a good experience. A lot of people complain that the game is badly designed and makes no sense, and most of these complaints come from a poor understanding of what the game expects from the player. If you go straight to a guide every time you hit a wall instead of going around, reading tablets, and trying to reason it out yourself will make a lot of the puzzles seem arbitrary and nonsensical, but only because the lack of effort you've put in has robbed you of the context to understand why what you had to do made sense. If you run around without paying attention to the ruins, you'll miss of a lot of the game's more subtle hints and you'll think the game is badly designed, when in fact everything you need to solve every puzzle in the game is there and waiting for you to notice it.All that said, there are still some quirks to the game that you have to learn and get used to. The store page has a very helpful guide to getting started that covers what you should do in the overworld level before you even set foot in the ruins, and at least leafing through the instruction manual is a must. Once you clear the first area of the ruins, you should have a pretty complete image of what the game expects from you.			"

												It's wonderfully hard, and incredibly rewarding when you finally figure puzzles out. The best way I can describe it is a 2D Dark Souls mixed with Castlevania: SOTN mixed with Indiana Jones. You'll be exploring a massive complex of ancient ruins, solving the often-interrelated puzzles within, and engaging in heart-pounding boss battles. The game can be punishing at times, but if you're persistent enough to figure out everything on your own, you should have a good time.Sometimes boss fights can seem too daunting, but because of the mostly non-linear format, you can challenge the bosses in varying sequences. So, if you're having trouble right now, you can go explore another part of the ruins until you feel strong enough to face them.  Or you can just save up enough money to buy a gun and ammo and shoot that boss in their stupid face. That should teach them.tl;dr: if you like challenging games with a mix of puzzle solving and combat, you should probably own this game.			"

The depth is incredible. It can be excruciatingly difficulty but always FAIR in that the combat is never cheap and the puzzles (which account for most of the difficulty) always have 'hints' or 'clues' in the form of left journals or stone tablets. The story/theme lends it self so well to the genre I'm suprised that it is the first game like it. Over the last year or so playing it, it has swiftly found its way into my favourite games list for sure!			"

												A really tough metroidvania game that was originally released as freeware on the pc. This version is the updated gfx version that was released on wiiware. Play as a professor has he goes on an archaeological exploration of the ruins of La-Mulana. The difficulty curve of this game is extremely high but through trial and error and exploration you will be able to finish each of the dungeons and find treasures in La-Mulana. Each of the hints given from the stones and skulls are semi-cryptic and at first you won't know what they mean but as you play through further and further you'll begin to understand what they mean or how to solve the puzzles. Be careful while exploring as there are a lot of traps that will kill you instantaneously. Definitely not meant for people who aren't a fan of memory trial and error challenges (IWBTG), castle/dungeon style non-linear exploration (Metroid, Castlevania). Also I wouldn't resort to a FAQ as it will take away alot of the fun and point of the game. However I will recommend watching the 2nd video in the trailer as it will explain the controls and get you started, since otherwise you'll get placed into the game with no real knowledge on what to do.

												La-Mulana: The Masochistic Man's Fetish.La-Mulana is a metroidvania-style jump'n'run with puzzle elements, in which you explore the eponymous ruins in the skin of the Indiana jones lookalike Lemeza. This exploration process is not entirely easy, however - the ruins are full of monsters and contain many traps that will kill you instantly should you make a wrong move, not to speak of boss monsters that feed on your tears. Healing is only possible by teleporting straight back to the starting area. Atop of this, La-Mulana is full of riddles and puzzles that will see you wrack your brains for hours on end, with many of them requiring you to read text on one side of the ruin complex to activate a mechanism on the other one. In truth, chances of you making it through the game without the guide or a very sizeable amount of spare time are quite small.Despite (or perhaps because) of the game's challenging nature, playing through it is an immensely rewarding feeling - each boss that drops before your feet causes your brain to dish out an entire flood of dopamine, and the fact that you actually will spent no small amount of time on reading and interpreting ancient texts from wall frescos and the like actually makes you feel just a little bit as if you're a real archeologist rather than just a 2d character moving from item to item.TL/DR: If La-Mulana was a steak, it would be raw, bloody, tough, chewy, and it would have an absolutely fantastic taste.

So, I decided to invest in the game for myself! Especially with La-Mulana 2 comming out in the near future I wanted to experience the first one before jumping into the second one. This game is a genuine masterpeice!! I am astounded by the amount of mythology and clever references they make, you can tell they did their homework and to me the addition of those references make the game a true work of art! The game has great controls wonderful stage design, manty different styles of weaponry and items to gather that ALL place a vital peice in the works of the games natural progression, EVERYTHING has a purpose and I love that! It has ppresented me with a many challenging parts and the puzzles are insane to the point where I have pulled out a peice of paper and kept my own notes. I will cut my rambling short here cause I could go on and on about this game!La-Mulana is genius! I look forward to more games from the creators and cannot wait for La-Mulana 2!!			"

												There are three ways you can play La-Mulana:1) Accept defeat. Use walkthroughs or Let's Plays when you get stuck. Risk being spoiled. Meet that old friend of yours you haven't seen since the days when Point and Click Adventures were all the rage: that awful, gross feeling of knowing you could have figured something out on your own with just a little more patience.2) Be patient. Invest a lot of time. Go everywhere you can think of. Reread the hints the game gives you over and over again. Try everything you can think of. Get stuck. Eventually figure things out by accident. React with anger or laughter.3) Get yourself a notebook and start making a map of the game's massive levels. Write down every hint, note everything down that looks suspicious. Become Professor Lemeza. Somehow, miraculously figure out what the obscure hints are trying to tell you to do. Be very, very proud of yourself. Then get stuck again and repeat the process.None of these options sound appealing to you? Well suck it up, buddy. Because you will want to play this game. Why? It's a Metroidvania on a truly massive scale, with gorgeous graphics, incredibly catchy music and kickass bosses, mixed with puzzles that if you do manage to solve them, will make you feel accomplished like nothing else.Oh yes, there is going to be frustration. But that's part of the fun, isn't it?			"

I got the surface level's theme stuck in my head now and the only negative about that is that I'm too tone deaf to hum the tune correctly. I wish I could find my old copy, if only to compare that with the current version and see where I left off.

												La Mulana does not want to be beaten, with tough boss fights and numerous highly convoluted puzzles (seemingly unfair at times) you will need to invest a lot of energy and time towards overcoming these challenges. Which is why I adore this game, every bit of progress feels highly rewarding.     If you're one of those people who avoid using guides/FAQs, I recommend keeping a notebook filled with what is written on the markers, important things npcs say, and maps of the areas. I did this, and  there were a large amount of puzzles I wouldn't have been able to solve without being able to look over certain clues.

												La-Mulana has an heir of nostalgia to it. It has a lot in common with games I grew up with. Very fun Metroidvania game if you like exploring and stumbling around trying to figure out what to do next. It's a game that requires some note taking to get through it and even then I still was stumped two or three times to the point of looking up what to do next. Some may call that a flaw but I enjoyed trying to figure it out on my own. The combat in the game is pretty good, although it takes a little getting used to the character's jump since you can only change it's arc a certain way. All in all a fun game that I've sunk plenty of time into it for what I originally paid for it. I'll be looking forward to it's sequel when it finally is released.			"

												Do you like hard games? I like hard games. La-Mulana harkens back to the days of yore when video games were hard and played on the MSX, which makes no sense to most of us westerners. It's a platforming adventure in the style of Indiana Jones, where you whip and shoot monsters and explore ruins for ancient treasure. The story of the ruins is bigger than it first appears, and only by reading the tablets and walls yourself can you figure it all out. La-Mulana doesn't baby the player, it expects you to remember things it tells you, think outside the box, and be ready for one of the most challenging adventures you'll ever have.			"

												Simply incredible. An adventure/platformer game (aka ""Metroidvania"") in which you star as an Indiana Jones-style archaologist who explores some ancient ruins to find old treasure. Yet, anyone going into this expecting a traditional Metroidvania experience will be in for a shock; though all the elements are there, the challenge has been signifcantly increased thanks to the abundance of puzzles scattered throughout the ruins. Not just basic ""find the right key for this door"" or some ripoff of Simon, these puzzles are incredibly obtuse; their answers only deducted through various clues located throughout the ruins. If you are one who refuses to consult FAQs or guides, then you'd better have a notebook handy, or make liberal use of screen captures. It can be very frustrating, especially at first, when you don't even have an inkling what you're supposed to do. On the other hand, nothing quite compares to the feeling of finally solving a puzzle, or beating a particularly difficult boss (of which there are several).The graphics are quite good, a noticeable increase in detail and colors from the freeware original (although those MSX-style graphics had their own charm; it's a shame they weren't included as an alternate texture pack), very reminiscent of 32-bit platformers like Castlevania Symphony of the Night. The music is phenomenal, recalling the styles of it's 8-bit inspirations, such as Castlevania, Ys, Maze of Galious, and Gradius. If you play thgis game long enough, you will likely end up getting the soundtrack, it's that good. I find it hard to talk about the individual tracks, because this would end up being a music review; every track suits its area well.The controls are quite stiff, and will lead to much frustration, but that's not to say they're _bad_ controls. Once you get comfortable with the way Lameza moves, you'll find you can pull off some quite impressive moves.As hard as the game is, there is also a secret area for those seeking a new challenge: Hell Temple. You cannot even unlock and find it until near the end of the game, and its reward is rather... interesting. And if that's still not enough of a challenge, the game has a secret unlockable hardzone that can be unlocked in one of the areas... and then you can to Hell Temple in Hard Mode as well. It's much, much more challenging, and the reward is no different than before (except for the pride one feels at having accomplished it).Speedrunning is another fun thing to do in this game; it's very nonlinear, even by Metroidvania standards; most of the time, you simply need to solve the right puzzle or find the right item to advance; only in a few cases must you actually defeat bosses to move the game forward. My first playthrough was over twenty hours;'since then, I've replayed several times, and have managed to beat the game (including Hell Temple) in under five hours. Very flexible, very open game... once you play it enough, it starts to click.Anyway, I could go on and on; I can't recommend this game enough, but only for those with the patience and dedication to overcome some SERIOUS challenges. PLAY IT!			"

												10/10 game. Production values and graphics are crisp, music is amazing, and physics are tight. You will love this game if you like Castlevania and Metroid. It creates a great oldschool experience of not knowing where to go next, but in a good way. Tablets scattered among the ruins explain lore and give cryptic hints about where to go and what to do. Early on, it is possible to stumble through a third of the game just by exploring, but you must solve the puzzles and mysteries by thinking, which is a very refreshing change.			"

												In brief, La-Mulana is a game with very challenging platforming, tricky puzzles, viscous traps, difficult bosses and very few clues where to go next wrapped in gorgeous art style with rocking music. If you've played Dark Souls, and savour the rewards it brings to every little progress you did through all the hardships, pain, tears and blood. I do believe you'll enjoy this game. You WILL die a lot in this game.  You might get discouraged and get angry at most part like I did. But getting new items, progressing through that room you though was impossible to beat, defeating that boss you've been trying to kill for hours, the feeling of accomplishment is its own reward. I recommend this game absolutely. "

												""Nigoro’s La-Mulana is like Castlevania: Symphony of The Night spliced with Dark Souls. It is long, it is tough, it is involved and it has puzzles that’ll make your brain bleed."" - Indie Game MagThis quote hits the nail on the head.This is the re-make of the original (free) La-Mulana that came out in 2005.In its essence, La-Mulana is a side-scrolling action-platformer. But it is also a game in which you explore a ruin. A ruin with a secret that will take you anywhere between 20 to 40 hours to unravel, on your first playthrough. Like a proper Metroidvania-style game you can freely move between most of the game's zones, skip some and come back to do them later. The game is teeming with puzzles that will make you scratch your head as well as tough encounters with all sorts of enemies, including over 40 bosses and sub-bosses.If you like side-scrolling action games you owe it to yourself to pick this one up. It's very polished, the controls are great (also supports USB-gamepads!), the music is phenomenal and the amount of content is simply astonishing. This is a title that will NOT let you down (assuming you don't give up on some puzzles).My recommendation: Don't use any walkthroughs on your first playthrough!""Finally, I reached La-Mulana. The adventure starts here!""			"

												To start: I normally add a header to these reviews describing my ethos on scoring a game on the four criterion I chose. Since I've been running out of space more and more, I'll just keep it on my Backloggery page.Gameplay: Ah, La-Mulana. A game that I often wonder where it would be today if it weren't for the helpful proliferation of the original by a certain DeceasedCrab. This game can be described in short as a very open-ended Metroidvania-esque game, although that description certainly sells this game short. The ruins of La-Mulana are gargantuan and certainly give a considerable impression that prior civilizations did in fact live here. There's three major aspects to this game: platforming, combat, and puzzles. Platforming is really weird at first, but you definitely get used to the controls. They're not bad controls; they just have a lot of weird quirks, such as not being able to jump off of a ladder and only having a good amount of movement control in air after the apex of the jump. Fortunately, a lot of the rooms in the game are designed around this control scheme, with Hell Temple being a perfect demonstration of just how good the controls and the level design synergize to produce very tight platforming.Combat is pretty bare-bones at times, but once you start getting more and more weapons, it becomes a lot more enjoyable. There are also plenty of items and software combinations (you've got a computer thet you bring along with you) that change certain attributes of the weapon, such as damage and attack rate. Enemies that don't just walk along a path are surprisingly clever, and even the enemies that patrol a platform are still very fun to fight. There's quite the variety of enemies in the game. Even though there are a few reskins, the reskins typically have enough changes to differentiate themselves from their unskinned counterparts. There's also plenty of minibosses which can be rendered useless by a certain item, but I'd still recommend giving these bosses a couple of shots without that item. Bosses are certainly a lot more interesting here than they were in the original. With the exception of Palenque, there really isn't any boss you can troller-coaster your way through. There's ten bosses in total, counting the one at the end of the Hell Temple, and they're all memorable; especially the final boss. The only boss that I didn't think was that good design-wise was Sakit, but that's mainly because it was just a really boring and tedious boss that took too long.Now it's time to talk about puzzles. This game has a lot of them. Fortunately, you'll hardly ever have to go into a puzzle completely blind, as there are at least a couple of hints for every puzzle scattered throughout the temple, usually within that particular area. Despite this, I did notice a surprising amount of times where I had an idea for a certain puzzle that didn't work in this game, but would've worked perfectly fine in the original. This may just be me thinking like the Nigoro staff; I dunno. Nine times out of ten, if I ever needed to look up a particular solution to a puzzle, it was because I didn't notice an element in the background, or a more specific case later on, I didn't see that there was a teleportation wall. I'll go over this in more detail in the Graphics section, but that was basically my biggest beef with the puzzle solving. Apart from that, I wish that weights were a multiple use item. It's pretty annoying whenever you have to exit an area and lose your progress just because you didn't buy enough weights.Overall, there's only one room in the entire game that comes to mind as being terribly designed (the Witch Room in Hell Temple aka the only reason why I haven't beaten Hell Temple). However, for a game as big as La-Mulana, that's an incredible feat. 10/10.Story: I mentioned earlier that the ruins of La-Mulana felt like actual ruins. This is mainly helped by the fact that nearly every bit of dialogue is written in an ""ancient"" fashion. The story itself pans out much like the Souls series in that your involvement with the story is as much as you want. On the surface, it's just you exploring a temple and killing God at the end. However, start digging deeper, and the story starts to really come together, with lore from various areas weaving as seamlessly as the areas themselves do physically. The biggest highlight story-wise for me came from when things went down in Eden (you know the bit if you've played the original/are reading this review post-mortem style). The game does give you a lot to think about, and if you wanna get the full scoop, you're gonna have to think like an archaeologist. Just like Lemeza. 10/10.Graphics: Now, the adverts describe this game as being 16-bit, but I'd have to disagree with that. It actually looks a bit more 32-bit like Symphony of the Night. Whatever you wanna call it, though; it's freaking amazingly done. There is an absolutely absurd amount of detail in the areas; a bit too much for me at times. This is what I was talking about earlier with my issue of not seeing things in the background. Again, this is just me and not a mark against the game, but this seemed like a better place to bring it up. Regarding the technical aspects, it fullscreens to pretty much any resolution your monitor may be. It does have the sidebars, much like the 360 port of SotN and they cany be changed as well, which is always nice. Overall, I can tell that a lot of time went into making the areas look as great as they possibly can, even if the amount of detail can be a little bit overwhelming for me. 5/5.Sound: Holy butts, this soundtrack owns. No, seriously, this soundtrack is absolutely top-notch. I definitely went and got the OST after playing the game. This is the kind of soundtrack that can get stuck in your head very easily, although the songs are so good that you won't mind it a bit. All I can say is go listen to Wonder of the Wonder, Interstice of the Dimension, and Grand History if you need convincing that the soundtrack is top notch. 5/5.Overall scores are: 10/10/5/5; cumulative score of 10/10. Hey, another perfect score! This game has certainly earned it, though. I just wish I had played it sooner so that I would have been more willing to contribute to the La-Mulana 2 Kickstarter. Oh well; it got it's funding even without me..			"

												A metroidvania style game with an incredible depth! The game also hates your guts, and you will hate it too, in the best kind of way.Old school punishing, but taking your time to think the puzzles through and being patient enough with the bosses will result in being rewarded with a tough and exciting experience!Except for the Gate of Illusion and Mantras, though, I have no idea how people managed to clear those sections without a guide, christ.Still, a ♥♥♥♥ing excellent game in all the ways!

												This is more of a puzzle game than a metroidvania game, and quite a stacked game too. I played over 30 hours and I don't even feel like I'm close to the end. Keep in mind that this game IS cryptic and you WILL use a guide at some point. Even though a lot of the puzzles can be obtuse, you can see how lovingly well the pieces are put together. Even the puzzles that I googled impressed me from the given clues that I have not properly followed. I have not yet pieced the historical glyphs together quite yet, but the lore in this game is pretty facinating too. To make it short, this is no typical indie game, or even metroidvania game.The graphics and music are pretty nice too, gave me GBA vibes. Gameplay is classic Castlevania with a Metroid/Galious style map, so fans of those game will feel right at home.If you really want to get decently far without guides these are some tips I reccommend1. Write everything, EVERYTHING! I solved a lot of the puzzles from just reffering to my notes and making connections.2. Look very carefully in your environment, if something is off or important KEEP NOTE OF IT.  3. Talk to NPCs every once in a while. There's an NPC you will meet later that will give you some really useful info the more you progress  4. When you see a puzzle and don't know what to do, SCAN EVERYTHING. I solved quite a few puzzles just from randomly scanning.5. You don't have to kill every boss as soon as you find them. There's a lot to collect, so maybe there's be something out there to help you defeat a boss easier.6. EXPLORE! Go back to locations you think you haven't. Keep in mind that this is a metroidvania, so attack walls and find false turrain.Even with these points in mind, don't feel discuraged for cheating with a guide. This game is designed to be a jerk, but at the very least try as hard as you can to keep the magic of the game. If you don't want to bust out the notepad/paper or bust your brain, avoid this game. If you're ready for quite the unique jouney and are willing to put serious dedication this is a must play.			"

												It’s great that games like this are still being made. La-Mulana falls into that rare breed of platforming and exploration that expects you to keep a pen and paper nearby. Pulling a lever you just found makes something rumble in the distance, several skeleton-filled screens away, but it’s up to you to notice what’s changed. The game gives precious few clues on how to deal with certain things, like bosses you can’t damage until you have the right item, or fiendish puzzles that punish incorrect solutions with death. It’s the type of game that wants you to draw your own maps, make notes, and have fun exploring the well-crafted universe within. If you don’t ruin it for yourself by looking up guides online, the experience is incredibly rewarding.The developer’s own genre for La-Mulana is “Ruins Exploration Archaeological Action Game”, made in homage to old MSX games like Maze of Galious (1987). It’s just you, your trusty whip, and whatever wit you bring, versus a sprawling interconnected tomb full of mystery. The Steam version is based on the freeware game released a few years back, but remade from the ground up with various gameplay and visual improvements. Proper gamepad support has been added, along with achievements, a new area, and additional modes like Time Attack.			"

												This game is like Spelunky with puzzles. Puzzles that seem so obscure and disconnected. But once you find out how to do them, you are either mad that it made so much sense or mad that it made no sense at all. It's a great game,  you should try it it you have 40 spare hours.			"

												La-Mulana doesn't hesitate to strike unprepared players down when they least expect it. Whether you whip at the wrong spot or step on the false floor, La-Mulana will send you a painful reminder that this game is no walk in the park. But when you carefully observe your surroundings, you will learn the rules of the ruins. It requires patience, but you will be greatly rewarded. And there lies the magnificence of La-Mulana. Few games have managed to match the feeling of satisfaction and greatness which figuring out a puzzle or beating a tough boss in La-Mulana brings.This game is a hidden gem for those who are not afraid of challenges and as such it definitely needs more attention than it currently has!PS. The soundtrack is amazing! I just couldn't leave it unmentioned			"

												If you want a 2D Dark Souls, here ya go. This game definitely has its challenge, and it tends to be pretty unforgiving of screw-ups. The bosses are, except for the first couple, very challenging. The ruins really do feel alive to you once you read the tablets and take in the lore from the people you meet. If you are looking for a very challenging, fun, and addicting metroidvania, this is it. I have two complaints. First, some of the puzzles have hints that are REALLY obscure. Second, a couple of the boss fights felt cheap. That being said, the final fight is very hard but also one of the funnest boss fights in recent memory.In short, this game will test your skill and do so mercilessly, but it is worth every second.

												If you're a fan of the original freeware game, or just a fan of metroidvania-type games with truly challenging puzzles, you owe yourself to get this game. The game has been revised somewhat from the original release, some mechanics have been streamlined, but by no means has it been dumbed down.Also, 2 things for aspiring adventurers:RTFM: http://la-mulana.com/en/wp-content/plugins/downloads-manager/upload/lmlnpc_manual_en.pdfSeriously, the manual is required reading. It has some vital information that you will need during the game. Why is this? Because the original game was made to look and sound and feel like a genuine MSX game (it also had a kick♥♥♥♥♥manual) and this remake reflects on that. You totally have to play this game like some really old-school video game that will kick your♥♥♥♥♥if you don't PAY ATTENTION. Which leads me to point 2:TAKE NOTES. Take a pen and a notebook and start taking notes about everything you see and read. Nothing in this game is just fluff. Every bit of info, no matter how trivial, is useful at some point in the game. The game is infernally difficult at times, but as long as you pay attention to your surroundings and take notes and you'll figure everything out eventually.Edit for November 2016: I nominated this game for the ""there's something in my eye"" category, because the sense of accomplishment I got when I finally figured out a difficult puzzle was something that no other video game has ever given me.Also: Hell Temple.

												A wonderful platform game, focused on exploration. Very addicting gameplay, in the likes of many retro games (e.g. Rick Dangerous), which keeps you alert at all times. Both enemies and puzzles that you'll encounter in the ruins are quite tough; your wits and lightning reflexes are essential to overcome them. The game's music is great, very appropriate to the adventure you're in. The graphics have also been improved since the earlier (freeware) versions of the game. A must have for everyone! Thumbs up!

The environments are vast and varied, the puzzles are interesting, as is the lore of La Mulana.I never played it before because it is infamous for being incredibly difficult, yet in my experience it hasn't lived quiiite up to the difficulty level I expected, though it is a pretty damn hard game, don't get me wrong.Also, best ♥♥♥♥ing soundtrack ever of all time all years.

												La-Mulana is a hell of a nut to crack. Its original freeware release was built as an homage to brutal old MSX games, hence the absurd difficulty including lots of bats, 'get knocked down, start over' rooms and riddle-based crap bordering on Fez levels of incomprehensibility at times.This remake gets a lot of things right and wrong. It makes the system of saving and healing NOT completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and it fixes up a few puzzles for the better (in some cases by removing them entirely). But at the same time, the remastered aesthetic completely loses the pure retro charm, bossfights have been buffed to be harder by roughly a factor of eight, and some perfectly good puzzles have somehow been turned entirely inside their own ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s alongside some crummy new ones. The game is even MORE long-winded, grating, and obtuse now, and were it not for the few select things so sinfully abhorrent about the original release (grapple claw), I'd otherwise just recommend playing that.I guess I still like it but I doubt more than ever that I'll manage to finish it.

												People that love this game sure seem to love it, but quite frankly I am not in that group.  This game advances a lot of ideas from the era on Nintendo Hard games, without improving on the ones that really matter.  The movement/controls suck, I've heard they did this intentionally, and I understand why but that doesn't change the level of frustration a new player will encounter when they try this out.  There seems to be a lot of info about this game in a manual that you don't seem to get with a digital copy of this game from Steam which is pretty frustrating to start with.  The puzzles don't really make sense or at least aren't presented in a way that makes them understandable for beginners.  All this together creates a great experience for people that have a lot of time on their hands and want something really difficult to figure out. If that's you, if you want something difficult to muddle your way through, you will love this game.  This is the dark souls of indy metroidvanias.  For the rest of us, I wouldn't bother, check the achievements on this, there's a reason only about 20% of players got more than the two achievements you get after the first hour or so.			"

												If you were to rank every hour of video gaming I've spent this year, La Mulana will definitely take up the top 5 and the bottom 5 hours on that list. The other 15 hours fall somewhere between the two, though more on the positive than the negative. When it shined, it was glorious. When it was dull, it angered me to the point where I was too♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to sleep.La Mulana is a Metroid/Castlevania style game with the difficulty of Dark Souls with an Indiana Jones theme. The combat was second to none, and had some of the most memorable and fun fights in a 2D platformer ever. However, some puzzles were beyond the ""guess what I am thinking"" style.We're talking ""Pause the game for 10 minutes, then close the game, then load it, come back to this area and stand still for 30 seconds"" kind of puzzles. There are tablets that try to give you hints about the solutions, but CLOSING the game isn't one that really crosses your mind.Combine this with the fact that this game is even LESS linear than Dark Souls, it was easy to get stuck on a puzzle you didn't even know existed, or think you needed an item from another area entirely.Things were so bad, that the developer announced that La Mulana 2 (coming in January) will have much more straightforward and less obtuse puzzles. If it weren't for these complications, this game would hands down be my GOTY 2013. No contest. It was THAT good, but it was also THAT bad that I'm hardly even considering it as an option.I have incredibly high hopes for La Mulana 2. It may surpass Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance as king of the genre.			"

When it was dull, it angered me to the point where I was too♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to sleep.La Mulana is a Metroid/Castlevania style game with the difficulty of Dark Souls with an Indiana Jones theme. The combat was second to none, and had some of the most memorable and fun fights in a 2D platformer ever. However, some puzzles were beyond the ""guess what I am thinking"" style.We're talking ""Pause the game for 10 minutes, then close the game, then load it, come back to this area and stand still for 30 seconds"" kind of puzzles. There are tablets that try to give you hints about the solutions, but CLOSING the game isn't one that really crosses your mind.Combine this with the fact that this game is even LESS linear than Dark Souls, it was easy to get stuck on a puzzle you didn't even know existed, or think you needed an item from another area entirely.Things were so bad, that the developer announced that La Mulana 2 (coming in January) will have much more straightforward and less obtuse puzzles. If it weren't for these complications, this game would hands down be my GOTY 2013. No contest. It was THAT good, but it was also THAT bad that I'm hardly even considering it as an option.I have incredibly high hopes for La Mulana 2. It may surpass Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance as king of the genre.			"

												La-Mulana has to be one of the best computer games i've ever played. It feels and plays like an NES game, I will admit the controls are a bit awkward at times but I just use an Xbox 360 controller so thats not a problem. The puzzles are challenging but the good kind of challenging. I would give this game a 10/10			"

												this game is dark souls in a puzzle form, you will die over and over again not from enemies but to the insanely hard to figure out puzzle mechanics this game throws at you, the game will you have do the most obscure things to solve a puzzle.for instance i had no idea until i consulted a guide that i had to stand infront of a door and use a doll to make a ladder appear in another ruin.it's true what everyone says, write down every little piece of tablet that you see because if you are planning on playing this game blind then you might not make it very far.some puzzles can only be solved by going to another ruin and back to the other ruin you were in.this is truly, truly a masterpiece, it will challenge most seasoned puzzle fanatics!

												Basically a Metroidvania more aimed to puzzles and clue hunting. The ruins are massive, and puzzles will get more complicated as you advance in the game, to the point that you will need to write down some tips and possibly look up in the internet what to do when you're nearing the endgame. It's very satisfying to do it in your own. Controls feel a bit weird, specially in the jumping mechanics, but it's not too bad. Music is amazing, one of my favorite OSTs of all time.

												Good, but essentially for hardcores only. Though a Metroidvania game with immense depth to it, it's very possible to get permanently stuck if you enter certain rooms without obtaining the proper items needed to overcome obstacles or even backtrack. Enemies don't drop much money, which makes buying pricey items a pain. There aren't many healing locations either, and the cryptic clues aren't helping matters either.			"

												I'm a huge fan of platformers and Metroidvanias. I want to like the game but simply cannot get over how bad the controls are. The entire game reeks of an almost pretentious ""look how hard this game is! look at the obscure everything!"" but the foundation, its platforming, is a trainwreck. Not worth a purchase at any price imo. If a platformer can't get its act together and have decent controls, it's not worth your time. there are difficult games out there that are hard for the right reasons and not because you have to wade through molasses to solve puzzles that provide almost no feedback as to your progress.

												Off of Playism and now on Steam. Oh, boy, where do I start.La-Mulana touts itself as an, 'Archaeological action game,' and it shows. The many trials and riddles will beat you; even those who played the original freeware release may find themselves at a loss. This remake really shines through in graphics, audio, and refined gameplay, allowing the challenge to be based mainly on the gameplay and not the controls or wonky visuals. The PC version also touts a commendable amount of features (widescreen, controller support, filters, screen borders, mod support, cross-distribution save compatability).There are flaws, however. The game can get very tough and confusing, and some items can be missed altogether. While not a flaw in itself, it is frustrating enough to cause a player to end up using a guide, which can demean a good portion of the gameplay. The greatest reward is solving a difficult puzzle on your own; having a guide makes the game more painful than it already is.If you want a challenge, in both skill and wit, definitely try La-Mulana. It is a solid platformer, improving over every aspect of its original form, that tries its best to beat you down, while giving you more reason to keep going. If you've beaten the original (on your own), you'll definitely enjoy this at full price. If you're skeptical, there is the original version to try out, which cannot do this version justice.			"

												La-Mulana is super cheap today... is it worth the price? Hell yeah it is.La-Mulana is a Metroidvania Platform Adventure game. I consider myself quite the expert at these kinds of games with a lot of 100% completions, speed runs, sequence breaking and so on... and even I must admit that this game is not a simple ride. If you're looking for something that will tingle your adventure senses and keep you entertained for a good 30 hours or so at least,   this game will keep you thoroughly engrossed. The graphics for this game were updated to a more SNES style for the remake, and gives it that special retro charm of that era of games. Once you start exploring the game, you'll learn just how finally crafted all the features and the areas are, but the clues sometimes feel like the live in moon logic. Just... check everything and hit everything. Getting into new areas and trying new things out is the heart of the game, and La-Mulana pulls no punches. As soon as you discover how to get into new areas, the difficulty of the game will jump with it.This is is still probably one of my favorite games, and there's a lot to it that adds to the replay factor of the game. Also, the game will run on virtually anything... but have a gamepad handy if you've got one. Oh, and if do beat this game, tell me.			"

												Rock hard Metroid-vania styled game. Be prepared to die a lot, but the game is just awesome for the persistent player. The soundtrack kicks♥♥♥♥♥with several tunes that stick to the brain (I love Gradius like Inferno Cavern tune). While playing this game, don't be afraid to use a guide because the game is very hard. Not every puzzle you solve is immediatly clear and sometimes solving a puzzle in area 1 has effect in area 2. Or in it's backside. Lost me just there? :)If you like classic platformers like Metroid, Castlevania and Treasure of Usas, give La-Mulana a try. On one hand it is frustrating, on the other hand playing La-Mulana is very rewarding. Again, be prepared to die...a lot!			"

It doesn't tell you where to go, what upgrades you need to get, or anything, really, but you're freely left to explore and figure things out by yourself. SInce this game has one of the most labyrinthine setups of its genre, in addition to some geniuinely mind-moiling puzzles, it'll keep you busy for some time.   If you're hunting that old-school nintendo difficulty, welcome home.			"

												I tried. I tried my hardest to like this game. I looked past the nigh-impossible-without-a-guide puzzles, and the terrible boss design. I ignored the repetitive nature of the game itself. I even defended it against people that disliked the game. But I've passed the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ""event horizon"", and I can safely say this game is a turd. A great soundtrack is wasted on this game.The boss fights are my biggest gripe. The enemy hitbox is INSIDE its hurtbox on all occasions, and in a game where contact damage does more damage than actual attacks, you've got a moron on your development team. How can the player be expected to jump, within pixels of an invisible hurtbox, to attack the bosses weak-point.. when the bosses are CONSTANTLY moving?The game will also give you a hint in one dungeon, to be used in another to find a vague clue to another puzzle somewhere else. Before you know it, you're scanning a silhouette of Michael Jackson. [I'm not even kidding.]The platforming is satisfying enough, until they introduce an ice level in a game with dedicated jump arcs. What ♥♥♥♥ing idiot came up with that?Overall, the game is just.. a disappointment. There's so much lore in here that I care about, and I want to finish this thing. But I cannot look past these flaws. This is legitimately a bad game, in its very design. I'm actually saddened writing this. Oh well. Maybe La Mulana 2 isn't made by the same clueless morons that made this one, eh?			"

												you may ask why i'm reviewing this with such a low play time, well, I've reached my limit.I bought this from the holiday sale for less than a dollar, and honestly, I regret it. I bought this with a positive mindset, hoping to be able to write a positive review against all other negative ones.La-Mulana handicaps the player so badly that the entire difficulty of the game relies on it, there's plenty of cheap tricks and traps everywhere to take advantage of the player's handicap. Clever? no, cheap, really cheap. The controls themselves are so cryptic that even after reading the button configuration I couldn't figure out how to do something simple like reading signs and it took me a while to learn how to open treasure chests.the player's movement have a delay, which as many other features is a reference to castlevania, however, where castlevania's delay had a reason to exist, a justification for it, this game doesn't so i can only assume the main character is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or something.contrary to what other reviewers said, you can change your direction in a jump, but only when you jump straight up, and only when you reach the top of the jump. which quickly becomes annoying to do when climbing something.the enemies are cheap, they mostly move faster than you and have patterns designed to get you without being hit. when you are hit the character jumps back a huge distance, it's worst than castlevania X's!I was frustrated to the point of almost giving up before even entering the La-Mulana ruins from the title, which is close to where you start ( about 2 or 3 screens away ).the music is ok, it's repetitive and tries to be epic, but it gets tiring after a while, at least it changes within different areasthe graphics are nice, they try to be SNESish but in reality they are more like GBA games, they have a obvious strong influence from final fantasy 6 and the castlevania gba games.I've seen sites like tiny cartridge drooll all over this game because of how it is a throwback to older games and stuff, but honestly even in the 90s I wouldn't play this with much better games around. it feels like one of those experimental early playstation 1 games, in a bad way.this game has potential to be good, hell, it has potential to be awesome, but it's so focused in making you have a miserable experience that it's not even fun, it's definitely difficult yeah, but not fun in any way, in the end it feels like a chore, a really really annoying chore.( and I'm purposely avoiding saying things like ""oh this game is for masochists"" ""oh this game is so hard and wants to make you suffer"" because I don't want people to be encouraged to buy it and challenge themselves, it's not worth it. )go buy Rogue Legacy, it's a similar idea but done right.

												Within minutes this game felt like Castlevania 2, right down to the cryptic hints and clunky controls.  On top of that there's a few control choices that feel unintuitive.  The slabs where you save you have to press down to activate the save screen, but there's no indication that these are save points or even how to activate it.  I found out how to use it by accident.  A simple indicator on the screen is all that was needed here.The graphics are confusing.  I had a hard time telling at times what was a platform I could jump on or if it was just background.  Considering that the game has walls you can walk through anyway you'll have to try everything by trial and error.  There is not much for PC specific options here but even the most basic PC games have resolution options.  If you increase the resolution in this game it doesn't increase the resolution of the game, but instead creates a border around the game.  You can customize the border I guess... woo...If you want a game similar to Castlevania 2 for better or worse, then you'll probably like this game.  There might be a rewarding experience somewhere in this game but I haven't found it yet.  There are other games on Steam like A.R.E.S. that pull off Metroidvania better and I would recommend one of those games instead.TL;DR version:  Avoid unless you really enjoy Castlevania 2: Simon's Quest			"

												Oh, this has been a LONG time coming!Graphics:The graphics are VERY well done!  Very detailed and clorful, but also fitting for each area.  The animations for the sprites, espcecially the bosses, are very detailed and nice.  There is nothing bad looking in this game at all!   It's espeicaly nice to look at Tiamat.Sound:The music is very enjoyable and fun to listen to.  From the first ruin to the final boss's theme, all of it is great!  I even have a few of the songs on my computer for listening now and then!  I would love to have a limited edition soundtrack of this game!Control:Here is where I have problems.  If you think Lemeza will control like every other platforming hero, you are DEAD wrong.  Lemeza is one floaty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!  When you jump through the air, he flies like he has the momentum of a rocket (which makes pixel perfect jumping VERY hard), which is weird because if you just step off places, he falls LITERALLY like a rock!  No control.  Straight down.  Pretty much ever other platforming game has a charter that can move a bit while falling, but not Lemeza.  It's almost like he has dark matter in his pants!  But when he swims, he takes so much button mashing to swim around, and when he is at the top of the water, if he has ANY kind of momentum, he bounces along like a stone skipping a pond!  Also, don't expect perfect twitch movement, as any flick of the control stick (Yes, thankfully this game has controller support), and he spins to the OPPOSITE direction of where you need him to face!   Then you have the issue of Lemeza getting kicked back VERY hard when damaged and losing control of him until he hits solid ground.  This makes it very difficult in certain areas where there are many enemies and jumps.  There are even times where getting damaged kicks you into a spot where you are stuck in a perpetual fall, thus being unable to move and have to resort to teleporting away to fix it!  Lemeza is literally the WORST platforming hero ever!Gameplay:This is where I HATE the game.  The game's puzzles rely on you just wandering around, trying random crap to solve puzzles SOMEWHERE in the entirty of the ruins!  You will literally solve a puzzle that will unlock a chest or door ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE RUINS!  And many of the answers are so obscure that I ACTUALLY REQUIRED A WALKTHROUGH!  You will have to worry about scanning everything to learn the language, and smacking every wall for secret paths, even in places you'd never even think there would be a wall!  You all have to worry about having certain program combinations to power up weapons or unlock abilties which wouldn't be so bad, IF THE PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS ACTUALLY TOLD YOU!  Instead, they are game descriptions, forcing you to test combos through trail and error.But the most annoying is the bosses.  Almost all the bosses have a set pattern to learn before you can win.  A pattern that will kill you.  Over.  And over.  And over.  And gods help you is you screw up as most bosses will give you no quarter.  I have played hard games before, but DAYUM!  Then you have the final boss,..  I died the least to the final boss, who has the most obvious patterns and can even be cheesed with sub weapons!  I kill the boss's final form with the axe and pistol! , making it literally the easiest boss!So...  I have this to say.  I will admit this is a well made game, but I HATE it.  This is NIGORO's pride and joy, but I DESPISE it!  If you like difficult and unforgiving platformers, then you will ADORE this game.  But if you're like me and get frustrated easily, AVOID THIS GAME!This game will rip your soul out of your body, stomp on it, do digusting, vile, horrible things to it, hang it by it's toe nails, use it as a boxing bag, drop it into a grinder, throw the remnants into a bowl, mix with ghost peppers and wasabi, tossed into an oven with liver, cooked at 500 degrees for 20-40 hours, then pulled out, drowned in horseradish sauce and then shoved up the♥♥♥♥♥♥of your body, give you the middle finger and runs away with your self respect like it's a cheap ho.So, ummm...  that's a no.  It's a well made game.  But..  just.... no.			"

												This game is fun, but frustrating. I got to the point where I had no clue where to go and had to look up a puzzle online, the solution to which I do not think I could have reasonably discovered on my own. This game is a great Metroidvania style game; however, the frustrating puzzles remind me of Fez and after I had to look up a puzzle solution, I ended up losing interest because of how frustrating the puzzles where and how often I was exploring the same rooms over and over to find where to go.

												Note: I'm currently trying to play all of the games in my Steam library and give a quick review of each one. Therefore, this review is based on about half an hour's worth of gameplay. This game has a lot going for it however, I found the controls to be too... weird? I guess? It's hard to explain without playing it for yourself but I'll give it a shot. The jumping is all sorts of f***** out. First, you jump like your on the moon, slowly way up, and slowly down. Next, you don't have control of the character while in mid jump. Except you do! If you jump just straight up, then try to move in a direction, the character will move after about half of a second. I found this to be quite akward. Either give me control over the character in mid jump, or don't. I'll deal with it. Conversely, if you're falling, you have no control and fall straight down. I assume this was for the sake of realism, which would be great if it was consistant. I don't mind strict realism in physics but don't fiddle faddle around by having moon jumps one minute, and no mid air control the next. Based on this, I could not continue to play this game. If you can get past it, then there is a lot to enjoy here with interesting graphics and great music. Alas, I cannot recommend this game because I feel control is the essence of what makes a video game and for me, it's just all wrong.			"

												I was really looking forward to playing this game... It looked like something I'd like... I was, really wrong...I don't understand why people like it... Controls are very bad, gameplay is pretty boring and slow (maybe it changes later, but at the beginning, it really is), graphics is awful... I like pixel graphics, but having the game in 1/5 of screen is really not something 15e game should be... The game is extremely difficult... But not in interesting and challenging way, but in awfully boring and ""let me try every possible wall/floor for hidden stuff"" way...I don't usually play metroidvania, but most of those I played, I pretty much liked... So, that shouldn't be the problem... I still don't understand why people like it...I really, really don't like this game...			"

												This game reminded me of what games should be like. It treats you like you have a brain and the ability to think in an abstract manner, and if you don't keep track of and use the information provided to you well, it's your fault and you flip open a walkthrough. I didn't really know what I was getting myself into, and that caused me some problems.  There is almost no irrelevant information provided by the game. Not just a notepad is needed, a notebook even. Keep track of clues, deity and lore names, places, room names, where those unreadable tablets that you ignored are, anything and everything. That information will come into play at some point, in some way. Cross off clues and puzzles you've solved, keep it organized. The last thing you want to do is to have scour the game for the hint, tablet, mural, deity statue etc, to progress that you only read/researched not realizing it's importance.Well, when the sequel is finished and released, atleast I'll come prepared for it.

												This game brings some new ideas to the NES Castlevania games. It has funny and interesting dialogues and in game computer software for being a modern archaeologist. Yet still it fails to give you the nice gameplay feeling of the Castlevania games. I'm not even comparing this with Symphony of the Night. A strongly advise you to ask friends about this game. Most of the reviews seem to be exagerrated positive with a very short amount of idea about Metroidvania games.			"

												I feel bad leaving a negative review as this was a gift, but I'm doing so, none-the-less.The game isn't all bad. Its definitely a nostalgia blast of 16 bit graphics. The story is intriguing, a nice approach to the genre. The mezo-american themed art is really enjoyable in the game. Its hard, but this isn't necessarily why I'm rating it poorly. Its WHY the game is hard that is the issue. The play control is just utterly terrible and the collision detection is bad. I can't tell you how many times I've watched my whip sail right through a sprite and inflict no damage. I can't tell you how many times I've jumped from one screen to the next and the trajectory of the jump changes because of the screen change. To make matters worse, it isn't predictable, so I can't even build up muscle memory to improve my precision. It reminds me of the NES days when game devs made games ridiculously difficult to mask the limited amount of content in the game.   Unless you're seriously into spending hours repeating the same action over and over until you get lucky enough to get through an area, I can't recommend this title.			"

												This game is an absolute masterpiece, but it won't appeal to everyone. It is a platform style game with a focus on exploration, puzzles, and high challenge. There is a lot of game here: it took me over 40 hours to finish my first playthrough. The artwork in this game is good, especially the music which is exceptional.  I'll admit that I actually listened to the soundtrack outside of the game.The puzzles in this game are the heart of it, but the whole thing has an exceptional design. Each part of the game is expertly prepared. Although the game is extremely difficult, none of it felt unfair to me. I felt a real sense of accomplishment after completing some of the more difficult areas.If you're the kind of person who needs a walkthrough, you will not enjoy this game at all. If you love old-style platformers and a good challenge, this game is a masterpiece and you are a fool to miss it.			"

												I think this game is great. It's kind of like what you'd find on the NES or SNES because it's got that classic sort of difficulty and depth that you simply can't find now days. I could even see this game having the same nostalgia. Lets look at what specifically was good and bad about the game.Pros: 1. The game is difficult, but not impossible... To me this is a very nice balance.2. It is really fun to explare new areas, especially after finding the save points.3. A lot of the gadgets you get are hidden, so finding them feels very rewarding.4. Everything about the artwork was done to perfection.5. The bad guys are unique and each has its own way of attacking.7. The music is well done and catchy.8. It was clearly a well thought out game with much effort put into it.9. Bosses and mini bosses are difficult but fun.Cons: 1. Some of the riddles are simply too difficult. The majority of players will likely use a guide eventually.2. Under-water/lava controls are difficult and more than frustrating at times.3. Dying can be a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥if you havent found a save point in the area you are in.4. This is a huge one: If you haven't gotten the Holy Grail, but have made it far into the game, you may become stuck permanently, and need to restart the game. Thankfully this doesnt apply to many players.Over all, the game has its flaws, but I still love the game and would reccomend it to anyone who wants a good challenge.			"

												(all my reviews are labeled as ""Recommended"" because I don't like the label system)La-Mulana delivers what it says it wants to, it's old school. Unfortunately, this brings the problems of old school gaming.In terms of actual gameplay, the game's platforming is a bit different from the norm. You can't control your jump trajectory except at the beginning of your jump, and you can barely control your falling direction.Then comes the real oldschool part. The puzzles. Where you not only have to think outside the box; but also flip the box upside down, chop it open, and analyze it with a microscope.The hints offer only slight indication of what you need to do.At first it seems pretty simple. The first puzzle presents you with a hint to kill two red skeletons, you kill the skeletons, which unlocks a block needed to complete a puzzle. Fine.Then they start getting a bit obtuse. You get a hint that the mouths of two statues are connected, ie. pushing a block in one will push another out the other. Only the perspective doesn't fit the block you are shown, and you have to hit it with your whip.....And there has been no indication that your whip can affect these blocks.You get a hint that the geometry of the temple is messed up. Apparently this is supposed to refer a secret passage right behind the hint that leads you to the other side of a map.Sometimes puzzles activate things in adjacent rooms, sometimes they activate things 4 rooms over.This is the first level alone.

												This game is amazing.It is hard, oh yes it is hard. And oh yes, is it good. La-Mulana is entirely old-school. In fact, it is a remake of an old Japanese MSX game. Luckily, they upgraded the visuals and sound, and the result is a charming Metroidvania with a real SNES vibe, both in visuals and sound, and difficulty. The bosses are amazing and feel massive. They are one of the most exciting parts of the game, and each one is unique with different attack patterns. There are a lot of bosses and minibosses in this game. If you like big dramatic battles, this is potentially for you. There is truly a sense of scale, and the wonderful 16 bit art exemplifies it. Each stage has parallax scrolling that allows the background to be the same, yet change position. The tiling and backgrounds and sprite work are beautiful.  Partly because of the purposely gimped controls (Castlevania-style jumping, with momentum) however, once you play enough you learn that this is not much of a limitation for experienced players- you need to master falling angles, and jumping straight up without momentum allows you complete control in the air. It's still a restriction, but you kinda get used to it.Game length: I took 38 or so hours on the main quest. Not sure if I'm above the average or below it, but the game is massive and the feel of exploration is real. Now on to the cons: This game is vague as hell. Some puzzles are convoluted, and you need to have a pen and paper handy to write down hints from skeletons and writings on the wall. There is an in-game note saver, but it only carries limited information. I resorted to using the wiki after getting a few times. Honestly, the puzzles are too hard and are too abstract. Some random tablet of writing on one end of the ruins shouldn't solve a puzzle at the other.Note: This game is hard. Like, really hard. You will get frustrated. Guaranteed. Like Podbrilliantly summed up in his review: ""You will get stuck on a boss, you will get hopelessly lost, you will be thinking of clues when you're not even exploring."" Be ready to ragequit, then come back.AT A GLANCE:(Point totals used as a general reference point.)Graphics: Almost perfect, a bit dark/unclear at times. 9/10Sound: Dramatic, badass, amazing sounding. I found myself whistling these songs to myself, and I can still remember the Giant boss theme. 10/10Controls: They're responsive, and feel tight apart from the retro jumping mechanics (which are a turn-off for some people. I'm not sure how I feel about them, but they take some getting used to.) Subjective.  Content: With 5 unique primary weapons, and 10 secondary weapons, you'll have a lot of ways to kill with (just find them first!). Game lasts from 20-80 hours on the first playthrough, depending on how good you do. Tons of bosses, and stages. For a 15 dollar game, 10/10.  Other: If you're a fan of hard NES-SNES era platformers, get it. If not, consider it but it may not be for you.  Overall: 10/10, with subjectively lower scores. I certainly loved it. "

												One of those cool platformer games where you get more and more items and skills as you go on, making retracing and re-exploring fun (Metroidvania), with an awesome amounts of riddles to solve along the way. The riddles get a little convoluted towards the end, and the gameplay falters a bit due to having to go into the menu and switch ""active"" items (desperately needs a shortcut button for this), but is overall a complete masterpiece of the genre.

												I want to like this game.But I do not. The controlls are sloppy, there's no player scaffolding, and the physics are atrocious. Two examples from the physics complaint: jump mechanics and preservation of inertia. There are two things that Super Mario Brothers, the gold standard of physics expectations in 2D platformers, do correctly. If I fall off a ledge running full-tilt, where do I fall? Straight down? No, but in La-Mulana, the answer is ""yes."" I'm torn between conquering this and deleting it forever, or just deleting it forever and cursing the developers for burning away some of my money. I would hope they fix the physics in the two aspects--oh! Another one! As a player, I have the expectation of being able to grab a ladder/rope in mid-fall. Here, I cannot. It turns a game that could be ""interesting"" into one that is ""tolerable ... perhaps.""I cannot possibly recommend this game.UPDATE: I looked at the Kickstarter page for This Game Part Two. I learned more from the manual there than I did about this game in my entire ownership, and I played the demo and found the physics problems remain. I will not be buying that game, and see now that this was an intentional design decision. Pity, as it's irritating and unenjoyable to be stymied by a game with sloppy controls and unintuitive physics and movement. ""Hard"" is fine; ""broken"" is irritating.UPDATE 2: I now have ten hours of gameplay invested. I have only invested these, an additional eight hours over when I wrote my original review, in order to ensure I wasn't selling this game short. I was not. This is a game that I ""tolerate,"" at best. I do not enjoy it. The controls and art and design all conspire to push the player into prime striking position for enemies, and there is little logical association between a switch and its effect. I have to wonder if the dev put this out there as a lark: a kind of special f-bomb to video game players everywhere: ""you like to play games? Well f-you, guys!"" This is the only explanation that makes sense with all the design and artistic conventions that have been broken in this game. I really, really, really wish I hadn't waited six months between purchase and play, because now I'm screwed out of $15. Worse, the person who wrote this software is now some percentage of that $15 richer, AND has been given a dollar-vote of, ""yes, this game is good."" It is not. It needs significant work. It won't get that work, though, as La-Mulana 2 is on Kickstarter and is more of the same; just a re-skin of this game with (presumably) different and equally-f-you-based ""puzzles.""UPDATE 3: The game is growing on me, like a fungus. After 33 hours total gameplay and a 6-hour (new) savefile, it's interesting, but continues to be hamstrung by horrible platformer-controls and swimming mechanics. If you fall into lava with fireballs/rocks, you're pretty much done for, as you'll be batted around like a toy mouse in a room full of cats. Ice is similarly slick, but that's expected: it's ice, just ice where mu = 0.0001 or so. You will, in one particular area, be sent back and forth between screens if you forget that an enemy awaits just inside the screen transition, on ice.Overall, with 33 hours in and really needing--truly, absolutely needing--a direct walkthrough read in the Chamber of Illusions (the whole ""on bended knee"" thing. Ugh!), I remain correct in my original assertion: I cannot recommend this game at its asking price given its treatment of the above controls/scenarios. Could I recommend it at the $5 mark? Yes. It's frustrating, as it is hamstrung by deliberately-bad controls, but for $5 you can do much worse.UPDATE 4, 46 hours of play: I would recommend this game at the $5 mark. Comments on controls and physics are unchanged, but the game as a whole has grown on me. Gameplay improved post-Feather.			"

												97% of people who buy La-Mulana never finish the storyline. Check the ""global achievement stats"" and see for yourself.I urge caution in buying this. Some people like it; I like it. But many don't understand what they're buying. The game is ""hard"" -- but not only ""hard"". It's deeply flawed:The first few hours are awful.Some puzzles are tedious and the solutions random.Some puzzles expect you to draw and annotate maps.You will need to go out-of-game to get help on puzzles; no one lucks onto the solution of every puzzle. Bear in mind that going out-of-game means seeing spoilers, and meta-gaming like ""Does it 'feel like cheating' to look up X after putting in Y effort?"" It fundamentally changes the experience.Some of us like the game anyway, because of the quality of art and music, sense of exploration, replay value in speedruns, etc. We like it in spite of its flaws; you may not.Here's what you can try. There's a free La-Mulana 2 demo available on Kickstarter. Since it's an early demo, it uses the same engine as La-Mulana, and is highly similar: the same jump, the same whip, the same style of puzzles. It's also a better newbie experience; it introduces important mechanics sooner, and more clearly. Try it first. Will you end up drawing your own map, and will you enjoy it? Or googling maps and answers, and will you enjoy that? Try it and decide.I hope you make an informed decision, the decision best for you. It's not just ""other people"" who don't enjoy this game. It's a lot of people.			"

Because there's a game breaker hidden in all that cryptic junk that activates hard mode without your knowledge and there's no way to reverse it. So, now 20 plus hours into the game I realize why I am having such a tough time. The bosses are easy enough to defeat. I killed the first boss in about thirty seconds on my first try. Not much longer for the mine kart boss, either. The giant boss took me a few tries, got him. Then the death trap. Now it's stuck in hard mode. Thanks, developers, for wasting 30 hours of my time!

												A game for all skill levels.Not good at games? Go the bulk up route. This game does not strictly require you to fight any bosses until you're roughly 90% done the game. You can get most of the items, including health upgrades, without fighting any bosses. It feels like sequence breaking but it's (usually) completely intended. The bosses all have roughly the same difficulty, meaning you can fight them in whatever order you feel like.Average at games? Play through the normal way. When you're done an area, fight the boss, and move on. None of the bosses are particularly harder than any others, they just take some getting used to.Good at games? Set it to hard mode. More enemies, harder enemies, bosses have more health and do more damage. Accidentally went to hard mode, but can't do it? Don't reset. You can still explore the ruins to get more items, just like you would do during a bulk up run. With enough health, anyone can win.			"

												There are a lot of glowing review of this game, it doesn't deserve such praise but it is not a bad game, just deeply flawed.The games has a lot of flaws, first and foremost is the fake difficulty in much of the game. Trapdoors into spike (spike cause a lot of damage) and lava, pits with pop up spikes that you can't jump out of, enemies placed at the edge of screens causing you to walk into them when you transition to that screen, ridiculous puzzles you absolutely need a guide to figure out and death traps. These add only unnecessary frustration and don't belong in the game.In the list above I mentioned ridiculous, most puzzles are not ridiculous but later in the game many puzzles get ridiculous but by the second half of the game the get ridiculous. There is one puzzle that requires you to go to a specific pot in an aria you hadn't needed to go in a long while and Mario down it. Another example is getting the grail, you'll need the grail, it is the games form of fast travel but to get the grail you need to walk through a false wall with no indication that it is a false wall. The game does give hints in the form tablets spread around the game and give you a way to save the text from the tablets but you don't know always which tablets have information you need and they are often not near where the puzzle's they are giving hints for are.The game is inconsistent when  it come to controlling the player character (named Lemeza) in the air in the air. If you jump at an angle you have some control, it's not Meat Super Boy level of control but it doesn't need to be,  if Lemeza jumps strait, up you don't have control until Lemeza reaches the pick of the jump and starts falling, then you gain some control during his decent, but if Lemeza walks off a ledge and falls you have no control until Lemeza hits the ground. This may seem minor to some but it causes a lot of problems in many parts of the game. As I've said the game doesn't need Meat Boy level of control but consistent control would have been a lot better.Thirdly is the music. The music is good but it eventually becomes highly irritation. After hearing the music for many hours it becomes grating. Again the music isn't bad and if the music is available for purchase I would recommend buying it but it's like a song that out stays its welcome and it's only like that because of how many hours I've played the game.Over all it is a good but very flawed games. I've put about 60 hours into it and I can't argue against that so I recommend it but I suggest you don't play past the middle of the game.			"

												Do you remember back in the NES days when games were hard as hell? Making progress from one level to the next was a monumental task. You couldn't just sit down, turn your mind off and breeze through any task; games required you to memorize and adapt. It made even the most awesome of ideas sometimes horrid.La-Mulana harkens back to that exact idea. If the game isn't kicking your♥♥♥♥♥ you must be Jesus. While I appreciate a game that doesn't hand hold me, I'm torn on exactly how La-Mulana goes about torturing the player. Sometimes, it can feel really unfair; other times, your objective is clouded in obscurity that nearly necessitates a guide.The basic breakdown of the game is akin to Super Metroid or any more recent Castlevania. You explore dungeons on a 2-D plane, acquire weapons that will help in different rooms and proceed to tackle bosses and enemies as they come to you. It's all about exploration, puzzle solving and some tight jumps.The difficulty comes from a lot of cheap tactics and some staggering hits from your foes. The developers philosophy was that a normal person placed in a hidden cavern wouldn't have the know how to get out. You normally wouldn't jump down a black hole and expect to land softly.That does make sense, realistically, but it kind of hurts the game in some parts. Puzzles end up following their own logic and you often are required to walk through hazards to make any progress. It can lead to you being unsure, backtracking a lot to find some different route and then giving up and just saying, ""♥♥♥♥ it!""It's cool to see a cavern designed in a way that should facilitate logical thinking, but to hide so many core solutions behind layers of riddles and abstract thought stinks. I just want to be able to evaluate the situation and move on, not have to constantly refer to a guide to figure out what I'm doing.The game makes up for this with extremely tight controls and some incredible music and graphics. The artwork comes to life in all it's 32-bit glory. The soundtrack is immediately nostalgic while being modern and energetic. The boss fights are intimidating and demand you to master your skillsets.It makes for some climactic and exhilirating encounters, but getting to those points is often frustrating beyond reason. That I somehow managed to finish the game in around 20 hours is a testament to how determined I was, but most players won't have that resolve.La-Mulana asks a tremendous amount from you. You are only going to get from it what you put it. Nothing about the game will coddle you until you succeed. If you cannot adapt, you will fail; time and time again.So while I think the game is good, I can't recommend it to a lot of people. It's just going to put off more casual players or gamers who like not relying on walkthroughs. If you can muster up the courage for the challenge, it's definitely a worthwhile investment.7.5/10			"

												Too hard and the controls suck. That's it in a nutshell. I've played difficult platformers like Super Meat Boy, They Bleed Pixels, etc. Games like that really need to handle well. This game does not. Once you jump you are stuck going that direction until you reach the top of your jump, at that point you can veer one way or another. I couldn't grab ladders in the air. These things may be forgiveable if the game wasn't so unforgiving itself. You get one man and when you die you go back to the main menu and have to reload the game from the last checkpoint. Games like SMB knew that they needed to throw you right back in the action to curb frustration. After having to reload the game a million times... I quit. Packing it in. Moving on with my life.PROS:- gorgeous pixel art with great enemies and bosses- great sense of humorCONS:- poor controls- having to reload the game every time you die- too hard for me to enjoy (of course thats my opinion. you may have more skills than me)			"

Yes and yes only if you can manage to find a friend, guide or a wiki to help you on every step you take on this Metroidvania of a game.Eventually, you will get stuck no matter what because you could not peg that one hint that applied to that one dungeon in that one specific place in that moment of time.

												Everyone wants to be ""metroidvania"" and this had potential. With a lot of backtracking and ""powerup"" items and skills, La-Mulana has all the trappings of metroidvania, with a massive game area and lots of interesting bosses. Only problem is that it mistakes challenging with frustrating = fun. Overly cryptic puzzles, stale humour and 90's era controls leads to a lot of frustrations and deaths. Weird jump mechanic, can't grab a ladder in the air, can't drop down a ladder, strange hit-boxes and strange weapon animations meant trying to solve the already difficult puzzles too much to bear. And perhaps the fact it's a remake from an era long past that makes me not like this game. The first scene where the old man in a remote village gives you software to install on your laptop so he can send you email is just stupid. Not my kind of game, but if you're one who likes to live in the past of retro gaming you might like this.Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed watching someone speedrun this (2hrs), but I honestly couldn't play much more than an hour myself.

												So I finally tried it today. Nope. I love the attempt and there's good things about it, but the bad stuff really drives me away. Ultimately it feel like an NES game that was intentionally designed without visual cues and other visual narrative/storytelling to make users call the help hotline for advice on how to advance.Allow me to itemize my grievances so future generations can develop games which don't have these issues: - Up or down? I managed to figure out Down to apply a weight, and to use the save, but doors are UP instead. I had to watch someone play to see that doors were even thing. I stood in front of one and pressed every key multiple times, but apparently I wan't lined up enough with the door, so I spent the first 30 minutes killing snakes and birds wondering when I get the power to hit those cracked broken button things. - Wait WTF? There's far too many puzzles where you are lucky to stumble upon the answer, and otherwise just kinda need to throw youself at every surface of every screen to figure them out. - Progression? I though every ""level-up"" was increasing my health, but after getting the Blue Orb my health stayed as 64. Is it not a level up, and the green pips are just an intermittent healing system?- After I quit and uninstalled, I saw a speedrunner using an item to teleport netween saves. Not sure how to do that or where to get that, but it would explain why there's so many critical path failures that result in the inability to otherwise continue.  - The controls could be stiffer, but it would be hard to pull off without making the game wholly unplayable. Jump straight up and fall with control OR jump at an angle and maybe try to slow your horizontal speed. No air-grabbing ladders either, which is constantly reinforced by one lil crapling assigned to knock you off that ladder 100% of the time (like the first waterfall fish and the middle ladder). I'll admit that I had to look up the breakable ice when I played SotN the first time, it was the only thing that wasn't obvious, and there wasn't a good element that would force players to discover it anyway (like some big ""break me"" cracks). But that was it for SotN, everything else I was able to figure out with ease and a bit of back-and-forth. By contrast, La-Mulana is pretty much designed around fake difficulty with the use of layers of convoluted nonsense puzzles. As a result, I'd say this is not worth your $15. My advice is to get an actual Castlevania game, a good metroidvania like Guacamelee, or even a so-so one like Dex, or just wait for Chasm to come through with procedural metroidvania awesomeness.

												La-Mulana is a platformer that immediately turned me off.  Poor graphics settings, poor optimization, awful controls.  Slippery character movement, inconsistent jumping, awful screen transitions.  No useful tutorial or instructions.  Devs obviously put a lot of work in some things, but seem to have ignored the basic fundamentals of any contemporary platforming game.Didn't get in to the story, but what I did see wasn't impressive.  Your first contact in the game is an NPC that talks like white trash, looks like a Chinese Monk, gives you software that he designed himself but later refers to as some unknown ""thingy"" that he's never tried before.  He tells you that nobody ever comes back from La-Mulana, and in the same conversation he tells you to return to his village whenever he emails you.  Sure this game is for someone, but it's too mechanically flawed for my tastes.			"

												The idea of the game is pretty nice. Yet controls are working to slow. The movement of a character is limited. The goons are respawning each time you go to the next screen. Oh and when you get to the edge of the screen it moves to the next one - should be done as a smooth move during movement of a character. You cannot jump of the ladder, sometimes because of the silly controls you just fell over and over. I tried the game 4 times and passed. Not worth my time until something big changes with controls and screens.The web version (e.g. like on Humble Bundle does not have any options controlls binded), but it's rather irrelevant.			"

												Let me point out the things that I hated about this game.-The jumps. You never know for sure where your jumps gonna land, and it's not that I don't enjoy retro SNES castlevania kinda of jump, but this is not like Castlevania IV, it's more like Castlevania 2, Volgarr the Viking did it good.-The graphics confuses you. The game is meant to be full of secrets and doesn't explain anything to you, and I'm ok with that, I like to explore and figure things out by myself, but the scenery shouldn't be a puzzle itself, if I look at somewhere and I don't know if I can land on it, or if I can even PASS through it, that really turns down all the fun to search for secrets, thjis is in the category of mistakes that you cannot do on your game, that's poor level design straight outta NES era.-Farm system. Why does it exist in this game? You are exploring, you suddenly finds the solution for the puzzle, but damn, you're out of ""weights"" and can't solve the puzzle, actually, you can't do anything, because you use weights on the ruins everytime, time to go back to the village to farm or buy some weights, like, why? Why I have to stop and change my mindset in the middle of a run just because I run out of a stupid item? There is no reason to the weights to exist, there is no item management in the way you use them, because you want to use it everytime, there is no strategy.-The difficulty. No, I'm not a filthy casual, but this game is just hard for the sake of being hard, it is actually a contradiction by itself, because if it wasn't that hard, the exploration and sense of discovery would be much more enjoyable, the game begs to you to explore and find secrets, but you're not going to be able to do that, because even if you're doing good and playing well, sometimes the game's just going to destroy you, imagine that you're on a pit, there is a ladder to get out of this pit, that's the only way out, but when you climb it, an enemy attacks you and drops you back to the pit, you try again and again, but there is no time to either kill it or dodge it, so you're basically trapped. IT IS A DEATH TRAP THAT CAN TAKE 5 MINUTES OR EVEN MORE, JUST TO KILL YOU.-The puzzles. No, the puzzles are not good, I've seen people praising this game for its puzzles, but no, the idea of puzzles on this game is like, put a bunch of spikes, if the player fall on those spikes he can use a ""weight"" to finish the puzzle. There are some oks, but most of them can't be even called puzzles.-Emails/Tutorial. The game keeps pausing itself to teach you some dumb things, like, at the start of the game it says to you use a ""weight"" to get an item, but it doesn't say anything about the purpose of the item, which would be something interesting. The problem is, it uses texts to teach things that should be teached by visuals, and doesn't do anything to teach you about things that should be explained by texts. Like, if you want to make your water poisoned, just make her visually poisoned, don't send me a damn text about it.They say that this game is a metroidvania, but it looks more like a roguelike with random dungeons, even if the dungeons are not random, it looks like, it feels like random.Just do yourself a favor and go buy Spelunky, it does almost everything that this one tries, but with success.

												Clumsy controls, unforgivable puzzles, old school knockback when struck, this is not what makes 2D exploration platformers good, it's what dates them when compaired to other more sucessful games in the genre.I'll be fair and say that there is a lot of good going for La-Mulana, a nice 16-bit art style accompanied by some wonderful music really brings home the feeling of playing a classic SNES in your own home. On top of that, this is part of a genre I really love and don't see very many games of this type. The only recent one I can think of is Dust: An Elysian Tail. La-Mulana perfectly replicates the experience of exploring a treasure filled booby trapped temple. And there in lies the overall problem with the game.First off, controls in this are very floaty at best, while movement and attacking is fine, if you jump you are committed to it up until a certain point in the air, which leads to some very tricky and downright frustrating moments of platforming. Adding to that, if you are hit by something and the area requires lots of jumping, you will be sent flying and can only recover movement upon landing on the ground ala: old school Castlevania. When a lot of exploration in this game relies upon pixel perfect platforming, getting hit not only hinders advancement, but also can be unavoidable at times. This can be especially bad when you are fighting big bosses that sometimes take up the entire screen and force you to move from platform to platform, or clumsily jump around in hopes of dodging that one fireball while at low health.Puzzles in this game are what really drives in the decision to purchase this or not, as they can be downright unforgivable and just don't teach you how they effect the rest of the game. Two switches, one could be a trap that leaves you with the only choice to restart your game, one just activates another puzzle in a distant room, oh and if you don't get a certain item... you're ♥♥♥♥ed! Want to know what this item is? We ain't going to tell ya, you just have to solve more puzzles to find it... if you're lucky! If you're not lucky, the only choice you have is to use the RESET feature in the settings. You will use this often as the game just loves to trap you without any prior warning. And to top that all off, you had better save often because these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t moments will occur often, and sometimes at a time where hours of progress will be lost!Teaching the player about the game over time is especially important to this genre, trial and error gameplay only serve to punish those who do not know better or are just starting out, and having a reset the game function is not the right way to fix such an inherently flawed puzzle system. Throughout all of the game I was lost, unable to solve the basic of puzzles, and would find myself trapped for making a beginner's mistake. The game barely teaches you it's basics unless you go out of your way to purchase necessary equipment that is needed to beat the game.A good exploration game requires the tightest of controls, intelegent/clever puzzles, and the right conveyance to teach players as they play so that they can grow smarter and stronger. A bad one puts you into impossible situations where you cannot win and says ""Oh well, start over from the beginning and do it right this time!"". I found this frustrating on my first 12 hours, I'm sure it would be better on a second playthrough, but I strongly believe first impressions are the most important thing when it comes to a game, and I cannot recommend this game as there are better alternatives out there.Play Dust: An Elysian Tail, Castlevania: SotN, and/or Super Metroid instead. Just pass on La-Mulana.			"

Once you jump, you hold the momentum of the direction you were moving, but if you run off a cliff you fall straight down instantly like you hit a wall.This game isn't worth the money when I bought it on sale, and it definitely won't be at full price.

												I was torn between recommending this game or not, but the sheer amount of frustration at the end makes me say no.  On the plus side, the gameplay once you get used to it is fun, the boss battles are enjoyable challenges in a throw the controller throught the monitor sortof way, and some of the puzzles are clever.  That being said (and admittedly I probably am not the target audience for this game), the 'puzzles' at the end aren't so much difficult as being completely off in left field.  After the first half, I was pretty much playing via the walkthrough--which is unfortunate, because I know I could have figured some of the  things out on my own.  Since the unfair puzzles are so numerous, its simply discouraging to try your hand at any of them.  Travelling around in some fields becomes such a chore that it detracts from the entire experince (I'm looking at you chamber of birth).			"

												La-Mulana is a metroidvania style platformer. The game looks good. Like old 16 bit games. Although the characters and enemies look a bit uninspired. When you start playing you immediately are reminded about Castlevania 2, not only because of it's clunky controls and that you also have a whip. But like Castlevania 2 the puzzles are confusing and enemies respawn if you revisit an area. While the clunky controls worked for the linear Castevania's in a metroidvania like La-Mulana it's rather annoying. But at least there isn't a day night cyclus like in Castlevania 2.So if you expect to pick up and play and play it. You going to have a bad time. Mainly because of the controls and puzzles you need to really invest some time to get into it. If you can overcome this the game will be fun. This game is just not for everyone.			"

												This game is fun as all hell for the first few hours, then it becomes so incredibly cryptic that you need a guide or youtube video to progress further into the game. My problem with this game isn't the controls, the difficult enemies or even the unfair traps; it's the fact that there's no direction whatsoever. You know how in Dark Souls you eventually start to hit all the walls you see looking for a hidden or how in the original DOOM games you go OOMPH against everything looking for some sort of easter egg? That's literally the gist of this game, hitting every wall and scanning everything just so you can progress a slight bit. The ""hints"" that you get are vague at best and often times they aren't even near the puzzle, they're in another part of the ruins entirely. There's a lot of comparisons to Dark Souls with this game, but I think it's more like Demon's Souls: an unrefined prelude to a great game. Similar to Demon's Souls, La Mulana is challenging but it's mostly challenging because of bad design. Also similar to Demon's Souls, fans of this game rave about it because they feel like they need to play sadistic, quasi-impossible games to prove that they're not ""casuals."" La Mulana 2 is coming out soon and Nigoro says that they're gonna cut out a lot of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and make a more accessible game. Hopefully La Mulana 2 will be the true ""Dark Souls"" of the puzzle platformer genre.			"

												I am all for challenging games and figuring out puzzles but this game is beyond silly. You have to hit switches that magically do something in another room somewhere in the level (it could be in ANY room and you have to backtrack to 20+ rooms to find it). Sometimes you have to walk through an invisible wall, sometimes you have to set a rotating stone then figure out what it changed in who knows what room.I am sure there are some people who will really like this style of game. To everyone who says this is like Demon/Dark Souls, you are completely wrong (It is more like The Battle of Olympus for NES). Just because if you die you start over from a save spot does not mean it is like those games. You can save anytime you want with this and you keep all your stuff. I wouldn't even call this game difficult because it is pretty easy jumping over traps and whipping bad guys. It just takes a ridiculous amount of time to figure out what everything does and for me, that is not fun.The music is very good and I thought the controls were decent (using an xbox controller).Overall though, this was a terrible gaming experience and as much as I hate leaving games unfinished, this just isn't worth the time. It is not fun for me to have to look at a guide to figure out what I am missing every 15 minutes. 5/10.			"

												It's... er... it SHOULD be good, but...Honestly, I'll just say this: the save/healing system ruined this for me. It's the kind of system where you can only save at infrequent checkpoints... but where you're solving puzzles. As in, if you die after doing a few puzzles, you lose all progress in them since you last went back to a checkpoint. I stopped playing the moment I lost 20 minutes of progress from getting insta-killed by a trap.Additionally, to heal, you have to warp to the surface, go a half-dozen screens left to a very-easily-missable pool, wait a while, then warp to a checkpoint. It's the most roundabout way of just healing at checkpoints there is.Basically, it should be a good game, but I absolutely cannot stand time-wasting mechanics like those in a modern game.			"

												This game is fun as all hell for the first few hours, then it becomes so incredibly cryptic that you need a guide or youtube video to progress further into the game. My problem with this game isn't the controls, the difficult enemies or even the unfair traps; it's the fact that there's no direction whatsoever. You know how in Dark Souls you eventually start to hit all the walls you see looking for a hidden or how in the original DOOM games you go OOMPH against everything looking for some sort of easter egg? That's literally the gist of this game, hitting every wall and scanning everything just so you can progress a slight bit. The ""hints"" that you get are vague at best and often times they aren't even near the puzzle, they're in another part of the ruins entirely. There's a lot of comparisons to Dark Souls with this game, but I think it's more like Demon's Souls: an unrefined prelude to a great game. Similar to Demon's Souls, La Mulana is challenging but it's mostly challenging because of bad design. Also similar to Demon's Souls, fans of this game rave about it because they feel like they need to play sadistic, quasi-impossible games to prove that they're not ""casuals."" La Mulana 2 is coming out soon and Nigoro says that they're gonna cut out a lot of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and make a more accessible game. Hopefully La Mulana 2 will be the true ""Dark Souls"" of the puzzle platformer genre.			"

												This game has so many design shortcomings I actually wonder if the developers had any idea what they where doing or even wanted people to enjoy their game.First of all, the jumping. It's like if you took castlevania jumping, where you can't control your descent, and tried to fix it but stopped halfway through, Point is it feels weird.A bigger issue is the level design and enemy placement. This game opts to have single screens with a scroll kind of like zelda but with gravity. This can be done well, but here the enemies and obstacles are placed in a way that it's extremely likely for the player to get hit by something they can't see coming, and if they do see it as the screen scrolls they can't react because of the poor to nonexistant mid-air controls. And there are some places where if you jump off the side of the screen, the next screen has no floor and you'll fall. It requires so much caution that it ruins the point of playing a video game.Another small issue is that you can't grab onto ladders while jumping. It's small, but it goes against my instinct and really should have been fixed seeing how many ladders there are.The platforming is a hassle, partially due to the jumping but also because the platforms are often placed badly. The jumping and the way the platforms are placed remind me of Castlevania 2: Simon's Quest. And the main character has a whip. It's almost like the developers looked at that game as inspiration.I wanted to like this game but it's so flawed I can't enjoy myself while playing it. You're better off just renting an Indiana Jones flick.			"

												Like pulling teeth, and your reward for having them pulled, is more teeth to pull. It's terrible, maybe if you like speed running you could suffer through it. But as a game, the story is confusing, puzzles don't even make sense, flow is little to none, nothing from controls to how items work is ever explained, and the game controls need to be remapped right out of the gate for it to make sense. Maybe you will like it, but it's just not something I enjoyed.			"

												Based on the other reviews, I don't doubt that this game has a lot to offer.

This plays like a vintage retro platformer in the worst possible ways - bad controls and enemies that infinitely respawn the moment you leave the screen. For me, that's a deal-breaker.			"

												Simply put, this is a game about exploration that will punish you for exploring. There are many ""kaizo-traps"", essentially traps where your only escape is death/game-overing, and that's just no good. I'm not sure if there's a way to heal other than gathering....uh, exp and leveling up? If that's leveling up, nothing seems to change when you get a full bar of green exp, you just heal. Again, may just be me and I may be missing something.But what I'm not missing is being sucker-punched by every effort to explore around. So, if you want a game that likes to make you suffer, don't get this, there's countless other masochistic games on the web for free, such as ""I want to be the guy: The Movie: The Game Beta"". And if you just want a challenging platformer, there's ""You have to win the game"" on steam for FREE, and if you MUST pay, I can suggest VVVVVV because it's got some interesting quirks to it. But not this. This was a waste of time and is the only game of my steam library that I out-right wish I could request my money back on.			"

HILARIOUS.)-""Puzzles"" can be a matter of accidentally stumbling onto some secret gimmick rather than figuring out a presented problem.-Have I mentioned the positively awful jump physics?There is a good game in here if you're a veteran of its particular flavor of old school jankiness and are fine with all of the modern gameplay lessons it proudly refuses to adhere to. Otherwise, you're going to have to tolerate a lot of petty annoyances for this one.This game is soooo close to exactly what I want, but damn. Just misses the mark.			"

												I loved this game at first.  But after I spent some more time with it (time counter isn't wholly accurate, spent a good deal of time playing on a friend's account), that view has changed a good deal.  This game... can be fun.  Its got some cool Indiana Jones-esque elements, good puzzles, and interesting enviroments and boss design.  That's all well and good.  But... the game bills itself as challenging.  I don't agree.  Its hard.  Not Dark Souls hard; not challenging in a way that drives you to want to win, to want to beat the next boss and the next and eventually the game.  Its frustratingly hard.  Unfun hard.  This becomes ESPECIALLY apparent in alot of the boss fights.  First of all, give the arenas a little bit of thought!  The second boss' arena is two platfroms and a ladder.  The first?  A series of floating platforms placed above of each other.  The third?  A minecart run over tracks of varying heights against a boss who you can only damage by hitting his head.  First three bosses weak points are all the head.  Also, this game, particularly in the boss fights, has some of the worst hitboxes I have seen in a videogame.  We're talking Dark Souls 2 bad.   The game itself doesn't even know what its doing half the time.  For example, sometimes the fireballs on the third boss will do 8 damage, other times 12?  Sometimes you'll get hit by his charge, other times the exact same thing wil happen, the exact same attack, the exact same point of contact between the PC and the boss, and nothing will happen.  Also noob traps.  SO MANY NOOB TRAPS.Doesn't rate a buy, and CERTAINLY not at $15.00.			"

												It sucks.Edit:That was too simple I suppose, though I still stand by that statement.  Here's an actual review:This is going to sound really bad, but...It's too hard.It's a throwback to the nes days where you weren't given a manual most of the time because people threw the boxes to their games away, and even if you got a manual it wasn't very useful for most games.This game is linear with a mostly set path, but you are given very little aid in finding it.  This game can be beaten very fast if you go through a what-to-do checklist from a site like gamefaqs, but people say that this is a terrible idea as it ruins the fun of the game.That's right, most people will tell you that the fun of this game, which is a side-scrolling platformer, does not come from gameplay mechanics and interesting fights, but instead from working against the attrition you suffer while trying to find where to go.  The gameplay is fairly solid, but even the most seasoned player will take damage as they work through figuring out what to do.  This would be fine if the game didn't have two very unnecessary punishment elements to it:Healing is difficult.When you die, you die.  Progress lost.As I stated earlier, this is a throwback to the NES era of games, but I don't think it's a good thing.  The 80's were 30 years ago; We've advanced in technology.  A game doesn't need to be extended by punishing mechanics anymore.  Not many people have the time to just say ""oh, I died into a dungeon I couldn't survive because I wasn't supposed to come here yet.  I didn't need that 30 minutes anyways.""  Punishing exploration is a good way to dissuade people from wanting to explore.Think about whether you think a game should be punishing at all anyways.  Does it make it more fun?  Is it fun to get so angry that you want to snap your controller in half because you just lost an hour because of some spikes or from falling into a pit of water?Somewhere in La Mulana there is a good game with great mechanics and an interesting environment/story to explore.  I just don't like that it's buried beneath a bunch of design decsions that make the game hard for the sake of being hard.			"

												I bought this game expecting Castlevania SoTN 2 (good) and I ended up getting Castlevania 2 Enhanced edition (bad).This game does nothing to guide you. You can miss buying the very indispensable items you need to get through the game and, yet, it lets you mess around for hours until you start feeling like the game is broken.It's way too open-ended. You can go through areas you are not supposed to - due to the lack of items you need -, save the game in there, and find yourself trapped trying to either advance or get back to where you came from.It's unjustifiably hard. Every clue is cryptic; it feels like you're supposed to write everything down and unravel a mystery while killing red skeletons - really? I had to kill the red skeletons to get that extra stone block to solve the freaking puzzle? where the hell was a clue about that?Yet, I feel compelled to finish it. If you plan on finishing this game too, I recommend watching a guide for the first part of the game to get the feel of it and not get surprised by its open-endedness.			"

												La-Mulana is an unfortunate game in that the music, design and concept are great, but requiring you to use a walkthrough to play a game is just ridiculous in this day and age.  People complain about games like Simon's Quest requiring you to use a guide to get through, but that was due to horrible localization.  If translated correctly, you could play through the game without the use of a guide.  I am not going to resort to a walkthrough or video guide in order to play this.  Just going to throw in the towel and accept that the money is gone.  I read previous reviews that stated that the game was a challenge, but when I hear the word challenge, I think of difficulty as in smart AI, brutal levels, etc.  This game is not challenging, it's uninformative.  It just refuses to tell you how to play or what to do.  That's just not fun to me.			"

												I went from loving to loathing this game in about half a day. I love the artstyle I love the concept and if it had been a better designed game I would have loved the game itself.  It tugs heavily on my nostalgia strings but I really can't recall the last time I played a game where I actually wanted to break my keyboard or punch my screen at the end of every session. The game can be challenging which is good unfortunately it commits some of the cardinal sins of game design.Between the Health system, Dead ends/Sudden death traps and schizophrenic puzzles.... you will find yourself retracing yoursteps far too often. Sometimes this game pulls stunts I would expect to see in a troll game, thing is if I wanted that I would be playing a troll game. Health: So far I haven't found any decent way to recover it. There are two bars your HP to which enemies will deal damage and a second fractional which will slowly fill as you collect what few health(?) orbs enemies drop. You will not actually recieve any health until that second bar is filled. You can however always use the Holy Grail to teleport to the surface to stand in the hotspring and regenerate health. Unfortunately that means you will need to teleport back to the nearest obelisk and retrace you steps, this quickly loses its charm. Dead ends and sudden deaths: both result in essentially the same end result. Being forced to either Continue (reload last quicksave) or use the Holy Grail to teleport to a (hopefully) nearby obelisk. Then retrace your rout for the nth time. This is especially annoying when you are starting to explore a new area and have yet to find its obelisk. So the nearest obelisk is in the middle of another zone. Again it quickly loses its charm. Puzzles: Others have covered some of the issues with the puzzles and how there are quite a few that have no clues and rely on either dumb luck or reading a walkthrough to make it past. Partly because some triggers are perfectly blended into the surounding level or they effect other parts of the level without any indication what they have done save for the ""Puzzle Solved"" sound. If you have the Shell that is. While other puzzles in the game have no trouble being completely intuitive.At the end of the day there this game does so much right but there is just enough that it does wrong that it crosses that line between challenging fun and just being aggrivating.

I spent the first 10-15 minutes wondering where the hell to go before realizing I could press up to enter a specific tent that you start near with a red stick at the top instead of a brown one.  I figured I would just go to the right or left and get some direction, but it was just endless confusion.  Nothing is explained, no direction is given.  Walls and platforms that looked like background were real, and occasionally vice versa.  The UI doesn't explain anything and is filled with vague lines and who knows what else.  And that's before going into the controls and mechanics I very much dislike.There are no soft platforms, as in you cannot go up through any platform, and the only air control you get is on the way DOWN from a jump.  If you don't jump off of a platform, you fall straight down with no control.  You don't move very quickly.  You can't grab ladders while jumping.  There's also that awful, awful knockback from getting hit, and you can get bumped to the next screen which has to do its scroll animation from doing so, and given your short ranged melee attack getting hit isn't uncommon.Once I started actually progressing after that short and dumb dialogue, my ""tutorial"" text is introduced through annoying beeping messages I have to go into my pause menu to get to, crowded by garbage flavor text.  Once I got into the ruins, the only thing waiting for me was more monotony, more confusion, and still absolutely zero direction.  Not even a hint.  Just rooms filled with random platforms, enemies, and traps, each room leading to more rooms, some dead ends, and nothing remarkable.  Where do I go?  How do I progress?  Do I care anymore?The music sounded nice at least, if far too energetic for what I was doing.  The graphics themselves are very evocative of the 16-bit generation, even though it bugged me that the resolution was limited to a square.  Again, it seems they set out to almost replicate a game from back then, but nearly every design decision worked against me to the point where I was frustrated and turned off in a very short order.  If you're going to copy a videogame from 1994, pick a good one.			"

												So rage inducing it led me to breaking my headset...At first this was a fun addicting game until I reached a point where I could not continue, came to find out the game boosted my difficulty to hard because a sign in the Mausoleum of Giants turns your game into hard mode if you read it, there is no warning other than looking up a guide and even worse it cannot be undone. Being how far I got I cannot undo anything and now the bosses one hit kill me. My headset broke during a boss battle where you had to get hurt to kill the boss which cannot be done with hard difficulty. Putting crap like that in a game should not be allowed especially when there is no forewarning of it without a guide.It's sad to because I really enjoyedthe game other than that for it's puzzles, metroidvania gameplay, interesting plot, and wonderful theme. So if you came to buy a game with all of this I recomend you search for the original.			"

												La-Mulana is probably one of my favorite video games, with bosses and puzzles that are actually challenging.However...This is the remake, and it tries way too hard to be different.This is the worst kind of remake, the kind that changes way too much.  The point of a remake is so that you can run the game on newer computers, not so you can play the same game, but with irksome changes here and there.  The difficulty curve is all messed up because they changed too much.  Not to mention, at least for me, the Remake runs WORSE than the original does.  I'm aware that if you've never played the original, then the differences won't be as offputting.  Although, I do believe you should just play the original anyway.Don't get me wrong, it's still a ""good"" game.  It's just not nearly as good as the original version.Only get this game if you somehow refuse to go through the work of getting the original to run, or you want to play it with stereoscopy.This game could be passable if it were marketed strictly as something like ""La-Mulana Arrangement"", and not touted as a remake.  But then, you still have to really try hard to tolerate the incredible lack of pixel integrity, which is honestly impressively sad due to how the original had perfect pixel integrity.			"

												A nostalgic game with great possibilities, I fail to see as much enjoyability in the gameplay. The game is too hard, elusive, and the physics are sub-par.GAMEPLAYWhen jumping, you are constricted from free movement till the apex of the jump, making it partially more realistic but still not physically accurate. Why not just have it be the old-fashioned method as seen in SNES Mario games where you can move freely in the jump? Also, when you are hit, you are stunned - you fall stories from a ladder, to land at the bottom. You can not course-correct if you've been hit off an edge or a ladder. This means if there's an enemy guarding the ladder, it's a frustrating and idiotic obstacle. And you cannot jump onto a ladder, or drop from a ladder to save time.Also, where you are supposed to in the game, what exactly an item does, etc., is too subtle. Some of the humor is cute, some of it detracts from the immersive world. It is too easy to die between saves, so I will have to get into the habit if playing more carefully and saving at save stations often. No quicksive in the game, as far as I can see.AUDIOThe music is nice, but lacks in bass and is too repetitive. Why not something more like the gems of music in Final Fantasy 6?GRAPHICSAnd one final issue: the game seems to be of the old, pixelated fashion. SNES was not designed this way for kicks, but for limiations. They did a great job on the graphics back in the day, and it worked for common TV screens. These days, we have large resolution screens with games of high potential, like La-Mulana, which fall short not only in stilted gameplay but with limited, 8-bit graphic stylization. If most gamers have a large resolution screen in 2013, the sprites should be created at a high, standard resolution (think 1920x1200,) and then downscaled to a measely 800x600, which is the standard this PC game is designed at.Lovely game, high potential, but the controls do not give you that fluid upper-hand you'd expect for a challenging retro game. Give us proper physics, and you'll have a much better game.			"

												Oh what this game could have been! It’s such a waste of potential.I don’t care whether the controls are intended to be a quirky reminiscence of old MSX games. Even back in those days they would have been considered too clumsy. They feel more like „Altered Beast“ on the Sega Mega Drive than „Super Mario World“ on the SNES. You lose all control of movement for a short time after a hit. Because more often than not, especially earlier in the game a small error you made is turned into a major setback by this. Second, diagonal jumps are hard to control precisely. You get quite good at working around these issues, but you can never quite master the controls, meaning that your natural progression as a player in this game is neither fostered nor valued by the game. This becomes especially obvious during boss battles. During normal gameplay, you tend to forget how clumsy the controls are. But then you get to a boss, and the realization comes back with a vengeance. Boss battles are more of a battle with the controls than with the bosses. Combine that with the buggy hit zones on some bosses. Sometimes they are not active when they should be. It gets better once you find upgrades such as the double jump, but it’s a serious flaw nonetheless.„But the exploration and item-hunting is so well done!“, some people say. No, it’s not. After the first area, there is often not the slightest indication what to do or explore next. At more than one point you have to discover a breakable wall whose placement seems completely random. The hints given on the stone tablets are too cryptic most of the time. Add to that the fact that sometimes a tablet gives a hint for the same room, but the next one gives a hint for a completely different area. Seriously, what’s the logic with that? This game does not present itself, but drops you in the middle of it and lets you figure it out for yourself, but in a way that is constantly screwed up by the awkward game design choices. This game pushes you back rather than drawing you into it. I guess some people may consider this a challenge, but it’s just a shame, because there’s so much potential in there.For how to draw a player in and provide a true sense of exploration without giving away everything too easily, look at the Metroid series. Or, even better, another contemporary nostalgic take on Metroid-like games: Cave Story+ shows how it’s done. Much better controls, secrets that can actually be found by indication instead of chance, and a nice progression of item hunting.La Mulana leaves you completely alone with the question what to explore and do next. Having to hunt for an unmarked, unhinted breakable wall through all discovered areas just to progress a little further is an unbelievably bad design. So is introducing a game mechanic that is neither used ever before or later in the game, or - even worse - expecting you to do the opposite of what you’ve learned earlier in the game. These strange choices culminate in the completely illogical and random design of the „Gate of Illusion“ area. There’s just no excuse for the mess this area is gameplay-wise.Such criticism is usually countered here by explaining that the game is a reminiscence to old MSX games or that the riddles and hints are logical once you understand them. Yeah, right. Well, congratulations on being a masochistic hardcore gamer and for fooling yourself by forgetting the many illogical riddles or way-too-obscure hints. If you can’t see how much unused potential has been wasted by the game design, you may not have played enough games which are both tough and well-designed. Because it’s perfectly possible to achieve both and *that’s* when you have a great game.			"

												Well, this is unfortunate. Getting hyped and hitting your face in a wall, it is. I wasn't deceived by the ""cool exploration and hard puzzles"" thing, that may be not a lie. The problem is: this game is just no good. The controls feel heavy, the screen/map loading is weird and... you know, no point ranting. People need to accept we're in 2014 and games that were created two decades ago (this is a remake, but whatever) are just what they are. That frustrating and unresponsive struggle masked as difficulty shouldn't be regarded as some fulfilling experience. Don't be fooled by nostalgia.			"

												Two words.....COMPLETE GARBAGE!! I cannot nor will I in my honesty recommend this rubbish to anyone. I now seem to recall seeing this game as a physical product in the cheap bin at a local store. Even then from what I could recall the package looked horrible. Steam needs to refrain from allowing these heaps of STEAMING trash from market release and the time of day. They are horrible examples of what devs should NOT do when developing games.Lamulana is a prime example of things gone ary in game creation. Teh graphics, the controls and the sounds are absolutely horrible and I cannot fathom who it is recommending this garbage!! It controls like it's  handicaapped. It looks like a blurry mess and in this is exactely what NOT to do with graphic design and animation. The music is a horrible throwback and serves only to aggrivate the heck out of a player.  Steam please stop offering these kind of games on the market pages. We as dedicated customers and players deserve protection from atrocities like this!!Games like this trully need to go the way of the dodo bird and cease to exist and be banished from all sight, sound and experience. ""I literally have a bad taste in my mouth from LA mulana that i feel like La PUKING!!!!Glad I only spent a couple dollars on this waste.........to all the reviewers reading this do yourself a great favor and avoid this game liek a plague and STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS GAME I WARN YOU!!!! Do not listen to the positive reviews; even in the early 90's LA mulana would of been regarded as crap!!!I normally wouldn't write a review like this, but I hope in my effort I can save some buyers from buyers remorse.

												**I already know this review will get a lot of ""not helpful"" hits. But as an old-school gamer looking for innovative Metroidvania style games, I do not recommend this game**Exploration? No. This is NOT a game that delivers on NES/SNES nostalgia. This is a game that was created for folks brought up in the 'walkthrough' era of gaming. There is no rhythm or mystique in the gameplay and level design, but rather a series of arbitrary 'locks' to manipulate in order to advance.I do like the controls, however, and I believe in more capable hands this game could justifiably be an Overwhelmingly Positive recommended game. I just wish there was more consideration for folks who appreciate good level design vs. obtuse ""puzzles"" (sorry, but activiating random weight spots isn't so much solving puzzles as it is throwing feces at a wall to see what sticks). Honestly, a better title would have been La-Arbitrair: Backtrack Hell.			"

												La Mulana could have been an interesting game had it been properly polished but instead, its just like the original free game this game is based on and offers very little to no changes besides some puzzle changes and higher difficulties.I wouldn't recommend this game for the following reasons1. Clunky Controls2. Unpolished mechanicsUnlike others, I don't mind the cryptic puzzles because I understand that is the main thing about the game. But damn the mechanics should've been polished enough as well as the controls to make this game tolerable.What do I mean by unpolished mechanics? Well let's start with how the game gives you very little information to understand the basics of the game. Unless you're watching videos, you are not getting a lot of info on how to get certain things right and how to even play the game. For those like me who are dumb and often stick to Nintendo games because of how simplistic the games are that they don't need any tutorials, don't expect any simplicity here because the game doesn't spoon feed you at all. The second problem is how horrible the health system is. There is no way to recover health during progress meaning to do that, you have to go back all the way to the entrance to heal and then go all the way to where you want to go. Enemies won't drop out health items like how majority of Metroidvania games do and when they do, they don't give health but this little sphere thing that if you get all 100, can restore your health.It becomes a problem because the enemies don't give these spheres that often and it makes it all the more frustrating. You can't even buy health items here.Speaking of buying, that same logic of health also applies to money as well which means on your first playthrough, you'll grind for hours and hours on money since money doesn't spawn as often as it should unless you go on some tricks which only applies very late in the game(which by then you wouldn't need that much of money since you reach the endgame by then)Then the game forces you to 100% the game inorder to beat just the main game. I understand why some games do this but in this game's case, doing it is a chore because there are tons of powerups that some are useful and some are useless so you'll end up getting stuff that won't be useful now but later and vise versa which again, the game doesn't hint you or even alert you of when to use said items. Not only that but the amount of powerups is large and very time consuming to the point that it feels like a chore sometimes because you don't feel like your making any progress at times.Then lastly, the open ended structure of this game is also terrible. Most sections are trial and error while some of them force you to lose health to get certain powerups and this isn't because of the cryptic puzzles this game has but rather how the levels themselves are designed so in other words, even if the cryptic puzzles don't screw you, the level designs will screw you instead.I wouldn't mind the clunky controls if this game didn't have a lot of platforming sections that require precise platforming to begin with alongside your attack function being delayed.To sum this up, think of this game as a spiritual successor to Simon's Quest only worse than that game and frustrating as hell.

												I had really high hopes for this game.  Unfortunately, it plays like Castlevania 2 from NES:  there is nothing to tell you what you're supposed to be doing whatsoever.  I enjoy figuring things out on my own to some extent, but this game just feels completely aimless.  The gameplay is clunky, the art isn't that great, and the presentation is very subpar.  I wrote ""the presentation is that of a 1993 3.5"" floppy disk PC game,"" but then I realized Doom had a far superior presentation, and I originally played Doom on a 3.5"" floppy, so yeah.			"

												I absolutely HATE this game.  With obtuse, non-sensical, ""How the hell am I supposed to know that?"" type puzzles, and dogsheet controls, this game suffers immensely.  Boss fights are held back by clunky controls, backtracking is this games middle name, and walkthroughs are not only your companion but your Holy Bible.  Sure, the first 1/4 of the game was decent and well paced, but this game says screw all of that, no fun for you.  I played this game as long as I possibly could.  Swear words poured from my lips every 15 seconds.  This game is a mess.  I beg you to not play it.  I do not want to see another human being suffer needlessly.  I'm absolutely through with this garbage.  I give it a 3/10, could have been sooooo much more if it were polished, handled better, and been a little less nebulous about the games overall feel.  I hate myself for buying this, I hate myself for playing this.  4 hours in, you'll see what I mean.			"

												Terrible. Retro done wrong. The controls are so bad it's just infurating to play. I sat down 3 seperate times to give this game a serious try and I've barely been able to play for 1 hour.  The music is bland and repetitive, and graphics are confusing. The design is all over the map, none of the graphics blend together. The enemy and NPC sprites are more detailed then the character. The player characters sprite is so bland looking that when you put it infront of the bright colorful backrounds it's jarring to look at, like it was pulled from a different game.This is also way overpriced, it feels like a free to play game ffs.

												This game answers the question ""What would the original Metroid be like if there was any rhyme or reason to the puzzles?"" The player is almost forced to keep a notebook to stay on top of the clues: the difficulty is mainly derived not from impossibly boss battles or jumps with a pixel-wide margin of error, but rather from the riddles that must be solved to progress. 99% of the solutions to the  puzzles that stumped me (which I was forced to look up) made me go ""Ahhhh, I see how I should have figured that out."" A must play for gamers for whom Cave Story mixed with 7th Guest seems like it might be fun.			"

												La-Mulana is an amazingly robust game offering classic nostalgia and fantastic exploration. It can be slow going at first, especially as you come across the multitude of areas that are blocked via various means but as with any true Metroidvania it simply continues to grow and offer immense riches as you follow it's winding path. The difficulty can sometimes be a bit cruel (think retro platformers) but he rewards for playing through this beauty are simply fantastic. If you are a fan of retro platformers, Metroidvanias, or simply want a game with tons of explorable areas then this is a must have.			"

												I've only had an hour of  La-Mulana  and I already feel like other people need to experience it.I feel like divulging information that I've discovered in-game breaches some kind of unwritten rules of the game that makes it more fun for newer players. La-Mulana  has some of the things I loved so much about  Dark Souls  in how difficulty is managed. If you're in an area that you're not ready for, you'll know.While this game does have a pause menu, it still feels tense. The realization that you can't just hide in your e-mails until all        the  spooky scary    skeletons go away is kind of  refreshing.While the translations probably simplify the dialogues and descriptions in-game, they're fun to read and are, in a surprisingly interesting way, loosely educational in places.It also makes me want to stand, fully-clothed, in some hot springs.If that's not a success, I don't know what is.

												Absolutely stunning game, and I thought it was just gona be another ho hum metroid like and short little game.This game annihilates all other metroidvania games, even SUPER METROID, in my opinion anyways. The sheer majesty of this game is shocking. From the humble and simple beginnings of just swinging my whip at snakes to collect gold, never would I have imagined the insane depth and enjoyment that would follow for a massive sprawling adventure.It took me 80 hours to beat the game and I only looked up a few things... Shamefully... an experience this phenomonal SHOULD BE PLAYED WITHOUT A GUIDE, no matter how stuck you think you are. You CAN solve pretty much every puzzle without a guide, but only if you think deeply and carefully. You really do get the sense of being like Indy Jones, reading, studying, obsessing over the many cryptic hints sprawled all over. The game can be solved in different ways with different levels of item completion, oh, and it has a hardcore mode too, as if it wasn't hard enough already!This kind of cryptic riddle solving is usually not my type of game, and yet I found myself hopelessly addicted to solving the ancient and increasingly fascinating mysteries of La-Mulana.The reward of finally solving some nasty riddle, or defeating one of the many very challenging bosses is a new visually exciting zone, more awesome powerups, with yet another great music to go with it..... zone after zone.... I was blown away by how big the game was, and how much great music is here. This is one of the most incredible gaming soundtracks in history. The game is worth 15 bucks on the music alone.Still on the fence about this? Let me put it to you bluntly.....Did you love Super Metroid?yeah?THEN YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO PLAY LA-MULANA!!! THERE IS NO EXCUSE! This game is NOT for the weak willed who cry to momma when the game kicks their behind, and it will, time and time again! And it makes no apologies for it. Bats will constantly knock you into spikes, pits, and doom! OH THE FREAKING BATS!!! STOP IT !!! STOOOOOP IT!!!!!! NOOOOOO!!!L2P NOOB OR DIE!!Prepare to rage harder then you have EVER raged at a game before. I PROMISE YOU WILL HATE THIS GAME at times! You will SCREAM in anger and agony from that *blankity* horrible and unfair knockback mechanic!.... and yet....... by the end of the game... you should realize it was a big part of the challange and taught you to PLAY BETTER!I rage quit many times... yet I was helpless and unable to stay away for long. I haved learned to deeply appreciate and love the challenge found in this game.CONCLUSION----Tight controls, fun progression with awesome powerups, very challenging, intellectually stimulating, teasingly addictive gameplay, stunning soundtrack, awesome visuals, epic boss battles, humongous game, fascinating story and lore, wicked awesome clever riddles, hard mode, speed run mode, boss rush mode, hell bonus level, a bathing suit, THIS GAME HAS IT ALL! All while kicking your posterior to kingdom come.I am a very jaded cynical gamer.... and yet..La-Mulana is one of the GRANDMASTERS, a true CHAMPION of gaming history. I feel sorry for anyone who's too much of a wuss to stick with it and solve it. They are missing out on one of the very best gaming has to offer in 40 years of gaming history period.			"

												Summary: La-Mulana is a massive Metroidvania game with smooth controls, beautiful environments, a great story, absolutely wonderful music, and ingenious puzzles that will take more than all your wit and luck to solve. But when your wit and skill pulls through for you and opens up the ruins further, you'll be rewarded with a true feeling of accomplishment.Review:This game will not hold your hand, period. You'll have to explore, find key items, and keep yourself alive by your own wit and skill. The clues scattered throughout the game are beyond numerous, and even if you write them all down, it'll take ingenuity and experimentation to decipher the meaning in the words, and figure out how that translates to an action to take in the game. Sometimes you'll even have to go the SOTN route and smack walls and floors in a blind hope of finding something (just be sure to check for eyes...). The most important key item in the entire game is easily missable, and is essentially required to explore the deeper parts of the ruins, as it allows you to teleport to save areas throughout. Traps and tough mini-bosses/bosses (which are all massive and wonderfully done) will kill you more than just a couple of times, and you'll just have to deal with it.My advice, explore as much as possible and gather clues rather than just sticking to one place. Clues don't always apply (in fact frequently they don't) to the area they are found in, and weapons/subweapons/power ups can be attained to help with issues you have with fights from other areas. Everyone will work through this game in their own order and pace when playing this game, and that's part of the beauty of it. Since you'll go in your own order though, a typical walkthrough will not be that helpful unless you read everything and spoil it for yourself. That being said, if you need help while playing, just hit the good old Shift + Tab and check out ""The Cartographer's Guide to La-Mulana"". It provides detailed maps of each area, including puzzle solutions and key items, while allowing you to focus your search to just the area you're having trouble with.Now I definitely can't say the puzzles are entirely ""fair"", but a large majority are. There were ~5-6 instances in this game where I was hopelessly lost, Shift + Tabbed, and after doing so, still didn't think any clue pointed to the solution (*cough* mario warp pipe nonsense *cough*). Particularly with the Hell Temple, I have no freaking clue how you could figure out how to unlock it on your own. The puzzles in the Hell Temple itself make sense (mostly), but the weird series of steps to unlock it are just ridiculous (funny, but ridiculous).Also, I know I didn't go into detail, but the music in this game is freaking awesome. I mean it, some of the best ever for the genre of game. Blend up some Megaman X & Castlevania and be drawn into it.On sale, this game is a steal. Buy it and have fun, get totally lost, and one way or another, reach the end.			"

												One of the all-great retro platformers. La-Mulana derives it's inspiration from world mythology, Indiana Jones and most of all, old MSX games. As you progress in the game, the game expands greatly on all fronts. The deceptively simple game mechanics are built upon layer upon layer, the levels get larger and more complex, the bosses get bigger and badder, the mythology and lore gets more and more elaborate.. and knowing it will become necessary to solve some of the most fiendishly difficult puzzles ever seen in a platformer. Still, the game does not resort to unfairness. Every challenge is surmountable, no enemy is invulnerable, and every puzzle has a hint somewhere. At least, until the mythical Hell Temple. But then again, that place is designed for people who want to prevail against all odds. Everyone else can expect 30ish ours of best platforming that you can hope to get.			"

												Great game, very challenging.I really like the graphics and the music.The puzzles, well... I got to the point where I deafeated four bosses and acquired the feather, without consulting any external guide (i.e. internet).But after that, it got way to cryptic and even unfair. False walls, breakable walls, spots where you need to press down, spots where you need to press up,... mostly without any hint. So, don't feel bad if you need a strategy guide at some point(s).But overall, I recommend this game. A better hint system would have been nice, but I hear that the sequel will aim for less confusion.			"

												A game very much inspired by the games of old, La-Mulana is a rather challenging SotN style, or more accurately, Maze of Galious style action adventure game, with a strong focus on exploration and puzzle solving. Players are expected to learn from repeated deaths and make steady progress over time. Unlike many games nowadays, La-Mulana is very open ended and permits the players to advance in any direction they see fit to a point, as there are select key items that will open vast new portions of each area to the player.So to put it bluntly, I love exploring, challenges, using my own wit to succeed, and going wherever I please, whenever I feel like it. They just don't make games quite like this anymore and maybe this is a key factor to my enjoyment to this game, but the style and aesthetic of the game appeals to me as well, as it makes me reminisce on the games I love from my youth. NIGORO made an amazing game, and I feel you should help them out. Already cleared the game several times now, still finding neat details, and hidden items and areas I hadn't seen before. Oh yeah, I like a little bit of history too, and a lot of this game's ruin design is steeped in it. Its enjoyable to me to stop at something unusual or unknown to me and research it a little. La-Mulana is a game that just keeps on giving.Be prepared to take notes/take pictures, keep your eyes peeled, and think differently. Also die a lot.			"

												If you can get past the difficult, sometimes obtuse puzzles a great game awaits you. Exploration is the main part of the game, combined with some very light RPG/item collection elements you may know from Metroid/Castlevania games. The music is great, the graphics charming.  It's worth the full price but can be gotten really cheap at sales, so try it! Excellent game overall.			"

												This game is great. I love this game intensely. And yet I didn't even manage to beat it. This game is hard. And I don't mean the platforming or the combat, but actually solving the puzzles is hard as balls. You can call them ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t puzzles, and I'm not going to try and refute that. While all the solutions to puzzles are scattered about the ruins you'll often find yourself failing to find an answer to your problem. Still... this game is fantastic. It rewards exploring and has some of the best music I've heard in games. If you're uncertain, wait for a sale, if you think you might like what I'd describe as a 2D Dark Souls then this is probably for you. I LOVE IT EVEN THOUGH I COULD NOT BEAT IT! Yet...			"

												La Mulana may be the hardest metroidvania ever created. The combat is appreciably difficult and the challenge increases as the game goes on, but that's not where the game shines. The puzzles encountered in the game are both extremely difficult yet gratifying to complete, many of them solved when you have an ""ah-ha!"" moment and finally put all the pieces together. The soundtrack is also superb.That being said, the game is not for everyone. If you haven't played it in a few days/weeks, you may not remember where it is you were going to be exploring next and be even more lost than ever. It's not for the faint of heart or brain.			"

												I looked at the Kickstarter for La Mulana 2 and saw that their objective in making La Mulana was to revive the 2D platform and they ended up succeeding in that goal. I got La Mulana for $1.90 and by God, it is worth every penny. Even if it was $5, I would have paid that much if I knew this game was going to be this much fun. This game revives the 2D Adventure Platformer by taking hints from Castlevania and Metroid, improving them, adding its own flavor and improving the graphics of each. It is a thrill to play and the music is simply amazing. Get this game, and throw money at the Kickstarter for La Mulana 2 because we need more games like this, games that continue to redefine and refine the industry.			"

												Extremely fun exploration and extremely difficult puzzles. If you decide to go through this without using help, it'll easily take you over a hundred hours to figure everything out, perhaps even more. But if you can balance your frustration and fun levels, and have a hint guru (either a wiki or a friend who's beaten it), then it can be a very enjoyable experience. The graphics, gameplay, and music are all excellent, so this is definitely recommended.			"

												This game is a fantastic throwback to the old school 2D adventure games.  It's a Metroidvania, there are plenty of skills and items to find, etc.There are a lot of good things to say about this game.  The combat is great.  You start with only a whip but you get different items over time including a Katana.  The menu system is very innovative; your character is equipped with a mobile PC which has multiple functions including deciphering ancient tablets and using your map!  You can equip and unequip these ""programs"" depending on how much ""memory"" you have available in your PC!The puzzles are interesting.  This game will make you think, but it's also action packed! The only problem I have is the old school jumping mechanics.  Like in the classic 2D adventure games of old, you can't change direction in mid-jump.  You're committed once you're in the air.  Also, when you fall from a ledge, you're forward momentum stops and you fall straight down.  If you want to move horizontally, you'll have to jump first!  You CAN control the height of your jump, however.Another con is the resolution.  If you have a 16:9 monitor, you'll have bars on the right and left sides, but you can enable cool artwork to take up that space!This is one of those games where you have to do a little bit of researching the manual.  You need some things from the merchants in the starting area before you can fully explore.All in all, I recommend this game wholeheartedly.  Dive into the world of La-Mulana!			"

												This game is not as difficult as others have said....La-Mulana is an homage to the older adventure games of the NES era. Castlevania, Battle of Olympus, and Faxanadu all rolled into one great little package. Just like the games of yester-year, La-Mulana does not hold your hand. It is up to the player to remember all the little details that add up later. To be able to find the hidden entrances that others in a hurry might miss. This game is about the fine details, covering every inch of every room to find your way! If you enjoy a solid challenge, and a grand adventure (with a little naughty mixed in), La-Mulana awaits!!

												This one is controversial... yet, it is an adventure gem. Up to a mid-game it plays brilliantly - full of exploration, character, discovery, figuring out what to do next. Bosses are somewhat on a grindy side of the moon (pixel accuracy madness). Somewhere in mid-game (you'll know when it happens) the only recommendation is - forget it :-) It is more of design flaws and pixel accuracy of latter bosses that break the flow then anything else (alternatively you can use FAQ)... But two components which still make this game a gem for me (and practically all other games miss) are there - exploration and discovery. Just wish design choices were more player-friendly in otherwise great game...A tip: buy this on-sale, so you won't regret it.			"

												This is a game for masochists.I mean, really, who wants to spend 50+ hours running around a dungeon, frustrated and confused by where to go, failing to make the same jump because a stupid bat flew in your way, retreading steps to find that hidden entrance you missed so you could get that item you need to summon the boss, and then getting blown up by said boss over and over again. You will die in this game. A lot. ...and yet there's something magical about it still. The freedom of exploration, the amount of depth to the level design, the satisfaction of finally killing that stupid Lizard monster from the minecart, and the hope just maybe if you make it far enough into the lava you'll find an item worth the struggle. This is one of the best crafted, charming, unforgivingly brutal Metroidvania-style games out there. From time to time you may need to take a break, and the temptation to use a guide is extremely real, but the enjoyment you'll find in the surprisingly deep story, settings, and gameplay is what makes this game worth playing - as long as you're ready for a challenge ;)UPDATE: While I still give this game a thumbs up, the difficulty and the lack of guidance was enough to make me quit. It stopped being fun having a guide alongside my playthrough. Still, give it a shot.			"

												So, I picked up this game cause it was on sale a while back and decided ""Why not?"", and unlike most things I happen to get on a whim, this game happened to be a real treasure.  Starting off though, I HIGHLY recommend a Gamepad of sorts for this game. I can only imagine going through this game with a Keyboard would make one want to Chuck it out the window. If you do NOT have a Gamepad, some of the platforming will be quite difficult assuming you are too used to platforming like elements with a controller as I was. Also the jumping physics take some getting used to.Gameplay: The gameplay is as other people have called it ""Metroidvania"" Wheras the game is centered around these large ruins and have seperate areas within the ruins that define as ""other levels"" So, in a nut shell, you go around the ruins exploring, trying to figure out what purpose these ruins have or what mysteries you can unfold. The more you discover, the more items you unlock, thus allowing access to different areas of the ruins.Difficulty: Wow, there are parts in this game where it makes you wanna rage, but if you're like me, and enjoy a challenege. It's all in good fun. You cannot heal yourself by normal means, you have to either go to the hotspring outside the ruins, or collect enough green orbs to ""Level up""      The puzzles in this game are quite clever ranging from block destrcution order to in game ciphers. Though there are puzzles as simple as placing a weight on a pedestal (or dias as called in this game) So, there is a large degree of puzzle difficulty variation in this game. (Protip: No hint is too small in this game)     The bosses.. holy crap. Their moveset may not be very extensive, but they are very unforgiving. There are 9 Main bosses in this game. The first one being... generally easy, but after that, it's no cakewalk. These bosses generally take a degree of skill to defeat. If you die, you have to start all the way back from your last quick save. It's usually not THAT far of a walk, though there is this one area where its just annoying.. gotta wait for elevators... and suicidal fish.. just a bad experience, but made one feel so accomplished after finally taking care of the foul boss for that victorious fanfare after defeating a boss.Music: The Music in this game is quite amazing I think. Not really much else to say.Storyline: Kind of non-existant untill about halfway through the game. There's slight lore on each area of the ruins, but once you reach that halfway mark and the lore starts to tie into each other, It becomes clear that there is MUCH more to the ruins than one could have initially thought of. I love it.  Category Rating   Gameplay 8   Soundtrack 9   Story 7   Difficulty 8   Overall 8-9 Overall, This game's got alot of good things going for it, music, story, memorable characters. It's difficulty and obscure puzzles may deter other gamers, but I enjoy the challenge. Pick up this game if you enjoy one as well!! You won't regret it.			"

												A great Metroidvania platformer with a good sense of boss design and challenge but poor conveyance on puzzles.Presentation:This is a standard 16 bit 2D graphics. Nothing technically special but the environments are based off designs of various cultures throughout the world. Enemies are based off some form of mythology. The bosses start off fairly intimidating then you encounter a satanic goat.The sound track is great and there's even a sound test within the game. There's a variety of instruments used.Story:You play an archelogist named Lemeza who tries to search for his father in the La Mulana Ruins. The lore of this game is found on ancient tablets and you piece together them to learn the history of this place.Lemenza is a silent protagonist but there are other characters that offer hints to you adventure but are still somewhat funny. There's the old man obsessed with video games and like to tell obvious lies that are funny because how blunt it is. Too bad every other character is just exposition or shopkeepers telling you to buy something.Gameplay:The controls are fine with keyboard but platforming is like Castlevania I on NES.Jumping while moving gives you little control in manuvering your jump, but standing still and jumping will pause you in place for a second and then given full control of you jump. This isn't too much of a problem espcially once you get the double jump. The worst part of the platforming is when you walk off a ledge. You lose any form of movement until you reach the ground. This can be really annoying since you will climb up long vertical shafts.You gain a large number of powerups and weapons that will help you through La Mulana. Weapons have different attack arcs that can help you hit certain enemies much easilly but you will probably stick with the whip with its hidden upgrades or the axe which has an excellent attack arc.There's also sub weapons that provides a ranged attack that run on individual ammo system that can be switched around easilly once you find them. Weapons range from surikens to a very expensive but deadly pistol.There's usable items that only serve the purpose of opening certain areas or reading tablets. There is one however that is very overpowered and can break nearly every sub boss.The powerups are fairly simple to increased HP or movement speed, but none of them really change the game except the double jump powerup.The last items you collect is computer software. Most of these items are either hidden or can bought in the store. They do various things like giving a map of the area granted you have the map of the place, or translate stone tablets. There's also hidden software combinations that cause special changes but you really don't know what it did.The normal enemies are good in variety but some are designed just to make platforming really annoying. There's a medusa head like enemy that shoots arrows at you. They also cause the Lemeza to have knockback which can be very annoying when platforming.Most sub bosses you encounter can be dispatched with full HP with little strategy and the ones that can't be dispatched either test your paitence or requires actual skill. The main bosses are all pretty challening but lack variety of moves. Once you learn to dodge them while still able to deal damage, then they are no problem.Outside of fighting and platforming are puzzles and secrets throughout the entire place of La Mulana Ruins. Now this is the biggest strength and its biggest flaw. Be prepared to take notes on stone tablets because those will be hints to puzzles in the zone you are or in a completely different area. Some of the tablets are pretty clever. However, some are just vague. There's one that requires you to pause the game in certain places. Then find a hidden warp pipe that leads to 4 tablets that gives vague one word hints.The amount of times I had to use a walkthrough is too much. Add some breakable/fake walls, or special hidden locks that can only be opened by a randomized summon. The good news is that the most vague puzzles are optional and miss nothing too major. There's still some ungodly hidden secrets you need to solve.If this game did not have puzzles, then it was still be a great game, but some puzzles are pretty good. There's great skill based obstacles you have to go through. This game still is very hard when it comes to combat.			"

												La-Mulana is an amazingly robust game offering classic nostalgia and fantastic exploration. It can be slow going at first, especially as you come across the multitude of areas that are blocked via various means but as with any true Metroidvania it simply continues to grow and offer immense riches as you follow it's winding path. The difficulty can sometimes be a bit cruel (think retro platformers) but he rewards for playing through this beauty are simply fantastic. If you are a fan of retro platformers, Metroidvanias, or simply want a game with tons of explorable areas then this is a must have.			"

												This is my favorite game. This is my favorite game ever.The atmosphere in this game is incredible. Your adventure begins in a small 32-bit village just on the outskirts of the ruins. There are numerous expansive locations to explore in this game and with a clever warp system you're able to traverse them all without too much difficulty. Our protagonist, Lemeza Kosugi, starts off armed with nothing more than a whip and a laptop but by the conclusion is armed to the teeth with multiple weapon types, ancient artifacts and supernatural devices. The writing is clever and the dialogue can be very humorous. Your relationship with the plot can be as independent or amorous as you wish, however I would highly recommend getting involved because I found the histories and tales to be extremely compelling.Patience is recommended. This game is very difficult and some of the puzzles can be straight up obtuse. It's difficult to find out where to proceed next and what to do in the game, but every puzzle and path can be understood if you study your surroundings and use the resources available. Write down everything! You will not regret it.I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game so much I can't even really write a review. I'm just kinda talking about it. Buy it. Buy two copies.10 STARS 5/5 GOTYAlso ♥♥♥♥ Viy.			"

												One of the all-great retro platformers. La-Mulana derives it's inspiration from world mythology, Indiana Jones and most of all, old MSX games. As you progress in the game, the game expands greatly on all fronts. The deceptively simple game mechanics are built upon layer upon layer, the levels get larger and more complex, the bosses get bigger and badder, the mythology and lore gets more and more elaborate.. and knowing it will become necessary to solve some of the most fiendishly difficult puzzles ever seen in a platformer. Still, the game does not resort to unfairness. Every challenge is surmountable, no enemy is invulnerable, and every puzzle has a hint somewhere. At least, until the mythical Hell Temple. But then again, that place is designed for people who want to prevail against all odds. Everyone else can expect 30ish ours of best platforming that you can hope to get.			"

												I never got into the retro platformers, the retro games that made it so your weapon would have windup time, the ones that made it so you couldn't change the trajectory of your jumps while you're in the air, the very same games that made it so that each time an enemy touched you, you'd bounced back (sometimes into a pit). Much like Castlevania 2, La-Mulana is full of cryptic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like kneeling at a foot of a certain giant, jumping into a death pit to retrieve a chest, or putting monsters in place of walls in order to discourage you to go further and come back later.La-Mulana embodies all of that retro gaming ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and I love it.

												I prefer metroidvania's in comparison to most other games. There's the feeling of exploration that you don't get from other genres, an air of freedom that's restricted only by your equipment and skill, the challenge of reaching something new that's mere inches over the tower of angry crazed monstrocities that haven't tasted food in centuries, just waiting for you to slip... It's amazing.La Mulana definitely met what I was looking for. It's a scarilly difficult game, but it's fantastic. If you're willing to brave the countless monsters lurking around the ruins, and smart enough to outwit the builders of these crazy traps and puzzles, this game is for you. There's treasure to be found, people to help, and a mess of bosses and sub-bosses that will have you rattling the controller in rage... in a good way. The game is beyond the simple word ""challenging"", which is flung around too often these days.Be warned though, brute force is NOT the answer to the majority of puzzles. You have to be smart with this game. Bosses themselves are a puzzle of what is safe, and what... isn't. And believe me, if you make a mistake with bosses, the all too common game over screen should be enough to tell you to try something else. If in doubt, look to the manual on the website. If that's not enough, there's no shame in looking to a guide. This game, in a few cases, demands it.			"

												La-Mulana focuses heavily on riddles and exploring inside a gigantic ruin. Some of these puzzles can be quite difficult to solve, but then you really feel you accomplished something. But even if you feel stuck, just go to another area, as many parts of the ruins can be accessed from the beginning. Others can be reached by obtaining certain items.There's a lot of different items, main and sub weapons to be found, each serving a certain purpose. So this gets elevated to a Metroidvania-style game.You even do not have to fight the bosses in a fixed order to progress. As for those boss battles, these are varied as well: There are stationary ones, in one fight you ride a track down in a mine-cart, while the foe follows you.Awesome.My only gripe in the game is some very obscure hints for certain puzzles. You probably might have to look up somewhere or trying out a lot there - but be assured, there so much to do in the game, You will never feel bad, if you 'cheated' after you clocked so many hours into the game already. Just check that thing in a suspicious room further (or go somewhere else, as stated above) and move on your own.The controls themselves are solid and work as intended. Only jumping down below properly needs some practice first. Lemeza falls straight down, if he doesn't jump from a cliff, unable to change direction. Luckily there is no fall damage and many regular enemies only do little damage, except for some sub and main bosses.Take a hop before jumping on platforms below you - and you can move Lemeza in mid-air. Required for certain puzzles and just being a small hint.I play the game with a keyboard by the way, while the game has full controller support, including XBOX360 support as in the dscription, and there's no problem with controlling that way as well.The Graphics are really well done. They are stretched in fullscreen, the aspect ratio is mantainted properly. In widescreen formats the black bars can be decorated with murals and other images by going into the Options menu - which is a nice touch. Each ruin is vastly different, many background objects and statues are unique (and often required to be examined further by the game). There's even a hidden area, where you explore some of the original areas with the MSX-style graphics from the 2005 version.Music and sound are nicely done as well. While the tracks might repeat too quickly, many of the areas (in my case, e. g. the Temple of Moonlight) have catchy background music, some more decent, others being more dominant. For anyone who likes videogame music, this might be just right. The sound effects help you, be it a breakable wall which makes a certain crumble noise if struck by (certain) weapons, different tunes whenever you fail or solve a puzzle and other effects.If you don't mind the difficulty at times and love either cool boss battles and some brain-teasing puzzles, get this game ASAP. It's worth every penny, especially at that bargain in this sale.			"

One fool believed, in his foolishness, that he was a wise man. The fool flaunted his shallow wisdom and made decisions with a narrow mind. He proceeded to the right without hesitation.  Another fool possessed wisdom, but his knowledge led him to believe he was a fool. A fool who smothers himself without first considering the situation. He went with the flow, and proceeded to the left.One can only hope that a true wise man stands here now. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------La-Mulana is not for the faint of heart or weak of mind. This is NOT a game where you can grind until you're strong enough to win. This is NOT a game where you can skip the lore and expect to succeed. And this is most certainly NOT a game where you can expect an easy victory just because you looked up the puzzle solutions online.Despite what my Steam records say, I've beaten this game twice now. (First the original, then a non-Steam release of this remake.) And neither time was easy in the slightest. You want fun? Play this. You want bland tedium that will atrophy your brain? Play your Call of Warbattles or Flappy Crush.La-Mulana is more than a video game; It's a test of character.(Soapboxing aside, I have to point out that the Linux version seems kinda janky. Just a warning.)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Those who do not listen, do not make light of the words of others. To come so far, blinded by pride at thine own powers... thou art a true fool. A fool deserves naught but death. "

												this game is absolutely NOT for everyone. For example, a little over 80% of the people who bought this game can not figure out how to enter the ruins from the starting village! It is a puzzle based game mostly, and not the usual kind of puzzle either, the basis is usually to obtain a very hard to understand hint then apply it to a part of the ruins. For example, you begin the game with an inability to look at written text, so you have to figure out how to spend the money you have. You are expected to look at all the shop’s wares in the village and then purchase a portable scanner for your laptop. Another portion of this games puzzles is looking for places to apply game mechanics. Many times, a suspicious looking block can be broken to reveal treasure, or pushed out of the way, or can be walked through. Attacking certain things will be punished in the ruins though, so one should always be cautious.Many people also have a problem with the way the controls are: the keyboard control scheme may take some getting used to because the menu, pause, and movement keys can not be rebound (in other words- If you like WASD, too bad). Some have a bigger problem with the way the character moves-If you run then jump you will continue to in the direction you were going in a semi-adjustable arc, and if you walk off of a precipice will fall directly down. The only way to have control in mid air is to jump while standing still. You will then have control on the way down.the bosses are hard. So hard that unless you have certain items you will fail endlessly (or be very lucky, or spend a total of twenty-seven minutes between each attack you make dodging). you would have a easier time Beating Final Fantasy XII Blind on a low level You, see, LA-MULANA is like an avocado, it is a rich oily superfood, unique among most other fruits, but also has a taste that many find off-putting, or love. Even if you are not a fan of this game, if you play two and three quarter hours into the game you will see that it is a game polished and slaved over for the twelve years that it was.but sad to say as for me I would find it more fun drinking Gasoline, then jumping head-long into a cactus, having my friend set the cactus on fire, pour and rub salt on my wounds then after I'm all healed up Pay a Wizard to turn me into a goat send me to Iraq get violated by a local, then die from bloodloss  if this game was made by Nintendo they would have to litteraly have to get you sign a waiver so you would not Sue there asses this game is not even possiblewatch a video walkthrough step by step is my recommendation			"

												IN SHORT: A very difficult game in the tradition of NES Metroid and Castlevania.Within the last year or so I learned the term ""Metroidvania"" and it seems like it was made for this game.  Gameplay reminds me a lot of the original Metroid, and then you're whipping skeletons just like Castlevania.I guess I was warned, but this is a hard game.  As if fighting your way through the ruins wasn't hard enough already there are hidden booby traps (frustrating, but adds a fun new element as well).I love the mix of cultural artifacts from around the world you see, and I like the story of the Mother Goddess who created the Earthly races in hopes they could return her to the heavens--and who periodically kills them off when they anger her.You find lots of clues on stone tablets (which may apply to something you'll find in a whole different area).  In theory it'd be fun to piece together the story like this, but I've found them more difficult to understand and sort of generic sounding (this is probably do in part to the translation from Japanese).I've made some progress (defeated one boss) and am hoping I can get past the difficulty factor and really get into this game, but it's possible I might give up.

												Some warnings up-front: this game can be hard to get into.  The controls aren't explained well initially, and it takes time to get a feel for the platforming mechanics, which are fairly idiosyncratic.  It's not an easy game either; it pulls very few punches and is much stingier than most modern games about checkpoint placement and health recovery.  There are also several fairly tough puzzles that require some creative interpretation of the sometimes-badly-translated hints strewn throughout the game.Despite all of the above, this is quite simply one of the largest and most satisfying Metroidvania games I've ever played.  The maps are massive, the backstory is interesting and integrated into the puzzles.  The power-ups are fun, and the weapons provide enough variety to be satisfying without being numerous enough that any of them feel like afterthoughts.  In terms of content for the price, this game is an absolute steal.  If you have the chops for it, bring your action-platformer and adventure-game-puzzler A-games and take this one on right away.			"

												I haven't enjoyed a game like this in YEARS. I'd best describe La-Mulana as 'Castlevania: Symphony of the Night' with the go-where-you-want/progress-how-you-will attitude of the original 'The Legend of Zelda'.  The game world it presents, ends up being a large, well-trodden one, full of cryptic puzzles, whose solutions often grant you a piece to solving a greater puzzle.If you enjoy “tough but fair” games, and/or are in the market for a lengthy journey, I'd give La-Mulana a look.P.S.

												A great Metroidvania platformer with a good sense of boss design and challenge but poor conveyance on puzzles.Presentation:This is a standard 16 bit 2D graphics. Nothing technically special but the environments are based off designs of various cultures throughout the world. Enemies are based off some form of mythology. The bosses start off fairly intimidating then you encounter a satanic goat.The sound track is great and there's even a sound test within the game. There's a variety of instruments used.Story:You play an archelogist named Lemeza who tries to search for his father in the La Mulana Ruins. The lore of this game is found on ancient tablets and you piece together them to learn the history of this place.Lemenza is a silent protagonist but there are other characters that offer hints to you adventure but are still somewhat funny. There's the old man obsessed with video games and like to tell obvious lies that are funny because how blunt it is. Too bad every other character is just exposition or shopkeepers telling you to buy something.Gameplay:The controls are fine with keyboard but platforming is like Castlevania I on NES.Jumping while moving gives you little control in manuvering your jump, but standing still and jumping will pause you in place for a second and then given full control of you jump. This isn't too much of a problem espcially once you get the double jump. The worst part of the platforming is when you walk off a ledge. You lose any form of movement until you reach the ground. This can be really annoying since you will climb up long vertical shafts.You gain a large number of powerups and weapons that will help you through La Mulana. Weapons have different attack arcs that can help you hit certain enemies much easilly but you will probably stick with the whip with its hidden upgrades or the axe which has an excellent attack arc.There's also sub weapons that provides a ranged attack that run on individual ammo system that can be switched around easilly once you find them. Weapons range from surikens to a very expensive but deadly pistol.There's usable items that only serve the purpose of opening certain areas or reading tablets. There is one however that is very overpowered and can break nearly every sub boss.The powerups are fairly simple to increased HP or movement speed, but none of them really change the game except the double jump powerup.The last items you collect is computer software. Most of these items are either hidden or can bought in the store. They do various things like giving a map of the area granted you have the map of the place, or translate stone tablets. There's also hidden software combinations that cause special changes but you really don't know what it did.The normal enemies are good in variety but some are designed just to make platforming really annoying. There's a medusa head like enemy that shoots arrows at you. They also cause the Lemeza to have knockback which can be very annoying when platforming.Most sub bosses you encounter can be dispatched with full HP with little strategy and the ones that can't be dispatched either test your paitence or requires actual skill. The main bosses are all pretty challening but lack variety of moves. Once you learn to dodge them while still able to deal damage, then they are no problem.Outside of fighting and platforming are puzzles and secrets throughout the entire place of La Mulana Ruins. Now this is the biggest strength and its biggest flaw. Be prepared to take notes on stone tablets because those will be hints to puzzles in the zone you are or in a completely different area. Some of the tablets are pretty clever. However, some are just vague. There's one that requires you to pause the game in certain places. Then find a hidden warp pipe that leads to 4 tablets that gives vague one word hints.The amount of times I had to use a walkthrough is too much. Add some breakable/fake walls, or special hidden locks that can only be opened by a randomized summon. The good news is that the most vague puzzles are optional and miss nothing too major. There's still some ungodly hidden secrets you need to solve.If this game did not have puzzles, then it was still be a great game, but some puzzles are pretty good. There's great skill based obstacles you have to go through. This game still is very hard when it comes to combat.			"

												An 2D exploration-driven Metroidvania. The platforming and combat can be tricky. The rest of the game is much, much harder. Very well crafted, from the graphics to the action to the writing to the puzzles to the killer soundtrack,The exploration is very open-ended and organic feeling, which makes the world feel very real. It also means it's easy to venture into places you probably shouldn't be without realizing it. (a word of advice: DO NOT leave the first area before you get the Grail). Diving too deep will likely get you killed. But then again, going where you're supposed to go next can get you killed anyway. La Mulana is not a safe place.The puzzles and the story of the ruins are heavily interwoven. Bits of lore and puzzle hints are scattered everywhere, and the heart of the game is piecing it all together. Every puzzle has its solution implied somewhere, but percieving and understanding it may not happen on the first, or even the tenth, examination. The game starts hard and gets much harder, with the riddles, the hints, and the answers getting more esoteric as you progress, and spread over a much wider area of the ruins.That puzzle and progression design means that it's easy to have little idea what to do next. Am I supposed to be here? Does that tablet apply to this puzzle? Do I even have all of the items I need to complete it? Was I supposed to solve that other puzzle first? Multiply that uncertainty by 3, 4, 5 partially-explored areas on opposite ends of the ruins, and the confusion can quickly get overwhelming. If this sort of thing sounds terrible, La Mulana may not be for you, but the mechanics work wonderfully to enforce the mentality of exploring ancient, trap-filled, unforgiving ruins that nonetheless hide deep, deep secrets. That atmosphere is reinforced by stellar art direction and an excellent score (One of my top 5 VG soundtracks) You must be cautious, patient, thorough, willing to brave danger, and deeply dedicated to sifting through pieces of lost knowledge if you want to uncover just what lies in the depths of La Mulana.

Much like Castlevania 2, La-Mulana is full of cryptic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like kneeling at a foot of a certain giant, jumping into a death pit to retrieve a chest, or putting monsters in place of walls in order to discourage you to go further and come back later.La-Mulana embodies all of that retro gaming ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and I love it.

												Summary: La-Mulana is a massive Metroidvania game with smooth controls, beautiful environments, a great story, absolutely wonderful music, and ingenious puzzles that will take more than all your wit and luck to solve. But when your wit and skill pulls through for you and opens up the ruins further, you'll be rewarded with a true feeling of accomplishment.Review:This game will not hold your hand, period. You'll have to explore, find key items, and keep yourself alive by your own wit and skill. The clues scattered throughout the game are beyond numerous, and even if you write them all down, it'll take ingenuity and experimentation to decipher the meaning in the words, and figure out how that translates to an action to take in the game. Sometimes you'll even have to go the SOTN route and smack walls and floors in a blind hope of finding something (just be sure to check for eyes...). The most important key item in the entire game is easily missable, and is essentially required to explore the deeper parts of the ruins, as it allows you to teleport to save areas throughout. Traps and tough mini-bosses/bosses (which are all massive and wonderfully done) will kill you more than just a couple of times, and you'll just have to deal with it.My advice, explore as much as possible and gather clues rather than just sticking to one place. Clues don't always apply (in fact frequently they don't) to the area they are found in, and weapons/subweapons/power ups can be attained to help with issues you have with fights from other areas. Everyone will work through this game in their own order and pace when playing this game, and that's part of the beauty of it. Since you'll go in your own order though, a typical walkthrough will not be that helpful unless you read everything and spoil it for yourself. That being said, if you need help while playing, just hit the good old Shift + Tab and check out ""The Cartographer's Guide to La-Mulana"". It provides detailed maps of each area, including puzzle solutions and key items, while allowing you to focus your search to just the area you're having trouble with.Now I definitely can't say the puzzles are entirely ""fair"", but a large majority are. There were ~5-6 instances in this game where I was hopelessly lost, Shift + Tabbed, and after doing so, still didn't think any clue pointed to the solution (*cough* mario warp pipe nonsense *cough*). Particularly with the Hell Temple, I have no freaking clue how you could figure out how to unlock it on your own. The puzzles in the Hell Temple itself make sense (mostly), but the weird series of steps to unlock it are just ridiculous (funny, but ridiculous).Also, I know I didn't go into detail, but the music in this game is freaking awesome. I mean it, some of the best ever for the genre of game. Blend up some Megaman X & Castlevania and be drawn into it.On sale, this game is a steal. Buy it and have fun, get totally lost, and one way or another, reach the end.			"

												One of the all-great retro platformers. La-Mulana derives it's inspiration from world mythology, Indiana Jones and most of all, old MSX games. As you progress in the game, the game expands greatly on all fronts. The deceptively simple game mechanics are built upon layer upon layer, the levels get larger and more complex, the bosses get bigger and badder, the mythology and lore gets more and more elaborate.. and knowing it will become necessary to solve some of the most fiendishly difficult puzzles ever seen in a platformer. Still, the game does not resort to unfairness. Every challenge is surmountable, no enemy is invulnerable, and every puzzle has a hint somewhere. At least, until the mythical Hell Temple. But then again, that place is designed for people who want to prevail against all odds. Everyone else can expect 30ish ours of best platforming that you can hope to get.			"

												I prefer metroidvania's in comparison to most other games. There's the feeling of exploration that you don't get from other genres, an air of freedom that's restricted only by your equipment and skill, the challenge of reaching something new that's mere inches over the tower of angry crazed monstrocities that haven't tasted food in centuries, just waiting for you to slip... It's amazing.La Mulana definitely met what I was looking for. It's a scarilly difficult game, but it's fantastic. If you're willing to brave the countless monsters lurking around the ruins, and smart enough to outwit the builders of these crazy traps and puzzles, this game is for you. There's treasure to be found, people to help, and a mess of bosses and sub-bosses that will have you rattling the controller in rage... in a good way. The game is beyond the simple word ""challenging"", which is flung around too often these days.Be warned though, brute force is NOT the answer to the majority of puzzles. You have to be smart with this game. Bosses themselves are a puzzle of what is safe, and what... isn't. And believe me, if you make a mistake with bosses, the all too common game over screen should be enough to tell you to try something else. If in doubt, look to the manual on the website. If that's not enough, there's no shame in looking to a guide. This game, in a few cases, demands it.			"

												I've only had an hour of  La-Mulana  and I already feel like other people need to experience it.I feel like divulging information that I've discovered in-game breaches some kind of unwritten rules of the game that makes it more fun for newer players. La-Mulana  has some of the things I loved so much about  Dark Souls  in how difficulty is managed. If you're in an area that you're not ready for, you'll know.While this game does have a pause menu, it still feels tense. The realization that you can't just hide in your e-mails until all        the  spooky scary    skeletons go away is kind of  refreshing.While the translations probably simplify the dialogues and descriptions in-game, they're fun to read and are, in a surprisingly interesting way, loosely educational in places.It also makes me want to stand, fully-clothed, in some hot springs.If that's not a success, I don't know what is.

												The game is fun in the same way those old Nintendo or SNES games were. It can also be as frustrating as those old NES and SNES games were and still are. I like it quite a lot but I do find myself cursing at the screen everytime I die due to a missed jump or being knocked a screen and a half away when an enemy flies, runs, jumps, into you while you're jumping.( this is a slight exaggeration but it does happen to me quite a lot.)

												Ugh, this game is smash-head-on-wall frustrating sometimes.  Some clues are crazy obscure, others are sublimely obtuse, but - hard as it is to believe - all of them are solvable within the context of the game.  Puzzling aside, the game's combat is also satisfying though, at times, ridiculously difficult.Fans of Metroidvania-type games should definitely play La Mulana.  Anyone not familiar with the genre should probably cut their teeth on something else.			"

												La-Mulana focuses heavily on riddles and exploring inside a gigantic ruin. Some of these puzzles can be quite difficult to solve, but then you really feel you accomplished something. But even if you feel stuck, just go to another area, as many parts of the ruins can be accessed from the beginning. Others can be reached by obtaining certain items.There's a lot of different items, main and sub weapons to be found, each serving a certain purpose. So this gets elevated to a Metroidvania-style game.You even do not have to fight the bosses in a fixed order to progress. As for those boss battles, these are varied as well: There are stationary ones, in one fight you ride a track down in a mine-cart, while the foe follows you.Awesome.My only gripe in the game is some very obscure hints for certain puzzles. You probably might have to look up somewhere or trying out a lot there - but be assured, there so much to do in the game, You will never feel bad, if you 'cheated' after you clocked so many hours into the game already. Just check that thing in a suspicious room further (or go somewhere else, as stated above) and move on your own.The controls themselves are solid and work as intended. Only jumping down below properly needs some practice first. Lemeza falls straight down, if he doesn't jump from a cliff, unable to change direction. Luckily there is no fall damage and many regular enemies only do little damage, except for some sub and main bosses.Take a hop before jumping on platforms below you - and you can move Lemeza in mid-air. Required for certain puzzles and just being a small hint.I play the game with a keyboard by the way, while the game has full controller support, including XBOX360 support as in the dscription, and there's no problem with controlling that way as well.The Graphics are really well done. They are stretched in fullscreen, the aspect ratio is mantainted properly. In widescreen formats the black bars can be decorated with murals and other images by going into the Options menu - which is a nice touch. Each ruin is vastly different, many background objects and statues are unique (and often required to be examined further by the game). There's even a hidden area, where you explore some of the original areas with the MSX-style graphics from the 2005 version.Music and sound are nicely done as well. While the tracks might repeat too quickly, many of the areas (in my case, e. g. the Temple of Moonlight) have catchy background music, some more decent, others being more dominant. For anyone who likes videogame music, this might be just right. The sound effects help you, be it a breakable wall which makes a certain crumble noise if struck by (certain) weapons, different tunes whenever you fail or solve a puzzle and other effects.If you don't mind the difficulty at times and love either cool boss battles and some brain-teasing puzzles, get this game ASAP. It's worth every penny, especially at that bargain in this sale.			"

												The final boss of all Metroidvanias. It's very fair, in the sense that pitting a 140 lb novice against a heavyweight champion is fair. Just knock the other guy over to win! Rules are the same for both of you and the judges are totally nonbiased.Great game though. Huge amounts of content, beautiful pixel art, solid gameplay.

												IN SHORT: A very difficult game in the tradition of NES Metroid and Castlevania.Within the last year or so I learned the term ""Metroidvania"" and it seems like it was made for this game.  Gameplay reminds me a lot of the original Metroid, and then you're whipping skeletons just like Castlevania.I guess I was warned, but this is a hard game.  As if fighting your way through the ruins wasn't hard enough already there are hidden booby traps (frustrating, but adds a fun new element as well).I love the mix of cultural artifacts from around the world you see, and I like the story of the Mother Goddess who created the Earthly races in hopes they could return her to the heavens--and who periodically kills them off when they anger her.You find lots of clues on stone tablets (which may apply to something you'll find in a whole different area).  In theory it'd be fun to piece together the story like this, but I've found them more difficult to understand and sort of generic sounding (this is probably do in part to the translation from Japanese).I've made some progress (defeated one boss) and am hoping I can get past the difficulty factor and really get into this game, but it's possible I might give up.

												Some warnings up-front: this game can be hard to get into.  The controls aren't explained well initially, and it takes time to get a feel for the platforming mechanics, which are fairly idiosyncratic.  It's not an easy game either; it pulls very few punches and is much stingier than most modern games about checkpoint placement and health recovery.  There are also several fairly tough puzzles that require some creative interpretation of the sometimes-badly-translated hints strewn throughout the game.Despite all of the above, this is quite simply one of the largest and most satisfying Metroidvania games I've ever played.  The maps are massive, the backstory is interesting and integrated into the puzzles.  The power-ups are fun, and the weapons provide enough variety to be satisfying without being numerous enough that any of them feel like afterthoughts.  In terms of content for the price, this game is an absolute steal.  If you have the chops for it, bring your action-platformer and adventure-game-puzzler A-games and take this one on right away.			"

												So, I picked up this game cause it was on sale a while back and decided ""Why not?"", and unlike most things I happen to get on a whim, this game happened to be a real treasure.  Starting off though, I HIGHLY recommend a Gamepad of sorts for this game. I can only imagine going through this game with a Keyboard would make one want to Chuck it out the window. If you do NOT have a Gamepad, some of the platforming will be quite difficult assuming you are too used to platforming like elements with a controller as I was. Also the jumping physics take some getting used to.Gameplay: The gameplay is as other people have called it ""Metroidvania"" Wheras the game is centered around these large ruins and have seperate areas within the ruins that define as ""other levels"" So, in a nut shell, you go around the ruins exploring, trying to figure out what purpose these ruins have or what mysteries you can unfold. The more you discover, the more items you unlock, thus allowing access to different areas of the ruins.Difficulty: Wow, there are parts in this game where it makes you wanna rage, but if you're like me, and enjoy a challenege. It's all in good fun. You cannot heal yourself by normal means, you have to either go to the hotspring outside the ruins, or collect enough green orbs to ""Level up""      The puzzles in this game are quite clever ranging from block destrcution order to in game ciphers. Though there are puzzles as simple as placing a weight on a pedestal (or dias as called in this game) So, there is a large degree of puzzle difficulty variation in this game. (Protip: No hint is too small in this game)     The bosses.. holy crap. Their moveset may not be very extensive, but they are very unforgiving. There are 9 Main bosses in this game. The first one being... generally easy, but after that, it's no cakewalk. These bosses generally take a degree of skill to defeat. If you die, you have to start all the way back from your last quick save. It's usually not THAT far of a walk, though there is this one area where its just annoying.. gotta wait for elevators... and suicidal fish.. just a bad experience, but made one feel so accomplished after finally taking care of the foul boss for that victorious fanfare after defeating a boss.Music: The Music in this game is quite amazing I think. Not really much else to say.Storyline: Kind of non-existant untill about halfway through the game. There's slight lore on each area of the ruins, but once you reach that halfway mark and the lore starts to tie into each other, It becomes clear that there is MUCH more to the ruins than one could have initially thought of. I love it.  Category Rating   Gameplay 8   Soundtrack 9   Story 7   Difficulty 8   Overall 8-9 Overall, This game's got alot of good things going for it, music, story, memorable characters. It's difficulty and obscure puzzles may deter other gamers, but I enjoy the challenge. Pick up this game if you enjoy one as well!! You won't regret it.			"

												This is the true Indiana Jones simulator. Combining exploration, action, platforming and puzzle solving, La-Mulana is a long and hard but truely satisfying game. You will fall prey to fiendish traps. Get obliterated by challenging bosses. Get stuck on arcane puzzles. But overcoming these obstacles is one of the most cathartic experiences in gaming enhanced by a killer soundtrack, gorgeous detialed pixel enviroments and a uniquely told story.While there's a few weird glitches and a few of the puzzles can be a bit unreasonable, it's definitely a worth the price. My best reccomendation is that you try and play the game without external guides other than the Manual and this official beginner video.

												This game is awesome. I admit, I was a bit skeptical at first because I loved the original version (which was free, by the way), but honestly, almost everything has been improved. The graphics, the controls, everything. My only problem: holly [expletive], is it hard. I'm not a ""hard-core"" gamer, so when a game is as challenging as this, sure I like to find out how to beat the challenge, but a lot of times it just ends up frustrating me. Also, at the time I'm writing this, I haven't even made it past the second boss yet.Which brings me to another GOOD thing about it: it's non-linear. At the moment I'm trying to level up my main weapon and increase my health to hopefully make the second boss WAY easier. Doing so takes me quite off the beaten path, and I love games like that.			"

												I love this game. Even after almost 6 hours I've only found and defeated one boss, but I rarely feel like I'm wandering around aimlessly. I feel like I'm gathering clues to solve a huge puzzle...and most of the time that's exactly what I'm doing. Every time I backtrack I find something new, or decipher a cryptic note I didn't understand the last time. It's like a tougher and more puzzle-oriented Super Metroid with some I Wanna Be The Guy-style traps. Hints come in the form of emails from the village elder as well, but they're not too revealing, just a little nudge to help you get going. Expect to be writing some things down on your journey. My only complaint is the controls, which I suppose are supposed to be realistic, but even after 6 hours I'm still not used to them. When you jump you're committed to it; forward jumping has a set arc depending on how high you jump that can't be interrupted, and jumping straight up is uncontrollable until you reach the height of the jump. Falling off a ledge forces you to plummet straight down. It's somewhat irritating at times, but it's tolerable.			"

												The game starts off great. It gives you clues on how to progress and vague goals. I've got a little notebook by my computer, and it's been fun to write down the clues I get and writing notes, it feels like actual exploration in a way I've never seen in a game before. But, uh.Remember that part in Super Metroid where you get the power bomb and wander around for a couple hours trying to figure out what to do wih it? And then you finally manage to blow up the glass tube that gets you in Maridia, and you think to yourself, ""How on earth was I supposed to know to do that?""Yeah. Welcome to that, the videogame. The middle to end of this game is effectively that, repeatedly, for a number of hours. Rather than difficulty, the game goes straight into obscurity. The clues go from helpful to extremely vague and start making sense only after the fact (""...Oh, /that/'s what that meant."") You'll (sometimes) have a vague sense of what needs to be done - or rather, a collection of things that /can/ be done, though whether or not you're actually able to do them yet is unknown - and no idea how to do them or where to get them. It stops giving you goals on what you're supposed to be doing, removes any feeling of progression, and the game boils down to revisiting every area over and over and over again in the vague hope of finding something new. And when you do find something new, the experience is fleeting, because the new trinket or path or whatever it gives you is usually in another part of the game, wildly far from you.TL;DR: unless you are a masochist with rediculous amounts of free time and patience, you will need a walkthrough for this game at some point. The level design does not guide you along at all, and is actively obtrusive. The difficulty changes from basic survival to constantly trying figuring out the developer's logic like you're playing an old Lucas Arts point-and-click from back in the day. Granted that may apppeal to some of you; the game does not hold your hand, especially mid and onwards, and there can be value in that.All that said, I'm still going to buy La Mulana 2 when it comes out, because at the end of the day, the game is still fun to me.

												Imagine a metroidvania, but with a thick layer of varnish spread all over it. Progressing in La Milon's Secret Castle relies on mastering both the unforgiving jumping physics and extremely obtuse puzzles. The real draw of the game is, the underlying lore and story are closely linked to the puzzles for the most part via reading of tablets covered in cryptic text and primitive drawings where you can almost see the self-satisfied smug of the developer who drew them. Enemies are largely slow-moving piles of hitbox, whereas bosses are piles of hitbox that take up half of the screen. The weapons you're saddled with are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ enough to make the proceedings fairly challenging.Through the end of all of this suffering and turmoil the rewards definitely await, with no shortage of Chicken McItems you can get your greasy fingers on. If you can take the time to read all the tablets, discern what area the hint originated from, what particular puzzle or setpiece the hint is actually referring to, and cross-reference this information in the same notebook for which you keep track of your Zoloft medication, you clearly deserve this game.One thing I can attest is that this game helped me reignite the rage within my heart. At times a vein erupts in my forehead, I rip off my shirt and start beating my chest wildly, and it eventually takes 3 social workers and a powerful horse sedative to restrain me. 9/10 game, tell your friends.

												This game is really, really good. I cheated and played the game with a guide, and *still* had an amazing time with it, and even played the game a couple more times. It's one of the best games ever made. I'm dead serious.The game has fantastic music, amazing boss fights, and a huge expansive world with an incredibly deep lore. However, the game is full of extremely cryptic puzzles.Honestly, I recommend that you play this game until you get stuck, then go through the rest of it with a walkthrough. Some of the puzzles in this game are just not reasonable, and it's impossible to tell in advance the difference between reasonable puzzles, unreasonable puzzles, and puzzles you can't solve yet. It is also extremely non-linear, which complicates matters.If you want to beat this game without help, I recommend against it, but here's my advice. There's very little in the game that is blatantly not hinted at, but many of the hints are extremely cryptic. Get a notepad and write down every single hint you come across (or screenshot them). And don't come into it with the attitude that you're going to clear one area at a time; after the initial Gate of Guidance, you have to hop back and forth between areas frequently to progess. Many of the puzzles require out-of-the-box thinking so be ready for that. Read the manual and watch the Beginner's Guide. This game is tough as nails, and beating it is a project. Expect it to take hundreds of hours (if you use a guide, 10 hours). This is a real game.For my friends, I love this game, and I know it inside and out, so if you want me to hint you in the right direction instead of resorting to a guide, I'm happy to talk about it any time.

												I'm really liking this so far. Reminds me a lot of the old NES games ""Milon's Secret Castle"" and ""Tombs and Treasures"", but with puzzles that actually make sense. It's still very challenging though, and its secrets are not easily discovered. It is concievably possible to beat this without any use of guides, though. The action/platforming portions of the game can be a bit aggravating at times, but they mostly serve as a platform to deliver the puzzles rather than the focus of the game itself. Still worth a go in my opinion.			"

												I love this game. Even after almost 6 hours I've only found and defeated one boss, but I rarely feel like I'm wandering around aimlessly. I feel like I'm gathering clues to solve a huge puzzle...and most of the time that's exactly what I'm doing. Every time I backtrack I find something new, or decipher a cryptic note I didn't understand the last time. It's like a tougher and more puzzle-oriented Super Metroid with some I Wanna Be The Guy-style traps. Hints come in the form of emails from the village elder as well, but they're not too revealing, just a little nudge to help you get going. Expect to be writing some things down on your journey. My only complaint is the controls, which I suppose are supposed to be realistic, but even after 6 hours I'm still not used to them. When you jump you're committed to it; forward jumping has a set arc depending on how high you jump that can't be interrupted, and jumping straight up is uncontrollable until you reach the height of the jump. Falling off a ledge forces you to plummet straight down. It's somewhat irritating at times, but it's tolerable.			"

Puzzles are really fun and it's very rewarding to get♥♥♥♥♥♥done. The difficulty is very high but not heinous or impossible and you will always be making progress. The music is the best I've heard in years (youtube ""giant's cry"" for a good example). The spritework is great, the characters are great, everything is great. The controls are a bit stiff, but in a controllable, Castlevania kind of way. The game forces you to be careful about everything and rewards precision and half-remembered Egyptology trivia above all.If you get stuck in the beginning, just hang in there and the game will open up to you, or watch the beginner's introduction on youtube which shows you what to do first.

												This is the true Indiana Jones simulator. Combining exploration, action, platforming and puzzle solving, La-Mulana is a long and hard but truely satisfying game. You will fall prey to fiendish traps. Get obliterated by challenging bosses. Get stuck on arcane puzzles. But overcoming these obstacles is one of the most cathartic experiences in gaming enhanced by a killer soundtrack, gorgeous detialed pixel enviroments and a uniquely told story.While there's a few weird glitches and a few of the puzzles can be a bit unreasonable, it's definitely a worth the price. My best reccomendation is that you try and play the game without external guides other than the Manual and this official beginner video.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCjHHALcL2I "

The bosses are quite challenging, require practice to beat, but many of them can be made easier by outscaling them with power-ups.The puzzles though... Oh god... Mercy... I thought I was doing pretty well at first, but after getting about a third of the way into the game, I was stuck.  This game is full of ""moon logic"" puzzles.  Even if you are very meticulous in taking notes, you'll likely need to refer to a guide to get through much of the game.  These aren't optional puzzles either, they're REQUIRED to complete the game.  You could wander for hours, whipping walls and trying things and still not find out where you need to go next.  The game puts in all the necessary clues to solving the puzzles on stone tablets scattered throughout the world, but  knowing which clue relates to which puzzle is a feat in and of itself.A single playthrough will take you a bit over 20 hours... that's all ""productive"" time.  If you include time spent dying/losing progress from dying, you'll probably be closer to 60+ hours.			"

												La-Mulana is a 2d exploration-based platformer, a metroidvania, if you will. You run around a vast interconnected complex of ruins, whipping snakes and skeletons and bats and whatnot, solving puzzles, jumping, falling on spikes, etc. There are many little treasures to collect, powering up your character in some small way, often in such a way that is only really necessary for accessing a single area of the labyrinth, but giving you an actual ability rather than just throwing a key in your hand is a nice touch. The puzzles are many and quite esoteric, which I appreciate, though a few too many of them simply force you to return with some gadget, that more than likely required some other thing to solve its own puzzle. It definitely walks the line between intellectually engaging and tedious. The music is good. Overall the game has a lot of personality, doing things that seem a bit absurd from a design standpoint, but ultimately contributing to that intimate, programmed in somebody's mom's basement kind of feel that make Indie games the joy they are. Or can be, anyway. Where the game falls flat on its face is combat. Wonky collision, tedious enemies, needlessly frustrating bosses, pointless sub weapons, unresponsive controls, obnoxious healing mechanics, it's difficult to name something that was done right in terms of the combat design. The combat and platforming draw heavily, if not entirely, from NES era Castlevania. The whip has a little delay on it, your jump arc can't be altered (much) after you've left the ground, getting hit sends you flyiing, there are subweapons that, hypothetically at least, can fill in the gaps in your offensive capabillities. And that may have worked, if the level and enemy design had been borrowed from NES Catlevania as well. Instead, You find yourself navigating post-Symphony of the Night levels and enemies with pre-Symphony of the Night controls. Enemies move around a lot and in fairly random patterns, hitting them without getting hit yourself is a bit of a gamble (there's a very good reason fleamen only took one hit in Castlevania). You'll routinely find yourself knowcked off platforms and faced with a lengthy trek to return simply because a bat decided to move a certain way at a certain time. Many enemies are simply a matter of sitting and waiting for them to turn their back so you can hit them wothout risking your life (waiting is not skill). The subweapons are slow, weak, and generally go in a straight line, which begs the question of why there are even so many. It uses a bizarre healing mechanic. Enemies drop little health balls, but instead of restoring your health, they fill a bar underneath your health and then, once that bar is filled , all your health. This virtually guarantees that your health will be restored at some arbitrary moment, rather than when you would could actually benefit. Why the balls don't just restore your health directly is beyond me. The system can only be described as asinine. All of this would be tolerable, but what truly sinks the ship are the disastrous boss battles. Don't get me wrong, graphically the bosses are very impressive. Detailed, well animated, room-filling sprites certainly have an appeal about them. But the problem is that a massive room filling monstrosity has to be able to fight the player in such a way that justifies that level of detail. When, for all the charging and fire breath and crumbly cieling bits, the main threat, the biggest factor driving the difficulty of the fight, is not anything the boss is actually doing, but the difficulty inherent in negotiating the tiny area from which you can hit the boss without getting hit yourself, all that detail becomes a bit pointless. For a boss to attack the player in however many unique and interesting ways, but ultimately kill them because the player touched its chin a few too many times shows very bad combat design. I'm going to go farther and say that the concept of the player being hurt by touching enemies is an archaic anachronism and should be done away with. But whatever. Yeah, the game is hard. Hard in a very Dark Souls kind of way, where it's not really so much that you need to get good at it, but that you need to remember stuff and proceed slowly and not break your controller and all that noise. It's punishing and clunky and sort of poorly designed on purpose to make it more difficult. Sometimes that can be nice. I recommend it despite it's flaws. I dunno, play it or don't. It's unique, I respect that.			"

												La-Mulana's close to being a perfect game. It sure as hell is a perfect Action-Adventure Platforming Puzzle Game.LM sets out to be a game all about exploration and achieves this by making large areas that are enjoyable, challenging, and interesting to explore. All the while, items that can augment your skills and aid in your exploration are scattered throughout. Often times you can see these items but you'll have to solve difficult puzzles along the way to open them, thus creating great tension and lead up. Once you have these items, the effects are immediately noticible from running/attacking faster to something as simple as opening doors that used to be locked. Every pair of areas also have enjoyable(?), challenging, and interesting boss battles, following the same rules of puzzle solving and lead up as items do. It's incredibly easy to get immersed into the world of La-Mulana, and if you have the guts to stick it through the challenge, La-Mulana will reward you.That said, the game is floaty and the PC has very little control of their jumping (like Castlevania), on top of that, knockback can often lead to slow painful death (not like Castlevania). While this was done intentionally for the sake of difficulty - which works - it can be overly punishing for more casual players. While this is by no means a casual game, it's difficult to have fun when you can't continue exploring. Puzzles also become more and more complex and outright insane later in. I recommend having pulling out a walkthrough around that part, the alternative is pulling out your hair. Sadly this makes the later segments of the game drag on as the puzzles become larger and more complex. Though still important, it involves a lot of backtracking through obnoxious sections of the game.But those complaints are partially personal. La-Mulana is an amazing game with great length, and is strong enough to withstand multiple playthroughs. If you don't mind the challenge, I heartily recommend La-Mulana at its full price. If you're a cheapscape like I am, then I recommend La-Mulana at less than full price but if you want to play La-Mulana and still don't when that happens then you are an awful awful person who I will never invite to my birthday party ever again. And I'll probably kill you before you pass your inferior genes to a new generation. In either case you won't be getting any cake.			"

												A modern classic of the old-school 2D action platformer ""metroidvania"" genre. Difficult but rewarding, and unless you have a LOT of time on your hands to solve the many devious riddles in the game, you will need to consult a guide more than a few times to progress. It's also bloody huge, my playtime clocked in at around 30hrs for a first-time playthrough!All in all a magnificent game for those that still remember and appreciate retro gaming and don't get discouraged when challenged.

												This is a wonderful game. It has extreme moments of frustration, raging and keyboard smashing, but it's a challenge. Naramura's devilish traps do their jobs effectively. The story is rich, and the mythology is so well thought out as it unfolds while you play. I can't recommend it enough if you love games with challenging puzzles, tons of items to collect and tough boss fights. And if you don't feel the game itself was hard enough, you can turn on hard mode via a tablet or even take on the daunting challenge of Hell Temple.			"

												This game is awesome. I admit, I was a bit skeptical at first because I loved the original version (which was free, by the way), but honestly, almost everything has been improved. The graphics, the controls, everything. My only problem: holly [expletive], is it hard. I'm not a ""hard-core"" gamer, so when a game is as challenging as this, sure I like to find out how to beat the challenge, but a lot of times it just ends up frustrating me. Also, at the time I'm writing this, I haven't even made it past the second boss yet.Which brings me to another GOOD thing about it: it's non-linear. At the moment I'm trying to level up my main weapon and increase my health to hopefully make the second boss WAY easier. Doing so takes me quite off the beaten path, and I love games like that.			"

												This game is not for the faint of heart; the game is difficult. However, perserverence results in great rewards and a sense of accomplishment. Some of the puzzles are beyond cryptic; you will likely be hitting the online forums and guides to work out some of the more obtuse puzzles. But surprisingly that's part of the fun and hearkens back to old 8-bit days of yore.I always hate to make comparisons as the game stands in its own right, but if you love the obscure lore and difficult learning curve of the Souls series and enjoy the Metroid and Castlevania style exploration and progression, this game is for you.

												La-Mulana is a Legend of Tetrisvania style action exploration game with a whip cracking good soundtrack. You play as Indianus Sphincter Jones, or Lemeza for short, an archaeological digging teacher professor who is searching the ancient ruins of La-Mulana for his heart, which was stolen by the crimson dragon, Eddie Murphy, forever marking him as an Arisen.For some reason though, La-Mulana isn't ruined when you purchase it.The gameplay is like strangling a sock with a hot dog. You start out with a small bar of health that increases as you collect these items called Sacred Orbs. I'd have low health too if I didn't have my orbs. As you progress through the various traps and transexuals of La-Mulana, you're obviously going to be taking damage. The only way to heal is to eat these snot bubbles that enemies drop, or to give a load off in the hot springs.You could say that the level design is pretty PUZZLING. Picture Ghouls n Ghosts and throw all of its hundreds of puzzles into a bag, and put La-Mulana's puzzles into a bag and all of a sudden they becomePerhaps the greatest feature is your character's progression. You can really feel your chips begin to sog when you're wailing on bosses you had trouble with before but you can't fight bosses you've already killed you idiot.Overall, La-Mulana is a pretty great musical. With stars like Hugh Jackman and Bob Ross, you get an amazing visual of the jungle.I give it about ten high fives.			"

												I love this game. Even after almost 6 hours I've only found and defeated one boss, but I rarely feel like I'm wandering around aimlessly. I feel like I'm gathering clues to solve a huge puzzle...and most of the time that's exactly what I'm doing. Every time I backtrack I find something new, or decipher a cryptic note I didn't understand the last time. It's like a tougher and more puzzle-oriented Super Metroid with some I Wanna Be The Guy-style traps. Hints come in the form of emails from the village elder as well, but they're not too revealing, just a little nudge to help you get going. Expect to be writing some things down on your journey. My only complaint is the controls, which I suppose are supposed to be realistic, but even after 6 hours I'm still not used to them. When you jump you're committed to it; forward jumping has a set arc depending on how high you jump that can't be interrupted, and jumping straight up is uncontrollable until you reach the height of the jump. Falling off a ledge forces you to plummet straight down. It's somewhat irritating at times, but it's tolerable.			"

												How to describe La-Mulana?La-Mulana is oldschool.  It does not hold your hand.  It does not pull its punches.  It is not aftaid to dish out instant death as a concequence for failure.  This is a hard game, though for the most part it's a fair kind of hard.  Still, not for the faint of heart, or those unwilling to actually solve a few puzzles.  Even the jump physics will punish you at first (this isn't the air control you're used to) and you need to master most aspects of the game if you want to have a chance.The good news, for those who find this a little daunting?  La-Mulana is not Nethack or Zork.  If you die (and you will), you'll be able to restart from your latest save or, pretty shortly, even from a checkpoint.  If you see something that's trouble and think ""I should really save before doing this."" you can generally save before doing it, and there are few if any true lost-forever items (though there are more that become very difficult to attain, or can't be got for a long while if you mess up.)  So, while you will be punished for messing up, you're generally free to take your beating, burning, squashing, impalement upon spikes, heavenly lightning, or so on and keep playing, only now you know better.  In this way it is more of a modern Metroid/Castlevania type ""explore and platform"" game than a roguelike or adventure game relative, since you're generally not going to be in danger of losing more than minutes of work.In general, I'd recommend anyone who has a chance to try it give it a go.  I've focused on its difficulty and mechanics, but I shouldn't fail to say that it is a ton of fun.  There's a lot to find -- story as well as items and areas -- the visuals are great oldschool art that frankly looks great on its own, and the gameplay is an experience with a very rewarding learning curve.

												La-Mulana is a Metroidvania style game where you play as a Japanese take on Indiana Jones as you adventure to and explore the ruins of La-Mulana, the origin of all mankind in this world. There are plenty of puzzles and traps to see in the ruins that will keep you on your toes, this is also perhaps also one of the games faults as you WILL be doing look ups on walktroughs to break some of the game's more challenging puzzles. If you haven't had to look up a solution by the time you reach the Gate of Illision, you will then. The combat and movement is very finely tuned, not too often did I feel that my death was unjustified, it was usually due to my own lack of skill or even missing critical equipment for an encounter. Movement is pretty smooth even though you lack movement mid-jump, even after learning how to double jump. Upon recovering the Hooly Grail after solving a few simple puzzles in the enterance of La-Mulana you will gain the ability to teleport between save points from anywhere inside this sprawling dungeon.Health recovery in this game is a little strange, you recover your HP by sitting on hot springs or by collecting enough EXP from green orbs dropped by foes to equal the full length of your health bar upon which your EXP will be reset to 0 and your HP will be fully restored to %100 reguardless of how much health you have at the time. With this health recoverly system you wThe lore you will discover in the ruins paint an interesting spin on the origin of mankind and even how mankind ends in the La-Mulana world.

It's super challenging, even with help! The controls are terrible! But there is a huge amount of great content, music, weird humor, boss battles, dungeons to explore, and there's nothing like it...

												Great fun despite being brutal at times. Once you get used to the controls, you'll quickly discover a platformer with a lot of challenging content.  I purchased it on a great sale, but it's still worth its full, regular price.			"

												I'm only halfway through (I think) and this is one tough cookie of a game. I thought the other reviews were exaggerated but no, heed their warnings! This game starts off fairly easy to play, besides the lack of instructions. Once you get going though, it's reasonably obvious what kind of a journey you are embarking on.I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the classic NES and SNES platformers - it's like Megaman meets Metroid - that have parts that are frustratingly difficult to complete because it has a retro feel to it and obviously the graphics are similar.

												La-Mulana is a pretty good game, but it's definitively not for everyone. There is a huge focus on puzzle solving and it's not the easy kind which you often find in other games *coughzeldacough*. When it works well it works really well, but a couple of puzzles are really obtuse in what you need to do to solve them, this can be a problem when you get further into the game as the explorable space just gets larger and larger.The platforming and combat is also pretty good for the most part, there are a few hiccups, but nothing major. So if you want a game that really pulls of the concept of you being an archaeologist uncovering the truth/legends of an ancient ruin, then I honestly can't think of any other game that gets even close to that when compared to La-Mulana.

It has one of the most complex and hard dungeons of the genre. The levels aren't linear, and the order of the levels isn't linear either, nor the order to finish them.The most important feature of this game are its puzzles.

												Hours don't matter; I beat the game via a GOG.com versionAnyway, this game is amazing. Some of the best bosses I've seen in a metroidvania, outstanding music, an amazing final boss and a perfect escape sequence. The story is surprisingly deep with lore everywhere ala Metroid Prime, and the game is very long, easily lasting tens of hours.With that said, USE A GUIDE.Don't think you can get away with playing this game blind, unless you're a VERY determined player. You will have to write down nearly everything you scan, explore whatever you can, etc. This game is ridiculous in puzzles and level design and, in my opinion, it's nowhere near to even the best part of the game! It's well worth skipping it using a guide because the rest of the game IS worth it. Items, powerups, etc really help alleviate the difficulty this game has at the beginning.Also, this game is pretty hard even with a guide. For a good portion of the game you have no defense and very bad platforming; it gets much better later, but if you don't have a guide for powerups, it's understandable how you can get frustrated because the tools to make your life easier aren't available. However, at about the half-way point the game becomes much more tolerable due to the sheer amount of abilities you have gotten. Also, it is worth mentioning that both whip upgrades are permanently missable; however, reloading a save can let you try again. Just keep that in mind. With that said, the game is amazing. In my own experience, it's an 8/10 for the first half and a 10/10 for the second half, but only with a guide. Highly recommended, just, make sure you know what you are getting into.			"

												La-Mulana pleasantly surprised me when I first started playing.  Here was a Metroidvania in the strictest sense of the word, with an expansive hand-crafted map just waiting to be explored.  Pivotal items could be found anywhere, so you were constantly rewarded for investigating every nook and cranny.  These upgrades also allowed you to intuitively access new areas--for example, once you acquire an item that lets you breathe underwater, you can progress further in a watery area.At this point, my only complaints were that save points are few and far between, and are often not located anywhere near bosses.As I progressed through the game, I grew more and more frustrated.  Upgrades stopped being intuitive since the obstacles they got past became too obviously artificial.  For example, some items interact with arbitrary symbols found throughout the ruins, which you had no reason to believe were important at all.  This leads to a lot of directionless backtracking.Eventually, I got stuck, looked at a guide, and was shocked at the number of required items that were hidden in unfairly obscure locations.  Stuff like ""once you do X, a ceiling in an unrelated area that you've already explored becomes breakable with your whip"".  Maybe a tablet somewhere contains a subtle hint that would point you in the right direction, but I feel this level of opaqueness is bad game design.  Super Metroid had plenty of hidden secrets, but there was almost always something unusual about the area to prompt you to scan it more closely with your X-Ray Scope.I'm unsure whether I will continue playing La-Mulana, but if I do, I expect to have to rely on a guide.  Despite this, I do see why the game was so influential, and I still think it has quite a lot to offer.			"

												This one is controversial... yet, it is an adventure gem. Up to a mid-game it plays brilliantly - full of exploration, character, discovery, figuring out what to do next. Bosses are somewhat on a grindy side of the moon (pixel accuracy madness). Somewhere in mid-game (you'll know when it happens) the only recommendation is - forget it :-) It is more of design flaws and pixel accuracy of latter bosses that break the flow then anything else (alternatively you can use FAQ)... But two components which still make this game a gem for me (and practically all other games miss) are there - exploration and discovery. Just wish design choices were more player-friendly in otherwise great game...A tip: buy this on-sale, so you won't regret it.			"

												This game is not as difficult as others have said....La-Mulana is an homage to the older adventure games of the NES era. Castlevania, Battle of Olympus, and Faxanadu all rolled into one great little package. Just like the games of yester-year, La-Mulana does not hold your hand. It is up to the player to remember all the little details that add up later. To be able to find the hidden entrances that others in a hurry might miss. This game is about the fine details, covering every inch of every room to find your way! If you enjoy a solid challenge, and a grand adventure (with a little naughty mixed in), La-Mulana awaits!!

												La-Mulana is a wonderfully difficult metroidvania-game of riddles, with challenging bosses, and a huge game to explore.There is so much to discover and unfold in the game, part of the fun is finding out how to obtain a new treasure or find a new area to explore. The platforming physics are a bit wonky at first, and can mess up the gaming logic in your head, but it feels fair as you learn how to adapt to it (For example : In-game, if you jump moving right, you can only move right, but if you jump up without moving left or right, you can control your jump more. Also, touching a wall while jumping in a direction can give you back your aerodynamic control).The main challenge of the game is solving these huge riddles that can really stump you if you don't have a guide, and at times, you might need to look at every aspect of details, or every word the game conveys, just because it can be very vital for solving these challenging puzzles. Aside from the riddles, the game isn't that difficult until you start reaching certain areas (especially in the early-game), or fight bosses (then again, if you're as skilled in video games as I am, hard mode isn't as hard as it seems, despite the extra deaths (which is all apart of the fun in a game)). At the time of this review, I feel like I'm near mid-game, but I still feel like I just scratched the surface. The soundtrack is amazing, the satisfaction of solving a overly arching riddle is trumendous, and the bosses are quite challenging to fight. I highly recommend this game to the few that won't give up. (Also, if you're not sure about this game, there is a free version available looming around the internet with older graphics and slightly more frustrating moments, and equally great soundtrack. Just remember to patch the english translations, otherwise you'll get stumped quite easily)(Another thing I'd like to mention is that the official guide for this game is actually super useful!)			"

Well get over it because La-Mulana doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥. Your sob story has no effect on La-Mulana. In fact your suffering only fuels La-Mulana. It doesn't exist for you and the moment you come to terms with that you'll have an amazing time playing it. I love this game. But god damn does it hate my guts.			"

												Different platforming experience than most, mechanically speaking, although one adapts quickly by necessity. Collecting money is a grind, which makes certain portions of the game harder to get through than others. Once basic equipments are bought, though, money comes with ample exploration, which the game facilitates and encourages with varied backdrops, puzzles, and musics.			"

												An excellent game that's only for people with a lot of patience. The highlight of the game is the very unique and obscure puzzles, that can take part across different parts of the map and can't really be guessed. Be prepared to spend many many hours of your playthrough just trying to figure out how the hell you are supposed to solve them.			"

												La-Mulana does not give even the tiniest crap about you, and it's all the better for it. It wisely understands that playing as an action-archaeologist exploring mysterious ruins means hurtling into a confusing unknown, and everything about its play reinforces that. It's fantastically sprawling, fantastically confusing, and fantastically frustrating, but if you enjoy a taste of those elements, this could be the perfect game for you.It's closest cousin is probably Super Metroid, but La-Mulana trades out the former's tight action gameplay for much, much, much more focus on puzzles and look-before-you-leap lethality. And not just block-pushing shenanigans. (Though there's no shortage of that, of course.) La-Mulana demands that you approach your adventure like an actual archaeologist. You'll need to pay attention to details, take diligent notes, understand the history of the ruins, and never, ever, stop looking for new nooks and crannies to explore. Metroidvania-style games often feature an element of sequence-breaking, allowing diligent/skilled players to tackle the game in unusual orders. La-Mulana stands alone in being so massive and so uninterested in shepherding you along a default path that it's hard to say if there's a ""proper"" sequence at all. Even killing major bosses might yield nothing more than a pat on the back. Rare is the game that puts you so thoroughly on your own.That said, there are some big dings that make it more masochistic cult classic than masterpiece. For one, puzzles do branch into the realm of insane BS from time to time, and the game introduces (or rather, requires but does not introduce) a couple of unique environmental interactions along the way. Even if this kind of game is right in your sweet spot, keep the wiki bookmarked; you will need it at some point or another. Second, solving a puzzle triggers a confirmation sound effect, but the game doesn't show you what was unlocked or changed, which is a huge problem when the result is screens or entire zones away. And finally, things continue escalating in complexity all the way to the finale. While that would be fine in something like a platformer, here it means that you will absolutely be following a guide for the last big puzzle, and that it doesn't feel like you've come full-circle on the mysteries of La-Mulana so much as the it feels like the game just throwing more and more craziness at you.

												This game is not as difficult as others have said....La-Mulana is an homage to the older adventure games of the NES era. Castlevania, Battle of Olympus, and Faxanadu all rolled into one great little package. Just like the games of yester-year, La-Mulana does not hold your hand. It is up to the player to remember all the little details that add up later. To be able to find the hidden entrances that others in a hurry might miss. This game is about the fine details, covering every inch of every room to find your way! If you enjoy a solid challenge, and a grand adventure (with a little naughty mixed in), La-Mulana awaits!!

												This one is controversial... yet, it is an adventure gem. Up to a mid-game it plays brilliantly - full of exploration, character, discovery, figuring out what to do next. Bosses are somewhat on a grindy side of the moon (pixel accuracy madness). Somewhere in mid-game (you'll know when it happens) the only recommendation is - forget it :-) It is more of design flaws and pixel accuracy of latter bosses that break the flow then anything else (alternatively you can use FAQ)... But two components which still make this game a gem for me (and practically all other games miss) are there - exploration and discovery. Just wish design choices were more player-friendly in otherwise great game...A tip: buy this on-sale, so you won't regret it.			"

												Excruciatingly frustrating at times, but something about it keeps you coming back. The puzzles can be really ridiculous, using queer meta elements and truly obtuse clues. I screamed and yelled and cursed at this game but I still soldiered all the way through it. It's unique, and in this day and age I have to tip my hat to any game that can make me feel anything at all. If you stick with it, and forgive yourself for using a guide every now and then, you'll get a very distinct satisfaction upon finishing the game. Suddenly all the other evil puzzle platformers seem a bit more quaint. So be aware! You will get stuck, and you will die on the same rooms/enemies/bosses over and over and over again, but if you can learn to enjoy the pain of defeat, La-Mulana will tenderly embrace you with its sandpaper arms and razorblade fingers. Grab your notebook, and enjoy a different kind of fun.			"

												Much like the old gods, this game exists. It's far more powerful than us and is just sympathetic enough to allow us pathetic humans to coexist with this behemoth. Our infinitesimal species matters not to this great evil.This game doesn't care who you are or how you were raised. Your mother's in the hospital? Your pet just died? Well get over it because La-Mulana doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥. Your sob story has no effect on La-Mulana. In fact your suffering only fuels La-Mulana. It doesn't exist for you and the moment you come to terms with that you'll have an amazing time playing it. I love this game. But god damn does it hate my guts.			"

												this game is absolutely NOT for everyone. For example, a little over 80% of the people who bought this game can not figure out how to enter the ruins from the starting village! It is a puzzle based game mostly, and not the usual kind of puzzle either, the basis is usually to obtain a very hard to understand hint then apply it to a part of the ruins. For example, you begin the game with an inability to look at written text, so you have to figure out how to spend the money you have. You are expected to look at all the shop’s wares in the village and then purchase a portable scanner for your laptop. Another portion of this games puzzles is looking for places to apply game mechanics. Many times, a suspicious looking block can be broken to reveal treasure, or pushed out of the way, or can be walked through. Attacking certain things will be punished in the ruins though, so one should always be cautious.Many people also have a problem with the way the controls are: the keyboard control scheme may take some getting used to because the menu, pause, and movement keys can not be rebound (in other words- If you like WASD, too bad). Some have a bigger problem with the way the character moves-If you run then jump you will continue to in the direction you were going in a semi-adjustable arc, and if you walk off of a precipice will fall directly down. The only way to have control in mid air is to jump while standing still. You will then have control on the way down.the bosses are hard. So hard that unless you have certain items you will fail endlessly (or be very lucky, or spend a total of twenty-seven minutes between each attack you make dodging). you would have a easier time Beating Final Fantasy XII Blind on a low level You, see, LA-MULANA is like an avocado, it is a rich oily superfood, unique among most other fruits, but also has a taste that many find off-putting, or love. Even if you are not a fan of this game, if you play two and three quarter hours into the game you will see that it is a game polished and slaved over for the twelve years that it was.but sad to say as for me I would find it more fun drinking Gasoline, then jumping head-long into a cactus, having my friend set the cactus on fire, pour and rub salt on my wounds then after I'm all healed up Pay a Wizard to turn me into a goat send me to Iraq get violated by a local, then die from bloodloss  if this game was made by Nintendo they would have to litteraly have to get you sign a waiver so you would not Sue there asses this game is not even possiblewatch a video walkthrough step by step is my recommendation			"

												This game is a cross between a puzzle hunt and getting KICKED IN THE FACE.  REPEATEDLY.  There is nothing like La-Mulana, nothing, and there really ought to be because HOT DAMN this game is AMAZING.To start with, I have 24 hours with this game on Steam, but I actually played it first on WiiWare, so my total should be much higher, like 50 hours higher.  And that's not counting all the time I spent playing the game *outside* of the system.  You see, this game is really, really, really hard.  If you don't know what you're doing.  If you use guides, eh.  The bosses can be challenging and the platforming unforgiving, but the real reason for playing this game is the puzzling.  Oh, the puzzling.To give you a basic idea, which I hesitate to do because, when I played the game, I knew literally nothing about it, the game's world is filled with stone tablets.  These stone tablets contain hints to puzzles, which you must solve in order to progress in the game.  Or they contain flavor text.  Except when the flavor text *is* the puzzle.  ...Yep.  Because La-Mulana hates you and your family.  (""Your family"" could be interpreted as the protagonist's father, who...  Anyway.)  These puzzles are often someplace completely unrelated to where you are now.  So when I played this for the first time, I pretty soon got stuck and decided to map out the entire game.  Room names (those are clues too), tablets, locations of interesting features, unsolved puzzles, etc.  Somewhere in my apartment there's an entire graph paper notebook of maps and tablets.  I would spend hours with the maps spread out in front of me looking for solutions to the puzzles, and occasionally I'd have some flash of insight and go to the game to test it out.  You see, it's not so much that the game is *hard*.  It also draws you in.  You *have* to solve these puzzles.  And when you do, new stuff opens and it's incredibly rewarding.Speaking of which, La-Mulana is actually somewhat less of a metroidvania than you might expect; most of the stuff you collect isn't actually necessary to proceed.  For example, there's an item that improves your damage output...  OK.  There's the one that makes you invulnerable to certain enemies...  well, that's less annoying, but it won't actually get you anywhere new.  On the other hand, what does allow you to progress is solving puzzles.  New places means new hints to old puzzles, so you have to backtrack to go solve it, etc.  Progress in La-Mulana, if you don't know what you're doing (which is how it should be), is incremental.Oh, yeah.  The actual platforming.  UNFORGIVING.  The bosses.  CHALLENGING.  The good news about the platforming is that you get used to the mechanics soon enough.  The good news about the bosses is that you will die quickly.  I'm sorry, I meant the good news *for* the bosses.  Not for you.  You will die quickly.  And repeatedly.  At least, until you figure out the trick to defeating that boss.  Then you will die somewhat more slowly, but still repeatedly.  Until, maybe, you win, and you never have to fight that boss again.  Right?  ...Right?  Anyway, some of the bosses are pretty standard; they're just exceptionally tough enemies.  Others are really imaginative.  The level bosses especially are all really cool.The music!  You will continue singing it for years.  YEARS!  I just think of La-Mulana and the Surface theme plays in my mind.  And then there's the Chamber of Birth.  Whew.  Those little running elephants will haunt your dreams as you hear that catchy music.Finally, we get to one of the strongest aspects of this game: the setting.  Not just the La-Mulana ruins but the whole story.  This game really makes you feel like part of its wonderful world and makes you desperately want to learn more.  It's well thought out and really fantastic.  You're given an excuse plot (even in the manual, so I'm not spoiling anything): you're basically Indiana Jones and you're exploring some ruins that your dad went into and didn't go out of.  Hopefully, you in real life have a similar excuse plot: you're bored and want to play an entertaining game with good reviews.  But as you (well, your character) explore said ruins, you (yourself) get drawn in further and further into the world of La-Mulana.  And you won't want to get out.The only downsides of La-Mulana are...  Um...  La-Mulana's downsides are numerous.  They include...  Er, you know, I can't actually think of any downsides of La-Mulana.  Oops.  In fact, I don't think I've ever played a better game in my life.  So yeah.Ah, if only there were a sequel...  (There is a sequel.  It's not out yet, though.  When it does come out, you can bet that I will be playing it.)			"

												Ruthless.I had to take a break after the nine hour mark. Nine hours to do barely anything except survive. This is a game to keep on the back-burner, to visit and puzzle through for maybe an hour before it crushes your hopes of advancing anywhere meaningful. Go and play something casual to reassure yourself that you're not worthless, and come back to La-Mulana.The collected items and advancements in this game will make you feel like you've sacrificed some part of you to keep. The best kind of rewarding gameplay, but it will still crush you.			"

												Hmm, where to begin... I suppose first off I must say this game is definitely not for the faint of heart. You will be challenged unlike any other game you have played before in terms of puzzle solving. However, these are where the game really shines in my opinion. You, quite literally, need to take notes on just about everything you see or read. Even the smallest detail you think may not mean something could very well actually be part of a puzzle. This even includes things such as a small symbol or anomaly in the background that is unique to a room. Also, clues for puzzles are all over the place. Things you may find confusing at first could have something to do with a puzzle way down the road in a completely different area of the game. It feels very rewarding when you figure a lot of them out. I felt like I was really an archaeologist taking notes. Almost like a real Indiana Jones, lol.Visually, the game is very well done. Graphics reminded me of the SNES days but slightly better. Very detailed and vibrant areas. The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in a game. A lot of them I never really got tired of listening to such as the Inferno Cavern.Gameplay wise I do have to admit the controls are a bit clunky at first. It took me quite a while to get the hang of them. The enemies can be annoying and impede your exploration quite a bit, but all in all, I mostly got used to them. Sort of like Dark Souls I suppose. Try and try again and eventually you will learn how to take them down or manage them. Some boss / sub boss fights seemed very hard and almost downright unfair at first, but I kept with it and learned how to fight them and it felt very rewarding once you finally beat them.At the end of the day, if you choose to take on the ruins of La-Mulana, grab a pen and paper and be prepared to have a lot of patience because you will be in for one hell of a ride.

												An amazing game through and through. Taking all the best aspects of a Metroidvania while adding a heavy dose of difficulty based mostly on your deductive/exploration skills. It's not hard because you don't have a certain equipment or weapon on your person, just based on your reasoning in figuring out the secrets of the various stages. It's a challenging game that rewards you with each puzzle you solve, each success one step closer to beating the game. As long as you're willing to put in the time and put in some serious thought as well as enjoying fun gameplay, you'll have tons of fun with La-Mulana.			"

												This game is awesome. Plain ans simple. A retro style metroidvanian soulslike that tests your brain as much as it does your reflexes. The game is quite hard, as anyone would tell you, but not frustratingly so.There are some cheap deaths, but most of the time its entirely your fault when you die. Luckily there are enough save points around which you soon, but not right from the start, can quick travel between. This starting part might be the biggest hurdle you have to take. After you find the item needed to quick travel, you are good to go and venture deeper into La-Mulana.Lots of varied locales, enemies, secrets, riddles, treasures, bosses, quirky humor and a lot of challenge you might miss from modern games really makes La-Mulana one of the greatest plattformers I've ever played for me and I enjoyed every minute of it. Every riddle I solved on REAL paper, every map I've drawn and every ""yet-to-get"" item I've marked on it was still great fun. You can really put effort into the game, if you want to. However, I'm still kind of sad I can't selectively forget all about it, to enjoy it once again without any prior knowledge!Ok, to be fair, there are a few parts and riddles that are kind of too obscure with lacking hints. Those aren't that much fun and might bring you to a grinding halt just when you are having a good run. Yet, putting all together and in perspective, La-Mulana is a fun and challenging game.Just remember keep in mind: Do not think you can play it casually, it's a game that you must be willing to invest some of your time into it. Just like a Souls game, if you need a comparison.			"

												(Many more hours spent outside the steam version of the game)Many areas to exploreLarge amount of puzzlesMore than 40 bosses and sub-bossesPlenty of items and upgrades to findFirst playthrough took around 40 hours but a lot of the time is spent trying to solve the puzzles that get trickier and more spread out the more of the map you unlock. The puzzles absolutely carry that feeling of accomplishment. Some of the bosses are challenging but mostly you can avoid deaths by teleporting away from dangerous situations leading to most progress being permanent. In many cases you can go looking around for more upgrades to give you a better chance against any troublesome bosses.The controls feels responsive and fair with a lot of the fiddly things from the predecessors inventory ui being replaced. Very playable on a keyboard.There's a lot of clues, lore and an interesting story scattered around the place and it was great to see it tied up well in the end.The music is worth mentioning as there is a lot of it with each area and Guardian having their own tracks. Some of them are very memorable.For the negatives, it is very much possible to lose track of what you are to do, leading to a lot of walking around aimlessly before stumbling upon something. This gets worse towards the end of the game as the puzzles get more cryptic and the areas that might be relevant increase in number. You do have Xelpud and Mulbruk to give you clues when stuck, but sometimes they are simply not very cooperative.If you need some help getting started consider having a look at the Trailer/Tutorial.Overall I found it an absolutely brilliant gem of a game that feels very rewarding to play.

Controls feel much tighter and responsive in the remake, the platforming is far more forgiving to precise inputs (try doing some of the wall jump stuff in the freeware version to find out what I mean), and it's not absolute dogfarts to be able to heal in this one (though the healing system is fairly strange in both versions of this game) mainly due to the fact you have the ability to go back to the save points in this game, assuming you got an item early on.The one thing I found lacking in this version compared to the freeware version of the game was that the bosses felt better in the older one, aside from the boss of the Spring in the Sky, that one is better in the remake, and the music felt far better in the freeware version, though that's a very personal bias here.If you like Metroidvanias, and have a fetish for writing down notes continuously (not being serious with the fetish part), this game might be for you. On that note, it's worth looking at the freeware version of it to see exactly how they've improved, because the freeware version does not do the justice that this version does to the title.			"

												Incredible depth, wonderful riddles, a REAL sense of discovery everytime you visit an area, great longevity, all packed in this title.If you like hard games La-Mulana is made for you, with all its intricate puzzles and bosses(some of them are definitely hard to beat).If you dont like to make your brain work or investigate avoid this title at all costs tho.I would say its a 9.5 out of 10, the only flaw I found were 2 puzzles(Gate of Illusion, Inferno Cavern, if you played it you know what I mean)that are almost impossible to solve without a walkthrough			"

												La-Mulana is a pretty good game, but it's definitively not for everyone. There is a huge focus on puzzle solving and it's not the easy kind which you often find in other games *coughzeldacough*. When it works well it works really well, but a couple of puzzles are really obtuse in what you need to do to solve them, this can be a problem when you get further into the game as the explorable space just gets larger and larger.The platforming and combat is also pretty good for the most part, there are a few hiccups, but nothing major. So if you want a game that really pulls of the concept of you being an archaeologist uncovering the truth/legends of an ancient ruin, then I honestly can't think of any other game that gets even close to that when compared to La-Mulana.

												Playing La-Mulana feels like you're exploring ancient ruins, discovering hidden secrets and solving riddles.Ever get depressed that 'Puzzle' in most games means 'Pulling a Lever' or 'Pushing a block into a block-shaped hole'? The sort of puzzle that can be solved by infants? Do you want puzzles that require you to write down cryptic hints that you'll need to decipher to open a secret passage in 2 hours time from a different location?Ever get depressed that 'Difficult' in most games means 'Developer was a sadist'? Do you want the sort of difficulty that is hard but not 'wasted the last hour' hard?Ever get depressed that 'Soundtrack' in most games means 'Forgettable orchestral score'? Do you want the sort of soundtrack that you can actually enjoy listening to. One that adds personality to the characters and the game and stands out rather than blending in?Then try La-Mulana!			"

												An unforgiving masterpiece in the best way, and masochism in its most enjoyable format. There wasn't one moment in this game when I felt like giving up, even with its difficulty, because so many aspects of this game are enjoyable and polished, I was always motivated to keep playing. Fantastic 2D visuals, beautiful music, funny dialogue, excellent level design, cool abilities and items, and more make this game one of my favorites. Thanks to the developers for toning down the difficulty for this remake, lord knows we all needed it to tone down :')My only complaint is there's no options for the original MSX inspired graphics and music (from the original La-Mulana, this game is a remake in case you didn't know), and even then it would be optional, not required, just a little something for us longtime La-Mulana fans. Other than that, this game has everything a fan of Metroid, Castlevania, puzzle games, MSX games, and even Dark Souls will love.Also shoutout to DeceasedCrab, the La-Mulana community would be nothing without him <3			"

												Made in the vein of old-school platformers in that it's stupidly hard. It's a REALLY good little metroidvania game with some great puzzles thrown in.It is difficult. It does not pull punches. It is SUPER fun.			"

												Very confusing and difficult. The primary challenge is figuring out what to do next, which is nearly impossible without outside help. The other big challenge is surviving once you figure it out. I am bad at both and might never actually finish the game because of how steep the challenge is. If you like impossibly cryptic puzzles and challenges and dying repeatedly, go for it, because La-Mulana is a pretty good game.			"

												At first I hated this game, it has a very retro feel and I was spoiled by all the recent metriodvanias that I have played that removed these mechanics. The game plays like a retro metroidvainia on the NES/SNES. The controls are sluggish and stiff by design to aid difficulty. This game has a steep learning curve and will most likely make you do some research outside the game to figure out how things function. I hated it at first and hastily gave it a negative review. I regret that. If you put an hour or more into understanding how this game works I'm sure you will find it VERY challenging and charming.			"

												My advice to anyone wanting to play this - Do it in one go - it's not one of those games you can put down for a couple of weeks and jump back in,you'll be hopelessly lost and all your progress will be for naught. Brilliant game though, a total revelation for me. 10/10			"

												Get a pen and notepad, or have a word document ready, and get ready to write♥♥♥♥♥♥down. Just about every character, message, and tablet you find has information about progressing through the game. This game isn't for everyone, but if puzzle solving and exploration is your forte, then this game does it the best. Maybe the sequel will come out in the next decade.Pros:Fantastic SoundtrackExtreme attention to detail lorewisePretty cool boss fightsMetroidvania feelCons:I personally am not a fan of the controls, but you get used to them.Lots and lots of note taking			"

												This game is a cross between a puzzle hunt and getting KICKED IN THE FACE.  REPEATEDLY.  There is nothing like La-Mulana, nothing, and there really ought to be because HOT DAMN this game is AMAZING.To start with, I have 24 hours with this game on Steam, but I actually played it first on WiiWare, so my total should be much higher, like 50 hours higher.  And that's not counting all the time I spent playing the game *outside* of the system.  You see, this game is really, really, really hard.  If you don't know what you're doing.  If you use guides, eh.  The bosses can be challenging and the platforming unforgiving, but the real reason for playing this game is the puzzling.  Oh, the puzzling.To give you a basic idea, which I hesitate to do because, when I played the game, I knew literally nothing about it, the game's world is filled with stone tablets.  These stone tablets contain hints to puzzles, which you must solve in order to progress in the game.  Or they contain flavor text.  Except when the flavor text *is* the puzzle.  ...Yep.  Because La-Mulana hates you and your family.  (""Your family"" could be interpreted as the protagonist's father, who...  Anyway.)  These puzzles are often someplace completely unrelated to where you are now.  So when I played this for the first time, I pretty soon got stuck and decided to map out the entire game.  Room names (those are clues too), tablets, locations of interesting features, unsolved puzzles, etc.  Somewhere in my apartment there's an entire graph paper notebook of maps and tablets.  I would spend hours with the maps spread out in front of me looking for solutions to the puzzles, and occasionally I'd have some flash of insight and go to the game to test it out.  You see, it's not so much that the game is *hard*.  It also draws you in.  You *have* to solve these puzzles.  And when you do, new stuff opens and it's incredibly rewarding.Speaking of which, La-Mulana is actually somewhat less of a metroidvania than you might expect; most of the stuff you collect isn't actually necessary to proceed.  For example, there's an item that improves your damage output...  OK.  There's the one that makes you invulnerable to certain enemies...  well, that's less annoying, but it won't actually get you anywhere new.  On the other hand, what does allow you to progress is solving puzzles.  New places means new hints to old puzzles, so you have to backtrack to go solve it, etc.  Progress in La-Mulana, if you don't know what you're doing (which is how it should be), is incremental.Oh, yeah.  The actual platforming.  UNFORGIVING.  The bosses.  CHALLENGING.  The good news about the platforming is that you get used to the mechanics soon enough.  The good news about the bosses is that you will die quickly.  I'm sorry, I meant the good news *for* the bosses.  Not for you.  You will die quickly.  And repeatedly.  At least, until you figure out the trick to defeating that boss.  Then you will die somewhat more slowly, but still repeatedly.  Until, maybe, you win, and you never have to fight that boss again.  Right?  ...Right?  Anyway, some of the bosses are pretty standard; they're just exceptionally tough enemies.  Others are really imaginative.  The level bosses especially are all really cool.The music!  You will continue singing it for years.  YEARS!  I just think of La-Mulana and the Surface theme plays in my mind.  And then there's the Chamber of Birth.  Whew.  Those little running elephants will haunt your dreams as you hear that catchy music.Finally, we get to one of the strongest aspects of this game: the setting.  Not just the La-Mulana ruins but the whole story.  This game really makes you feel like part of its wonderful world and makes you desperately want to learn more.  It's well thought out and really fantastic.  You're given an excuse plot (even in the manual, so I'm not spoiling anything): you're basically Indiana Jones and you're exploring some ruins that your dad went into and didn't go out of.  Hopefully, you in real life have a similar excuse plot: you're bored and want to play an entertaining game with good reviews.  But as you (well, your character) explore said ruins, you (yourself) get drawn in further and further into the world of La-Mulana.  And you won't want to get out.The only downsides of La-Mulana are...  Um...  La-Mulana's downsides are numerous.  They include...  Er, you know, I can't actually think of any downsides of La-Mulana.  Oops.  In fact, I don't think I've ever played a better game in my life.  So yeah.Ah, if only there were a sequel...  (There is a sequel.  It's not out yet, though.  When it does come out, you can bet that I will be playing it.)			"

												Ruthless.I had to take a break after the nine hour mark. Nine hours to do barely anything except survive. This is a game to keep on the back-burner, to visit and puzzle through for maybe an hour before it crushes your hopes of advancing anywhere meaningful. Go and play something casual to reassure yourself that you're not worthless, and come back to La-Mulana.The collected items and advancements in this game will make you feel like you've sacrificed some part of you to keep. The best kind of rewarding gameplay, but it will still crush you.			"

												This game is an amazing mix of Castlevania, Metroid, and Indiana Jones. If you like puzzle platformers and want a REAL challenge, then play this game. If you're 2casul4it then go play New Super Mario Bros U or something, I dunno.			"
