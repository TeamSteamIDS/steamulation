												This game relies way too much on darkness to make its puzzles way more difficult than they need to be. For example, there is a section with a memory-type puzzle, where you have to step on a grid of tiles in the correct sequence to pass. However, the floor is completely dark, so you can't even tell which tile you're standing on. Even if you've memorized the sequence, you still have to make leaps of faith in the darkness and hope you land on the right tile.If it takes you 2 hours to solve a puzzle that could be solved in 10 seconds with the lights on, that's a pretty poorly designed puzzle.

												Doorways present itself as a survival horror game but it is more about exploration than anything else.The gameplay is pretty straight forward and too simplistic in design. Sometimes you may be required to do a little platforming as well which isn’t perfect but not too terrible either. The sections with traps requiring you to use surrounding hints to find solution of avoiding traps were particular nice. Other than such moments, most of you time you will be just going on exploration and scavenger hunts in the game. Reach from start to end and find out any items or keys that you may need to unlock the next portion of the game.Throughout the game you can find hidden collectables called ‘relics’. These add some nice replayability to the game. The relics are well hidden and should prove a nice challenge to players attempting to gather them.Doorways is something to look into. I loved the atmosphere, the music, and all the creepy, subtle effects. I think everything came together to create a memorable experience, in the end, despite some of the nagging issues.			"

												Linux notes: Achievements are broken in Linux, and the devs seem to be ignoring the community calling for it to be fixed. This irks me to no end when devs do this.Other than that, this game isn't all that scary. It's a ""haunted house"" game -- walk around until something pops out and goes ""BOO!"" The player's character is never put in any real danger.The game is dark. I mean really dark. It's like they didn't want you to see anything. They even did that ""film grain"" thing a lot of dev teams do in order to gloss over the fact they copied and pasted most of the level, and are using generic textures. Darkness isn't scary if there's nothing in it.The puzzles are extremely simple. There are unnecessary slow-paced parkour sections ... just because why not. The most interesting thing to do is searching for collectibles just to get an achievement. Lame.That being said, the atmosphere is alright. The sound design is probably the best part of the game.Scariness: 3/10Gameplay: 4/10Atmosphere: 7/10			"

												Where as I loved this game, and found it immersive, and enjoyable, I wouldn't recommend getting it. The devs are almost non-interactive, and it's been almost a year since this game came out with the promise that people who bought this would get chapters 3 & 4 free when they were released. This isn't the case now, and had I know that I wouldn't have paid this price for the game. As beautiful as it is, it's not worth the price for half a game riddled with glitchyness. Not to mention the devs removing/locking threads which are unfavourable. If you can find it super cheap, grab it up for sure, but don't hope for anything past chaptesr 1 & 2. Real disappointed in these guys.			"

												""Action""? ""Survival Horror""? You must be joking.Area 1 is a tutorial. Area 2 involves walking from place to place in order, picking up notes. Area 3 involves walking round and round in circles assembling bits of broken machinery.There is no action. You have no weapons. You can't run from anything that threatens you - you either have to avoid it or face it.Not only is it a DULL, DULL game with absolutely NOTHING of interest happening, the devs aren't interested in patching it. They've known about bugs and glitches for months but are too busy stealing money from people with ""Chapter 3"".Oh yes. If you haven't heard, this was an Early Access game. Parts 1&2 were released initially, with the rest of the game to follow when it was done. Not only have they not bothered fixing what was broken with parts 1&2, but they've decided they're entitled to charge for the rest of the game. So anybody who helped them by buying Early Access now has to pay again to get the game they've already paid for.Even if the game was amazing I wouldn't recommend it, simply because this sort of behaviour should NOT be encouraged.

												Hey guys and gals, ladies, and germs. I'm an Ex-Bawks controller fan myself however the KB&M function works just fine. I have to admit it's different than what I expected. In some ways it also reminded me a bit of the MYST series. This survival horror game will throw a lot of surprises, puzzles and creatures that want to see you dead. You'll play through a dark environment picking up pieces , clues and items along the way. You play as the protagonist known as Thomas Foster. An Agent that was assigned to track down criminals and psychotics.  The game plays in set chapters and has an auto save feature. The in game controls set to default but can be altered at any time. If you haven’t picked up this little gem yet, consider this game the next time you’re in the market for a unique and fun experience.			"

												Doorways is a really good game but i wouldent exactally call it survival horror more horror puzzle first person game.Now i will say why i think this,i love survival horror games and this game just does not fit with me into that catagory,there are no weapons to pick up no enemies to fight and the items you do collect all come in handy but for solving puzzles (just like in resident evil i suppose) snd thats what drives the game.The graphics really suit this game (and for an indie title are really good) and the creepy and earie sounds only help to make the whole experience that more unnereving.The story is really good and one that is very adult in nature and we dont see much of that lately (THE CAT LADY is another fine example of this also),i really dont know where the main character is my only guess is that he is some sort of dream walker and is in the killers minds that he is after,but whatever it is the story is engaging and really quite on the obscure side also.The 2 parts of the story that are here are both good and to be honest my only complaint is that they are rather short and when done you will only really want to go back to play through again to get achievements you havent got.Having said that what is on offer is entertaining and engrossing enough that any adult looking for a game that will engage them in a different way wont go wrong with this game,just dont expect it to last forever.Lets hope that the next chapters get released soon and that we can and will find out what and who THOMAS FOSTER actually is,as to be honest he is one hell of an enigma.

												Yet again my enjoyment in a game is completely ruined because a game thinks that darkness means scary and immersive. In the last review that I wrote, The Hat Man: Shadow Ward, I did complain that the game was dark, but little I did know that there was a game WAY worse in terms of darkness. I had to literally play with the in-game brightness at 10 (maximum), my laptop brightness at 100% and still open the Intel Graphics Center and turn it up to 50 so I could play this game. How can you even play something if you're barely seeing it? How is that even fun?Nevertheless the game is pretty simple, and it ain't bad, it's just meh, but since the only way it makes itself difficult is by using darkness, it's a bad design choice and overall lazy one. It definitely needed a bit more work. Regarding bugs and such I had no technical problems. There is one thing though, being a dual monitor user, and playing the game in one monitor, the game never locks the mouse in it's window, so this means if the mouse pointer is on the other monitor and I click it, the game's minimized. This happened about 10 times, but it's just a slight annoyance. The game also runs well at a constant 60 frames per second.Another problem I found is the torch. You lit up the torch and it lasts for about 10 seconds. Last time I checked that's not how torches work... And once more, the game relies on this mechanic to make itself harder, which just results in frustration.While being short in length and having some good-looking sections (mostly in chapter 2), which are definitely ruined by the lack of lightning, I'm still intereted in Chapters 3 and 4, but it's a very ""ehhhh"" start for the series. #BrighterHorror 4/10			"

												While the first two chapters were fun, it was supposed to have two more chapters.  The two final chapters now need to be purchased separately (Well only the third is out).  I would not waste my money on this game again as the developer will change their mind and want more money for chapter four.  Bad business practice and terrible game.

												CHAPTERS 1 & 2The main protagonist is a cop/detective who is tasked to find 4 criminals, all while trying to avoid being killed by various traps, ghosts, and animated statues. The setting is creepy, dark, and beautifully done. Levels vary from being outside with walls of spikes all around you to the interior of old, dark castles.The game tries to scare you, but doesn’t do a great job doing so, but there are some pretty scary moments, like being chased by a huge statue when you can only see 5 feet in front of you, or when you’re running through the darkness hoping your torch doesn’t die out leaving you vulnerable to the ghosts that dwell there. The fear from this game comes more from psychological things instead of physical objects or beings, like seeing a man being tortured with a device intended to rip the flesh from your bones. All that and the grainy visual effects still are not enough to make this game reach the level of horror they were probably attempting to achieve.There are notes and small statues you can search around for, while the statues unlock achievements, the notes are basically the only story there is in this game, and it could have been done better.Pros:Beautiful environments.Some fun moments.Voicing by Sam A. Mowry.Cons:Controls are bad.Very short (60-90 minutes).Boring for most of the game.Tries to be scary, but fails most of the time.Score: 5/10CHAPTERS 3 & 4-not released yet-			"

												It's a pretty generic horror game, but that isn't a bad thing. However there are many bad things about this game. I even made you a list!-The tutorial level is unbelievably laggy compared to the rest of the game, maybe because the entire level loaded at once.-Walk in the dark, pick up a thing, rinse and repeat. We're getting GOTY with these revolutionary mechanics.-Jump scares are substituted for things that could actually be scary, you know, like a story.-When the level loads a different area, there is no loading screen, the game cuts to black and fades back. It feels jagged.-Some parts are just way too dark. Even with the gamma turned up, you won't be able to discern different symbols in front of you, symbols which will determine if you live or become a giant shishkabob.But don't add this to your cart and delete it from your cart yet! This game has some redeeming factors!-The setting is great, really. The maps aren't the most creative, but they serve their purpose well when they aren't dark.-The sound is fun. It will make you feel as if there's someone around you or even BEHIND YOU RIGHT NOW! AAAHH!!-Because it's a standard horror game, they don't waste time introducing quirky mechanics you'll use once and then never again. It takes 5 minutes for hem to teach you what you need to know and you're off.-The first ""monster"" you come across (and the only one I've seen so far) has a pretty basic design, but still manages to be freaky after seeing it 500 times.I'd only recommend this game to people who like horror games and only if they want something a little lighter. The story won't give you existential depression, the monsters won't give you nightmares, you won't have to sleep between mommy and daddy when you finish Chapter 1, it's a very relaxed horror game.

												If you're a fan of spooky horror games then it's worth playing.  I had a decent amount of fun and I will continue to play the others in the series.7/10PS: The reason it's rated low is not because of the game itself, but the developers.  Apparently at first they said the rest of the chapters would be free and then they charged for them.  Kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of them if it's true but it didn't effect me any because I got it on sale for super cheap.			"

												For the most part, playing Doorways was like playing Amnesia without the monsters. I was relieved when I finally encountered an enemy that wasn't just part of the scenery. The game is linear, somewhat spooky and the puzzles are very easy. The plot is written all over little notes and scribbles left lying around in random places. I didn't read half of them because they didn't seem to hold any clues or essential (or intriguing) information.  To be fair, I thought that some of the individual scares were effective, but they were scarce.			"

												Personal Rating: Good story, not a bad game, maybe a bit shortClassic Rating: ★★★✬☆So, the first two Doorways' chapters are the beginning of an investigative story about four sociopaths: you are on the trails of the killings, trying to understand what happened and why the murderers did what they did. The story and the way it's told, is very fascinating; it's mixed by surrealism and true events/locations: you're guided through a maze-styled path and have to find your way out by recovering gears and other stuff, which are part of mini/easy puzzles.The game is quite short, I'd say 2 hours and a half - don't look at my playtime, I farmed cards before playing and left the game open several times to do other things.I encountered some technical problems too, not a big deal though: the menu is very slow, even in-game when you have to select items from your inventory and that is quite annoying. I also had a very low framerate (around 20FPS) @1080p with low quality settings but also at 720p, medium quality settings - my graphic card is a Radeon HD5550, not a very good one, I know, but I think the game could be better optimized (we're not talking about a pumped-up AAA title).Finally, moving the camera with my mouse was a bit of a pain, because it was like ""swinging"" around to turn 45° and I couldn't find any setting to adjust.Verdict: Got ""Doorways: Chapter 1 & 2"" for FREE and I enjoyed it quite a lot, so I'm going to recommend it too.

OverviewWell, where to begin? Doorways: Chapters 1 & 2 (now called Doorways: Prelude, apparently) is an exploration, puzzle solving horror game, that relies on darkness to confound you, while playing as a character who is after people in some alternate dimension.Unfortunately, it doesn’t do much well.It’s yet another horror title in what is seemingly becoming a bigger and bigger genre.ProsGraphics are decentVoice acting is surprisingly good for a low budget indie horror gameImagery is astounding, from the torture dungeon to the malformed humansIt’s over quick and has easy achievements if you’re an achievement hunterConsFar, far too dark; darkness is excellent in a horror game, this one just uses it excessivelyPuzzles are extremely easy, made harder by the near pitch blackness (I rarely turn my monitor brightness up; this game had me increasing it both from within game and the actual monitor controls)Not much to the environments, they’re all pretty basicInventory system is clunkyChapter 1’s torch is the most useless torch in the history of gaming, whether by design or anotSummaryDoorways: Prelude has a few things going for it, with some genuinely disturbing imagery at parts, but it’s overall another sub-par horror game, that relies on complete blackness to make its easy puzzles harder. I completed it in roughly 80 minutes, with the remainder of my time played allowing the game to run to get the final two card drops.I picked this up in a bundle at some point along the way, and for the price, it was well worth it. I wouldn’t suggest buying this on its own, unless you’re very hard up for a horror game. But if you’re hard up for a horror game, there are, literally, hundreds of other titles far more deserving of your cash.			"

There is a fine line between dimly lit to set the mood, and utterly black can't see where I'm going.  I was in a dark room with no other light sources and still had trouble seeing some stuff.   Puzzles were pretty weak.    No real action to speak of, and story line breadcrumbs fairly lame.			"

												Doorways introductory chapters held a lot of interesting ideas and promise for the by-now well trodden/beaten -pick and delete depending on your level of cynicism- atmospheric amnesia first person horror genre. I purchased the game for the atmosphere that was shown in the trailer and this is where the problems started to become apparent. After 5 minutes in game during the tutorial I noticed how the sound was looping, the ambient music, the effects, the wailing in the distance. Now, I am well aware that games like Penumbra & Amnesia which have clearly inspired Doorways commit the same looping but their loops tend to be a little longer than 20 seconds so I was let down in that regard, fair enough, I'm here for the gameplay. I played on. The level design itself is rather poor, from the very first moment you step out of the tutorial you realize that rather than expand upon the rather basic controls & level structure shown in the first few minutes, the game will simply apply the same rigid poorness to every area. Whether you are meant to be outside or inside it always feels like you're stuck in a rather poor Time Splitters 2-esque custom map from 2002. Add in the issues with the sound & atmosphere and you can already tell I was getting rather bored within 20 minutes. Outside of the structure of the levels the graphics themselves are middle of the road for an independent horror game without much financial support, so that is not a problem to me, however the issue with the graphics & levels is that when you step into a new area the screen goes black for a split second and loads things up. You want to see a ghost? You'll know when because the screen will blink. I have absolutely no idea of what goes into coding but this is not good enough, it's like refreshing a screamer website! Is Doorways as good as a screamer website though? No. The shocks did not make me jump or lose my footing, the atmosphere of the game left me with a rather sarcastic expression after every attempted tension building moment, and the ideas behind the killings & horror is so trope based I wanted to become a Yorkshireman and hang myself with t'rope I have handy in my DIY kit in order to stop the pain. Did I keep on playing? Yes, I didn't immediately turn the game off after tasting my salty disappointment because I did enjoy the implementation of basic floor tile/memory jumping within a castle. That may sound dull but within the confines of this game it was the peak of the experience for me. Still, after chapter 1, boredom once again crept in like a badly designed giant enemy in chapter 2.The one upside is my boredom didn't last very long! Not due to any particular excitment or interest from the game but because I completed both chapters within an hour and 35  minutes. 95 minutes for two chapters of a game that I paid full price for. These two chapters amount to 50% of Doorways chapters, as you will have already done the math that means two more chapters are incoming, but there is no way I would spend money on a sequel set to Chapters 1 &2. In fact I doubt I'd even play them unless they were a free expansion to make up for the first two chapters. Doorways is lacking in longevity, ingenuity, atmosphere, and scares. It's frightening only in the sheer disappointment it offers, comparable to a once hopeful post-degree move into an empty dreary admin assistant job market.Avoid, if you're looking for new atmospheric horror right now I'd suggest having a long break after you finish Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs.

												So, I'd definitely recommend reading the other reviews here, specifically the ones from people who bought into this game when it was in early access. Anyway, none of that affects me because I picked this up in a bundle.What I was expecting: spooky exploration, storyline, puzzlesNormally I struggle through games to the bitter end before leaving a review but sadly I just didn't feel like it was worth it in this case.It's very (intentionally) dark. Whilst darkness can be used to add atmosphere, in this case it mostly just left me squinting at my screen as I fumbled my way through irritating... I don't really know what to call them... jump quests? jump on the tiles quests? etc etc I'm assuming these were the ""puzzles"" mentioned. I found my willingness to explore evaporating as I squinted into more and more dark corners. Stuck? don't know where to go? can't find a way on? retrace your steps. Even though the game appears to be very (very) linear it still wants you to wander through many obstacles into dead ends to collect things, so you can turn around and have to make your way through those same obstacles in order to get out.It feels like a college project. It has some nice ideas but they're not well implemented. When you compare it to the other games available out there in this genre it really doesn't hold up. The storyline might have been fun but the game was too irritating for me to be able to appreciate it. The controls are clunky (as a KB/mouse user anyway).			"

												I was hesitant with Chapter 1 as I wasn't quite sure what to expect... which turned out to be a lot of fumbling in the pitch dark in  a few ""Penumbra-esque"" environments. Once I got the hang of what was going on I found myself entertained, but not necessarily thrilled. I was concerned that the next chapter, not to mention the following 3 and 4 were going to be just the same, but maybe with some skins swapping and cookie-cutter levels/puzzles.Then I got to chapter 2 and was blown away. This isn't ""in your face"" horror, this is subtle. The game isn't in it to make you jump out of your seat, but to let you plod along then suddenly make you sit rigid and let out a panicked ""#$@!"". Chapter 2 was magnificent at its pacing, letting me get just confident enough to be speeding around right before slapping me in the face with a big horrible surprise.After completing the first two chapters I'm super happy with the game. These chapters are not just copy/paste jobs, but offer full changes in environment, puzzles, interactions, and 'enemies'. From what I can see the last two chapters will also differ greatly from the first two, making each chapter a unique play experience, and horribly eerie in its own way.However, as for the bad (or atleast the not-so-good) the game offers the ability to change keyboard controls, but not for all functions; so when I bind the horrid WASD to the more preferred ESDF I couldn't understand why my torch kept going out so fast - Oh... F is bound to pull-out/put-away torch, but there's no option of that in controls, and is a forced keybind... gotcha.On top of that, the story is a little too vague. I do appreciate the fact that the story is just subtle and vague enough to not be  an ""insult to the gamer's intellegence"" by being spelled out and shoved down your throat (and actually works very well to let you figure it out in your own interpretation), but it's so vague that I found the continuity confusing, and most specifically for Chapter 1, that there was no successful completion to my mission (that made any sense to me at least).The last negative is the price point. While the game was a worthy purchase for me, I bought it on a sale for pretty cheap. Had I of spent $10 on this I might've felt a little ripped off - why? I don't know... $10 isn't much and I certaintly got a few hours of fun out of this, but the game feels 'simple' compared to the other games available in the same vein (that are also available for quite cheap).Still, despite some minor flaws, the game is short enough to not get repetative and interesting enough to hold your attention. While it may not be for everyone, fans of the horror-puzzle games (and most specifically, the third Penumbra game) will have a grand time with it... but maybe just wait for a sale.			"

												I actually played most of this some years back - in fact, it was one of the very first games I ever played on Steam! - but alas, my laptop back then was a steaming great pile of doggy-doo, and the lag I experienced ultimately meant that I had to throw in the towel and wait for a better computer.  Well, I've now owned that better computer for well over a year, so I guess the time taken to get BACK to this game doesn't quite suggest that I found it all that ""compelling"" the first time around.      Coming back to it though, I gotta say, it actually stacks up EXTREMELY well next to a lot of the cheap, ""indie"" horror games which have come out since.  It's maybe never quite ""inspired"", but Doorways: Prelude is consistently solid.  Very solid.  BRICK solid.  Almost the textbook definition of ""solid"".    So what exactly does the gameplay comprise of, you ask?  Is it a traditional ""survival horror"", in the vein of the early Resident Evil and Silent Hill games?  No.  Definitely not.  Is it more like a post-Amnesia: The Dark Descent ""stealth horror"" game, a la Outlast and Alien: Isolation?  Again...no, not really, but definitely getting warmer.  Is it a...gulp...""walking simulator"", then?  Well...hmmm...again, no.  Not really.  But kinda.  But really kinda not, considering how many opportunities the game gives you to DIE.    ""SO WHAT THE HELL KINDA HORROR GAME IS IT, THEN?!"" I hear you scream, in mounting frustration.  Well, hmmm...lemme think a sec...I guess it's really a bunch of quite different and varied ""mini-games"", and therein lies the difficulty in trying to nail it all down.  This isn't a BAD thing, though, when the vast majority of said ""mini-games"" are actually rather GOOD ""mini-games"" - don't spend too long in the dark or die, find the correct path across the trap-laden floor, that kinda thing - and the overall game ultimately serves up oodles of what horror gamers generally seek the most:  Spooky and interesting locations, puzzles which are challenging but not TOO tricky, and spooky atmosphere and (fairly minor) scares aplenty.    ""BUT ARE THERE ENEMIES?"" I hear you ask next, still not quite convinced what it is that you'll be buying if you throw down your hard-earned dosh for this game.  Um...again, no easy, regular answer to this question, but my best attempt would be:  Yes.  Sometimes.  Sort of.  Though not generally in the ""traditional"" sense.  But as I mentioned above, there's no end of ways to meet your demise, so don't fret if you're a member of the ""not another ♥♥♥♥ing walking simulator"" crowd.  Rest assured, unless you're a much more competent gamer than myself - not hard, admittedly - you're not liable to complain that you didn't cark it enough times in the course of your play-through (which, for the record, is probably somewhere in the three to five hour range, making it kinda short but sufficiently sweet).  There's certainly a fair element of trial-and-error style gameplay, though it's certainly no Limbo in that regard, and the save/check-points are frequent enough to never render it TOO frustrating in that department.    Sure, there's a few things wrong with it:  It's insanely dark (I mean visually, not just tonally!), but once you crank your brightness up a little it's fine (and don't feel guilty for doing so...I certainly didn't, 'cause it really is borderline unplayable in parts if you DON'T).  And sure, the whole ""here's a static, cut-screen image of a spooky little girl to signify your death"" thing is usually a sure-fire sign of cheap AND nasty, but somehow it seems justifiable enough in the way it's used in this game, and if you stick around long enough, you WILL encounter ""enemies"" which actually MOVE (but I won't spoil that for you).    So what about the price?  Well, it's possibly a tad steep at ten bucks, so unless you're frankly unconcerned by such things, I'd probably wait for a sale.  In any case, I'm taking it as a good sign of what's to come in the two episodes released since, and if it's any kind of incentive, I just purchased said remaining episodes on the strength of re-playing this one (granted, in a sale)!  I can only assume that the games get BETTER as they progress, and if so, this is a pretty bloody good start.  Verdict: 9/10.			"

												Read a lot of reviews and finally decided to jot a few lines. I understand that many are frustrated because this game was listed under survival and I can see why. Yet if you think about it, anything where you would have to try and not get killed can be classified as such (I personally would classify Prelude as more of a stealth game... but then again, not exactly).For those who gave it a thumbs down simply because ""it wasn't scary enough"" remember - just because it didn't scare you, does not mean it didn't scare anyone else. What DO you find scary? Seeing someone being sliced in half with their guts all over the place? Stupid in my opinion. Or having to check yourself every once and again because you feel like someone's following you? Because that's what Prelude (or any Doorways game) is in essence. I felt so immersed in the atmosphere and the score that I had to turn around to see if anyone was behind me. Sometimes I would simply walk around just to LOOK around because everything is so beautifully made (also applies to Holy Mountains). The game knows exactly when to slow you down or speed you up and there's nothing you can do about it no matter how uncomfortable you get. Smooth movement and very effective narration.I play a lot of horror and I must admit that a certain chapter of this game made me truly physically ill (in a good way!) and I will never look at sculptures the same way again :)Personally, Prelude is my favorite in the series (although... Holy Mountains is so beautifully done!).And please turn up your brightness before you complain.			"

												This game is mediocre, at best.  The graphics are uninteresting, and largely monochromatic.  In a cavern?  Right, lets make everything a blue-gray color.  Much of the game world is copy and pasted, or otherwise pitch dark to conceal that there is nothing in it.  Traversing the game world seems more akin to a carnival ""house of horrors"" where you trudge from point A to point B and if you go off the path the wrong way there's either a dead end or a ""boo!"" scare to put you back on track.  There are a few puzzles, but they won't tax you, and you're likely to find most of the challenge in the platforming bits.  That's right...  platform jumping.  The bridge section, for instance.  Oh, the bridge section...  if anything underlines how one-dimensional and linear this game is, it's the bridge section.  You're on a big broken up bridge...  you have to find the right path to get to the other side...  a creepy girl keeps popping up who stands in your way... basically, go the path that doesn't have her and you have the correct path.  The jumping was the toughest part, as your path is rather obvious.The game is an incoherent mess and the poor designers of this game are so out of their ken.  Even with the readables the story is almost non-existent and there are no NPCs.  In fact, there are no enemies, so there is little to actually be afraid of.  In Chapter 1 I'm looking for one person, but in Chapter 2 I'm looking for someone else, without ever having found the first target.  This game makes no sense.  And it's boring.  And it's slow!  Why is this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game so laggy when nothing is happening!?  I've played far more graphically intense games on this rig and none have suffered the sort of hemmorrhaging this game limps along on.It's also worth noting that the developer of the game originally marketed this as a multi-chapter game with the implication being that after you purchased the game you'd get the other chapters.  However, after chapter 2 was released, and just prior to chapter 3 being released, they changed the name of the game from simply 'Doorways' to 'Doorways: Chapter 1 & 2' and announced that chapter 3 was going to be a separate product.  It's their game(s?), so they can do as they wish, but the first two chapters can be breezed through in an hour or two, it's hardly scary or interesting or stimulating.  Don't bother.			"

												Disappointed.Well, the game is beautiful, sounds are excellent, it's very atmospheric. Sometimes even scary.Sometimes - yes. But difficult puzzles are repetitive and if you fail the tenth time, a spirit no longer scares you, you treat it like a loading screen. And after some time it is no different than other puzzle-platform games.And the linux support is poor. X-box controller does not work properly under linux (no crouch button) while some keyboard keys are not re-mappable, so I cannot use IJKL (yes, I am a leftie).			"

												Rating: 6/10Atmosperical horror game with a bit of puzzles, which plays on your feelings of loneliness and unknown fear rather than jumpscares. The environment isn't very detailed, but it suits the purpose and with creepy ambient it's overall pretty decent piece. Despite the fact it's a low budget game, with no real challenge, I recommend it.			"

												I simply HAVE to  write a review about this game because it baffles me that they actually asked 10 euro's + for it. First of all the game is VERY short, i finished it in just under 2 hours (that includes screwing up and finding the next way to go. the game is rather linear with absolutely NO exploration. it's not scary, it tries to set the mood but the graphics just won't work with the sounds. the first 15 minutes i thought something was going to pop out at me but that was not the case at all. There are relics to be found in each chapter. I have searched many corners and only found one, kind of a let down. The only real redeeming factor of this game is the voice actor that reads these weird notes that sometimes talk about the most obvious things ever or it speaks of things that are too ""deep"" for the game to handle. In the end i didn't have a good experience, i know there wil be more chapters and i wil play them just for the sake of finishing the game. But i hope they wil be longer if not more interesting because halfway through i just wanted the game to end.If you really REALLY want to play/try this game buy it on sale if you want to have your money spent equal to the amount of entertainment you get, 10 euro's is really too much to ask for a game like this			"

While immersion was present, the constant fear of being watched was not. Occasional jump scares and cheap frills, what else is there to say?

While not the worst horror game out there, it feels like a fan made amnesia custom story that got pretty far, then just said “f*** it, I’m done.”  "

												Initial thoughts:-For people who thought Amnesia needed platforming-For people who thought the girl from The Ring wasn't in enough survival horror games as is-More grain than a ♥♥♥♥ing bakery-Littered with horrible pop-psychology -Protagonist is likely a dwarf because the camera is two feet off the ground -Dark enough that the gamma setting is your primary antagonist-Some of the textures appear to be lifted from the original Doom-The writing is incredibly heavy handedFinal thoughts:In the middle of a particularly eerie segment where the halls are flooded with statues I thought perhaps I'd be able to say at least the second chapter is half decent. The game didn't lose its ad nauseum fetch quests or inane map design/platforming elements but as the atmosphere increased I started to be charmed by the game a little bit in spite of everything.Then I actually played the statue part and it managed to take the one example of good tension it built and ruin it completely by making it a puzzle where going too close to the wrong ones gets you killed in a quick animation and sent back to the start. The visual design is clustered and messy during this segment while the gameplay is dull and irritating which exemplified everything wrong with the game: it doesn't know what it wants.Even when Doorways succeeds in one area it fails so horribly in another that no good will could withstand it, not because there's nothing of value going on but because there's always self-sabotage to undermine it.

												The game is for beginner dungeon crawlers.  The puzzles are super predictable.  The graphics and some of the scenes are put together nicely, but the game itself could easily be beaten in 2 hours tops...  In other words, this is not a very long game.  It was actually shockingly short.  The soundtrack loops and is also shockingly short.  About the scariest part of this game is wondering how long it will take before you ram a screwdriver in your ear and put your head through the monitor.  The game is totally worth like 3-5$.  I just finished the second in the series and it was a bit longer, but the very end of it was excrutiatingly frustrating.  Neither game is at all challenging to the mind, the only challenge is trial and error.  As in, you already know exactly what to do, but the game is so petty and precise on some stupid timing trick that you have to be at a perfect distance to the last pixel, I literally was down to my last try to finish the 2nd in the series before I rage quit.  You will know the part I'm talking about...			"

Short version: 63%A puzzle platformer disguised as a psychological horror, Doorways is perfect for those who like a decent atmosphere and don’t mind hopelessly running around in the darkness. Long version:Despite what the description states, Doorways is not a horror adventure but a first-person platformer/puzzle game with some eerie elements, including an overabundance of the most overused one, pitch black darkness.To the game’s credit, it has a good place in there, since the levels are actually representing the subconscious of two deranged serial murderers, and the player’s job is to explore these psyches by solving various jumping puzzles and avoiding all kinds of traps: essentially this is Tarsem Singh’s The Cell without a framing plot and less artistic pretentiousness. And with a shorter run time: an experienced player can run through the game under an hour. But the road there is paved with lots of hopeless wandering in the darkness and many attempts on the trial-and-error puzzles.Still, if you get hooked on the atmosphere, it can be a good experience, especially if you can grab it at a discount price to compensate for the short length.

												I'm going to give this a thumbs up though with caveats because I like what it is trying to do and I think for a small team development. There is some potential even if the first two chapters are not going to come across very strong. The first chapter isn't very good, relying on the fact that you can barely see in the dark for its 'challenge' factor, which is really more exasperating than anything, but it still didn't take long to get through. The second chapter is more of a traditional puzzle environment with some audio/visual creepiness to it, but is by no means very scary. I did want to play through these games to see where the Doorways series is going though, and overall, each one improves in art quality and game design. This specific purchase is Chapters 1 and 2, with 'Doorways Underworld' being Chapter 3. Having played through all 3, there isn't any real reason to play 1 and 2 in terms of narrative or world building that I could see and 3 is probably the most fleshed out in terms of having interesting mechanics, so it wouldn't be wrong to skip straight to it unless you just want to make sure to see all the series has to offer.Ultimately, you are going to be playing a low budget, small dev team game, so keep that in mind when you judge it if you decide to pick it up.

The torch stays lit for less than 10 seconds and most of the stuff is completely invisible. Most of the time you stare at a black screen with some details. If a puzzle is difficult just because you can't see where are you going or because you can't see the symbols on the floor it means it's too dark, even at maximum brightness.			"

												Time to beat: under 3 hours (non-completionist)Played with keyboard and mouse. Easy to control, although jumping was sometimes buttclenchingBugs: none that I came across.Motionsickness factor: very minorThe story: Prelude is Chapter 1 and Chapter 2. You are a kind of agent who is tracking down some psychopaths in a very surreal environment and at the same time trying to sort out his emotions about the things he is experiencing through his search.Have you ever watched the movie ""The Cell""? Yeah, 2000 with Jennifer Lopez.... this game is very much comparable to that. And maybe that's why I enjoyed this game, because it felt like I was physically exploring the twisted minds of these psychopaths.Visually, this game was kind of nice. Not always. Not spectacular, but most of the time just nice. The different environments were great (except for spikey forest... that was kind of lame).Some points during the game, it was just too damn dark to see anything at all... which has been mentioned in previous reviews...all points are true. It was bloody difficult to comlete some puzzles in the dark. WOW. Pain in the♥♥♥♥♥The puzzles/scavenger hunts were neat. Easy enough though... maybe a bit too easy. I'm hoping for more puzzle challenge in chapter 3.Chapter 2 was great! Spooked the hell out of me at one point, so that was nice. Overall scary? Meh... sometimes... no real threat, but there were a couple scares a long the way. Especially in some of the halls in Chapter 2. Not Amnesia scary. Not Outlast scary. More like Anna scary.I'm really looking forward to the direction the story is heading and looking forward to the next Chapter. I already have a theory................ but I won't spoil it for you.Do I recommend this? If you don't mind a really short game, sure. The price was a little steep for the short game, maybe try for it on sale. But overall, I recommend it.			"

I found no clear narrative. You apparently enter some evil people's minds, but I was not sure. The game could have used some more polishing, and more scares, and more atmosphere, and then it would be rather good. But alas, it fell short, and feels like an engine test more than a full game.

												I actually enjoyed this one. On the Oculus it'd be intense.  On the standard monitor, it's a nice puzzle/adventure using an FPS engine, which is unique.  Story is interesting if a little confusing.  I'd like to play more chapters with more exposition and explanation.			"

												First person survival horror / exploration games are on the rise right now. While this game does have some strong points, it falls short over other similiar titles. The short of it is..Pros~Great atmosphere~Great ambiance~The story is told through a very different, yet interesting perspective~A few fun puzzles~It is episodic, more episodes will be released in the futureCons~Some areas become very, very tedious ~A lot of the exploring feels dull~The death animations are not scary, making the game feel more trial and error than survival.~Very lackluster--Verdict--The atmosphere and ambiance will put you on edge, but aside from rare encounters that is all that will put you on edge. Some of the puzzle are fun. A lot of the ideas in the game are rehashed over and over and become very boring. The only punishment of dying is having to go back through an already tedious task. There are a lot of survival horror/exploration games out there right now. This game does not hold a candle to the likes of Outlast or Slender.--Rating--    5/10			"

												If you are indeed hoping for the next ""Amnesia"" you wont find it here.Even if you were *somehow* excited by pewdiepies playthrough, you will soon realise the game is completely different after the initial scares of the random woman appearing infront of you and attacking you if you stay in the dark. the rest of this 'chapter one' is simple puzzel sovling and collecting items to watch split second animations of torture. For example, the dark area being dangerous literally dissappears from the game (as does the woman)Part 2, while dull, atleast sticks to its theme the whole way through and doesnt make a completly disjointed beginning, tricking you this game might be worth your time. Personally i played and payed much more time and money then i think this game deserved.			"

												Jump puzzles.Still interested? Ok, well it also isn't even a little bit scary, and only sometimes atmospheric. Did I mention the jump puzzles?There was an interesting idea somewhere in this game. Then it got strangled to death by poor design. I get the feeling that the dev team never asked anyone else what they though of the game and might not have listened to the responses if they had. If I made this game as a project, like as a first foray into game development, sort of a ""proof of concept"" type of thing, I'd probably show it off to some friends and maybe even put it up on my website for free download. I would never have the chutzpah to charge money for it. There are too many good games you haven't played to waste time with this. And if you want to support indie developers, then go give your money to the ones that are cranking out really, really good stuff. "

												This is one of the worst games i've ever played. It will only take you about an hour to finish and mostly consists of Haunted jumping puzzles that are incredibly boring. Often at times I would find myself confused because you have to guess where to go and what to get. If you are buying this game because you think it would be Scary it is the farthest thing from it. The story isn't well defined and could be brought out more. The puzzles incorperated into the game require little to no effort to solve and the boss battles are pathetic and generic.			"

												Nothing new, puzzles don't take much thought if you're familiar with this kind of adventure game. Most of it was very predictive and linear.The forest level is very boring to explore, it's supposed to be dark, but that's all it is. There is a lack of atmosphere and it seems very bland. I enjoyed the room with the torture devices and piecing together a story of some kind, but it failed to deliver, almost like an unfinished book that has no form of a ""cliff-hanger"" to keep you interested. Chapter 2 however was a completey different story, it has potential here, i felt the environment created a unique atmosphere (especially with the boss fight at the end, that was brilliant).I personally enjoyed parts of it, but it happened too fast, and gives you a feeling of being ""rushed"", almost like you would be expecting something more but it doesn't follow through.For now i don't reccomend it. The length of the game and the forest level is why i think this.Hopefully the chapters 3 & 4 will compensate that, but i'm in no rush to buy it when it arrives.(also, small note: achievements do not work on linux for some reason, and has been like this since release)			"

												***Not Worth Price Point*** TLDR; Get this game on sale - Approx. 3 hrs longI just completed Doorways: Prelude and I am hesitant to reccomend it. I enjoyed the writing so overall this is a positive, but I'll keep this short.Pros:-Great atmosphere & sounds-Intriguing writing-Decent PuzzlesCons:-Poorly optimized - a lot of frame drops during checkpoint saves-There seems to be some sort of mouse acceleration going on - it may be intentional for atmosphere. Some people may not be fans-Not worth the price - One play through for me was 2.8 hrs - That's close to $4/hr of game play at the 10.99 price point. Wait until it is on sale :)			"

												Doorways: Prelude ... a decent 7 / 10The good :- Immersive  , dark and eerie atmosphere . By far the game's strongest feature , gives an intense uneasy feeling for the entire (short) duration of the game.- Decent graphics , great level design . Nothing out of the ordinary but nice all the same.- Great soundtrack (and voice acting) , really contributes to the game's dark atmosphere.- Delivers some really good , scary moments. The bad:- Underdeveloped story . The main idea and concept is great , navigating through the killer's subconcious and having to re-live said horror. However it feels sketchy , none of the charcters , including the main character get any sort of development or a bit more background and details.This bugged me the most. They really could have worked more on the story,- Really short. Done in 2 hours. It does keep it from getting tedious , and it does build anticipation for the next part. But still way too short.- Really simple puzzles , game mostly involves walking around. Not a lot of thinking going on with this game. It keeps it from getting annoying , but it's too damn easy.All in all it's a nice effort . Got 1-3 on sale , and it was worth it. Decent game.			"

												Doorways Prelude is a great attempt of a horror game, but with some issues.Pros:-Interesting concept.-Very graphic with its content, it doesn't hold anything back.-Some parts are truly terrifying.-The story, while not great, is interesting for what it is.-The performance is alright.-The voice actor is great.-Some of the puzzles were really fun.Cons:-The visuals look like a 2004 game.-The music can get repetitive at times.-The atmosphere is sometimes not the best.-The player moves way too slow.-Some of the puzzles feel a little unfair.-It's way too dark. I had to max my brightness and squint my eyes during some segments.-The camera is a little awkward and the controls slightly unresponsive.I overall recommend this game for 3-4 bucks.

												Bought the whole Doorways collection as a bundle.While I didn't expect that much from the first two chapters (Prelude), I must say I was honestly surprised.Sure, the gfx are a bit dated, but they did the trick.It was an eerie fun experience with a little diversity in the type puzzles and a macabre background story including some very disturbing visuals. Loved it.Had to adjust the darkness a little though. Even with all lights out, it was just a bit too much by default. Luckely there's an option for that in the menus.One minor issue. The game doesn't seem to like my HOTAS. Had to unplug it in order to regain normal keyboard control. Best played with keyboard and mouse anyway (imo).			"

I completed chapter 1 with keyboard/mouse then moved to 360 controller to try it out at start of chapter 2 and continued with that so  could play on my TV for a bigger screen.Graphics are very nice and create a creepy look and feel for the game. The sound does a great job of providing a very atmospheric and scary gaming experience. I hope further chapters appear soon as I really enjoyed the game.If you liked the Amnesia games or Outlast then you will totally enjoy this, great price too.			"

												This game is pretty unique in itself.  First of all the game does get better as you go along.  The starting ""forrest"" area you go through is the worst and it seems like the developer learned more about how to make good levels as they went along.  It was very atmospheric and creepy at times.  This game is great for people that are either just getting into or not used to horror games as it's more about the atmosphere and not the running and hiding as other horror games have.  It's not perfect but I would definitely recommend.			"

												I played around an hour in a couple chunks. So far I rather like it. Most of the complaints are that it is too dark. And it is. I don’t necessarily say it’s TOO dark with the in-game brightness settings maxed, but it’s awfully dark. Like, 60% black. You can get a torch but it only stays lit for about 10 seconds before it fizzles and you have to find another sconce to reignite it. Most of the time I didn’t bother with the torch though. Just like in real life, it kind of blinds my dark vision, because the idiot character holds it out in front of him.So the game is horror, obviously, and it’s predicated on darkness and atmospheric noise mixed with creepy stuff like cages and spikes and a big huge pendulum blade (not moving unfortunately). And there is an occasional flashback where you see a bunch of people on spikes or a bunch of women burning at the stake or whathaveyou. The story centers on you are a detective searching out to stop some serial killers. The first chapter you are after some Professor. Story is revealed through notes you find on the ground that are narrated (well, I might add, if a little over dramatic). The thing I like about it is that the scary/spookiness is left up to atmosphere and creepiness and not jump scares like freaking Outlast. I REALLY liked outlast but I HATE HATE HATE jump scares. I got jump scared once in this so far and not really in the same way (screen just suddenly flashed red and showed some people hanging from a tree in the distance and a little bit of a scream).So far I have only sort of encountered a couple baddies, and they literally stand in one place. If you approach them, you “die” but really they are just creepy obstacles that make you go a different route. They are creepy though.Game has a fair bit of platform gameplay. In one area you walk on narrow planks to cross what appears to be a bridge. Later on you have to get past spike mazes and if you jump on the wrong spot you die. They aren’t hard though, I didn’t mind them. Occasionally it’s difficult to figure out where to go, especially with the darkness, but not usually too bad. Otherwise level design is pretty simple and straightforward. Occasionally you have to backtrack, which is annoying. Basically you come to a big locked door and you have to go down the side halls to hit a switch and then back to the big door. They aren’t too far though. So far, I recommend it! "

												Strictly my opinion - -Story ain't even scary and in many points on the game, the pure darkness and running out of torchlight poses more of a hassle than genuinely trying to create a scare. - There is real ""demons"" that appear, but don't even scare me the slightest.- If you wan't to spend some money getting a scare, this isn't the game. Buy the game, Outlast, that's a real scare game, loved it from beginning to ending and for a few bucks more.My rating:Doorways 2/10 (I'd give it zero but then all of you won't take me seriously)Outlast: 10/10This game is stupid. Narration in the game ruins it for me, annoying voice too.			"

												I was first turned on to Doorways over at Rock Paper Shotgun with the original Early Access trailer.  I'm really finicky about what Early Access stuff I do go in on and while the trailer with all of the static, agonized human statues piqued my interest, I opted to let the game sit on my wishlist until it was out of EA and on sale.  I finally got around to this bundle this past October, since like most Steam indies, it ended up in a never ending back log of shame and excitement (shamecitement?).The first chapter featured some basic puzzles and fleeting jump scares, though the style of the models bordered somewhere between an amateur aesthetic and illustrator intent aiming for a ""not quite real"" art style.  It wasn't distracting, though it did harken back to the late 90's/early 00's, and I'd be lieing if I didn't feel a little nostalgic going back to a world with that level of fidelity.The second chapter was a marked improvement, and I ended up appreciating its Amnesia-esque, crumbling castle setting much more.  I felt like I could feel the developers improving in their ability to build a functional, good looking product as I progressed through the plot.  The game never really felt horrifying, but there was something about the enemies in Chapter 2 that was really unsettling.  I'm not sure if it was uncanny valley rearing its not-quite-ugly-enough head, but it added the hint of creepiness the game needed to establish the atmosphere the developers seemed to be aiming for.  The puzzles were also a little more involved, reminding me of Penumbra and older point-and-click adventures from way back.  Though the game ended abruptly, I have Chapter 3 waiting in my backlog and as of this writing I hear Chapter 4 is in Early Access, so I'm curious to see where the series goes from here.Other stand out features from this game include the narrations provided by Amnesia alumni, Sam A. Mowry.  Before looking up the voice actor, I was convinced the voice was somehow modified or synthesized.  The delivery is ominous and is almost too powerful, making the main character feel like something more paranormal than a regular dude.  The plot was also a tad confusing, as the opening exposition makes it seem like you're some sort of detective, though as the story progresses it seems like something more is going on the player hasn't been made fully aware of.  I wouldn't drop dough on this if you're expecting a solid horror game, but for the right price it's a nice novelty that excels at showing a development team grow and improve at their craft.			"

												One of the worst games I've ever played. Shoddy is the simplest way to describe this game, and bored is the simplest way to describe how I felt playing it. Pay the extra 10$ for Outlast. From the poor graphics and animations (seriously there is no death animation, the screen just says game over.) to the lack of a coherent narrative or path to travel, to the illogical puzzles that have no context within the game, I have never been more dissapointed with a 10$ purchase. You're better off going to Wendys paying for 10$s worth of food and then having chronic diarrhea for an evening, that would be more worth your while than Doorways.			"

												The only positive I can give it is ""slightly creepy atmosphere"". I'm being generous with a 2/10, because I found I could play it even though it made me not want to.The list of problems: relies on darkness way too much to create ""challenge"" (i.e. blundering about) and to scare. The actual scares are either laughably easily avoided or are merely a ""don't go in the darkness."" First person perspective, but plenty of platforming. Darkness abounds but you're meant to find clues. Environments that are confusing primarily because the are so repetitive/uninteresting.The biggest challenges usually consist of ""did I go the right way, since it was so damn dark and everything looks the same"" and ""can I jump well without seeing my feet?""A definite pass, in my opinion.

												***Given that Chapters 3 & 4 have yet to be released, this review is subject to change in the future.*** The Good - Doorways is unsettling. It has an excellent atmosphere, soundtrack, and the voice acting (for the most part) is well done and fits the mood of the game. The graphics themselves are not terrible, the textures leave something to be desired but it all goes into the atmosphere and really blends. The Bad - Firstly, this game is too dark; Its not uncommon to get turned around and completely lose sense of direction because you can't see further than 8ft in front of you. Secondly, the story (as such far) doesn't make a lick of sense. I won't into spoilers but, the first chapter ends abruptly with little to no closure and story continous onto the next psychopath. The narrative constantly flip-flops on whether or not these events are all psychological or physically present. Thridly, the puzzles in the game are far too easy, they can be compared with puzzles from the Uncharted series as they practically show you the solution, you just have to do it. And lastly, its too short; It only takes about an hour to go through the whole thing on a first playthrough, subsequent playthroughs are almost twice as fast.OVERALL - As of this moment, I do not recommend it. For the amount of time it takes to beat it, coupled with the ridiculously bad storytelling; Doorways is an extremely forgettable title. **This review is likely to change once the final two chapters are released. However, it's been nearly six months since Chapters 1 & 2 released, and Saibot Studios hasn't even hinted at giving a release date. Doorways looks to be dead in the water.			"

												Not perfect but good enough. Decent visuals, dense atmosphere, balanced difficulty and some interesting puzzle ideas - these are the reasons I had a pretty good time with the game.However, there are some downsides. The game relies on darkness too much. I know what they intended to do but sometimes you can hardly see anything and it's too easy to get lost. And one of the symbol puzzles is so dark it's impossible to see the symbols so you have to rely on guessing.Also, I managed to get stuck twice in a place with no option to jump out. And the final boss was bugged the first time I've met him - he attacked me right away, giving me no chance to hide. Thankfully restarting the game helped. Otherwise, the game is stable.			"

												The game has a very involving atmosphere, especially in the beginning, where the player has to go through a claustrophobic network of caves.It's simple, but in a good way and the storyline, although not innovative it's, nonetheless, interesting.It's a very short game. You can finish it in a couple of hours but if you can buy the game for under €2, like I did, it is definitely worth the money.Also the game does not work with Ubuntu 13.10. As soon as the game starts it stops responding to the mouse and keyboard. "

												Doorways is a horror game based on exploration where you have to visit different areas and solve puzzles to move on.It's okay in that respect and certainly offers a creepy atmosphere, but anyone looking for a really scary game will be disappointed. There might be a handful of jump-scares spread across 1 1/2 hours and that's about it.			"

												Very 'meh' game. It honestly feels like an unfinished demo rather than a proper game. I finished the first chapter and I never really felt the urge to play the second one. The atmosphere and the voice acting were good, but the game just felt empty. The 'scary' parts were very few and not that scary, anyway.On top of it all, I remember when I bought it we were promised more episodes. They were never released.I would not recommend it for its price, definitely not worth it. Maybe if you can manage to grab it at a very cheap price during sales, otherwise it's no-no.			"

												I tried very hard to like this game but I'm unable.  The controls are arocious (at least using the keyboard & mouse).  The game itself feels like a high school term assignment.  Admittedly I don't have alot of time ingame however I can't continue any further.  The graphics are dated and unimpressive.  I had uninstalled and reinstalled this twice.  I won't be installing it again.  I keep hoping for a major update but nothing so far and with the next 'chapter' being worked on, it's unlikely.This game has been making the rounds in all the indie bundles on the internet lately and I can see why.  I usually grab anything that's ready for Oculus and I'm a  big fan of this genre but even with the VR support I cannot reccomend this title in it's current iteration.			"

												This game overall is pretty bad honestly. It was only 1 hour long to beat the first 2 chapters. The game only had one part that actually I can consider scary and it was more or less just a jump scare. The story makes 0 sense and it's boring. The puzzles were extremely easy to figure out since the game points you where to go and stops you from backtracking. This game is really not worth playing/buying.			"

												This game relies way too much on darkness to make its puzzles way more difficult than they need to be. But I sometimes enjoy that. This might not be the best horror game, but I had fun with it. I had to turn my brightness up to max to play half of it, but that doesn't bother me. I thought the story-line was interesting, the controls however are a little frustrating at times, to be honest, I had an easier time playing with a keyboard than a game-pad, and that doesn't happen often.

												Doorways is a first person episodic horror game. Only the first two chapters have been released so far.The story is about a private investigator tasked with seeking out a group of suspected murderers. These killers have names like “The Professor” and “The Sculptor”,  but the attempt to tie the world thematically to their respective case files feels dissatisfying. Unlike most episodic games, the ""chapters"" here are woven together without obvious narrative breaks and at this point it is just not clear what exactly you are supposed to achieve besides uncovering the truth about these murderers.The gameplay is simple, you move through dark forest and the dark castle corridors, avoiding a few traps and collecting various objects so that you might in turn pull levers and activate switches.This game is not scary at all. The puzzles are too easy and the story is not interesting.The graphics are not worth to mention.The voice acting and sound is good but not more.The game does not deserve the title ""Horror game"" it is boring and can not deliver a good horror atmosphere. It is more a jump & run in the dark. Mostly you have to jump from one platform to another or you have to jump over traps.The biggest scare of Doorways is that there will be more episodes like this one and you will have to pay for it. You should better take a look at the Amnesia series or Outlast. Also you can check out the free game Cry of Fear. Doorways is not worth to play, especially not to pay for it.Sounds 5/10Graphics 2/10Gameplay 3/10Atmosphere 2/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												There sure are alot of doorways in this game, maybe there will be a lights DLC added because this game is so dark like the screenshots 80% of the game is pitch black.  Seems like there is some kind of fog or something over the screen as a filter making it more difficult to see.  Makes me want to clean my screen  which doesnt help  make the game playable.  This game may be good but designers like this lose sight of the gfact that to play a game we kinda need to see the game.  This game uses Oculus Rift, giving the whole game a fisheye look, I guess that is what Oculus people like to play games as a fish in the dark?  Being innovative in design doesnt mean they should make games so dark their unplayable, maybe they made it so dark to hide how bad it is so people would just turn it off and uninstall it like I did.  For those who would like to see how NOT to make a game, be sure to play this game, also the controls using a controller make no sense really, they seem made up by a madman choosing random features to put on random buttons.  For some reason the bumpers move things back and forth like penumbra which is odd as if the character is so weak they cant lift anything, so like Penumbra you go around nudging everything, maybe the main character should be called the Nudger, a new type of super hero who goes around nudging things.Rating:  0/10  Value:  $0.00			"

												Short but sweet opening to a 4-chapter first person horror game in the vein of Amnesia: The Dark Descent, which was the hell spawn that popularized the PC independent horror FPS side of things.It's actually pretty damn good looking, with a very tense atmosphere and some easy puzzles to go along, nothing too complicated. The controls, as per usual with this kind of games using Unity Engine, feel a bit clunky and extra problems come from the engine itself, which can be a resource hog when using dynamic lights and other effects.I have no complaints, the game is around 3 hours long, you can 100% easily (something I love given how little time I have to play) but it suffered from Steam opening the floodgates and, of course, the really poor decision of separating the chapters into further releases instead of integrating them to the base game. However, still hope they can eventually finish the last chapter!Give it a try if you got it during discount season, which was my case and I'm sure many others. For those who paid full price... yep, I can understand their fury as this is not an arcade game you can replay for hours and hours.tl;dr: recommended, but newcomers or people with doubts, wait for the discount seasons just in case.

												This is definitely a good horror game. It has good atmosphere and antagonists which will make you cower in fear and want to hide in a corner. The difficulty is not overwhelmingly ridiculous, while not being too easy. It will keep you on your toes and perhaps make you cry a bit.One of the things I really liked was the huge variety of gameplay environments. You go through dark forests, a castle, and more.Some other reviewers complained about it being too dark. I'm guessing most of them didn't go into the game's video settings, where the brightness can be turned up (it's set to minimum by default). I never had a problem with it being too dark.The only thing I did not like about this game was its inventory mechanics. At times, you need to hurry and grab something out of your inventory (and I mean, really quickly), but it takes a good few seconds to pull up the inventory and take something out. That's just enough time for one of the antagonists to murder you.Overall, though, I strongly recommend this game.			"

												The plot would actually be good (which seems to be a recurring characteristic for a lot of horror games) if it was executed properly. But Doorways does nothing with it's idea. It uses it to make you appear in places which are spooky and dark, not to actually make something memorable.So, ""Doorways is an episodic first person horror adventure, featuring a complex story and deep atmosphere."" It's first person and episodic, but has no deepness or complexity to it. It's as simple as a rock. It looks fine in my opinion, at least it makes a good atmosphere and I thought one of the puzzles was rather cool. Unfortunately they overdid the darkness. You can't see♥♥♥♥♥♥ and I played on max. brightness. It's just a generic, boring ""horror"" game which wants to be more than what it is. Devs, I don't want to collect crap, I want to experience something with more personality and depth. Not♥♥♥♥♥♥talking anybody who wants to actually collect notes and statues, but a game can do both at the same time, so that people looking for ""complex story"" and ""deep atmosphere"" actually get it.

This game focuses more on atmospheric fear than jumpscares, although they are present. There were many times where M'aiq had to gather up his courage (and maybe a bit of skooma) before going into a room that obviously did not have Khajiit's best interests in mind.Do not play with friends, you will not enjoy the fear as much as you can by playing alone. Play by yourself, play in the dark, and play play play. M'aiq will wait.M'aiq highly recommends this game to anybody looking for more than a few jump scares.			"

												Awesome game its amazing with oculus rift, easily best ive seen on my oculus. Super scary almost too scary lol. But very immersive indie game. You guys should make a demo for people with oculus rifts, I think it could add more scales. The only thing is I play with xbox controller and the right analog stick for turning your head is way to slow and head movement could be a bit better and move further too, but thats small complaint to how well this is done. And maybe 3-5 sec longer for the scare scenes to really look at them in 3d and really see it. BUt thats nitpicking.			"

												starts out slow...gets better and better...though provoking...good puzzles...gotta think! The plot is good and the game gets more difficult as it progresses.  If your hand/eye coordination isn't up to par, don't bother with this one. You need the best of both to get through some of the mazes unscathed! My only con is that it ended rather abruptly...leaving me wanting more or maybe that is the way it was designed...Can't wait for parts 3-4. Pleeze hurry them along. "

												It has its own ambience though the game does seem a little short. I liked the puzzles and the mechanics in it seem good for the oculus. With the oculus this game would be amazing. The plot is thin but for what seems on of the few first offerings from this dev house the game is well-built. I didn't have any problem running it and the game was very smooth. The engine seems decent in it.			"

												An absolutely terrible 'horror' game. Cheap jump scares and a torch that literally lasts less than 10 seconds at a time make this game simply annoying and not scary in the slightest. Add in deceptive marketing tactics by the developer stating that future episodes would be free and you've got yourself quite a disappointment here. To be honest, the game is so bad I didn't even get through the first episode, so I don't care about getting the rest... but still, there's something to be said about lying to your customer base.			"

												Doorways is meant to be played in VR. I didn't know this before buying the game. If you play it on a PC with a regular monitor you'll probably be disappointed. You'll get about 2 hours worth of game-play, and compared to other horror games out there, this one just isn't really that fun. It's probably pretty cool with VR but I should have been given a disclaimer that it's meant for VR and not PC.Get Amnesia, Outlast, or the Penumbra series instead.			"

IntroDoorways is a first person survival horror game Developed and Published by Saibot Studios for PC, Linux and Mac.This review includes both Chapter 1 and 2.StoryThe player plays as a character called Thomas Foster, which I had to find out directly by the developer because I didn’t realise if I missed this information or it wasn’t actually in the game.The story consists of Thomas collecting documents of top secret information about what looks to be several psychotic prisoners however you are place in some kind of dream world which is the same across both chapters 1 and 2.So far it is unclear as to what this world is or why you of all people are trying to find answers.GraphicsDoorways doesn’t look overly impressive but it doesn’t look horrible either which for an indie game is completely acceptable. GameplayThe gameplay for Doorways consists of a few basic mechanics such as jump, drag and push items but the main focus is on the puzzles. I found myself replaying several sections in both chapter 1 and 2 simply because I had no idea what I was doing. Due to the nature of the game having little to no hints as to what the player is supposed to do next is something that I respect because if I knew were all the items were or knew exactly what I was doing then that would have taken the fun away drastically.Chapter 1 didn’t have any boss fights but chapter 2 had several, well there was one sequence were you have to dodge the statues with spears. That was an amazing section in my eyes.I can respect Saibot for choosing not to overdo it with the jump scares but when they did do the jump scares were somewhat lacking.Sound DesignWere Doorways might lack in horror elements I think Saibot really stepped up with their sound design which led to an amazing atmosphere to the game. Some sections the sound would constantly loop the same song which would get quite annoying.The VerdictAlthough Doorways is listed as a Survival horror game by the developer, yet there are no survival elements to the game whatsoever. It is unclear as to where this idea came from or the genre choice might be a misinterpretation of what the survival horror genre actually is.Doorways certainly surprised me with great environments, environment progression, and puzzle complexity. With chapter 2 completely changing the gameplay was a very impressive thing to do. During the ending section of chapter 1 the jumpscare/screamer thing was sort of pointless as I thought it would jump out and chase me or at least fly towards my screen then disappear which it didn’t. The second time around with the same scare looked rise and repeated which took away what little horror elements the game had. In terms of horror this game would be quite poor however the game provided a scare when there needed to be or made the playing feel powerless during chapter 2 which lifted my hopes for chapter 3 and 4. So hopefully Saibot Studios can out do themselves with the final chapters and answer some of the questions I have with the game.Doorways chapter 1 and 2 gets a 6/10 "

												Categorized it first under ""Horror"" but moved it to ""Adventure"" after the first Chapter (and I might move it to ""meh..."" as soon as I find the energy to finish it)The narrator introduces you as a detective, who is trying to find 4 serial killers/psychopaths/very bad persons. You do this by walking, jumping, pushing&pulling (which I only saw in the tutorial, I think) activating switches/buttons and simple ""find Item A and put it somewhere else""The graphics are sub par. The light/darkness-ratio is okay on my machine. You can balance the gamma with two bars in the option screen, but everything looks still grayish-dark or muddy-dark after that. Nothing really stands out and catches your eye, so I just waltzed through everything being bored. The blandness of the textures would maybe go unnoticed, if the environment had more details (empty shelfes, empty walls, empty floores, empty.. well, pretty much everything looks lifeless/without detail). The best example would be the basement with torture rooms you visit at the end of chapter 1. There is not a single sign of them ever being used. No blood, no body parts, no decaying corpses. It's just sterile (in a run down kinda way) with to much wasted floor space.The ambient sound loops pretty soon, maybe after 30 seconds, I didn't really time it. It certainly doesnt add the atmosphere, as it doesn't build any tension. The narrator helps in getting you interested, as at least here you may feel a little more tension here, though the texts are very generic and bland. Horror/Gore/jump scares and scary story wise this game is a 1 out of 10. Same goes for the story. I just noticed now, that although your character says, that he is a cop, you never really feel that way. He could be a plumber or scientist and it would still just be a label to him, seeing that you never really have any kind of character growth or further characterization with him.On the plus side: You get cards, achievments and maybe better content in the later chapters. 3&4 are still in development and hopefully the team learned from past mistakes.

												I am a big horror fan, so im very picky about games. Its not easy to satisfy me and after playing games like penumbra or amnesia, something like DORRWAYS cant even match with em right? Well not really. Dont get me wrong the game isnt as awsome, yet it has some features that penumbra or other classics are missing.pros:-The atmophere is great, aswell as the soundtrack is quite fitting- Confuses the player about whats going on, yet its a ""good"" kind of confusion, one that fits the genre- Enjoyable story, that makes you feel like a jackass hunting down psychopaths and stuff, yet at the same time makes you feel unsafe. This feature exposes your trueself and makes you see the diffrence between ""who you are"" and ""who you claim to be"" in REAL LIFE- Awsome and detailed graphic for mostcons:- Some graphics are dull and repetitive. It reminds me of SCP: containment breach- Mechanics are not as elaborate as amnesia or penumbra. I know this isnt really a con, but if you happened to play any other game that allows more interaction with objects than DOORWAYS does, you will notice a major downfall and you may feel like the controls are stiff.- You may also consider that all psychopath stuff is ripped of from OUTLAST. Even thou I havent played that game yet I have to agree yet I think DOORWAYS takes another perspective in this thread. Call this a pro or con depends on an individual ;)Summing up I recommend this game. I find it enjoyable and worth its price :)			"

												Lovely! I think this game in unique insofar as it relies on atmosphere rather than specific danger to evoke its scares. I rather like that there isn't so much of a self-defense mechanism as there is a 'don't eff up or we'll punish you' mentality behind it. I have to say I definitely jumped more than once. The first chapter was my favorite, but I loved both, and I'm incredibly excited for what's to come. The settings are lovely and completely immersive. I can't wait to play it on the occulus rift. Great job!			"

												I'm not sure if i can recommend this game or not. The game itself is realy great if i rate the athmosphere.To the graphic or optic i can say it is good or better said functional. Now the only and biggest problem i have with this game, is the playtime.I mean i often failed at these jump or avoiding parts and had to redo the passage, but i played through both chapters in around 2,5 hours.I have to admit that i didn't find all relics (bonus items) or made all achievments for the game,but that shouldn't increase the gametime so far that you can say it was worth the money.My rating for the game is a 7 out of 10. So i put a possitive rating. Since i enjoyed to playing the game.Decide for yourself if you want to pay that price for a short but good game.			"

												tl;dr get it on sale if you're looking for a simple atmospheric adventure game.First and foremost, it's not Amnesia or anything like it. This game plays more like a simple adventure game that is using a very horror atmosphere. It fails to bring the horror and scary to you, as the player, because there is never really any danger or threat. And the puzzles are not **really** difficult either, I managed most of them without really trying.What this game does offer is interesting visuals and (to some, I think) an interesting story, though it's a little too cliché horror for me. I'll go on a limb here and say this game plays for as a visual novel with gameplay elements than anything else.While I think it's definitly not a bad game I do think the current price (€8,99 as of writing) is definitly not worth the 3 hours (100% complete) of gameplay it's going to get you.So get it on sale (be sure to check out the humble store, it gets even cheaper there) or when it's in a bundle (been in quite some I believe).

I'll go on a limb here and say this game plays for as a visual novel with gameplay elements than anything else.While I think it's definitly not a bad game I do think the current price (€8,99 as of writing) is definitly not worth the 3 hours (100% complete) of gameplay it's going to get you.So get it on sale (be sure to check out the humble store, it gets even cheaper there) or when it's in a bundle (been in quite some I believe).

												5/10Is it just me or does the main character/narrator guy sound like the narrator from the anime berserk? i love that. As a person who loves horror type games i found this pretty decent. its far from great. but the game itself plays well and isnt glitchy or broken in parts, which seem to be a problem that plagues most horror games on steam. To be honest this game is less horror and more mystery/walking simulator/puzzle esc. There are no Monsters except for enviromental traps, although one type of monster(if you can call it that) did show up and it did manage to give me the chills.The Pros:- Writing: This game is very well written with the notes you find, along with the narration, which the voice actor does a damn good job. - Gameplay: The game plays fine, its not spectacular, but compared to most horror games I've played through steam, just to have a horror game that functions as intented is a plus. - Torture chamber devices, - some of the torture devices you encounter were pretty original which i found entertaining. +- The Cons:- Boring : This game is boring, there are no enemies, the ones you encounter are part of the enviroment, except for one, and that part only lasts 30 seconds.- The Lighting: This game is stupidly dark most of the time. I know dark enviroments are a plus, and in this game there are parts where you need to constantly light a torch to get through areas or you'll die. But some areas in general were just WAAAYYY to dark to even see what i was doing, which were during certain platform-esc sections , i basically had to have all ights off in the room and squinting at my TV just to see what the heck i was doing- Music: It seems to loop alot, gets kinda annoying and repetitive. Overall I found this game ok as a Horror experience, i see many people feel differently about the Horror aspect, and they are entitled to their opinions. I found the game creepy throughout and had a cupple scary parts, but dont espect quality like Outlast or Alien Isolation. I know this game is on sale now for a cupple bucks and if you were thinking of picking this up at any time now would be perfect.			"

												If your looking for a horror title, in my opinion, keep looking.Doorways: Chapter 1 & 2 is a fun game with great atmosphere and some good puzzles but just not scary. I also thought the tutorial was a bit long. If you find this game on sale snatch it up but with only about 2 1/2 hours of gameplay, lack of scares, and some glitchy moments, this game is just not worth the original price. (Also the next chapters must be paid for)Overall rating : 5/10			"

												Not good enough to keep me going. I stopped early in chapter 1 and uninstalled.The first hour or two of the game consist of trudging through an unexplained strange terrain, with ""spooky"" music and sound effects, while occasionally picking up extremely vague and disjointed notes that appear to have no connection at all. Deadly ghosts may appear, apparently only to serve as a very startling ""try again"". The only ""challenges"" consisted of dragging something in order to jump from it, a ""move between checkpoints before your torch is extinguished"" puzzle (otherwise something goes ""boo"" and kills you), and very simple ""jumping over a chasm"" puzzles. There is no explanation of who you are, why you are there, why you are seeing ghosts and hearing spooky noises. Basically, the first hour is walking in a straight line while things go ""boo"" at you, which after the initial heart-pounding is just plain annoying. The only challenge is to endure this linearity while things try to startle you.Now, compare this to other games.In Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you don't know who you are or where you are *as part of the plot* and that is made *immediately* known to you. Which is an awesome hook. Also the puzzles are rather clever, progress is often not linear, and you actually have some action - albeit you can only run & hide rather than any fighting. But, hiding someplace dark with your head down while *something* seems to be shuffling its (feet? tentacles? body?) outside provides a true atmosphere of genuine horror. Being startled is a less-used aspect of the game, whereas finding tinder for your lamp so your character doesn't go insane from the horror of being in the dark too long is much more satisfying and works a whole lot better. If you want a real ""horror"" experience, that's the one for you.In Deadspace, they rely on startling you quite a bit, so if that's what you like, head on there. But, over there you know who you are and why you're there, and while some aspects of what occurred where you are remain unknown for a good while, hints are everywhere and it's very clear the place had a clear function that has turned into a horror scene. While the ultimate causes remain mysterious, the actual occurrences are not and are merely a sign of how screwed up an otherwise ordinary place has become. So again that works much better. Also, you get to actually fight whatever jumps at you rather than a bland ""try again"", and other action (e.g. zero gravity, zero pressure environments) is very fun and very satisfying.Now, you may think I just have a short attention span, and maybe I do and this game deserves a more thorough examination - but I don't think so. Both of the games I mentioned gave me much more entertainment in the first 5 minutes than this was able to deliver in an hour. There I cared about the characters, here I suddenly realized that I don't give a damn what happens to this nameless character with no motivation in a place we don't know how or why the character got to and no attempt is made to explore this or even acknowledge it.Bottom line: Not worth your time.

												There are three things that this game attempts to do: psycologically disturb you, scare you, and challenge you.It fails at all three.This game didn't cause me to yell at all.  At the first forced jump scare, I let out a ""woah.""  After that, I anticipated everything to where nothing phased me whatsoever.  If you are scared by this game, then you're a ♥♥♥♥♥♥.  All the attempted scares are soley FORCED jump scares, and for someone who is slowly becoming a horror game connaisseur, it's really pathetic.The ambient sound is absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥in this game.  Everywhere you go, you hear sounds that makes it feel like something is imminently behind you, however, after  looking back about three times, the sound just continues, and it becomes stupidly annoying throughout the rest of the game.There was maybe one puzzle that was actually challenging, and it really wasn't even a puzzle-- you just literally try to make it from point A to point B without getting to close to certain statues.I give this game a 28/100.  Luckily, I didn't spend money on this game.			"

												Horror game based mainly around exploring/solving puzzles. Said puzzles are generally pretty aight. Not like, Penumbra-tier good, but they're not bad either. There aren't any Amnesia-style monsters, but there are parts where you have to avoid traps and such, and they're generally well executed. Does a great job at setting up the atmosphere, and doesn't use cheap jump scares. Not very long, but it's meant to be played alongside Chapter 3 and the now-in-early-access Chapter 4.Edit: In hindsight I'm actually finding that 5-ish hours is pretty standard for this genre. So, props to this game for not being as short as I thought it was?			"

												Doorways is an experience that has a fair amount of promise, but falls flat on delivering on that promise repeatedly. My most immediate problem with that promise is that it barely explains why you're in the strange places you explore, if at all, and I actually had to look up after the fact that you're somehow in the psyches of serial killers and other less than nice people.The lighting, on the whole, is an absolute disaster, especially in the first chapter. It's one thing to leave players wondering what might be lurking in the dark, and another entirely to leave them wondering where the hell they are or where they're going. A lot of the puzzles felt unnecessarily tedious and/or convoluted, if not unfair in regards to their fail states, and a lot of trial and error came into not getting completely screwed over.There were some interesting bits scattered throughout, and I loved the atmosphere of the temple and statues setting in the second chapter, but between the game's player unfriendliness and threadbare storytelling, there's just not enough meat on the bones of Doorways to warrant playing it for most people. I'll probably end up working through all the chapters as they release, but I'm also kind of a masochist, and I stream this stuff for entertainment value more than my own well-being.Unless you've got a few bucks to spare on a laugh and a couple of neat things, I'd say pass on this.

												As a fan of survival horror games, I wouldn't actually label this in that genre. It's very much a search & find puzzle game with a dark atmosphere and interesting story. I can get behind it having the same actor as the guy from Amnesia. Nice touch. There are some ""monster"" mechanics in reference to the ghost & the statues but they're very limited and not much in the way of an actual threat. The puzzles are fairly simplistic and quick to get through with a bit of common sense ( & brightness ). Speaking of which, my only real complaint is that the game is too damn dark. I understand what it's going for. Dark, foreboding and spoopy, that's great. But a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥when it comes to puzzles, especially the memory game during the castle run. I had to take several shots in the ""dark"" ( pun intended ) before actually reaching my goal.I'd honestly wait until these games are on sale in order to buy and play them just like I did around the Steam Christmas Sale. It's worth giving a try at the very least but not for 9.99 ( but that's just me being a cheapskate ) Might not be everyone's cup of tea but it kept me entertained enough to continue onto ""The Underworld"".
