												DuckTales! Woo-oo!The immortal classics have returned - with exactly the same gaming experience covered in perfectly remade visuals. Nothing less, nothing more. And if you feel like missing those good ol' times, this one would definitely do the trick.			"

												I’m downvoting this game with extreme prejudice because it has a crash bug which has been left unaddressed for over a year: players who have Nvidia cards with up-to-date drivers will find that the game will always freeze on the final boss. It seems that some recent version of Nvidia drivers broke some graphic effects in late-game cutscenes. Unfortunately, the rights to this game are a royal cluster of bureaucracy between Disney, CAPCOM, and WayForward, and nobody seems interested in addressing the issue, or even acknowledging that this game exists anymore. Basically, if you don’t have access to a PC without an Nvidia card, do not buy this game, as you will not be able to finish it without skipping specific cutscenes and using weird workarounds.Aside from that unforgivable issue, the game is okay. It is a decent remix of the original DuckTales NES game, and is sure to bring waves of nostalgia to anyone who has fond memories of it. For the unfamiliar, DuckTales is a barebones, unremarkable platformer where the main gimmick is that you can bounce around on a pogo stick which can break bricks, defeat enemies, and cross dangerous terrain – think of Shovel Knight’s down-stab attack, but one that works nearly anywhere and not just on top of enemies. But the game is certainly is a “remix” and very much not the same game as it used to be. Imagine the differences between Super Mario Bros. 3 and New Super Mario Bros, and you'll get a decent idea of how this game has been updated. Differences include:- Save points! Unlike the NES game, you can save your game between levels and come back later (unless you’re an achievement hunter playing Extreme difficulty, in which case you’ll have to beat the whole game in one sitting anyway… sorry!).- Greatly improved controls which make it much easier to master the pogo stick.- Large changes in level design which make them easier, but the addition of more fetch quests make them longer.- Bosses are harder and longer with the addition of long unskippable invulnerability periods.- Some plot events have been removed, such as the Transylvania detour in the mines level, and the paywall in the Amazon level.- Money collected in-game is more than just score, and can be spent on gallery unlocks.The new sprite animations are absolutely adorable, and the soundtrack by Jake Kaufman (composer for Shovel Knight and the Shantae series) is just epic – the soundtrack alone is, in my opinion, worth more than the price of the game.  But it seems that this game’s main draw is its storytelling and voice acting – several of the voice actors from the DuckTales TV show have returned to voice the characters, and the levels play out like an episode of the show with numerous cutscenes. This is where the game somewhat fell flat to me. Although the scripted cutscenes obviously had a lot of heart put into them, I found them mostly annoying, pointless, and not nearly as funny or clever as the show they try so hard to pay tribute to. After seeing each cutscene once, I saw no reason not to just slam on the “skip cinematic” button on all subsequent playthroughs, and that makes me a bit sad, because I feel like that’s where most of the charm of this remake is supposed to be coming from. Final verdict: don’t buy, because we PC gamers need to put pressure and accountability on the corporate red tape which prevents developers from supporting the games they make. Talk with your wallet, as they say, because that’s the only way they’ll listen. Leaving a reproducible crash bug that prevents the game from being completed, especially near the end of the game when refunds aren’t available anymore, is simply unacceptable for everyone involved.But if you want to ignore me and buy the game anyway, keep in mind that this is a game meant to be played with nostalgia goggles firmly glued to your face. If you’re a huge fan of the original NES game, then you’ll probably love this from beginning to end. But if you’ve never played DuckTales before, you might find the level design to be a bit empty, tedious, and pointless – you’d probably get more overall joy out of Shovel Knight. It’s not a terrible game by any means, but if you're a newcomer to the game then it probably won't blow you away.			"

												DuckTales: Remastered is a remastering of the original DuckTales game with the original cast and voice actors. I played this game for 7 hours, and found it to be incredibly, incredibly difficult.First, I'll briefly talk about the game itself. I played on a controller and the controls were tight and responsive, easy to use and very fun. The game was bright, colourful and looks beautiful, they've done a great job remastering the scenes and levels. The gameplay is very classic and enjoyable, and the story whimsical and fun.Next, and just for a moment, I'll talk about the voice actors. One of the big draws of the game is that the original audio has been remastered by re-recording using the original cast of the original DuckTales game. This, at times, is pretty cool! But, after a while, I felt that the voice of Scrooge McDuck to just be a little ""too old"". Like, I know that sounds mean, but some of the lines seemed very strained and some incomprehensible without subtitles. While awesome to have the original voice actor back, I feel this drained a little of the vibrant colour from the game, for me.And now, I'll discuss the difficulty of the game. My god this game is hard. Of the 7 hours I played, at least 3-4 were spent on the last level. The game uses a Lives system which, if you run out of, it's game over. Start again. Not the game, but the level.The final level of the game takes about 20+ minutes to complete. If you run out of lives, on the final bossfight, you have to re-do the entire level again. I have never been so frustrated by something that I felt, while playing, should be so easy. Many controller slams were had. But, in a good way. In an I WILL COMPLETE THIS I SWEAR TO GOD way, which so many games wish they could achieve in this day and age. If you're up to a challenge, this is the game for you. Trust me.Oh, did I mention I completed it on Normal mode? Yeah. There's a Hard Mode too. I couldn't even imagine completing Hard Mode.Oh, and after Hard Mode, there's Extreme Mode.Highly recommended for gamers who like a challenge.Nilesy			"

												I'm almost 30 years old and I'm not ashamed to admit I absolutely love this game, I grew up with the original on ""NES"" and this remake was faithfully remastered, the beautiful sprite animation, remastered soundtrack and lots of extra artwork to unlock will keep you busy for a couple of hours easily.This game makes me wish Capcom would bring more classic remakes to steam, especially ""MegaMan: Powered Up"" and ""MagaMan: Maverick Hunter X"" (PSP) the entire time I played this awesome game I couldn't help but be reminded of those two awesome remakes as well, COME ON CAPCOM, get off your♥♥♥♥♥!!

												I hate to downvote this game, but it freezes on the end boss for a lot of people, including me. It sounds like it's related to Nvidia's newer drivers but I'm not sure.The game itself is a solid if not particularly impressive affair. The graphics are obviously an improvement over the original, but compared to the recent remake of Castle of Illusion this remaster is kind of disappointing. If you are looking for a great Disney platformer I'd recommend trying that one first.This is worth picking up for $5 sometime, though, if you are a Disney fan or like 2D platformers. However, I'd hold off until it's patched - otherwise you might not be able to finish it.			"

												Essentially, this is an HD remake of the Capcom NES/Gameboy game from the early 90's. Level design is almost identical and gameplay is the same too, which is a good thing because both were considered great at the time. The pixel sprites are replaced with hand-drawn, fully animated images and the music, which is also notoriously good in the original, has been updated as well and sounds fantastic! As a bonus, the original music can be used as well from the options screen. Also in the audio department, most of the original voice acting cast returns to lend their vocals. The game is let down by frequent and dull cutscenes, they can be skipped but you need to pause the game and select ""skip cutscene"" which gets old fast. Another let-down is the that it seems to give a lot more health and continues than I remember, making it a little too easy unless you use the hardest possible difficulty which can only be unlocked after an initial full playthrough. Regardless, highly recommended if you are into platformers and especially so if you owned the original, WayForward does a great job and you can see a lot of love went into making it happen.			"

												I'd love to recommend the game. It's a beautiful game and WayForward and Disney have given it a lot of love. I could write many more paragraphs about how well-crafted the and game is than this review takes.However I can't recommend it. The game has a catastrophic bug that causes the game to freeze on a significant number of users' machines, including my best PC. It appears to be a problem that is occurring with an increasing portion of new players and one suggested option to reduce (unfortunately not eliminate) the problem is to lower the graphics settings, resolution etc. so it seems likely the issue happens most when the game is played at its best. It is more frustrating still that this freeze happens mostly at the very end of the game.But the most annoying thing about this is that Capcom are being wilfully neglectful of all of these complaints. Players have repeatedly contacted them about the problem over the last 2 1/2 years. WayForward, the licensed developers, have also tried to communicate with them to offer work on fixing the issue. But all of this is being rejected, so nothing can be done. It turns one of the best games and certainly one of the best platformers of recent years into one of the most aggrivating.Instead I would recommend looking into other WayForward-developed platformers where they are not restricted in such a way, and where such issues cannot be found. In particular the upcoming Shantae: Half Genie Hero is shaping up to be a wonderful game with similar aesthetics and handling.			"

												DuckTales: Remastered is an excellent release of one of my childhood favorites.  There are a few mechanical problems (hard pogo and stairs rarely function in tandem), but they should not be enough to ruin the experience for someone pursuing the game for what it is.  The newest patch removed what I believed to be the worst part of the game - the long cutscenes.  If you enjoy platformers there is no reason not to pick this game up.			"

												I'm not giving this game a negative review because it's a terrible game. I'm giving it a negative review due to a commonly occurring bug that makes the game impossible to beat.DuckTales: Remastered is a remake (rather than a remaster) of an old NES game that garnered quite a bit of praise back in the days, for its well crafted levels, great soundtrack and fun gameplay. Remastered does not quite hit all the same notes, but the core gameplay is still very fun.Graphics and soundIf anything, the game actually looks better than the show it's based on. The colours are vibrant, movement is smooth and everything is nicely detailed without feeling cluttered. It ""feels"" like a cartoon, in a good way. The only area where criticism can really be had is in the animations that sometimes leave a bit to desire. Still, the game is beautiful.And it's no slouch in the sound department either. All the songs but one are based on the soundtrack of the NES game, but updated to make use of modern hardware. Only a single song is less than stellar, and that's the one that is new to this game. And it's not even a bad song, it just does not fit in with the rest.And what good is an action game without good sound effects? It ""feels"" satisfying to jump on enemies. The sound effects have just the right amount of ""impact"", creating a very satisfying experience. It manages to both stay faithful to its source material (the NES game), and expand on it.And let's not forget the voice acting. It's great. I did not grow up with the English version of the cartoon, and I still think the voice acting sound just right. This is extra impressive, considering the age of many of the voice actors (remember, this show originally aired back in 1987).StoryNo-one will play this game for its story. It's a forgettable story that adds very little to the overall experience. You're out looking for some special treasures, and need to visit places all over the world, and also the moon, in order to find them. That's really the extent of it.Sadly, the story delivery often gets in the way of the gameplay. Cutscenes are frequent, and they completely stop the action. It would most likely have been better to just have one bigger cutscene at the start of the level, and then a bigger one at the end, with some chatter between the characters during the levels that don't require you to stop moving. GameplayThe game borrows its gameplay from the original NES game, and it's a testament to good design when in 2015 a game that plays like a game from 1989 still is a joy to play. Bouncing on enemies is just as fun now as it was back then.The levels are heavily inspired by the levels from the NES game, keeping a similar layout. New objectives are added to the levels that basically amount to scavenger hunts, and here is where the game starts showing its faults. The original levels were never designed to be navigated this way, you were supposed to get to certain points in them, and you had a few options in regards to how you got to these points. In the remaster you need to go through almost every part of the level, which results in some strange looping back. It's particularly bad in the first non-tutorial level that you're likely to play, Amazonas, where you were originally meant to either pick the upper or lower rout in the earlier parts of the level, but here need to pick one, then go back through the other and then through one of them again. It breaks the sense of forward momentum, and it's really just a bit dull. All other levels, except for the new one at the end, suffer from this issue to some extent. This adds up to a game with worse level design than the game it's based on.The final level also feels out of place. Suddenly the style of the level (in terms of how you play it) changes completely. If you've ever played a Mega Man game, then this level will feel familiar, because that's what it feels like. A Mega Man level (and not a well designed one). The soundtrack on this level also feels like something out of Mega Man.Options?The options menu is severely lacking. You can't even change the sound levels. It's more or less limited to resolution, AA, language, brightness and two pre-set key combinations for your jump attack. No, you can not even re-bind controls. While graphics options for a game like this is not super important, sound levels and re-binding controlls is just something that I've come to expect from any game with more than a minimal budget.The big freeze-bug at the endThis is the reason why my review ends up negative. There is a bug near the end that freezes the game. It won't happen for everyone, but the amount of people I've seen reporting this seem to indicate that it's at least a relatively common bug. One that neither WayForward nor Capcom has bothered fixing. Exactly what causes the bug is unknown, but it does not seem to be due to a specific graphics card vendor, OS version or anything like that. Closing wordsEven without the bug, the frequent cutscenes and the frankly not great level design pulls this game down. The core gameplay is really good, but sadly the things surrounding it are not. Had they either stuck with the original level design, or designed brand new levels around the scavenger hunts you're supposed to partake in, then this game could easily have been a winner, but as it stands, it's just an alright game, with great graphics and sound, and a very serious bug near the end that might make it impossible for you to see the last boss.

												Ah, I remember playing Ducktales way back on the NES. It was great and I still have fond memories of it. But I wasn't sure a remake would give me the same memories... On the one hand it's pretty much an exact remake of the original, but with improved graphics. On the other hand it' might not translate well enough, and, because of that, might scare gamers off. I'm sorry to say it's the latter. First, let me talk about the things Ducktales does right. The graphics haven been upgraded with 2D HD sprites in a 2.5D world. It looks excellent, even if the backgrounds don't fit with the rest of the graphics. I personally think it would've been better if it was entirely in 2D. But that's a different story. The levels are exact replicas of the originals. Epic !The gameplay is also kept the same. It's tough. But not too tough. Back when I was a kid it literally took me hours to complete a level. Maybe it was because I was too young and didn't fully understand games just yet, maybe because games were really more difficult back then. Ducktales Remastered tested my patience when I had only just started it. I was rushing through levels carelessly and I died several times in a matter of minutes. This is a good thing, mind you. It makes the game feel old school, in a certain way.But despite the game being somewhat difficult it's also very short. Levels can be finished within 30-60 minutes and since there are only 6 levels in total you should complete it in about 5 or 6 hours max.Then the controls. The controls are pretty good, but jumping on your pogo stick doesn't seem to work all the time. Plenty of times have I tried jumping down, followed by a pogo stick jump and the game just didn't register the button being pressed. It cost me more health than intended.Oh, and the voice acting... Man, the voice acting. The voice acting was cringeworthy. I understand it's based on the cartoon, but the dialogues in general were just terrible and childish. Same goes for the rest of the cutscenes. I skipped through them at one point because I couldn't take it anymore. Next time, no more voice acting please. Just a textbox would suffice.And maybe it's my memory, but I remember secrets being secrets in the original. Secrets in the remake are pointed out in obvious ways. All that's missing is a big arrow pointing to it. Like I said, it might just be my memory but I remember this differently.If I had to rate this game right now I'd give it a 6,5, or 7 at best.Ducktales is a decent game and still kinda fun to play, even now and especially if you have never played the original. But wait for a sale instead, because the current price is once again too high. Also, I think the Castle Of Illusion remake might be better in comparison. Let's just wait for that.[Rating: 67/100]			"

												Overall rating 7.5/10As you probably know already, this game is a remastered version of the Ducktales game released on NES back in 1989. I have to admit that although I did play it for a tiny bit back in the early 90's, my memory of the game is fairly fuzzy and I don't remember enough to make an appropriate comparison between the two. Furthermore, I did not get an nostalgic rush when playing this game like many others do.With that said, I think the game has charm in its own right. First off, the presentation is fantastic. The graphics, the music, voicework etc. is exactly what you were hoping for. My only real complaint is that there are cutscenes *everywhere* in this game. Luckily, these are skippable (press Start and then go to ""skip cutscene"")As for the gameplay itself, the game is very much in line with what was popular in the late 80's/early 90's. Unlike other difficult modern platformers (such as Super Meat Boy or Shovel Knight), Ducktales isn't so much difficult (none of the segments are particularly tricky) as it is punishing. What I mean by this is that unlike those games, you have a limited amount of lives, and once all your lives are gone, you begin back at the games hub and have to do everything in a certain level all over again. Without trying to spoil anything, this is particularly annoying on the last level of the game, where a single mistake at any point might set you back 10-15 minutes. Other than that, this is your standard run-of-the-mill platformer. You play as the infamous Scrooge McDuck and look for treasure in each of the levels (the order of which you can pick, ala Megaman, although bosses in these levels do *not* give you weapons so the order is less important). The gems you collect throughout the level can be used to unlock artwork and music, but as far as I know have no bearing on the actual gameplay itself. Each level has a boss at the end. The controls in the game seemed fairly tight.The gameplay lasts approximately 4 hours for a quick runthrough (but this may vary greatly depending on how good or bad you are at platformers). I'd say it's definitely worth the price of admission at 50% off, although I wouldn't hurry to get it when it's not on sale.			"

												TL;DR: No option to lower audio volume in game, is incredibly loud. Game is broken for many NVIDIA card owners and if you are affected it will freeze in the final cutscene before the final battle. They apparently aren't working on a fix, so I can't recommend it at this point. Score without bug    9/10Score with bug         6/10 (I enjoyed the game very much up until the final battle, but it's too frustrating not being able to complete it at all) I loved this game and was incredibly happy when they announced this HD Remake. The only thing that really really annoyed me was the fact that the game has no option to turn the sound down (RIP Headset users), which meant I had to put my Windows sound regulator bar so far into the bottom that it was almost impossible to play while chatting with friends on teamspeak. If you don't turn the sound down, your ears will start bleeding from the epic Ducktales theme as soon as you hit the Welcome Screen. I eventually managed to somehow get it to a bearable level and was able to play the game (on hard difficulty) without any issues whatsoever. The controller support is great and I highly recommend using one. The fundamental problem, and the reason why I cannot recommend this game at this point, is the fact that there is a game breaking bug which prevents you from finishing the game because it freezes to death during the cutscene prior to the final boss battle. As far as I am informed, this problem only exists with NVIDIA cards, and it doesn't matter which one you have (I have a GTX 970). Thus far, the developers have not done anything to address this issue. I haven't seen one post on the Forums about it and it is unclear if they are even working on a fix. My gut tells me they are not, yet they do not hesitate to put this game out on sale.There are supposed fixes around, but they require a lot of work and I simply can not be bothered to fix something that is not my fault as a customer. If they ever fix the bug I will happily change this review.			"

												There's been a trend in recent years to cash in on nostalgia in a big way.  Take an old game, give it a little bit of polish, release it again and rake in the dough.  Sometimes it's welcomed because its handled respectfully, while other times it's a shallow cash grab.  I am very happy to say that this is NOT a cash grab.  If anything, DuckTales: Remastered is an example of how a updated re-release should be done... mostly.So, as per the usual formula, let's talk about the good to start.  First and foremost, the core of the original NES game, what made that game a beloved masterpiece, is still there and fully intact.  Scrooge still has his bizarre pogo stick ability that is as inexplicable as it is fun, and the levels still stick to the same general layout, even having the same locations for pickups.  The game's tunes are also the same, save for being performed by real instruments rather than an 8-bit chiptune processor.  If you thought the Moon theme was catchy in chiptune, wait till you hear it now.Of course, that's not to say the game is just a graphical update without any other changes.  DuckTales: Remastered adds some new content to the game, most of it welcome.  While the levels are mostly the same, there have been some minor alterations and changes, most for the better in terms of level flow.  Bosses in particular have been changed up so that they have more than the same single attack pattern to work with, making them far more challenging (though not unfairly so) than their pushover NES incarnations. There are even two additional levels: an intro training level and a final boss level, both with new soundtracks that fit in quite nicely with the rest of the tunes.  The final level in particular was a surprising addition, and is far more satisfying than the original game's ""go through this level you already beat"" concept of a final level, albeit with a caveat I'll talk about later.Probably the best thing DuckTales: Remastered brings to the game are the fully voiced characters.  Rather than just relying on canned sound effects and clips from the show, the game actually uses newly recorded lines from the original voice cast (minus the ones who, tragically, are no longer with us).  Yes, this includes Alan Young as Scrooge, sounding surprisingly good for being 92 years old.  Scrooge obviously has plenty of time to say a variety of things, what with all the pogoing and gathering treasure and whatnot, but the other characters get plenty of time to speak, too.  Mostly this happens during cutscenes that occur between and sometimes in the middle of the levels.  These cutscenes are true to the original series, and do a great job of explaining some of the more inexplicable parts of the original NES game; why was Bubba Duck frozen in ice, for example.Cutscenes aren't without downsides though, which brings me to the next part of the review: the bad. As I said, cutscenes can happen in the middle of levels, which can get very tiring on repeated playthroughs of the game.  You can skip them, but it does take a few seconds to do so, and quite a few are placed such that even that can be a noticeable interruption.  The game also has some serious issues with recognizing all but the most common monitor resolutions, and really didn't like my 16:10 monitor at all.  I was able to get around it by manually altering the game's ini file to use my specific resolution, but it's still something that could have been handled better.  The most maddening thing for me though is that in keeping true to the core of the original game, much of its buggy movement behavior was kept in as well, especially the random things that could cause Scrooge to stop pogoing for no easily apparent reason.  Any fan of the original NES title won't be surprised, but the movement quirks could have been ironed out without angering most people, or at the very least with an optional toggle as was done for the requirement to hold the pogo button while bouncing, a.k.a. ""Hard Pogo Mode"".The only other thing I can add about this game is only arguably a downside, but I found it somewhat negative all the same, that being the significantly increased difficulty of the final boss fight (and beyond) compared to the original game.  It's not impossible by any means, but it's still quite the jump in challenge.  I'll freely admit it had me frustrated for a little bit.Despite the few bad things in this remake, there's clearly far more good things to say about it. Ultimately though, DuckTales: Remastered is a bit of a victim of time, with its gameplay style not nearly as popular by today's standards, not to mention the waning popularity of the DuckTales franchise.  That said, it's still a solid platformer with a lot going for it, and very little going against it.  Fans of the original game will love this update, and people who have never played either can get quite a bit out of it, too, but you might want to watch a few episodes of the original show first.

												A wonderful and loving remake of a classic early 90's NES hit. Platforming at it's almost best. A unique mechanic (The Pogo Stick of Doom, wielded by ol'Scrooge) brings around a bouncing mechanic not found in normal 2D platformers. In an age where we see new and innovative stuff churned out in this genre almost every year, this project brought together the essence of the old NES Game.This however brought along a few hiccups which are annoying at most. The cut-scenes are a wee bit dull, and only skippable if you select ""Skip Cutscene"" in the pause menu. The final boss is just as annoying as it was in the original which is either my bad memory, or an oversight.In this nostalgia romp for yours truly, I enjoyed this game for exactly what it was. A trip down memory lane in the city of Duckburg, only done in a visual style that reminded me of an episode of the show. 7.5/10. Would recommend to young ones, Platforming fiends, and those who have a soft spot for the penny-pinching McDuck Clan.			"

BEWARE: if you have NVIDIA, with recent drivers, expect to wander in the community hub to find the solution of a freezing game during the last boss.DuckTales.... so many memories... on the NES system.Because I belong to that generation that got the chance to play it on it. Besides, I can still remember the song (in French) for Duck Tales, the cartoon. And I still remember the pogo stick, the Amazon and the Moon.DuckTales Remastered is an improved version of the original game. Oncle Scrooge (or Picsou in French) is searching for a mythical artefact with the help of all the gang (the nephews and niece, the chopper pilot, the crazy inventor) and pitched against some enemies (the witch, the scottish billionnaire, the thiefs). I'm sorry if I'm not giving the English names, as I'm used to Geo Trouvetou, Mystique or Riri, Fifi and Loulou (who are Huey, Dewey and Louie) and as names.Anyway, dear Scrooge will visit the Amazon, some African mines, a haunted castle in Transylvania, the Everest and the Moon, without forgetting a volcano where the big fight will arrive. If he can jump, he can also use his cane as pogo stick to reach heights or to throw stuff. As part of a classic platformer, you can improve your health or find secret areas with bonuses. The score is determined by the value of the diamonds you've found (whether they're hidden in chests or not). Unless they're in chests, you have to pass on the zone they're to make them appear. But they're only there temporary: you have to take them quickly.Also, the enemies are typical of the level visited: gorillas, spiders and snakes in the Amazon (without forgetting the tribemen), mummies, bats and ghosts in Transylvania, etc... Each level is ending with a boss to defeat, though some are just mad at you for another story, like the Yeti for example.Anyway, the good part of the game is that you can unlock art gallery thanks to the money you're accumulating during the levels. If you start a new game, it's not erased, which is great. But during a same playthrough, you can't replay a level. Once it's done, it's done. You can't go back for secrets you've missed or for achievements. Anyway, if you're starting a new game, generally, it's because you want to try it at a higher level.The graphics are very colorful, anyway, you can't expect a dark setting for a remastering of a game that was already oriented towards children at the time. Everything is well polished..... APART FOR A FREEKING FREEZING BUG FOR PEOPLE WITH NVIDIA CARDS ON THE FINAL BOSS! IMPOSSIBLE TO FINISH THE GAME!And that's where all the good found in the game is crushed because the developers aren't trying to patch the game for that game-breaking bug. It's just sad that I can't finish the game.So yeah, while DuckTales isn't perfect as there is only audio in English, that the game is for people having played it and finding some good memories, while DuckTales, despite that, is a very good game until the end, should I thumb it down or up?I'm tempted to thumb it down but I've enjoyed it the game for 90% of it, apart the bug. So, well, I'll thumb it up but stay aware of the problem.			"

												DuckTales! Whoo-oo!I don't even remember DuckTales, but this game has some sort of mystical charm around it that unlocked my inner child. Who am I kidding, he's never locked up. But this game, it's fantastic, magical and I can safely say it's the most innocent, harmless fun I have had in a game for years.Despite it's name, it's much less of a remastered game than a completely redux of one. A lovley mixture of 2.5D visuals, well done and cartoonish sprites, it's really got Disney written all over it. The music, is wonderful, I could listen to the theme tune all day! For gameplay, DuckTales: Remastered doesn't have much going for it. Mainly because it's a game targeted at children, so it's understandable why it's easy to use. Simple button controls, jump, hit, brutally murder, the usual. My one issue with the game, is that it doesn't do much to make me come back, other than improve my rankings on the World Leader Boards. And that final boss battle. It's hard. The story is short and can be completed in 3 hours or so, and of course there are achivements and trading cards that could keep you busy.All in all, DuckTales is just harmless fun, even if it is a little guilty pleasure game.+ 2.5D!+ A complete over-haul of the original, everything is new. + Great character design and voice acting.- Not much to do after the campaign is finished.- The game get's repetative after the first act. 8.5/10.

												While the game is very fun, I will have to give this game a negative score for it not having the freezing problem fixed yet. The last boss fight freezes unless I choose to skip cutscene which ruins one cutscene I could have seen and the game has also frozen at a random moment as well. Until this is fixed I am leaving a negative review. This does not freeze at all or even once on Xbox 360, there is no excuse why this can't run better on the PC without any freezing issues.			"

 It's perfect. I’m not going to lie, I flipped out a little when I first saw that teaser for DuckTales Remastered back in 2013. The NES version of DuckTales has been close to the top of my nostalgia list for many, many years... and now... Now is the Time... Summer Sale 2016 gave me the opportunity to buy this game... 4,61€ HELLA WORTH IT!.Pretty much everything about DuckTales Remastered is great, both from a nostalgic point of view and from the music which has been remixed but is still faithful to the original (and extremely good), the visuals are fantastic, the voice acting makes me crack a smile every time, and the harder difficulties are actually hard.DuckTales Remastered is a game worth playing regardless of whether or not you’ve played the original. But if you’re a total newcomer this is the best choice you can make to start your Ducktales experience :)			"

												A great game in it's own right, it's one of the few remake games that does more that do more than just update the graphics of the original.  They make the sprites like the cartoon, get all the VAs from the show they can, polish up the music, and add to the levels to give more of a challenge, as well as a story. A definite must-play if you were an 80's kid, or just like the original game.  I want to d/l the series after playing this.			"

												Whether it’s from the TV cartoon series or Comic books, at one point many seen, played or read something, somewhere about Ducktales. In this remastered title you are able to travel back in time in your memories and experience a classic game from a timeless genre. As Scrooge McDuck, you are about to travel to mysterious places filled with dangerous enemies in order to acquire five Treasures to add to your insane pool of wealth. With the help of your three nephews you will face different scenarios like the forest, snow environments and dark underground mines (among other places). The gameplay mechanics are what many can expect from a platform standpoint and while it may not appear nothing demanding, simple things like jumping from point A to point B will highly depend on how used you are playing similar titles. I often failed a simple jump not because of bad timing but because my own perception of space between two platforms which meant I was being put to the test and patience. It may seem easy for most, but like everything, every player have different strengths or weaknesses depending on the genre.Aside from maybe one Boss or another, the game is set with a standard difficulty. After around 6 hours I managed to finish the game and was watching the credits. If you are a fan of the DuckTales stories this game can be a great “snack” to play between those lengthy, high story based games. In the end, it is a little adventure with vibrant colors and happy environments that is great to play in short burst if you are taking a break from something.   "

												DuckTales Remastered is a testament to what a developer can do with an old title and WayForward does an absolutely stellar job in every department.Graphics and animation are lovingly updated and re-created to make you feel that you are playing an interactive episode of the old TV show.  I could go on about this, but if you haven't watched the 'Duckumentaries' above (and on YouTube) they do a great job of showing the process they went through to update it.Sound design is fantastic, but the game's music was the audio portion done with the most love of the original NES source material.  It is nothing short of beautiful and nostalgic.  The composer went above and beyond keeping close to original compositions, but updated them perfectly to full orchestrations.  I can not fathom how this could have been handled any better.  The calm, smoothness of the stage select music coupled with the act of performing a swan dive into Scrooge's money bin hit my nostalgia nerve very hard.  Nothing has pulled me back to the happiness of my childhood like that did in a long time.  The other impressive bit in the area of audio was the use of what I believe is the entire original voiceover cast from the cartoon which adds another layer of authenticity and enjoyment to this game.  And when I say everyone I mean all the way from Scrooge (Alan Young was 93 I believe when he recorded this) all the way down to Webigail and even Duckworth the butler has a couple of lines.The gameplay remains wholly unchanged from the original.  The pogo can be a little frustrating every now and again, but it always was and isn't in any way crippling here.  Also, the addition of added difficulties is welcome since the original was very unforgiving in this area.  The main change is the addition of a whole new final level - Mount Vesuvius which takes the place of returning to Transylvania in the original.  A difficult final stage that is well conceived and fits in with the rest of the game well.  The final bit of the game after your battle with Dracula Duck is a homage to what the old 8-bit twitch reaction platformers could be.  The game is a tiny bit short, but that's hardly a criticism since the orignal was the same and only took more time due to the unforgiving difficulty.Overall, this is a wonderful game for all ages, especially those old-school gamers of us in our 30s that loved these old 8-bit platformers.  I am definitely keeping my eye on anything WayForward does from here on because they clearly know how to make, not just a good game, but how to make it fun and its refreshing to see a developer who seems to really care about what they're doing versus raking in the cash as the primary motivator.  If they ever got their hands on Capcom's 8-bit MegaMan library (especially this same music composer) I would be all over that.			"

DuckTales: Remastered is a game that plays exactly like the old DuckTales on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and what makes it work is that we have a story and dialog to go along with the old game. The gameplay is the same from the NES like I said, but with a few twists that makes it even more exciting. The remastered music is another thing I love about this game and bless my bagpipes the music to The Moon, Transylvania, The Amazon, and many many others. I highly recommend this game to everyone.

												The game is a pretty decent platformer, nothing amazing but good enough at what it does. This in itself would not be enough for me to give a negative review. However gamebreaking bugs are a very valid reason for a negative review.The bug occurs at the final boss. The game freezes sometimes in the cutscene before the final battle sometimes into the final battle or if you can make it through it without freezing in the cutscene afterwards. This bug has existed for approx 2 years and will not be patched as there is some license issue with Capcom(the publishers) Wayforward( the devs) and Disney (the license holder). On a side note I had very similiar problems with another Wayforward game Double Dragon Neon so I will be taking extra care when looking into any of their games in the future.I did manage to find a workaround to enable me to finish the game but it was a little awkward and less computer savvy people may be hesitant to try it. And frankly it ruined what would have otherwise been a fairly pleasant experience and I or other paying customers should not have to go to these lenghts to play their game.For anyone that is unlucky enough to have bought this and is outside the refund window heres what I did to get it working but YMMV.1. Launch the game2. Alt Tab out of the game and open task manager3. Find Ducktales.exe, right click and go to Set Affinity...4. Change the affinity from 4(For me, it may be 2 or more depending on your system) to just 1 of the CPUs (I doubt it matters but I used CPU 05. Play the game until you get to the boss and the cutscene starts, pause the game and skip cutscene. ( You can watch it on Youtube )6. Fight and win final boss battle and when the cutscene starts pause again and skip the cutscene.7. Thereis a short escape scenatio to play through then. The game froze on me during this the first time but I managed to get through it on the first attempt the second go. I have no idea if the lenght of time I had been on the scene caused the crash but I would suggest trying to get through it as quickly as possible.So to sum up do not buy this game, it is broken and will never be fixed. I am just glad I picked it up on sale. "

												While I must admit that I barely played the original NES game, DuckTales Remastered is an instant nostalgia bomb from the moment you press start. From the colorful sprites of all our favorite characters, to the original voices from the cartoon show, and the theme song, everything feels so perfect at the beginning. It really isn't just a ""remake"" of the original game, it's also a reunion for people who were fans of the show as well.With colorful graphics, tight controls, fun gameplay, and great music, Remastered also attempts to make fans of the original game feel at home. However, with the inclusion of many pesky and intruding cutscenes, the wonderful flow of the game grinds to a complete halt. Some can be welcome -- introducing a new level or terrifying boss. But other cutscenes will activate whenever you complete trivial ""objectives"", which can be anything from finding a token or aiding Launchpad fix his plane. They interupt a bit too often, and while there is an option to skip these (by pausing the game during the cutscene, selecting ""skip cutscene"", then confirming), sometimes there's two or three back to back, making you have to awkwardly repeat the process. It doesn't help that if you Game Over and have to repeat a stage... well, get ready to skip all those cutscenes again! I understand they were just trying to add story to a game where there was none (except perhaps in the instruction manual of the original), however, it is still frustrating to repeatedly have to keep skipping cutscenes.Despite that one flaw, DuckTales Remastered is an easy game to get into and a very rewarding one to complete. Scrooge and all his companions are back for a DuckTales encore that seemed long overdue. And I'm very happy to have been apart of it! DuckTales fans, pick this one up! Fans of the original game or just fans of old school side-scrollers in general, maybe wait til it's on sale.Happy adventuring!!!			"

												Cool game! Drawn cartoon sprites, the official voice actors, and the levels and gameplay very closely follow the original game, with tweaks and updates that I like. Lots of dialogue has been added as well, giving it more of its own storyline to follow. I like that you can jump into your money bin and sort of swim around, just for fun. I played the original NES game again just before this one, and I found the ways that they managed to update the game while still staying faithful to the original were pretty clever. I'm not a big fan of the new tutorial level (Scrooge's Moneybin); it's just not as interesting as the rest of the game, but it is just a tutorial I guess. Also, Scrooge doesn't sound as energetic or enthusiastic as he probably should for the situation (demanding his nephews be set free or narrowly escaping death), but it's still pretty  awesome that the original voice actor for Scrooge (now in his 90's) voiced it.Gameplay wise, it's the same as the original, with some tweaks. A 2D platformer with a pogo-cane attack. There is a extra heart powerup hidden within each level, as well. I played through the game on ""easy"" and found it very easy to complete (you have unlimited lives). I can see it becoming a challenge on the harder difficulties, though, since the bosses are by far the most challenging parts of the game.I really enjoyed it, and would recommend it to people who enjoy oldschool platformers, and ESPECIALLY fans of the original NES game.

												One of the best games on the NES and still amazing. Still plays as good as the original, besides lag from the flat-screen etc, but it isn't enough to ruin the experience. Music is amazing and so is the voice acting. Only one thing that's bugging me is the last stage (Spoilers), which isn't Transylvania anymore but a brand new stage created by WayForward and it's really noticeable that it isn't Capcom anymore. It feels poorly planned and the last part when you race Glomgold for the final price, like in the intro of the show, you crash and burn. Frame perfect jumps and such just ruins the finale. I had to redo that last part five times before being able to beat it. Not sure if I'm bad at it, since I beat the rest of the game without a problem, or if it's just a peak of difficulty but I don't like it. Even with that last stage, the game is incredible. Just buy it and you won't regret it!			"

I want to keep on playing it and I want to recommend it to everyone. Unfortunatey, this review is negative for a reason.The game, at the moment of writing, suffers from a widespread bug that causes regular freezing at the final boss. It seems to primarily affect people using modern Nvidia drivers. Fans will suggest ways to work around it (not using Nvidia aside), but the fact stands that Capcom and WayForward have yet to fix it.

												Fun platformer although challanging. Last level has very poor hit detection and doesn't register jumping onto chains half the time making it a very frustrating level. Despite this the overall game is pretty good.			"

												DuckTales Remastered is a perfect upgrade from the original 1989 NES version.Now with 3D graphics, official voices of all the characters from the cartoon, a completely enchanced soundtrack , new unlockables and Steam achievements.If you enjoyed the original DuckTales for Nintendo then you should definitely try DuckTales Remastered on Steam. It is quite the treat. Kudos to Capcom, Disney and WayForward for bringing this out for us! :)			"

												As someone who loved both the DuckTales TV show and the original NES game, I was quite excited when this was announced. I've just finished the game on Hard and overall I love it. Graphically it's fantastic. It's like playing the old cartoonGameplay is spot on. Jumping, pogo'ing, etc all feel tight. It's rewarding finding all the hidden spots for gems, health, and 1-ups, just like the original.  Sound is great too. Almost all of the original voice actors are back and they do a great job of stepping into their old roles.This is what an HD remake should be. Graphically it looks better, it has new features and extended levels/boss fights but it still feels like the original. My only major complaint is the final leg of the game. It's overly long and punishing, often forcing you to re-play sections over and over again.If you are a fan of the old game/show and/or platformers, this is a no brainer.  8/10If you'd like to see the game in action before you buy, I have a full Let's Play available as well : http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=SPib-fhfCM7h5Ee5N4vMxBXtCD6BtWI1RE "

												Never finished this game. Why? Because multiple times in a row on the last level, the game froze up, The screen freezes up and the music continues to play. It forced me to restart and I had to replay the level again only for it to happen again. Apparently, this is a common issue if you look around for information on it.			"

												Man, i can't tell you how hyped i was when i heard that the remastered version is in development.I can't tell you how much i loved the original (like THIS much). It was soooo good!I'm a sucker for old NES/SNES games and games that try to capture that old essence (Oniken and others).But, and this is a huge but, DuckTales: Remastered dissapointed me a little.OK, so the gameplay is great! Just like in the original game...it's exactly the same! The artstyle and graphics are nice. The music is cool, (altho i prefer the original NES music but that might be the nostalgia talking), the story is neat but it's the story that also ruins this game.You see there's a bunch of cutscenes. You get a cutscene after every 1-2 minutes of gameplay and that kills the game. It's constantly stopping the gameplay. Pulls you right out of it in the very moments when you're enjoying yourself.The story is neat but cutscenes are spammed...like often...very often!And just because of cutscenes i would like to give thumbs down to this game. It's really that bad, yes. You have to play it to understand it. It's just...ugghhh.However, the gameplay is still supreme. The levels and music and added secrets are still all top-notch so i'm giving this a thumbs up. But only get it on a sale.Because of the cutscene spamming, that makes it more of a cartoon rather than a game, i can't say that it's worth the full price.Maybe get the game when it's like -50% or so. You're better off playing the original.			"

												Pogo everything. Leave no survivors.I was too young to play Capcom's Ducktales when it originally came to the NES back in 1990 (I was two years old then), but I made up for it by playing the game constantly when it was available on the NEStalgia online emulator a few years back.What a treat, then, that Ducktales Remastered (a port/remake developed by Wayforward Technologies) is light-years ahead of the original version. I don't think it's hyperbole to say that this is a faithful remake that does justice to the license while throwing a boatload of extra content for longtime fans.The original game had what can best be described as an ""excuse plot"" - you journey around the world to find five treasures, and at the end Flintheart Glomgold and Magica de Spell show up to ruin your party and force you to lose them again. The remake goes much, much further than this, to the point that I would characterize it as a ""mini-season"" of the series. There's an honest-to-God story this time, which ranks up there with some of the best episodes of the show.You begin the game as Scrooge McDuck, racing to the scene of an attempted break-in by the Beagle Boys at your Money Bin. Once you take care of the intruders, several things open up to you - a gallery where you can purchase unlockable content (ranging from character sketches to a sound test, complete with the 8-bit retro soundtrack), the legendary Vault - yes, you can go swimming in it, complete with ""gold-spewing"" animations - and your choice of levels from the computer, just like the original.The best thing about the game is that it is filled with continuity nods and nostalgia galore. Everything from unused items in the prototype version of the original game, to nods to various episodes and character concepts, to little in-jokes based on the level design of its predecessor, is on full display here. Pogo jumping on enemies and racking up as much treasure as you can still feels as great as it did before. It's a game that was clearly made by fans of the series, and it shows in spades.I could spend an hour rattling off all the ways I love this game. Running away from a giant boulder as Scrooge yells ""Children and billionaires first!"" at the top of his lungs. The lampshade hanging of why you can breathe on the moon. The way all of the supporting characters get much more screentime and characterization, and how their jokes fit so seamlessly with the lore (Glomgold and Scrooge's rivalry, anyone?). The way they still managed to capture the tight controls of the pogo stick from the original. Alan Young seamlessly jumping back into the Scrooge character, despite being 94(!) at the time of recording his lines. The extra Money Bin/Vesuvias levels. The New Game Plus mode. The ""light muzak"" version of the Moon theme that plays over the end credits. Mega-Dracula Duck trying to chomp you. Gizmoduck is a bro that kills anything in your path.You get the idea.I don't say this lightly. This is an incredible tribute to the series. I'd even go so far to say that this is one of the best Disney products ever made. We're taking ""Legend of the Chaos God""/Castle of Illusion-tier quality, folks. It was made by people who poured their heart and soul into making it as good as it can be.From a difficulty standpoint, this game isn't for children. Even on the Easy difficulty level, there are level portions and boss battles that are much more taxing than the original incarnations. The Amazon/Incan relic boss fight in particular has you using near split-second timing to avoid crushing walls that come in from all sides.The quality of the port is also somewhat lacking. You can clearly tell that this port was a rush job to get it out to PC audiences - the command prompts at Scrooge's office have an ""A"" button prompt (you have to press Space to activate it by default), and I experienced slowdown at a couple points in Transylvania and the Money Bin.I didn't experience the dreaded ""end boss crash"" others have reported. Rather, the game locked up when I was near the end of the Moon level, causing me to lose a half-hour of playtime. All things considering, a few technical glitches are a moot point.Ducktales Remastered is an amazing achievement. It makes me wonder what Wayforward could do with other franchises. You can't tell me that a Talespin or Chip'n Dale: Rescue Rangers remake wouldn't be awesome. Hell, this game makes me excited to see what they could do with Ducktales 2, the more technically advanced NES sequel that made a lot of changes to the formula.If you value your childhood and love this series, go out and get it now.

It's not to hardif your not on a high difficulty, but its easy to make it harder. I was not prepared to die when I lost my lives.. myheart goes out to those who died and that was it.Overall, I think this game is amazing, short, but amazing. The music is beautiful and I love the ability to have theclassic music on. If your a fan of Disney, Capcom games from back then, or just like ducks, I think this is a must try.			"

												Despite watching the cartoon daily as a kid, I never actually played Capcom's classic DuckTales on NES, so I wasn't really sure what I was getting into with this. I was really only interested because WayForward was involved, and because I'd heard stories that the NES game was actually pretty great.Well, lo and behold, I actually loved DuckTales: Remastered. Virt did a fantastic job on remaking the music, and everyone involved did a great job at updating the levels, and, apparently, adding two new ones. The somewhat open-like gameplay that a few levels had gave me a bit of a Metroid vibe, something I was not expecting from a game based on talking ducks. The only real negative I'd have with this game is the constant cutscenes. The writing is rather charming, like watching an old 80's Disney cartoon, but they start to get on your nerves when they play every five minutes. It's also a rather short game, as my first run of the game, on PS3, took about 4 hours. However, this is one of the few games that, immediately after I finished, I began again on a higher difficulty.The bosses are fun to fight, the stages are fun to traverse, the music is great, and the controls work well enough. Another great game from WayForward.			"

												It is easy to recommend this remastered version of DuckTales.  The devs have taken the levels and layout from the original 1989 version and expanded them to enchance the gameplay even further.  The graphics, music and story have been recreated and even surviving members of the animated series lend their voices.  New areas are included in the original game's levels and bosses are given new patterns.  The game even comes with two new levels exclusive to this version of the game.It certainly is a nostalgia trip and I would highly recommend it to fans of the original, but I would also recommend it to any fan of 2D side scrollers.  It is quite difficult, which makes it enjoyable.  Various difficulties are included and despite the game being quite short, it does offer some replay value if you attempt the Extreme difficulty.  I recommend picking this up in a sale and experiencing a remastered version of a great NES game.  It will at least occupy you for a couple of hours!			"

Still, the game looks great, it has that nostalgia factor, and the remastered soundtrack is enjoyable.			"

												DuckTales Remastered is a 2D Platformer. It's, as the title implies, a remaster of the original 8-Bit NES game DuckTales. The story is about Scrooge McDuck and his 3 nephews searching for ancient treasures around the world to become the richest duck in the world.The game is a rather simplistic platformer, but it's charming and fun in lots of ways. You play as Scrooge, who has the ability to jump on his cane like a pogo stick. This gives Scrooge lots of extra height, and it's also the main way to defeat any enemies in the way and cross dangerous obstacles. The pogo jump can be done indefinitely unless you take damage, so it's pretty much the primary bit of platforming you're gonna do. Gameplay doesn't have lots of depth, but it does a good job at what it aims to do: Controls are super precise, platforming bits are fun, game is moderately challenging, and enemies are a threat. So that's what matters most, all of it's gameplay mechanics are solid.DuckTales consists of 7 levels (Including the tutorial level). You go around exploring, trying to find all the gems and diamonds you can, then subsequently fighting the boss at the end of each stage to get the valued treasure. Every level also has some items you need to find to advance to the next section, which encourages the exploration aspect. Now, don't go around thinking it's gonna be like a Metroidvania, because it's not. It has little tidbits of exploration, but it's not very abundant. The good news is that each level has it's own enemies and gimmicks to it, so you'll never feel like you're playing the same thing over and over again. They're not very long, nor are they very big. But like I said, for what there is, it's good and gets the job done.The visuals and soundtrack for this game are incredible. Every song, excluding the new levels, are remixes from the NES game, and they sound spectacular. Jake Kaufman, who does the OST for Shovel Knight and Shantae, did a fantastic job on the music here. The graphics really do capture the spirit of the original DuckTales cartoon, each of the characters are hand drawn 2D while the background and objects are 3D. The 3D bits don't look as good as the 2D characters, but they work well to make a cartoonish and fitting environment and all that.Speaking of which, the game has LOTS of cutscenes, so it kinda feels like an episode of the show if you wanna look at it like that. Some of the original voice actors from the TV show are present, such as Alan Young playing Scrooge. (The dude is in his 90s, mad respect.) However, some people might not like the cutscenes since they show up a lot in the middle of gameplay, whether it's reaching a new area or finding a collectible. They're very abundant, but many felt like it interrupted gameplay. (Tip, you can skip them my pausing and pressing ""Skip Cinematic"".)The game has 4 difficulties: Easy, Normal, Hard, and Extreme. Every gamer will probably find their preferred difficulty whether you wanna take a stroll through the game or ramp it up to hardcore levels. The harder difficulty you choose, the less health related items there will be, which will instead be replaced by more money or 1-Ups. Also, after you beat a level, you'll get some bonus cash for it. The higher your difficulty, the more your cash bonus is. Extreme can only be unlocked after you beat the game on Hard, and it takes after the NES game. You have to beat it all in one sitting, and if you get a game over, you need to start from the very beginning of the game.So anyway, DuckTales is a good remake of the NES game and a solid platformer with not much depth to it. It's also rather short, clocking in about 2-3 hours for 1 playthrough. However, if you're into platformers or just wanna spend some time on a pretty decent game, go get it on a sale.7/10			"

-Quick Review-DuckTales: Remastered was a work of love from the developers at WayForward, the game brings a fresh new experience to a classic video game from the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System - for you younsters). DuckTales is a 2D Platformer where you play as Scrooge McDuck visiting various places on earth and the moon, collecting treasure.


Beautiful. Simply beautiful. <3

-Disclaimer-I hate to point this out... but the game did freeze on the last boss. I had to skip the cinematic to get through it (after replaying the level). But not everyone has the opportunity to skip. Just check the forums and you'll see that the most common problem in the game is freezing on the final boss.I still recommend this game because I absolutely love it! But, buyer beware, you might get to the last level and not be able to finish the game. :-/

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: Scrooge McDuck is the richest duck in the world, he is quite the treasure hunter and adventure seeker. In between treasure hunting and adventures he seems to be perpetually trying to protect his money vault from the “Beagle boys”.In DuckTales: Remastered you will visit the Jungles, Arctic, Transylvania, Mines and even the moon. You are visiting these places to collect precious treasures, that Scrooge learned about from a painting.Here's some history for those of you who like gaming history; the original DuckTales game was developed by Capcom and released on the NES in 1989 in North America. Additionally the places you visit within the game are actually episodes from the DuckTales Disney Cartoon Series that aired in the late 1980's and early 1990's.Gameplay: The controls are very simple, you move, jump, and Pogo with your cane. The controls are tight and very responsive. It's very easy to get the hang of the controls, however implementing them in the various platformer challenges in the game will reward the player with plenty of difficulty.Achievements: There are 20 achievements in DuckTales: Remastered, there are three achievement categories: Achieved while playing, Beat the game on the hardest difficulty, and Secret achievements.After my first play through I had 15 achievements, it is important to note that I play quite thoroughly so I usually get a lot of achievements on my first play through. This game will take a few different play through depending on how careful you are to collect as much as possible.The toughest achievements worth noting are: Beat the game on extreme difficulty, “Look Ma, No spats”, and I missed two hidden achievements on my first play through.Price: DuckTales: Remastered is priced at $14.99, I had this game on my wishlist and was waiting for a sale before purchasing it, but a friend bought it for me on my birthday. (Thanks Helen! :D )I felt this game is completely worth the price, there are qualities that I don't even touch in my review that I ADORE about this game: The Music, the artistic style, the sense of progression, and the nostalgia factor.Conclusion: To quickly recap, Story: Awesome, and endearing if you've watched the DuckTales Cartoon series or played the original DuckTales for the NES. Gameplay: simple, yet having plenty of difficulty. Achievements: Most of them are earned on your first play through, but there are always those tough achievements keeping you away from 100% without a struggle.Once more, you should be careful when purchasing this game because the last boss might actually freeze/crash your game. But other then that I have nothing negative I could say about this game.I recommend Ducktales to anyone who enjoys platformers, fans of the series, people who played the classic NES game, and anyone who likes supporting Indie game developers.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update August, 22, 2015:Added Screenshots			"

												Looks good, music is great. Dialogues are great since they're done by pretty much the original DuckTales cast.Very high skill ceiling towards the end.But controls can be pretty buggy, even with controller. Can't count the times I missed a rope and plunged to death even though I clearly pressed up at the rope to climb it. I can't say if it's just bad PC porting on control scheme or what.So I'd say that if you're TRUE DuckTales fan, you can get more out of it. Regular players might not find it so interesting.			"

												This game just gave gamers one of the sweetest love letters in a longest time. The name ""remastered"" definitely fits for this beautiful gem. Amazing remastered OST by the company and Jake Kaufman that alone revived the good times of the nineties and the glorious gaming generation. I just keep some of the tracks on the loop and pause the game to remind me about the good gaming memories telling me not to let them go. True to its sincerity, the graphics and voice acting felt like the old times was just right around the corner of an old school gamer's heart like mine. to me it feels like this game is just making my gaming heart cry with joy inside with all the presentation it gave. This game will not only charm the old but also the new generation of gamers and we can all sit down and talk about how games were in the old days. Never forget the good memories just to create if not better memories for our next gen gamers. I can't recommend enough so just stop reading this and go buy it for good old gaming time sake. :)			"

												If you thought the remake of Goldeneye 007 was a surprise at E3, this remake was the biggest surprise of all. Ducktales: Remastered, the remake to the classic NES Ducktales game. The game opens up with an awesome 8-bit/modern remix of the Ducktales theme on the title screen, then we jump into the games story. Scrooge McDuck, the richest duck in Duckburg, uncovers a map hidden in an old painting that leads to some hidden treasures. So he imbarks on his quest to find them with the help of his friends. The game is a classic 2D Sidescroller game that relies on your wits and skill. The gameplay focuses on Scrooge's cane and jump ability. The cane is used to hit objects or to bounce around like a pogo stick. Gems are hidden everywhere so keep a close watch on where they are scattered. They are used to buy art galleries from the game and the TV show it was based off of, or to fill up Scrooges Money Bin. It's always been a fans dream to dive into his money bin, and now they finally get the chance to do so. The game is faithful to the original with it's upgraded graphics, remixed soundtrack, and challenging gameplay. It's even more surprising that they were able to get most of the original voice actors from the TV Show to reprise their respective roles. It feels like a breath of fresh air to hear Scrooge, Launchpad, the Beagle Boys and others back again after all these years. June Foray still manages to get so carried away as usual, and Alan Young is still smarter than the smarties, and tougher than the toughies. The new voice actors thatfill in the other characters like Flintheart Glumgold do a good job in bringing these characters to life. Each level feels like playing through an episoide of Ducktales, espically when the graphics are to resemble the traditional animation that the TV show had, you don't see that kind of animation anymore in recent years. This game isn't a walk in the park, unless your an expert on the original game. It's very challenging with it's difficulty, you know your playing a classic hard game when extra lives are hard to come by. The last level is probably the hardest level ever, no matter what difficulty your on. After defeating the final boss, it then goes into a race against Scrooge and Flintheart and Magica De Spell in retriving Scrooge's Number One Dime. After you've succedded in doing that, it then leads into a race for survival by climbing up chains while the lava is flowing upwards, one false move and your finished. It's been so long since I've played a game where I'm tense all over, the fast paced music and it's setting really gets you pumped up. Even after making it to the top, I can still feel my heart beating out of my chest. So if your in the mood for a game that is a throwback to the golden age of video games or if your a Ducktales fan, than this game will saticfy you as it has already saticfied me. So what are ya waiting for? Buy it now! It's worth every penny, as long as it's not some of Scrooge's pennies. lol			"

												If you liked Ducktales on the NES OR Duckatles on the television, you'll find something to like here. If you like both, you'll be in heaven. The only downside is the annoying cut-scenes that require multiple button presses to skip. It's just as difficult as the NES game, and your many deaths will require many multiple-button presses to skip multiple cut-scenes per level.Very specific product for a very specific demographic-- If you weren't of remembering age in 1990, this isn't for you.

												A faithful recreation of the old classic. Including a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t deaths. I had a great time with it until having to repeat the last level multiple times in a row because I kept dying on the very very very last part of the game. I've seen a lot of people complain about all the cut scenes, but they got a bunch of the original voice actors from the cartoon so I don't mind them showing off. It's good but can be very frustrating.			"

												This is a charming classic platform game. It's kind of easy, and the cutscenes drag a bit, but it's fine because it's Ducktales. The moon music is one of the classic tracks of the NES era so the game is worth buying for that level alone. Trust in Stooge McChicken.			"

												Fun little game - beat the whole thing in about 4 hours, including doing some levels a second time because I had to quit midway to do other things.Don't listen to the reviews that tell you there's a huge difficulty increase in the end - they're just bad. The final boss fight also went flawlessly and was a nice easy challenge. Definitely nostalgic! Loved seeing my childhood again!			"

But I was VERY DISAPPOINTED in not being able to finish the game because it alway freezes on the last boss. I simply can't recommend it, because not fixing that since the release is just silly to me.			"

												don't get this game on PC. Get it on a console when it's on sale like right now on Wii U eshop. or get it on PSN or Xbox Live BUT NOT ON PC!. When your mostly jumping on enemies it gets really repetive. While I do like the cutscenes the lip-sinking doesn't match up with the sub-titles which looks awkward. I also feels the levels overstay their welcome but it's there because this game is JUST TO SHORT! You can beat this game in like six hours. if you lose all your lives in a level your sent back to the mansion instead of going back to the star of the level. You will lose all your lives because the end of the final level has a race THAT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE! SERIOUSLY! This is controller throwing frustrating! & now for the biggest reason I can't recommend this game on PC EVERY PURCHASE IS PERMA-SAVED! If you buy the 8-bit music for the sound test which for me sounds horrible compared to the incredible remixes YOU WILL NEVER HEAR THE REMIXES OUTSIDE THE SOUND TEST EVER AGAIN! You want to know how I know this? BECAUSE IT HAPPENED TO ME! This was a birthday present I got in 2013 before I owned my Wii U. Don't get this game on PC Get it on PSN,XBOX LIVE, OR THE WII U ESHOP! I will be buying this game again on my Wii U & will be avoiding the 8-bit music. All becuase of YET ANOTHER STUPID DECISION BY CAPCOM! But at least they made this & Dead Rising 3 without Keiji Inafune so there is a spark of hope for Mega man. & guys please o ask nintendo to buy the rights to mega man we don't need ANOTHER reason for people to tell nintendo to go 3rd party.

(Warning: This review is by a person who is not picky about what games said person plays.)(You have been warned.)DuckTales: Remastered""A-woo~oo"" indeed.As part of a Disney-loving family, I watched DuckTales reruns growing up until some older siblings got me the first season on DVD. Some would say it's one of Disneys better animated shows, and I'd agree with them. The original DuckTales game for the NES was also one of the only games I ever played on the NES.But enough about my backstory...let me tell you why I like this game. Gameplay The gameplay is incredibly smooth. The controls are basically the same as that of the original NES game, said controls being Left, Right, Jump, Duck, Pogo Cane, and Menu Access (unless you play the game with Hard Pogo on, then you need to press Pogo Cane and Down at the same time in midair). Due to this, it's most likely best to play this game with some sort of controller instead of the keyboard. On top of that, you stop where you think you should stop when you stop, which is a great mechanic for me due to some past experiences in games (curse you past experiences). The gameplay itself is as simple as the original; collect the diamonds, defeat the enemies, fight the boss, get the treasure. Some elements have been added to this remastered version, such as completing set tasks before progressing in the level, less or more items being available on different difficulties, and a few mini bosses to name a few. Story This game is filled with story while also being true to the story of the original game. Basically, there's 3x more story. I'm also someone who just loves a good story. It's not great, perhaps, but definitely good.You might as well be watching a DuckTales episode instead of playing a game because this game has voice acting and animated 2D sprites. With subtitles...if you want. The voice acting was done by all members of the original voice acting cast of the TV show that were still alive at the time the game was made. It's quite nostalgic, to be honest.It all makes it feel so much like the TV show, all the way from Scrooge and Glomgolds rivalry to Launchpads strangely stupid antics. Levels If theres one thing that's the most like the original NES DuckTales game, it's the recreation of the levels. Almost every aspect of the levels have been faithfully redesigned into the game.They're in 3D...which is nice.The enemies, items, bosses, obstacles, etc. are in the same places as they were in the original,  with a little bit of rearrangement (well, as much as I can remember anyway).The remastered levels are also very pleasing to the eye. They're just so beautiful and colorful...Some things have been changed, like how to leave levels, for example. Launchpad isn't in his usual spot to give you a lift back home. Instead, you can leave a level whenever you want via the pause menu. Along with this, their's cutscenes and dialogue in various places throughout the game that replace walking up to a sprite and reading the text box that follows. Secret areas and hidden diamond locations remain the same...I think. It's pretty simple to tell where diamonds might be after a level or two, especially if you've played the NES version before.There are also two new levels added to this game. The Money Bin, which is a tutorial level, and Mount Vesuvius, which replaces your returning trip to Translyvania to fight the final boss.The game is a bit time consuming on the harder difficulties. I'd say it takes about 15-20 minutes per level on easier difficulties and 30-40 minutes on harder difficulties and that's if you're not speeding through it. Music Music...one of my favorite parts of a game.The main menu theme, the redesigned levels, the new levels...I love it all...which means I'm not the best person to tell you how good the music is. I don't trust myself enough with scrutinizing music because I like it too much.The remastered versions are basically the same as the 8-bit ones but with less 8-bit electronic sounds and more...well...modern electronic sounds. The Translyvania level music even has some dubstep in it. You can switch between the two soundtracks at any time you want.  Graphics I, for one, do not care much about graphics. I'd rather have a fun time rather than concern myself with how the game looks.I will tell you that it's a MAJOR improvement from the NES version from 1989-1990...because 2.5D is better than 8-bit as far as games based off of TV shows go.So colorful...so animated... Extra A little bit of extra stuff that doesn't really fit into any other category... The only glitch I ever found was a game breaking one. The game would freeze upon defeating the final boss and I would have to close the game and restart the level. Incredibly frustrating when I was doing my Extreme Difficulty run. The only fix I found for this was upgrading to Windows 10. No idea why. There are 4 difficulties this time around. The new difficulty is Extreme, which requires you to complete the game without dying AND in one run. It's exactly like the original game. It's also a pain if you want all the achievements as well. It has Steam Achievements and Steam Trading Cards. Yay! There's an Art Gallery where you can view concept art and the like for the game and the television show, as long as you have the money to unlock them. You can dive into Scrooges Money Bin. It's quite entertaining. Conclusion DuckTales: Remastered is a throwback to the early 90's for those who were alive at that time (myself not included) and to those who grew up with Disney and an NES (myself included).It is an incredibly faithful recreation of the original game and a great homage to the television series, which, coincidentally, is being rebooted in the Summer of 2017. I hear David Tennant is playing Scrooge McDuck. My life is complete.It's a very enjoyable, short-ish game meant for children, but is still fun for older Disney kids and avid NES lovers nonetheless with difficulties tailored to all ages.Now where are the DuckTales 2 and Darkwing Duck remastered versions? I mean, really...they should be things.			"

												Sometimes remakes are done right. DuckTales: Remastered is a great example of a remake that does 2 things very well: meticulously adhering to the source material, as well as adding new elements to appease veterans of the original. This game features outstanding updated graphics as well as fantastic remixed versions of the original soundtrack. In addition, the levels have been changed enough to challenge old and new players, with small differences in level layout, as well as modified boss encounters that ratchet up the difficulty. My only complaints of the game are that the final level tends to drag on a bit, and that you must essentially ""grind"" for money via numerous playthroughs to unlock all the extra artwork and music. Oh, and I really wish they had included the NES original as an extra feature. But, as it is, DuckTales: Remastered is a great platformer for fans of the original or new gamers alike.			"

												I never played the original Ducktales on the NES, but I'm quite familiar with the show, and I feel like I can say with a degree of certainty that anyone who is a Ducktales fan will walk away from this game with a smile on their face.The moment you see the cartoon-accurate sprites and hear Scrooge and his nephews talk with their original voices from the 80s cartoon, you will fall in love. It really does feel like a long lost episode! Of course, when you replay levels, you won't have to go through all the cutscenes again... and you don't have too, thanks to a scene skip option! (My only wish regarding the cut scenes was that there was an option to turn off the subtitles.)It can be bit a bit brutal at times, depending on what difficulty you're playing it on (with some deaths feeling like they weren't your fault at all), but you will feel a great degree of satisfaction when the credits roll. I heartily recommend it for anyone who was curious about the NES original or is plain straight a Ducktales fan. It really is quite the nostalgia bomb!			"

												Honestly, this is one of the better games I have played. To be honest, I don't remember much about the original version, I was really young. But, I can say that this version is masterfully done, and is worth the money spent. So many people are fans of ""indie"" games, especially with their low price and compact playstyle. But, this is a big studio game with the same appeal, and the differences are evident. Though it plays like and costs the same of an indie game, it's not buggy, very optimaized and masterfully crisp. Those are things we look for as gamers in final production. Instead, we always excuse it because ""indie developers"" aren't as trained or financed. TL;DR, amazing game, great content, great replayability.			"

												DuckTales is a solid platformer.  I unfortunately missed playing this as I was growing up and even now as an adult the game did a great job of engrossing me into it (at times it almost felt like I was playing through a cartoon show).The graphics are great and the cartoonish effects help make set the atmosphere.  Controls were solid as well.  I had forgotten how difficult some of the early platformers could be and the initial challenge was unexpected and welcomed.A full playthrough of the game on Normal difficulty took me about 4 hours.   There are quite a few unlockables that will require multiple playthroughs if you want to unlock them all giving this game some replay value.  The cutscenes were probably my favorite part of the game as I can't remember any recent platformer I've played that has made me feel like I was playing through a TV show.  I strongly recommend this game.NOTE REGARDING BUGS:  I only experienced one bug - I had a game ending crash during the boss cutscene in the transylvania level.  The game seemed as if it had paused itself during the beginning of the cutscene and when I hit start to try and skip the cutscene it completely blacked out forcing me to restart it.  I turned down the resolution for future playthroughs and that seemed to do the trick as I was able to finish both the level and the rest of the game without any other issues.   "

												If you loved the original, you'll love this game. WayForward have reunited the voice cast and effectively remade the NES classic for today. Jake ""virt"" Kaufman has done an incredible job remixing all the original songs as well as creating new tracks that are just as memorable as the old ones. The controls are responsive and I never felt like a death was because of anything but my own bad decision or reaction to a foe.There's some notable differences between the difficulty levels I appreciate, as well. Besides enemies dealing increased damage and your maximum health meter being lower, the (new) mapping function is disabled on Hard. Conversely, on Easy, you have infinite lives, so you never have to restart a level over unless you choose so yourself. There's a multiplier for the rewards found per level based on difficulty, however, and said money (as well as the art & music unlocks) are retained between playthroughs, so besides the achievements, you have something else to shoot for once you've completed it the first time.If you want something that plays like the good ol' Nintendo days, but looks and sounds like it was ripped right out of the Disney Afternoon, then it's worth taking a trip to Duckburg. Woohoo!			"

The graphics is good, the music is redone with modern quality, the controls are simple and accurate.

												Life is like a hurricane here in Ducktales Remastered!  This is an enhanced remake of the (at least for some) classic Ducktales game for the Nintendo Entertainment System.  An old fashioned platformer, that game has been transformed into something more, while still remaining true to it's roots.  The game has a new introduction/tutorial stage, a new final stage, new sprites and stage models, an animated, hand-drawn look, and a new overarching story of why Scrooge and the boys are off to gather random treasures (a story which was not contained in any real measure in the original game).  It also has voice work from almost all the old cast from the show (Flintheart Glomgold's voice actor had died, and was replaced with the current voice actor for the character).Each stage is a typical platformer game stage, where items are collected, enemies are jumped on (pogo'd on is more appropriate of a term) and areas of spikes, jumps and secrets are traversed in order to get to the end of the stage where a boss battle always lurks.  The changes are interesting: the player now has a map a la Super Metroid and the like, items that must be collected in many of the stages to progress further, and hidden life-ups to add a heart of life in each stage.  Each stage also plays like a mini episode of Ducktales, with a story beginning and end cinema scene.  Then, that stage becomes locked until you beat the game, after which you can revisit basically any stage.  The game is solid, the nostalgia factor is high, the run time is short ( I have 70% of the achievements and I've only played it for about 5 hours) and it's a beautiful and fun game.  For some people, $15 might be a bit much for the game (I remember getting it on sale for at least 50% off), but if your nostalgia factor is high enough, this is a great game at any price.			"

This is a beautiful remaster of an NES game, Duck Tales, from 1989. This platformer is a joy to play, a wonder to view, and a good time all around. While at times the story is lackluster and even childish, it still treats the player as a competent person. Compared to the original NES game, it's an upgrade!Art StyleThe art style features beautiful backgrounds and hand-drawn character animations. Every area and every character is incredibly detailed. In fact, that is what makes this game so great: the attention to detail. The game combines 2D characters with a very subtle 3D environment, which makes the experience immersive and areas fun to explore.Voice ActingThere is voice acting for all of the dialogue throughout the game -- and while the main character, Scrooge McDuck, occasionally spouts a catchphrase or rattles an idiom, it is done tastefully, sprinkled throughout instead of forcefully frontlined. All of the voice actors are amazing, including ones that were brought back from the original 80's show.StoryThe story is, as before mentioned, lackluster and sometimes childish -- but it serves its purpose, and overall is forgivable. It doesn't hinder the gameplay, and in many cases works with it to create tension and purpose. There are plot twists, villains, supporting characters -- it doesn't lack content, but perhaps quality.SoundtrackThe soundtrack is phenomenal. It takes the already amazing original NES soundtrack, and completely updates it, while also adding new tracks that sometimes exceed the original! There is even an option ingame to switch the soundtrack to the original 8-bit -- and this also includes new 8-bit versions of the added tracks.Level DesignThe level design is great, making areas fun to explore, with enemies sprinkled throughout, and each ending with a boss. It's the same basic formula for each stage, but there's just enough variation to keep you engaged. There are multiple secret areas, lots of hidden gems, and great enemy design.GameplayThe game isn't very difficult, but do note that there is a slight difficulty ramp at the end of the game. You'll probably die the most at the end; it is definitely a worthy boss battle. After you finish the story, hard mode will be unlocked, and you can replay the game in said mode. You'll get a lot of hours out of the gameplay, all enjoyable and definitely replayable. While sometimes frustrating, the controls are usually quite pleasant.ConclusionYou'll appreciate this game if you played the original version as a child -- but you'll appreciate it without as well. A worthy remaster with respect for the source, it's just simply delightful, surprisingly beautiful, and a seriously good time.			"

												I am so done with this game. I have to hand it to Capcom. They lifted the whole classic NES experience to the pretty HD era. Including the punishing difficulty. I'm all cool with that. I grew up with this stuff. Learning the level is part of the game. I'm all game. But, even now, you don't put a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t lava escape climb after the final boss to kill you dead despite having won. No, I managed after a zillion tries, but my opinion on this game now skewed. So before I go full hate, buy it if you want some old school platform action and catchy music.			"

												This game is really good and nostalgic, got goosebumps once i heard the intro music,reminding me about how much fun i had playing the original game before 20 years, the gameplay is nice but this game got a bug by the end boss,its always freezing and no one taking care,10/10 for the Nostalgia -9000 for wasting my time on the end of the game,trying to finish this 10 times but failed alwaysCRAPCOM FIX YOUR GODD@MN GAMES AT ONCE =_=EDIT: im changing my review from negative to positive because some people found a way how to get past the end boss,the trick is disabling 1 procesor from the taskmanager,this is how to do it in case you're stuck and don't know what to do:task manager>Processes>Ducktales>right click on the mouse>Set affinity>disable 1 procesor and youre good to goits worth buying the game			"

												DuckTales: Remastered is a fun (as long as you play on Easy Mode) 2D platforming game that has been Remastered from the old NES version. The art and graphics are very sharp and look great; furthermore the sound and music are outstanding! Besides the classic theme song, some of the other music is very well done which I was suprised to hear in a game like this. The game is fun and somewhat short if you play on Easy mode; on increased difficulties this game can be very difficult as you have limited lives, less health and if you lose all your lives you have to restart the entire level and lose all your money you have collected so far in the level. This game brings back those good old memories of watching Disney's DuckTales by letting you play through one of their adventures.			"

												4,5/5This game made me feel so nostalgic: these characters from childhood, music, interesting storyline where you play Scrooge McDuck. And in this game you can swim like him!It was really fun to explore the map, find treasures and have a fight with bosses! So why it's only 4,5/5?Cause for me last mission (ending) with Magicka was really hard. After 20 minutes of playing I feel myself so angry and nervous that all happy moments are gone.  Generally, I like this game and recommend to have it:) And also I very like CG: models and animation are pretty good!			"

												ENGLISHThis game looks like it's going to be a fun and an easy game. BUT if you going to play it on expert, then it's going to be so hard that you go to the local grocery store and buy whatever makes you happy again (in my case: salted licorice and chocolate).One thing that is positive is that it doesn't matter how many times you get kissed by that giant vampire duck (because I didn't realise that you need to duck to avoid it), Scrooge McDuck is still going to have his happy face put on! :DSVENSKADet här spelet ser ut som om det kommer vara ett roligt och ett kul spel. MEN om du kommer att spela på expert, då kommer det vara så svårt att du far till mat affären och köper vad det än är som gör dig glad igen (i mitt fall: saltad lakrits och choklad).En sak som är positiv är att det spelar ingen roll hur många gånger du blir kysst av den där jätte vampyr ankan (därför jag förstod inte att man måste ducka för att undvika den), Farbror Joakim har fortfarande sitt glada ansikte på! :D			"

												DuckTales, woohoo! Every now and then, we lucky kids who grew up with 8 bit games, get to see a personal favorite reborn with the kind of graphics we always thought they had.  Capcom has delivered with just such an experience in this game.  Filling the screen with beautiful artwork, the storyline of this game remains true to the original, once more giving the fans of Duckburg a front row seat to the show.  The voice overs are perfect, the character cameos just right.Perhaps my favorite part of the game is not in the gameplay itself but in the extras like the ability to take Scrooge Mcduck to his vault to dive and swim in with his money. That same money can be used in game to purchase some behind the scenes looks at the concept art, including comparisons between the 8bit Scrooge and his Steam counterpart.  Gameplay is exactly as you would expect, but if you want a gorgeous walk down memory lane, it worth nabbing while on sale.			"

												This is my first review in Steam... I'm going to effort to express English (Because I'm a Mexican).This game is a (obviously) a Remake of the NES Game ""DuckTales"", a classical platformer made it for Capcom (I miss you Capcom) based in a cartoon with the same name made it by Disney. Well, this game was developed by WayFoward, who actually some people know WF for make Contra 4 and/or Movies and Cartoon adaptations in Videogames, actually I know WayForward for make Shantae games and the Mighty Series (Mighty Flip Champs, Mighty Milky Way and Mighty Switch Force 1 and 2). This game, for be a remake, have high quality in graphics and Soundtrack than the Original 8-bits game.This game have good animations in the Character sprites, like a modern version of the cartoon. The controls are simple, and I like it, because, for being a Classical Platformer, no need a lots of buttons for play the game, also, the controls in the game they are completly responsive, and that make the game frustrateless.The gameplay is good for me and for Gamers who likes Scroll Platformers or, posible, not like it so much. The problem of the game is the replay... Complete the game make it boring for playing for some hours, but for me is not a problem, because I like platformers, and that not make me boring.The soundtrack... Oh god! I'm just going to say 2 things: The Soundtrack of this game is the 2nd game with the best soundtrack I ever hear (the 1st was Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney) and my favorite song in-game is Mount Vesuvius and the Escape in Mount Vesuvius. Also, they are added new OST for the new stage and the game, like the Mount Vesuvius and the Escape, the Final Boss, Intro Stage, etc. and possible to change the Soundtrack for this game into a 8-bits songs, and the new songs (except the Final Boss) have its 8-bits version.The differences between the 8-bit and the Remake: All the bosses (including the Final Boss) have a boss theme, in the Remake, The Final Boss have a different boss theme. At the moment to defeat the Final Boss, in the 8-bit original, you just need to get up using a rope, and the Remake have obstacules, make it hard for some players. The boss battle are simples, because limitations of the NES, and the remake make the bosses a little hard than before. The Final Stage in the 8-bits game was Transilvania (again) and the Remake, the Final Stage is the Generic Volcano-themed Stage who people loves, named Mount Vesuvius... And that's all I know the differences... Because I never play the original from NES, but I see some videos in Youtube. D:My opinion? This is a good old school game for play, the game is a platformer, but different to other Scroll Platformers, this is a good remake for the fans of the cartoon or the NES game. Also, its have some old school """"""bugs"""""" like the dissapear of some object if you move the screen.Well, that's all... Yeah, this is the worst review ever!			"

												I remember playing the original on the NES, and at about 10 yrs old I never finished it.Than I found it here and breezed thru the Easy setting in a single sitting.The game overall is good. It plays almost exactly like the original, the only difference I remember being the cane jump. There was not option to make it a simple push of the button on the NES.The new levels are very good as well and while the end, ie the race to the top, is similar, it is much harder.The voice acting is very good as well and brings back memories of the animated series.The extras are nice and add some replayability as do the different difficulty levels. If you like to go for 100% than this will take up a good chunk of a time to do so.Of course my favorite part is the Moon level and the music upgrade is very good. On top of that the extra piano mix during the credits is nice as well.My suggestion, if you've played this on the NES, get it here but do it like Scrooge would and wait for a sale. It's a remake of the original and the extras are not quite worth $15 in my opinion.			"

Before you couldn't do that, but now you can.The music is memorable and I find myself sometimes just listening to the music in the background.This is a must buy for anyone who likes platformers and nostalgia.

												Just a friendly WARNING to people thinking about buying the game. People are having trouble when you get to the final boss fight and defeat him, the game freezes and cannot be fixed. So you cannot finish the game and get the achievements after putting in the hard work required to get to the end. There is a thread in the forums if you want more information. It may not happen to you, but I just feel you should have the information before purchasing because STEAM and CAPCOM won't be mentioning it but they WILL take your money.The game is very enjoyable (much like the NES version) and I was very happy with it up until that point. I hope someone will create a fix so the unlucky people who encountered the problem will be able to finish what they started.			"

												A stunning remake of the NES classic!  It expands the original levels greatly while retaining all the trademark mechanics (pogo cane!!!) and hazards.  It also injects a lot more of the lore from the original cartoon than did the NES version, and they even got the original guy to do Scrooge's voice!  I don't need to tell you how great the high res sprites look.I played the NES version to death when I was a kid and watched the Ducktales cartoon about every weekday throughout grade school, so I think I am qualified to say this:  Ducktales:  Remastered is a terrific platformer and a ton better than the original.  WayForward really cared about the source material (both game and cartoon) and it shows in the polish!(NES Ducktales veterans must play this on hard.)			"

												This is a remake of the NES version which I played a long time ago. I you have never played this game before I would recommend starting on Easy as Normal is quiet hard and can be frustrating.The graphics are very nice and suit the game. It's best played with a controller. It will take around 2 hours to finish, after that you can try other difficulty modes.It's a platformer, so it's best played with a gamepad. I used the Xbox 360 controller and it works flawlessly. As it's a remake of a NES game you only use 2 buttons. You can jump and jump with your pogo-stick to kill enemies.In the forums I read that some people can't finish the game because it crashed sometimes. With my setup (Win7 64bit + AMD R280X) I encountered no crashes and the game played flawlessly.			"

												4/5It's 1987 again!Duck Tails: Remastered, delivers exactly what it promised; a beautiful looking game that hasn’t lost it’s integrity.That’s right…   all the characters, levels and bosses you loved in the first game are here. In fact the game is pretty much exactly the same as the original.  Don’t let that fool you though. While your ear-drums are reliving the 80’, your eyeballs will be entranced by the beautiful artwork. And the voice acting is absolutely amazing!Great for kids and young gamers, as well as seasoned veterans; and if you used to run home from the bus stop to catch the show, like I used to…  It’s like a time machine with a controller.(controller recommended, but not needed) "

I'd give more details but I don't want to spoil it incase you've never played.

												This game is a lot of fun, the hole time I was playing I felt like I was a little kid again. Alan Young was the best with his voice acting and it was awesome and him being over 90 years old, it was fantastic. Not that many people get to reprise there rolls at that age.I will say the worst part about this game is starting a new game undos all of what you unlocked. I wish I could change the difficulty without undoing all of your work. Still this game looks good and sounds grand, plays really good better then the Nintendo Entertainment System version.  Even knowing Alan Young is not with us any more I would love Ducktales 2 to be remasterd as well, maybe they could use the new cast for the 2017 show.			"

												DuckTales: Remastered is a solid and often fun old school platformer. When the game focuses on the actual gameplay it is a blast. Simple controls that you should have down by the end of the tutorial. However, the game slips up by adding annoying cutscenes (I skipped almost all of them) and sometimes sticky controls and collision detection. My biggest complaint is from the games ending though. After a fairly challenging boss battle the game throws something else at you that just didn't fit with the rest of the game and became annoying. I know these kinds of levels are common in platforming games but here it felt out of the place. The game up to this point requires very little precision and the tight spaces and short time the ending forces on you comes out of nowhere. Even as someone who has played many similiar games this felt cheap and just didn't fit the flow of this particular game. If you're a fan or veteran of these kinds of games then you'll enjoy this for what it is but don't go looking for depth or even a huge challenge. If you're new to this genre then I suggest going with a more Shovel oriented platformer that used this game as it's inspiration.			"

												Game hard crashes when fighting a final boss. You need to play on lower resolution, windowed, with process priorities set to low and still you need to pray for the success. If not for the amazing music from the last level (with the whole soundtrack on consistent, high quality throughout the game, by the way), I wouldn't attempt to try the last level +15 times to ultimately beat it.Plethora of needless, pace ruining cutscenes and the oddities with difficulty balance would leave a serious mark on this otherwise simple but decently made game, but the consistent crashes on the last stretch tips the scales. I'm not the only one with those problems. If you have rather new NVidia graphics card, you are risking buying the game that you could not beat.It's a shame, because it's really a honestly done remaster with lot's of heart put into it (sometimes even too much - those cutscenes are EVERYWHERE), but I ultimately cannot recommend this game.

												I've never been hit with so much nostalgia in my life, Hell I got run over by it. This game is absolutely done to perfection. The music, the game itself, it even feels like a movie in the duck tales universe. Buy it, play it, love it!Blathering Blatherskites!			"

												Let me start by saying that I have experienced no technical difficulties at any point while playing this game, but according to other reviews there seem to be issues for some people.In short I would probably give this game an 8/10 point rating.The graphics are simply beautiful, the soundtrack is awesome and the gameplay is exactly what you'd expect if you've played the NES game. I do feel like the game sometimes eats my inputs, but the only time that was actually a problem  was the escape after the final boss. You also stop shortly when you land after a normal jump, which is kind of annoying at times.I would not call this a remaster. I know where they are coming from, but this is technically a remake. A lot of things feel familiar, but others just seem completely different. I personally don't have an issue with that, but it's fair to say that this is not 100% the same levels you played on your NES. The biggest changes are the two added stages and the boss battles. You have now a short intro stage that introduces the plot, and instead of going to transylvania again for the final boss you get an actual final stage here. The Boss battles, while still resembling the originals are a lot longer and the bosses are usually bigger. Again, the final boss has probably the biggest changes, adding a lot more variety and making him actually somewhat difficult on your first few tries.However the game has one big problem, and that's the cutscenes. They are really well done, with, I think, all of the TV series cast and while I do enjoy them there are simply too many. Or more specifically there are too many minor ones inside the stages. When you collect important items there's always a cutscene, even if it's just a small monologue by Scrooge. I can understand mthem at some points, especially when there are other characters to interact with like scrooges nephews or Webby. But some are simply unnecessary or go on for too long.But despite this I think the game was really well done and, despite it taking me only a bit over 4 hours, is absolutely worth it's money.			"

												Warning Paragraph ahead:So before i continue this ""review"" i would like to say that i never played this game in its Nes form.Im sure the game is practically the same just (obviously) new graphics.Even though i was born in the era of amazing stories and endless beat em ups and shooters i still love myself a 2D side scroller and this game was the perfect little game to pick up for relativley cheap during the steam summer sale.So the story for this game is that scrooge Mcduck's vault was attacked by the beagle brothers to take a peice of art that Scrooge had.When Scrooge comes to stop them he finds out that the beagle brothers were after a treasure map.Once you Decipher the map you find 5 locations where the treasure is hidden these places are Translyvania,TheHimilayas,The amazon Jungle,African Mines,and The Mother ♥♥♥♥ing MOON! So in this story you play as Scrooge Mcduck(pretty ovbious if you saw any trailers/gameplay)And his 2 attacks are mario style jumping on enemies heads and whacking rocks at the enemies(In my opinion definitley alot more fun to jump on their heads)Throughout the game you find gems to increase your cash and ice cream and cake(and cake) to refill your health and Characters from the show like Huey,Dewie,and Louie(scrooges grandkids)You also see Duckworth the butler and Mrs. Bentina Beakley. Back to the health topicSpeaking of health one of my favorite things is that you have infinite life so you can mess up as many times as you want(like i did)(ALOT) and you wont get penilaized for it which i think was a great addition to the game. In my time in playing i had no negative comments to the game besides the fact that you cannot change the controls from UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT,to WASD it lets you change it but doesnt keep it when you get into the game.Beside that small thing i really enjoyed this game and thought it was a blast to play and definitley a fun time for people who like classic 2D sidescrollers			"

												i doubt i'd recommend this even if not for the widely mentioned game-breaking crash after the final boss. it's certainly charming but i found there wasn't really enough to get all that much enjoyment out of it, and some of the level design choices left a lot to be desired - there was more than one occasion where i would backtrack or come out of a secret room to find an enemy had respawned in a position that meant i HAD to take damage from them before i could get past. i also find it strange that every single gem is invisble and has to be walked past before it appears, meaning you end up doing a LOT of walking back on yourself at sometimes inconvenient moments if you're trying to get everything. it all comes together in a way just makes it a very unfortunately not fun experience.i would 100% recommend the soundtrack though			"

												First off actually this is a yes review, because i ducking love DuckTales, it's all about jumping on a cane and ducking those ducky enemies right out of duckhell. The Game contains an easymode, for the stoned players who can't jump straight, you pretty much can't lose in this mode. Then the Medium difficulty in which lets you have some continues, and then it's game over.I played the game through and arrived at the last level, duck, that was a ride. And then boom last screen, tension intensifies and DUCK DUCK DUCK!!! WHAT THE DUCK!...It crashed, i tried it 5more times and DUUUUUCK DUCK DUCK DUCK this godducked ducking game...Well i guess it's just me, the games awesome but i'll never kill that ducking boss nor finish the game :(			"

												Okay, so i will start off by being honest and say i am not always a fan of remakes. Sometimes (for me personally) they fail to capture the nostalgia of the original and often lose some of the magic that was created. Having said that, i remember playing the original Ducktales on the NES many years ago and right from the title screen of the remastered version when that familiar music kicks in i was transported back to my 8 year old self again :D Rather than add several new features which sometimes make these classic games so much easier, the creators of Ducktales remastered have done a wonderful job in capturing the charm and feel of the original whilst making sure the level design is just as challenging. Updated with modern looking graphics plus the original voice actor who played Scrooge McDuck in the cartoon (the later really adding a lot to the remake) Ducktales Remastered is a great example of how a remake should be done. If you were a fan of the original back in the 90's then you will love this game :)			"

												What might have been an excellent game ended up being just OK. Don't get me wrong, up to the final level the game is beautiful and I played it with a big grin on my face because it brought back memories from my childhood when I watched the TV Show.When the fight with Dracula takes place, after you beat it, a game breaking bug occurs, namely the game freezes although the music is still playing and you have to kill the process. To fix it, I had to set the processor affinity to one core and when beating Dracula and the animation starts, immediately pause the game and select Skip cutscene, allowing me to continue the game.Before the game ends there's what must be one of the worst designed levels I've seen, not necessarily because of the idea behind but because of the unresponsive controls and the unusually bigger hitboxes around the blocks that make you fail. It was impossible to play this level with my controller (although I played the rest of the game with it) and I had to finish the game with the keyboard. The chain and lava sequence is exceptionally bad because the character refuses to stick to the chains when the corresponding button is pressed and if the key doesn't register you fall down and need to restart the sequence. So you end up needing to press repeatedly the corresponding key when jumping from chain to chain, hoping that one of the presses sticks and the character doesn't fall down. This never happened with the chains outside this area, just with those from the last sequence.I'm not sure why the controls in the last level are so bad, but my guess is they are intended like so to increase the difficulty in a synthetic manner. Or maybe it was another bug. I don't know, but this killed the enjoyment for me, because having to redo the same sequence over and over again because of broken mechanics, in my book, it equals to bad design and not a fun experience.So, let's cut to the chase:- Do I recommend it? Yes, up to the last level, then it's up to your luck if the game behaves or not.- Should you buy it? Only on sale. I got it for about $4.5 and I think it was worth it.- Is it a fun experience? Definitely, up to the last level when, if you have a short fuse, you might end up rage quitting it. I'm usually quite calm, so I finished it although it annoyed me a bit. But take this as a warning if you have a quick temper.Also be warned, the game might break for you and you might not be able to finish it because of the Dracula fight's bug. To be honest even so, you don't miss out on anything and you're still left with the best part of the game minus the annoying elements of the last section.These being said, it was a nice experience although with some quality defects.

												This is a hard game to review; because while it's by no means a trainwreck, it's lacking in every aspect of what I felt made the original game for the NES so good. I played the original when it first came out as my older brother got it for christmas, so my heavy bias of childhood nostalgia will probably make the motivations for not recommeding ""Ducktales: Remastered"" quite different from someone getting into Ducktales now, through online buzz, hype and word-of-mouth. The aspects that made the original so great for me were the tight controls, the fast-paced gameplay and the memorable music.  In this game, all three of those aspects fall short of living up to the NES version. I tried playing the game with the keyboard at first, but that turned out to be nothing short of a horrid experience. The wonky hitboxes were made much worse by the *extremely* sluggish controls. You could hit enemies with your pogo stick and still take damage, while killing them at the same time. Also, some areas require you to abort your pogo jump mid-air to not hit the ceiling or an enemy waiting at the top of the screen, which with the keyboard controller was just blind luck as the game hardly ever responded fast enough, making you overjump or underjump woth little to no fault of your own. Getting a gamepad helped out a bunch, making the game playable again, with a barely passing grade. However, barely passing isn't good enough for something which purports to have remastered the NES version. Rose-coloured glasses aside, going back to the original, you *clearly* feel a difference in the controls. The response time here just is not up to the standards of a 22(?) year older game, and that partly ruins the experience.In regards to the fast-paced gameplay, I'm again sad to report that the remake falls short by leaps and bounds. Every other minute you are rudely interrupted from playing the game by it just pausing to play a cutscene. I found an option to turn off cutscenes, but even with that option active you will still find yourself annoyed by constant roadblocks on every part of every level. They add nothing to the experience, it's just a completely unnecessary (shoe-horned in) storyline that goes against the very concept of the game, to send you on a action-packed, exploration and treasure seeking adventure. In this regard the remake gets a failing grade, it does not live up to the original.The music is a matter of preference. Either you like it or you activate the original soundtrack. I found the remade music entirely pointless. It felt way over-produced and intrusive, like they felt they had to change it for the sake of changing it. The original soundtrack is, in old-school gaming circles, almost legendary. There's no need to ever change from it to the new, inferior stuff in my opinion. Additionally, it's worth mentioning the extremely wooden and lifeless voice acting job. The voices aren't bad, you can clearly hear who's who and whom they are supposed to sound like, but it's just so incredibly uninspired and unengaged. Makes the jokes fall flat and it completely drains all energy out of the gaming sections between cutscenes.I can't recommend this game for these reasons. It's got sluggish and irritating controls, bad sound and choppy and uneven gameplay. It got everything wrong about what the original got right, and it doesn't add anything of value to the NES game. You can watch a playthrough on youtube instead of wasting money on this game. Or, better yet, play the (again in my opinion) far superior original to this pale imitation.			"

												I missed this one the first time around when it was released on the NES. All I knew about it was the legacy, beloved by many, memorable music, and the cartoon it was based on. Was it all deserved? Yes! It's a classic Capcom platformer from an earlier time. If you've never played it before, it's not too easy. If you're an old fan, it's probably a familiar treat, and worth the price either way.			"

												The minute this game starts and the familiar sounds of the Ducktales theme begins to play, I knew I was in for a delight. If you're a fan of the old tv show, and platforming type of games, then Ducktales is definitely for you. All of the right nostalgia notes are hit perfectly. The sounds. The looks. The original voice actors doing the work. It's fantastic. I felt like I was watching a lost episode as I played through it. I've heard complaints that there is too much dialogue and too many cut scenes, and maybe there is, if you hate a game to have a story. But me? I absolutely loved it, and was always curious to see what would happen next. No, this isn't a note for note remake of the old Nintendo classic, but then what would the point of that be? If you want the old game, play the old game. The remaster aims high, trying to be true to the source material, while also doing its own thing. I think it succeeds. This is a really fun game to play. The platforming controls well, and the puzzle aspects of the game aren't too difficult. I will say that the challenge does ramp up a bit towards the end, but it's nowhere near as tough as the old 8 bit games of yesteryear. Ducktales isn't a super long game, and can be played through in a few hours your first time, but there are achievements, leaderboards, and plenty of things to collect that provide replay value. I recommend this game to anyone who likes platformers, or the old Ducktales cartoon, and give it not pony tails or cotton tails, just a big thumps up. Woo Hoo!Rating: 45454025691010 Lucky Dimes out of 45654045684060.Verdict: Go play it.			"

												I loved this game on the NES back in the day, when i heard they were remastering it i was so excited to see what they would bring to the table and i was not disappointed i noticed people were saying the game was crashing on the last boss but it seemed fine to me i never once experienced any problems with the game.Pros.Great art styleReplay value for getting all the gallery itemsMusic is fantasticGreat voice acting.Cons.Only one it wasn't long enough haha'If you love platformers then this game is for you especially if you played the original game on the nes.So i give this game a 9.5 out of 10 the .5 being because it felt too short to me apart from that i cannot fault it whatsoever.

												Fun game, brings back many memories. The game has great visuals the songs were revamped and sound very good. Overall a good buy, however I played through the game using a xbox 360 controller and often found that the game would not respond to pressing the jump button in many spots and jumping between ropes/chains/etc was very difficult using the analog stick on the controller, It seems not to recognize the right/left and up simultaneous movements. The combination of these two made the last climb in the game very frustrating. This may have just been my setup/controller. On the Dracula boss, I found that the ""bat crush"" was nearly impossible to center the character as not to get hit while using the analog stick. It feels like testing was rushed on the last portion of the game. Having said that, if you played and enjoyed the original then you should pick this up.			"

												This is how ""remakes"" or in this case: ""remastered"" titles should be done. The original game was solid aside from it's obvious NES limitations, like color palette and awkward text-based storytelling in the corner.WayForward took the original game's foundation and didn't fix what wasn't broken; Scrooge's arsenal is still just his cane. What they did do, however, is expand the original levels in a method that is fitting of the source material, take the original music and orchestrate it, nab the surviving voice actors to act out their rolls (the only changes are Flintlock, Gyro, Fenton and Mrs. Beakly, all whom have passed away) and redo all the art assets with Disney talent assisting with staying true to the style of the show. The attention to detail is pretty amazing, and without a doubt this is the best Disney game out there.WayForward even, against all odds, managed to get a DuckTales appropriate story to go along with the original game's pieced together story, and it works pretty well considering. Not only that, but they managed to keep the difficulty of the game, and ramping it up in some parts. It's refreshing that the game isn't tuned down for the 21st century, as it really is a classic. If you're a fan of DuckTales (in my case: it's my favorite Disney franchise) and enjoyed the original game, $15 is going to be a steal for this sort of opportunity. The game is short, so it's value drops considerably if you're not a fan of the show, the old NES game, or platformers in general, but it's definitely a mechanically solid and fun game, and worth your time if you've missed Duckberg these last 20 years.

												Originally a game for NES, DuckTales: Remastered does its job perfectly. DuckTales and DuckTales 2 were my favorite platformers and my childhood was built on them. They had solid controls and cool boss fights.DuckTales: Remastered is a full overhaul in graphics and sound but still has that perfect DuckTales feel into it.The controls and gameplay are the same. The character controls perfectly and the pogo stick attack obeys your every move accurately. You still kill the enemies like you used to in DuckTales NES. The developers made great choices with this.For the graphics, it looks cartoony and cute. It fits and is a perfect modern look for the original NES title. The animations are excellent, even top notch. The 2D and 3D environment are blended together perfectly and the result is a perfect soft smoothie.The sounds and music are the most amazing part of the game. They are so perfectly remade. The SFX were brought into the future but they still have the nostalgic feel. It is the same with music. The music might even be funkier than ever. Some themes had slightly unnecessary wub wub but mostly they're as glorious and magical as in the old DuckTales. On top of all this, the whole thing is fully voice acted and it is marvelous.DuckTales: Remastered is worth every cent. I'm a hardcore FPS gamer and terrible at platformers but DuckTales: Remastered was really easy to pick up. It's all in all an excellent and hilarious game. I have no complaints. I recommend this to anyone. You're never too old for Duckburg and DuckTales.			"

												I just noticed Duck Tales: Remastered was on sale for $5.  That is the most I would recommend that you pay for this game.  In terms of what you are getting, there are two aspects to this game: (1) a very simple 2-button side-scroller kids game and (2) nostalgia.  Some gamers will value one more than the other; some will want both.  I value DuckTales: Remastered at about $2.50 for the genre and $2.50 for the nostalgia, in comparison to other games out there on Steam.The emulated version of the original Duck Tales game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) back in the late 1980s is available for free on the internet and is legal to download, own, copy, etc.  You can play the 8-bit version and compare it to this one.The obvious differences you'll notice in this version offered here on Steam are the upgrades to the graphics and sound.  Hence, for a very simple 2-button side-scroller kids game, you will be able to expend a few hours of your life hopping around and trying not to get hit by things or to fall into pits.  However, this genre of 2-D, 2-button, side-scrolling kids action means that you won't be developing your character (such as ""leveling up""), or carrying around an inventory of various items, or solving challenging puzzles.  Instead, you will simply be jumping and bouncing on top of bad guys, occasionally golf-shotting less than 20 rocks all game.  Very straightforward; very simple; not a bad way to spend your time, especially for $2.50.In terms of nostalgia, this particular game (the ""Remastered"" version) is unique for a few different reasons when compared to other games on the market, especially of the same genre.  For starters, it's based on a wildly popular Disney cartoon series from about 30 years ago, and they even brought back the voice actors of the popular series to do some voice-overs for this game (during the cut scenes between stages).  Also, Duck Tales: Remastered is a faithful rendition of the original NES game, which itself was a smash hit.  The familiarity of the simple gameplay and kids action genre will remind you of what it was like to play games as a younger person.  Essentially, playing Duck Tales (the original or the Remastered versions) will make you feel like you are participating in a Duck Tales cartoon episode.  For $2.50, that's pretty cool for a few hours of your life.  I analogize this to buying six episodes of the show on DVD, for example.So if you only prefer simple kids games but don't care about the popular Disney cartoon series or the original NES version, then I'd recommend that you get this game when it finally goes on sale for $2.99 or less.  If you are nothing but a lover of popular Disney stuff (especially Duck Tales) and/or love remakes of great old-school video games, then I'd recommend that you get this game when it finally goes on sale for $2.99 or less.  If you are a diehard fan of both the genre and the associated nostalgia, then I'd recommend you pay no more than $4.99 for Duck Tales: Remastered.  (And I'd also recommend that you legally obtain an emulated version of the NES version in either case.)			"

												The game is great.As a huge fan of Donald Duck's world, I certainly found this very entertaining. The soundtrack is splendid, makes the game go much more with a flow through the levels. Though, as many other writes in their reviews, the crash at the final boss makes the game more or less unbeatable for us Nvidia users. Not much one can do there, except for playing on another computer or switching to an AMD graphics card. The ""not recommended"" tag is for the crash, and the crash only.			"

												DuckTales: Remastered was a fun game. I had a great time playing it. It was challenging (on Hard difficulty), the voices and animations were what you would expect from the original cartoon series, with the same voice actors and actresses when possible (some have passed away since the show was on).I was all set to recommend this game, except that I can't pass the game. It freezes every time, immediately after I defeat the final boss and am about to go to the final scene. The forums show that many, many other people have the same issue, where the game crashes at the same spot. This is a definite bug in the game, and it will never be fixed. The game is old enough that it will never be patched. There is a good chance it will happen to you if you purchase the game.If Steam gave me a 1-5 scale, I'd give this game a 3. If you want to have fun playing through the levels and accept that you'll never pass the game, you can have fun with this game. I just don't want to endorse it because this problem was reported dozens and dozens of times, and it will never be fixed. Therefore I have to give this game a NO.			"

												To be honest, this game is pretty great.  The blend of 2D and 3D art is perfect and the animations are nothing but superb. The game plays well like an old school action platformer and though the story is simple and silly it has the Disney charm making it fun to play through.So why I am not going to recommend this game to buyers?Well the game played great for me throughout the first 5 levels, but on the last level, right before the last boss, the game crashes.   I mean, honestly, what frustrates me the most is that the crash happens right before the last boss, RIGHT BEFORE!  No matter what I do, reinstall game, skip cinematics, sacrifice a horned toad to the gods of computer crashing, nothing.  I cannot finish this game!   So therefore, I cannot recommend anyone to buy it.   I have read this issue happens to some people, can't really say a lot of people, but surely some.   Maybe you'll buy this game and nothing will happen and then you can come back to this review and mock me for not being able to enjoy the sweet relief of a plot twist being unraveled.   Then again, maybe you'll run into the exact same issue I have, or worst.  In any case, buy this flawed gem at your own risk.  If anything, wait to  get it on sale discount and keep it in your library for when technology will be advanced enough to fix whatever issue is going on with the last boss.  That's if by then, our robot overlords will even show any interest in fixing this instead of destroying humanity. Toss a coin before hitting buy.			"

												Don't get me wrong. DuckTales: Remastered is a whole lot of fun and the time I spent playing it was greatly enjoyable. The problem is that in its current state it likes to crash at the final boss meaning you can work your way through a particularly difficult level, and then be forced to quit and start over for whatever reason. This happened to me twice and there doesn't seem to be any word of a fix in the future.Pick this up on a console if you own one. Otherwise skip altogether.			"

												I cannot recommend this game to anyone.  I loved and played the original NES version many, many times.  Sadly, that version is still superior.  The only thing the new version does is add TONS of annoying and unskippable dilagoue that is corny, cliché, and predictable. The controls are pretty awful on a keyboard and they change the plot, tweak the music, and the cutscenes (which there are far too many of) are agonizing to watch.   Their idea of replay value is having you buy pictures of the original art and awful concept art sketches with the money you earn in game.  These sketches could be done on a napkin or wet toilet paper.  It's horrible.  The last level is frustratingly difficult and you thankfully have infinite lives but it's still annoying.  Also, it is NOT a direct remake. They changed the graphics, various levels, how you warp back to translyvania etc. and also changed every end boss.  This game is unspectacular enough to fail to wow new converts with the simple gameplay and the massive amount of corny cutscenes is sure to annoy the target audience gamer that is now 30ish and played this back in the day.  Remember the Amazon level?  Well, it's almost the same except now have have to Pause 8 different times for an annoying cutscene that you cannot skip where scrooge rips on the helicopter pilot in obvious and cheesy ways.   I loved the original ducktales and cannot possibly recommend this piece of sucktales, no matter how cheap you get it on sale for. AVOID!!!			"

												Dispite what a lot of people would probably believe, this game is not purely a nostalgia title. I, who never played the original title OR watched the show, still thoroughly enjoy it. It's a simpler gameplay style that I personally find more enjoyable than a lot of what's on Steam right now. However it is best to play with a controller because the keyboard layout is slightly confusing. Another issue I have with this game is that it isn't perfectly omptimized, and it lags through cutscenes and blinks the characters sprites nonstop on my computer. Lastly, the collectibles in the mansion feel a bit shoved in at last moment. Probably because they were.Four stars out of five.			"

												As someone who grew up playing the original on NES and its cousin on the Game Boy, I was pretty excited for this game, especially when they announced it would be on PC/Steam. Plenty of decent reviews out there, so I'll limit mine to bulleted pros/cons that really stood out for me:Pros:-Devs stayed true to the exceptional controls, music, and level design of the original game, and with a facelift that made it look like the cartoon show, it was doubly nostalgic for me. Loved the voice acting.-The two additional stages from the original game - the Money Bin and Vesuvius - are fun, though the latter far more so than the former. Especially where Vesuvius was concerned though, I wanted more.-Boss battles were all great fun.-You can swim in the Money Bin. Not the game's strongest point, but I've wanted to be able to do that since I got the original game when I was 10.Cons: -I really would have liked more or different stages. I would hope that if this game is a financial success, that they'd consider making another with more original level designs.-Cutscenes. I liked the attempt at a bigger story, and that story isn't actually bad, but the cutscenes are long, boring, and with all the wonders they did with the graphics, it would have been nice to seem more gestures, lips moving, etc.-At an MSRP of $15, it's a little too short, especially since much of the game is material many of us have played before. Might be worth it if you're a big fan, but for the casual platform fan, I'd wait for sales. Overall, it's worth a look if you're either a huge DuckTales fan, or if it's on sale, looking for a fun game to spend a weekend with. "

												I've never watched the DuckTales TV show, nor played the original game... but as soon as I saw the trailers I was hyped. The game is a remaster of the NES game DuckTales, with a beautiful new stylised look in HD. Not only that, but it has new modern remixes of the older tunes which sound great. The new cutscenes that were added have full voice acting by the original cast, which is an impressive feat in itself. Alan Young as Scrooge McDuck is still as good as always, and it's a joy to hear his voice acting.The gameplay itself is exactly the same as the original NES game, which isn't a bad thing. The controls are solid and never feel unresponsive. The game itself feels like a new game, especially to somebody like me with no experience of the original. I found myself loving every moment, and I really connected with the characters and the world they existed in, despite having no experience of DuckTales previously.My only gripe is the game's length. Despite the new level at the start of the game, the main story is only 2.5 hours long. The good thing is that you can choose to unlock all sorts of concept art and sketches for the game using the money you gain by playing the levels. Replaying levels never gets old, and there's an option to turn off cutscenes automatically if you want to just play the game, and also an option to have the original 8-bit music in the levels. I feel like I'll get many more hours out of the game just for the fun of playing the game.If you're a fan of the DuckTales TV show, or the video game, you must get the game now. If you've had no experience with it before, but are interested, I recommend that you wait for a sale and pick it up then, as the length may not be enough to satisfy. Personally, I'm glad to have the game in my library.			"

												Long ago, in the dark ages, I rented a video game based on a Disney TV show that frustrated me.  It was hard to get the controls right, and it was very challenging.  But I played it more, learned how the pogo jump worked, and rented it again, then owned a copy.  There were a lot of NES games, but this one lodged itself into my brain with a love and hate.  So of course, it's wonderful that Capcom has decided to revisit Duckburg again, not with yet-another-reboot, but a remaster of the original game.  And this time, they really brought out some of the old shine.For those who weren't around back then, Duck Tales was an animated series in the late-80's that focused on Donald Duck's three nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie living with their other uncle, a Scottish billionaire named Scrooge McDuck, who took them around the world on adventures seeking rare treasures.  It was crazy, absurd, cliched, and typical Disney fun, and I've got fond memories of the show.  The game follows the same premise.  Scrooge is travelling around the world (and the Moon) looking for five of the rarest treasures.  Many of the recurring characters from the show find their way into the game, the nephews and Webbigail, Ms. Beakley, The Beagle Boys, and of course, Magica De Spell.  While a few changes have been made to the game's levels and menus, the underlaying mechanics are unchanged.  The graphics, however, are far from NES.  The game has been completely reinvisioned in both graphics and sound, and it resembles (and surpasses) the original series it was based on visually.  This game looks great.  Musically, the sound in the NES version was always good, but it has been rewritten and improved entirely.  It's kind of a thrill to hear the old sounds coming out underneath the new recordings, it's there, but it's like you've never heard it before.One welcome change was the addition of new cutscenes featuring the original Duck Tales voice cast.  Much of the challenge has always been learning to use Scrooge's only weapon, his cane.  The remastered version contains an ""easy pogo"" mode, which I have not tried.  Mastering Scrooge's two main moves is the key to the game, and even then, the game is a challenge.  This game is of course a Capcom platformer, meaning many of the same pitfalls and traps you could expect in an early Mega Man game are here.  Endless waves of apes jumping over obstacles, stalactites falling from the ceiling, floors falling from underneath, as well as some other interest ideas that would be found in other games, like riding in a mine cart.  And at the end of each level, the boss fights have been completely reinvisioned.  The bosses are bigger, tougher, and scarier than before.  So what you get is a classic, pretty hard NES game, For those who played the original game, or grew up watching the late 80's/early 90's Disney shows like Duck Tales and Rescue Rangers, this is going to feel really nice.  I'm not sure younger gamers will fully appreciate a show that's been off the air so long and a game with old school difficulty (not Contra-difficulty, though).  But personally, I'm really enjoying going back to Duckberg, and I've got the theme song stuck in my head again.Life is like a hurricane, here in Duckburg... "

												I bought this mostly due to nostalgia but damn I wasn't disappointed xDThe difficulty in this is definitely just as perfect as the old original (I played on Medium, there's also a hard mode) and while they've changed a few things in the level layouts most things remain the same (hidden rooms included) =) The reworked backgrounds and sprites are great.The added story bits doesn't hurt either, makes it a bit more like episodes on the old cartoon and explain things like how breathing on the moon works, whould have been pretty awesome if they had actually made short animated clips instead of just text with voice over, but I think I'm asking for too much xDAs far as I know the VA for Scrooge in this is the same as in the old cartoons, despite that guy being ancient by now =DThen there's the music. Dear god, the music! I was afraid they'd risk ruining the old amazing soundtrack but, no, they improved on it! I really love all the reworked songs I've heard so far and I've played all levels except Himalaya =)If you loved the old NES game or if you want an old school hard platformer in a flashy new suit then grab this game!9/10 - Would give a 10 but I game overed on bosses so many times that I feel I need to get back on the game somehow xD			"

												DuckTales Remastered is a great throwback to when games were platforming platformers where you formed plats. Seriously though, this remake is bright and vibrant compared to the original NES game. The gameplay is not too difficult (no matter what others may say) and there are a few issues here and there. For example, others complain about the cane pogo stick not working at times. I find that the times that the cane pogo stick doesn't work is when you are close to an edge. Not all edges mind you, just most of them. In one of my videos, you can see where I hit a block and destroyed it and the block above it did not fall down. Okay, okay. Maybe that is just one of the NES game's quirks. However, then I swing my cane at the empty space below the floating block and then it comes falling down? Doesn't really make sense, but hey it's a game about a bazillionaire talking duck... so there's that.Basically, pick this game up. It's great gameplay and fun colors are more amusing than strangling a Webby duck.PS: The original voice of Scrooge McDuck does the voice here as well. Congrats to 93 year old Alan Young and I hope to God you do the voices for a DuckTales 2 Remastered!			"

												This game brought back a lot of nostalgia from my NES playing days.  The music and art that showed the 8 bit versions of the game were stark reminders of how far gaming technology has come in the last 15 years.  The game play is crisp and faithful to the original.  My only suggestion would be to include an unlockable version of the original NES version of the game.			"

												Pros: Ducktales: Remastered has gorgeous art, a fantastic soundtrack, and is just a super-fun casual game. I've played through several times, and I still occasionally come back to play again. Additions and alterations to the original content are by far positive.Cons:Occasionally, the controls are not as responsive as it seems they should be (pogo and grabbing). The final level is also notoriously frustrating due to this issue. Despite this, I still highly recommend it.			"

												This review is mostly aimed at those who enjoyed the DuckTales NES game and cartoon, as I did, because I won't be able to objectively divorce my review from my nostalgic love of this game.Score: 9/10This game was made for us.  And, by us, I mean we people who grew up with DuckTales, both the original game(s) and cartoon, both.  I really don't think there are words for how gratifying it is to see the adventures of Scrooge in all the remastered glory that this reimagining of a timeless classic has managed to provide, but I'm going to give it a shot.First, the graphics.  Not every game should strive for photorealism, and DuckTales is a perfect example of one such game.  As a licensed game depicting a cartoon, I have almost zero complaints about WayForward's presentation here.  It truly feels like you're both watching the cartoon adaptation of the game, while still being very involved in its progression, as the player.  Backgrounds are beautiful, and while mostly static, they do an excellent job of immersing the player in the cartoon world in which the characters reside.  Animations are fluid, sprites are beautiful, and everything looks familiar, and yet brand new.Second, the music.  DuckTales had exceptional music even when you had to play it on the NES to get your fix, so the team that was tasked with remixing and rescoring this game really had big shoes to fill, but they didn't disappoint.  Every song is reminiscent of its 8-bit counterpart, which is to be expected of a remake.  Not all remixes are made equal, mind you, and some are clearly better than others, but that's not to say that there are any bad songs in this game (in my opinion).  Some music is so good that I had to stop to enjoy it at the start of its respective level (looking at you, Moon Theme, and Mt. Vesuvius theme).Third, the gameplay.  The gameplay is largely unchanged from the original NES game, but that's not necessarily a complaint.  Some levels are just as unforgiving as their original counterparts, but the game itself is easier in general, due to some quality-of-life changes made by WayForward.  These changes include being able to save progress in between levels, or simply being kicked back to level select upon losing all of your lives, as opposed to having to completely start over from square one.  Having something to spend your hard-earned money on is a new gameplay element as well, which may lead you to make stupid decisions in certain levels while trying to find every hidden diamond (I sure did).Fourth, and possibly the most importantly, the cutscenes.  The biggest thing that WayForward added to this game is this considerable source of exposition.  When you played the original NES game, there was no backstory given or reason delineated for why Scrooge was doing what he was doing, other than greed (which is not entirely out of character).  The cutscenes provide that important missing element, which really, was the only thing that I found wanting about the original DuckTales.  The voicework is wonderful.  The incomparable Alan Young, who is well into his nineties now, does a masterful job of reprising his role as Scrooge McDuck, and much of the original cast also returns to bring life to this amazing game.  Perhaps the most important detail about the cutscenes, though, is that they're entirely optional.  This stops them from getting stale for those of us that plan on playing this game several times over.Scrooge, Huey, Dewey, Louie, Webby, Mrs. Beakley, Launchpad, Bubba, Gyro, Fenton, the Beagle Boys, Flintheart Glomgold, and Magica De Spell are waiting to greet you once again.  What are you waiting for?			"

												As someone whose first videogame was DuckTales when I was 4 years old, I was excited about this remake ever since it first made its announcement.  I am very happy to say that I was not disappointed.  DuckTales Remastered is a perfect example of how to do a remake of an old-school game.Controls are exactly the same to the point of my muscle memory working perfectly, the option to turn Hard Pogo on or off is a godsend, the music may be rather busy for some but I personally find to be a fantastically expansive soundtrack, the characters have all of their personality back with most of the original cast coming back in full flawless form, and lastly the difficulty still remains as an honestly tricky game on some parts.If you think this is just the same old game from the NES, you're wrong.  It's even BETTER than that, with more expansive levels, mission objectives, a helpful little map system and a much more involving story that's just as kooky and carried away as the old episodes themselves, DuckTales Remastered made me relive my entire childhood in the span of just hours.  Buy it.  Love it.  Like a hurricane.			"

												I got this game expecting a simple remake of the NES DuckTales game (which, to date, remains one of my favorite NES games), only with better graphics and music. I didn't expect that they would put in a coherent plot, voice acting, and the overall feeling of an episode of the television series. It felt like I was watching one of my childhood shows again!For those who haven't had the pleasure of playing this game's predecessor, I will say that this is geared towards a younger audience. If you have kids just learning to play games, this would be a fantastic choice. It may be a bit juvenile for some other players. That said, if one can't get past that to enjoy a well-engineered playing experience like this one, there's not much else I can say to persuade you. This is a great game.			"

												The gameplay lengtheners are so ♥♥♥♥ing pointless. in the final level you have to beat dracula duck and that boss takes forever it takes at least over 15 lives to beat him and once you beat him you are greeted with another stage and after that you are greeted with another boss battle where you have to beat magica and goldbulm  flying up to get your no.1 dime and magica has transformed into a vulture and goldbulm is hanging by her legs and you have to race up some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t platform area while they just fly up really fast. after that you are challenged with a  part where you have to constantly move up to avoid the lava which is consuming the floor. and i can't tell you what happens next because i won't complete this game.]o. if you think this game is worth buying because of a nostalgia rush, don't. you will be very very very dissapointed.

												Remember that awesome Saturday afternoon TV show about Scrooge McDuck and the adventures he had with his three nephews? Remember that awesome NES game they made about the TV show which you probably picked up at somebody's garage sale, and it ended being one of the best games the NES had to show? Remember that remake you always dreamt of?......So now that the DuckTales remake you always wanted is here, the question is, ""Did they deliver?""NEStalgiaIt's all there. The music, gameplay, bosses, enemies, characters, treasure, loot, gems, the Moon, and everything that made the NES game great is in Ducktales: Remastered. However, they did change a few of the level layouts and parts of the story to make the game interesting to those who are re-visitng from the NES game. The biggest changes are in the beginning and in the end of the game where they added some stuff (sorry, no spoilers).Gameplay*Gameplay is fluid and controls almost exactly like the original. You control Scrooge McDuck who attacks by jumping on enemies with his cane. When he lands on the ground or on an enemy with his cane, he bounces off, causing him to continually bounce in a pogo-like fashion for as long as you hold the button down.*Most beginning parts of levels are very similar to the originals, but the later parts are extended and have added sections for longer play.*You start off with the option of beginner or medium difficulty and unlock harder difficulties as you progress.*The 2D hand-drawn sprites are beautiful as well as the 3D modeling for the stages. Original Disney artists Mike Peraza and Rick Evans drew the backgrounds.*Even the steam achievements are well placed and add a depth of challenge to the game.MusicOnce you beat the game for your first time, you have the option to switch between the awesome remixed versions (default) or the original NES soundtrack! What more could you ask for!?Story*The plot is somewhat basic but features most of the Ducktales cast you know and love.*Voice actors - Alan Young is still the voice of Scrooge! He's ninety-four years old! The characters Duckworth, Launchpad, and Magica De Spell are all voiced by the original cast.  *If you didn't come for story, cutscenes are skippable.So... ""Did they deliver?"" My answer would have to be, ""Oh yes they did!"" So much so that I would recommend this to everyone who loves a good platformer and not just people who played the original.			"

												This game was so much fun. A nice change of pace from more ""modern"" and ""complex"" games, just go in and enjoy yourself for a little bit. My only real complaint is that it's short. Only took about 3 hours to beat, but I'd expect it to be geared to a younger and less gaming-experienced crowd. Still, hilariously fun and a good trip down memory lane. I'm hoping the developers decide to make sequels. They'd be a must-buy for me.			"

												An excellent remake of one of my favourite NES games, DuckTales: Remastered is just like playing an episode of the cartoon. With most of the voice cast intact (including all of the main characters), beautiful animation, and a brilliant re-imagining of the classic Capcom score, the 'feel' is intact. Of course, this all would be for naught if the gameplay wasn't up to snuff. Thankfully, aside from a few quirks here and there, this is a very capable platformer.			"

												I must admit this was purely a nostalgia buy because of my fondness for the movie.  Who wouldn't want to swim in a vault full of treasure?  Never played the NES version so I can't say if this version is easier or harder my guess would be easier since older games are typically more challenging.  The visuals look great and the music is quite catchy, you even have the option to play the original 8 bit music.  It was a little challenging at first but after a few playthroughs it wasn't too tough of a platformer.  I love the fact that they had the original voice actors who were still alive to do this, and it is quite a roster of cartoon legends.    So basically if you have any good memories of Scrooge McDuck and his pals it is definitely worth the 15 bucks.  For people who have no connection with it, you should wait for a sale since there really isn't much to do beyond playing the game on different difficulty levels.  One straight playthrough took me an hour and a half and that was with finding treasures/extra lives.  Overall an average platformer without the nostalgia factor, a must buy for those who's childhood involved the richest duck in Duckburg.7/10			"

When you played the original NES game, there was no backstory given or reason delineated for why Scrooge was doing what he was doing, other than greed (which is not entirely out of character).  The cutscenes provide that important missing element, which really, was the only thing that I found wanting about the original DuckTales.  The voicework is wonderful.  The incomparable Alan Young, who is well into his nineties now, does a masterful job of reprising his role as Scrooge McDuck, and much of the original cast also returns to bring life to this amazing game.  Perhaps the most important detail about the cutscenes, though, is that they're entirely optional.  This stops them from getting stale for those of us that plan on playing this game several times over.Scrooge, Huey, Dewey, Louie, Webby, Mrs. Beakley, Launchpad, Bubba, Gyro, Fenton, the Beagle Boys, Flintheart Glomgold, and Magica De Spell are waiting to greet you once again.  What are you waiting for?			"

												The Good: The game looks good, plays well, and sounds even better than you remembered.The Bad: The length. This game is short. I beat it in 3 hours. Granted, I played on Easy, but on normal you'll likely beat it in 4-5 unless the last board trips you up as that is a PITA.The Bottom Line: Great game for fans of the show. Great game for fans of the original. Great game for kids. Get it if you are any or all of those things.			"

												As someone whose first videogame was DuckTales when I was 4 years old, I was excited about this remake ever since it first made its announcement.  I am very happy to say that I was not disappointed.  DuckTales Remastered is a perfect example of how to do a remake of an old-school game.Controls are exactly the same to the point of my muscle memory working perfectly, the option to turn Hard Pogo on or off is a godsend, the music may be rather busy for some but I personally find to be a fantastically expansive soundtrack, the characters have all of their personality back with most of the original cast coming back in full flawless form, and lastly the difficulty still remains as an honestly tricky game on some parts.If you think this is just the same old game from the NES, you're wrong.  It's even BETTER than that, with more expansive levels, mission objectives, a helpful little map system and a much more involving story that's just as kooky and carried away as the old episodes themselves, DuckTales Remastered made me relive my entire childhood in the span of just hours.  Buy it.  Love it.  Like a hurricane.			"

												This is a really good game with the same 8-bit thrill I used to have with NES-clone many years ago.100% met my expectations.I can tell this firmly after having completed the game.Good:+Just like it used to be and has to be: fun and joyfull gameplay; neither long, nor short; nice background story properly integrated within the game progress.+Runs alright on low-end systems if you slightly lower the resolution and screen filtering (I have laptop with integrated 128 Mb video memory, 3GB RAM and Intel Core2 Duo @ 2 GHZ CPU and I have experienced very seldom framerate drops)+Can be played on keyboard, gamepad is not a must at all+Great escalation curve - the game is gradually becoming challenging but never becomes stressfull+100% family friendly+Good secrets and achievements system - you don't have to spend hours for fruitless attempts to keep discovering secret ares and unlocking achievements. Maps layouts in general are very smart in this respect.Good community guides are already avaliable to fascilitate the progress.Can't call it 'bad', probably 'minor flaws' will answer it better:- can't skip dialogues or speed them up (at least I've failed to do so). But is it a serious isse?Would recommend for causual players, platformer and cartoon enthusiasts, and for sure to take a new look at nostalgia themes.			"

												It's a cute game. Recommended if you played the original for the gameboy. Otherwise, I would only recommend this on sale. The graphics are nice, the difficulty level is actually still quite high (for modern games) but at least they added a respawn instead of the old instant death gameover. Still not really a game for kids. Graphics are fine, music is great, voice acting on point. Unfortunately it won't take you more than 2-3 hours to finish and the replay value is zero. In fact the only thing you can do is unlock a few gallery pics, sounds and to fill the treasury by collecting more money. But the levels are all the same and it will take you more than 5 playthroughs to see a visible difference in the collected money and gold. Play it once, spare yourself the perfection.			"

												I liked this one. It's a remake of the classic NES Ducktales game, which was a really good title back in the day. The game is pretty loyal to the original. It reuses a lot of the old enemies featured in the original, giving them a 21st century makeover with some really nice looking 2D drawn graphics. Also featured heavily is the famous pogo stick mechanic which stood out in the original version. It adds a lot to the game and it's fun to do.Ducktales is very rich in Ducktales lore. It features many of the characters from the show and there's a storyline behind the whole game that's told in a series of voice acted cutscenes. Amongst the voice actors is Alan Young who voiced Scrooge McDuck in the original cartoon, too. The game isn't very long and doesn't take much effort to beat. I imagine it'd be a great title for kids to play. However I did play it through on Easy mode as I was looking to enjoy it rather than punish myself with a tough play through. It may take longer and be more frustrating on the higher difficulty settings.In terms of replayability, if you're not interested in trying or you started out at the harder difficulties, then there's a fun little side quest to do where you use the money you earn whilst playing each level to buy art work and music. It's a nice little extra but it isn't essential to getting the most out of the game either. The art work is mainly concept work. There's an entire gallery dedicated to the characters of the game, which features how they used to look in 8-bit form in the old game. I thought this was a nice touch.If you liked the original, or Ducktales in general, I'd recommend you check it out for sure. If you haven't played the original and don't care for Ducktales, I'd still recommend checking it out if you can get it at a cheap price as it's a fun standalone game.			"

												This game is a nostalgic wet dream.  Plays exactly like the original NES version.  I only have two gripes. One is the volume of the sound.  It's loud and I (unless I am blind) do not see an option to adjust the volume.  The second is everytime you pick up a key item to a level it enters this cut scene that you can't skip.  Worth the buy?  Hell yes.  BUY IT AND EMBRACE THE AWESOME NASTAGIC TIME YOU SHALL HAVE.			"

												A fun nostalgic trip down memory lane.  As a kid in the 80's the disney after school cartoons were something to look forward to and ducktales was perhaps the crowning gem in the line-up.  So there was very high expectations from Capcom when a game was announced for the NES and they delivered beyond expectations.  This remastered version captures the same outstanding gameplay as the original but with added bonuses for the nostalgic.  Story and cuts scenes have been added and feature a lot of the original cast and everything, from the way the characters act to the scenarios, feel like it's from the 80's cartoon.I do have a few cons to the game though.  Everytime you play a stage you have to go through the cut scenes and while they can be skipped they are tedious.  Furthermore, once you are familiar with the stages the game is incredibly easy aside from the very last part that takes a dramatic jump in difficulty and ups the frustration level.  So my recommendation, if you love the original game then get this and enjoy the magic of ducktales once again.			"

												I never played the game this is a remake of, but I bought this because the original was considered one of the greatest platformers of all time. So is it still anything special by today's standards? Not really. It's a very basic platformer. But still, what it does, it does very well. And being based off the DuckTales TV show, it turns out to be a pretty cute little game (and I do mean little; it's a very short game). The original had little to no plot, but they came up with a completely new story to tie all the levels together and features several of the characters from the show (my only real issue with the story is that at times Scrooge seems to be a bit more of a jerk than he was on the show). Some reviewers who played the original thought the emphasis on story was a downpoint, but for me that may have been my favorite part. Without it, it's just a generic, if pretty fun platformer. Plus, these days it's getting harder and harder than ever to find someone who wants to make something that's just nice, like a video game that doesn't have bloodletting or edginess to it (ironically, if more people were to make games like this they would be the ones being ""edgy""). So, ultimately, I'd say DuckTales is a game worth playing, and a kind of game I'd like to see more often.			"

												I promised myself I wouldn't write a review until after I completed this game.I picked it up during the Summer Sale on a whim - it was late at night and my decision making process is kind of cloudy when I'm tired. I didn't really think much about the decision other than I had heard a few good things about the game - I have no experience with the series this game is based off of. My best friend likes it, and before he told me who Scrooge McDuck was a few months back during a game of Terraria I had legitimately thought that DuckTales was centered around Donald Duck. I had picked up what seemed to be a niche game through something that was clearly not my niche, is the point I'm trying to make here. Instead of just refunding it the next morning, like I did with most of my late night Summer Sale purchases, I decided to give it a go. I mean, why not? It was in my library and it could've been a right fun game for all I knew.What I got, however, was something I cannot consciously give anything other than a perfect 10/10 score. The gameplay is exciting and unique due to the pogocane, and the difficulty is always something that requires the player to have skill but is never unfair - even at the end of the final level, where I had spent the last 3 nights trying to complete, I found a way at the end that was right in front of me the whole time. It made the player earn victory but it did so without putting them in near-impossible to escape situations. The balance in the gameplay does this game so many favors, and when you top that off with the fun and exciting platforming then there's no way around it, you've got yourself a good game.It doesn't stop there, though, as the game features an endearing cast of characters to go with a fun and lighthearted adventure that made me feel like a little kid again - and I was born in '96. It isn't in the background to the point where it doesn't affect anything and can be ignored without any reprecussions, but it doesn't do anything to take away from what was clearly the focal point, which is the gameplay. While I won't say the story is a masterpiece, it doesn't trip over itself and it gets everything its trying to do very right. It's there enough to reel the player in, but it doesn't overstay its welcome.Another great thing about this game is the soundtrack - as it stands, I'd say this is my third favorite soundtrack in a videogame, behind Freedom Planet and Sonic 3 & Knuckles, respectively. The music gives off a grand sense of adventure on top of being catchy. There's songs that are jubilant and you can't help but smile when you hear them, and there's songs that are epic and makes you feel a burning desire to press onward and achieve the end goal. They couldn't have made the soundtrack more fitting - and no matter how many times I had to re-do Mount Vesuvius, I never got tired of that song. The soundtrack is excellent.This game has made me a DuckTales fan - I've found myself reading the comics and pondering whether or not I should watch the show at some point. Upon beating this game, I know I'm definitely going to look more into this series.I do have to recommend this game with caution, though - and it abso-♥♥♥♥in'-lutely breaks my heart to have to say that. Some people have apparently run into a nasty bug that can outright break the game, and while I was fortunate enough to have it not happen to me, the fact of the matter is that more than a few people have had it happen to them. Just keep that in mind if you're thinking about purchasing the game.Overall, though, my experience was easily a 10/10 and I would recommend buying this game at full price if it wasn't for the risk of hitting that bug. Definitely buy it while it's on sale, though. There's no doubt that this game was worth a shot and the only people who wouldn't enjoy it are those who are hit by that bug and people who just don't like videogames.			"

												I had lots of fun introducing this game to my son; he really enjoyed it, and it was just as much fun as I remembered.  The only downside is I wish there was a one-button skip option for the cinematics - they do get a little worn after the 10th viewing or so.			"

												DuckTales: Remastered is exactly what it says on the tin. It's a modernized and enhanced version of the 1989 NES classic DuckTales by Wayforward Technologies. Nostalgia is a big factor in liking this game. If you have played the original DuckTales on NES then you probably will get more out of this than others. It's still an above-average sidescrolling platformer with decent controls (use an XBOX360-gamepad if possible), great soundtrack and lots of fun moments. The biggest downside is it's short length.+Great soundtrack comprising of remastered classic songs.+Original voice actors from the Ducktales TV series.+A new last level.+Good graphics and animation.-Short, but then again, so was the original.

												""Good, but ultimately disappointing."" 7/10This game was an overall satisfying experience for me and I would most likely recommend it to fans of platformers in general, but in the long run, 'DuckTales: Remastered' just doesn't compare to the original. I'm not sure what it is, but something was lost in the translation; it just doesn't have the same charm that the original game had for the NES. But without comparing this game to the original, it's still an enjoyable experience. But how could I not compare this to the original? It's arguably one of the greatest games for the original Nintendo console, and tons of people, myself included, hold it near and dear to their hearts. So it's nearly impossible not to compare this 'updated' version to the original game that came out almost three decades ago.One of the biggest reasons this game doesn't have the same charm as the original, at  least for me, is the soundtrack. I know some people think they did a great job with it, and maybe they did, but most of the new versions of these beloved songs are just awful, and at times barely even recognizable. I would have been much happier with this game if they had just re-released the same game with the same music and just updated the textures, but whatever, it's not the worst thing ever. And I'm not sure if they went ahead and made some of these levels longer, but the levels feel longer, and sometimes for no reason at all other than to extend the time of play. And lastly, the cut-scenes; these initially made me dislike the game greatly as there are far too many of them, but once you realize you can skip them, they're not so bad.Overall, this game is good, but it could have been much better. If you've never played the original than you will probably like it more than I did. It's got everything you want in a solid title; the controls are tight, the graphics are crisp and look great in high resolution, it works perfectly with a controller, and the voice acting is very well done.

The right ammount of difficulty and fun!Now the problem I said was that it freezes at the final boss. I read that it is the newer NVIDIA drivers that cause this. It might not be fixed anytime soon.

												A cute, cartoony platformer. But don't be fooled by it's innocence; this game retains it's oldschool difficulty from the original.Easily replayable, I'm on my third playthrough now. Gallery unlocks are a small incentive to gather as much money as possible, but I figure that whether it included unlocks or not it's just great fun to find all the secrets in a level and explore to collect money from every nook and cranny. A fun storyline and fully casted voice acting do the original game so much justice. But most important is that the developers behind the game really know how to make an amazing platformer.			"

												Had this game when I was a kid, well I still have it....I have two cartridges of it. Whatever, point is this game kicked♥♥♥♥♥on the NES so I figured I'd try the remastered version out.The game is polished up with nice artwork and beautiful animations. The music, of course, has been redone and for the most part I think they did it well. The Himalayas have screeching guitars now, because if anything says the Himalayas, it's distorted guitar leads.The Moon I was slightly let down by since it's such an iconic tune in video game music, I figured they'd go all out on it. It's a great version of it, but I just wanted more. NOTE: The end credits has a piano version so hell yeah!They added a bunch of story to this game, being the old fart that I am though, I had no interest in why Scrooge McDuck is on the moon looking for whatever the hell it is he's looking for. I just want to bounce on my cane and collect gems.I did not encounter the gamebreaking bug so many people seem to have gotten, so I can't say anything based on that.All in all I think it's a good remake. If you're nostalgic for the NES version, I'd say this does a decent job since it's mostly the same with the boss fights being a bit more complex now.I give it 8 quacks out duck			"

												Ducktales wasn't a complicated game in 1989 and that remains the same now. You have a pogo cane to bounce your way through stages, open chests, stomp gorillas and then some. Controls are tight and the platforming is simple without being boring though higher difficulties don't amount to anything more than taking extra damage and having less health upgrades to find. I just really like bouncing around.This isn't exactly a long game either with a total of seven stages (the first of which is really just a tutorial stage) but if you're really into collecting art galleries and stage music, then there's enough of that to require multiple playthroughs so you can save the cash to do so.Presentation is obviously the game's selling point for all of you nostalgic folk. Excellent sprite work coupled with original voice acting from the cartoon series gives you just about the most authentic translation from cartoon to video game you could ask for. Also diving into the money pool is super rad.No in game volume control though? What's up with that?			"

												One can not describe the amount of nostalgia this game creates when you here that catchy DuckTales theme tune.The game, what is there to say. It kicks so much♥♥♥♥♥ From the level designs to the enemy roster and boss battles, this game has everything you would expect or want from a side scrolling puzzle-adventure.  Remastering this game was unexpected, but definitely a smart move. And adding  additional content, such as artwork and music is a great addition to the game.Overall, I would rate the game a terrific 9/10 and would absolutely recommend it to everyone who likes classic side scrolling action-adventure games.The game deserves an ""Staying True To The Source Material"" Award.

												I'm halfway through the game as I write this. Although I've played DuckTales 2 on the NES as a kid, I've never played the original version of its sequel. So even though nostalgia wasn't a big part of it, I'm glad to report I still find this game entertaining (and even challenging at times). However, I do have a couple of complaints:1. The 2D character sprites look great but they do not fit in well with the rest of the art (backgrounds, chests, gems, etc.), which is unfortunately 3D. IMO, they should've kept everything in the iconic cartoon style of the Donald Duck universe. This is by far my biggest gripe with the game.2. At the time of writing, I'm aware of two major bugs:(a) The level is not reset when you respawn. Hence, the baddies will continue doing whatever they were up to when you lost your previous life. This is unfortunate, as it means that losing your first hit point may be unavoidable. And while bosses do indeed respawn, their effects do not (e.g., if you die at the wrong time during the fight with the boss in the Amazon, the ground might still be shaking from when it slammed into it before).(b) Lots of people report that the game crashes for them when they reach the final boss. I don't know whether it will be the case for me as well but I thought I'd give you a heads up.3. Even though they were probably never a part of the original version, they should've added special-case animations for talking characters. It's a little silly to see them talk with their mouths closed.That said, I'm hoping for a remastered version of DuckTales 2.Cheers,Bogdan			"

I loved the original and have to say being able to use an Xbox Controller sure is easier on the thumbs then the NES controller was. :) Great voice acting and really well done graphics give this classic game new life.

												I'm not sure if it's just my crappy machine, but this game is incredibly buggy.  I never played the NES game, meaning I wasn't hooked on the nostalgia, and I never watched the show, so I had to look up a lot of the stuff here.  Much like the NES game, I often get a flickering effect with the characters as their sprites appear and disappear whenever a certain number of details are on-screen.  On top of that, there's the lag.  Oh sweet lord, the lag.  I haven't had a game run at 2 FPS since I tried playing TF2 at max settings.  As far as sound goes, I think the guys at WayForward did a decent job modernizing the songs from the original, except at the title screen.  As far as I could tell, the basic gameplay was faithful to the original, but as I mentioned before, it got really laggy.  Oh, and did I mention that it no longer works on my pc, thanks to a game-breaking glitch that crashes the game randomly during boss battles and whenever I leave the pause menu?  Wasn't worth the $14.99 just got a glitchy nostalgia-fest.  If you're into ""remastered"" games that try to be nostalgic for nostalgia's sake, then you'll love this.  Lord knows I didn't.  P.S.: I have nothing against WayForward, I just don't like this game.			"

												The economy has changed. It's no longer about stock portfolios, investment strategies or interest rates. It's an endless series of treasure hunts, carried out by millionaires and their nephews. The economy, and its consumption of liquid assets, has become a well-oiled machine. The economy has changed. Old, weathered ducks carry old, weathered canes, fly in old weathered airplanes. Lucky dimes inside their money bins enhance and regulate their cash flow. Currency control. NASDAQ control. Minimum wage control. Dracula control. Everything is monitored, and kept under control. The economy has changed. The age of gold prospecting has become the age of control.

Surely we all know the DuckTales Saturday Morning Cartoon Series on Disney along with the Treausre of the Lost Lamp Movie too. We'll Scrooge McDuck & his nephews are back in HD with DuckTales Remastered! Back in the 1980s, CAPCOM & Disney were a great Children's VG Combination.Anyway, this game is really fun-loving to play. It plays just like the Classic NES Version that we remember from Childhood. Visit Exotic Places across the Globe such as the Amazon Jungle, Castle Dracula, from the African Mines to the Earth's Core, the Himalayas & Even the Earth's Moon as you search for the 5 Legendary Treasures (Plus 3 Extra Hidden Treasures if you're Playing on Hard or Extreme Mode) and help Scrooge McDuck become the Richest Duck who would be King in all of Duckburg and the World!

												DuckTales: Remastered is an absolutely wonderful game. I was a huge fan of Disney comic books when I was a kid and I have many great memories of the adventures of Scrooge McDuck and company. WayForward did an amazing job capturing the spirit of the comic books and of course the 80s TV show. The visuals and animations are excellent and the writing and voice acting are perfect. It's such a joy to hear Alan Young in peak form reprising his role as Scrooge.DT: R isn't a long game, nor is it particularly challenging (except for the final level), but it's exceedingly well designed throughout. The gameplay is varied and the controls are refined and precise. The boss enemies in particular are very well crafted, with fun, pattern-based attacks and just the right amount of RNG to keep things interesting without being unfair. I can definitely recommend that anyone who enjoys platformers pick this game up, even if they're not familiar with the source material. DT: R is a rare gem that's perfect for young kids but also will easily keep adults entertained and delighted.			"

DuckTales! Woo-oo! It's a duck-blur!If you are an old school gamer such as myself, you may remember these tales of derring-do on the old Nintendo entertainment system ( NES ) or even the Nintendo Gameboy. Or even perhaps the cartoon series & comics. It was a pleasant suprise to find out that they brought this great game back to life with more passion and detail!Pro's: Beautifully remastered graphics & music. Voice-acting for the characters ( The Surviving members from the television series cast were included! ). Two new levels exclusive to Remastered Expanded story content. Harder difficulty levels offer greater challenges. Replayability due to difficulty levels and achievements. Purely a nostalgic experiance for those who have played the original title.Con's: Regardless of the little extra content and difficulty modifyers, it can be a rather quick play for adept platform gamers. I Personally felt that they could have included the old version of the game as a bonus or unlockable feature. The Theme song is just too damn catchy.. like seriously.. it's been stuck in my head for weeks now.. ""DuckTales Woo-oo!""... help! ._.If you have never even heard or experianced this game in its original state,  i would recommend giving it a go, or just go ahead and give this remastered version a shot. You never know, you may just get that song stuck in your head as well, while you bounce around on your pogo with glee.Get your Quack on!			"

This is the same game you once loved, with some new bells and whistles. Aesthetically perfect, with new cut scenes to add depth to unanswered questions from the original. The original soundtrack has been redone, and sounds fantastic...and they got most of the original voice actors from the cartoon to reprise their roles for this version. All in all... it looks great, sounds great, and most importantly plays great.			"

												Steam Library Playthrough Update:Last night I finished game #11 - Ducktales: Remastered.The first thing I noted was how gorgeous this game looks - the art is extremely crisp and clean, and it really feels like an interactive version of the TV show.Apart from the art, I also really enjoyed the gameplay - the platforming was solid and the controls were responsive and satisfying. I particularly liked the ""pogo"" mechanic which allowed you to bounce of objects and reach otherwise inaccessible places.I have two main complaints about the game however - one is that the cutscenes are very long, very frequent, and despite featuring the original voice cast of the TV show, the voice acting is annoying. I found myself skipping through most of the cutscenes because I couldn't take the voice acting anymore.The other (more minor) complaint is that the game was quite short for its $14.99 price tag, working out to $2.49 per level. I got the game on sale, so not a big deal, but had I paid full price for the game, I would have been unsatisfied with the amount of content.Rating: 75%			"

It constantly freezes everytime I get to the 2nd Magica DeSpell fight.Game cannot be completed!♥♥♥♥ Capcom... you used to be a credible company. Way to throw your reputation in the toilet. I'm sure you made enough money off of this game to fix a bug so someone can actually beat the game.I checked for fixes but it's impossible for me.I cannot reccomend a game that I cannot beat.

												If you played the original NES version, then you're in for a trip down nostalgia lane.  Great care has been taken to make sure every inch of this game re-creates the feel of the original.  The music and the level design all take a page from it's NES sibling.  The downside, which is a shame, is the inclusion of the original voice actors.  While it's extremely cool, it's also a detriment to the game.  It really does stop the action when these cutscenes begin and they go on for too long.  Otherwise, the game is well worth the price of admission.			"

												Good and entertaining remake of a classic with some inherited and some added flaws.The remastered DuckTales music draws you right into the game and you are eager to ""press start"", though you might encounter the first hurdle here, if you don't have a supported (read an Xbox360) controller. (Installing a utility like x360ce or xPadder helps, the keyboard is also an option on the PC of course.)The graphics are great, especially the animated sprites and while some reviewers criticized the comparably small number of different animations, especially noticeable in the cutscenes, I think it's fine for the scope of the project. Talking about the cutscenes, I consider them an added flaw, they are too frequent, interrupt the gameplay unnecessarily and require two button presses to skip them. No need to borrow the weak way of storytelling of a modern FPS in a classic. The voice acting is well done and the cast is mostly from the original TV show.I like the new 3D backgrounds as well, and I don't see why some reviewers think they wouldn't match with the sprites. The environments are clearly readable, which is important in a game like this.The uneven difficulty can be considered an inherited flaw, the levels vary greatly in difficulty, and the first on the list, Amazonas, surely isn't the easiest. When you play the game on ""Easy"" it's not too much of a problem, because you have infinite lives (making the mode arguably ""Very Easy""), but beginning on ""Normal"", it can become frustrating, because if you run out of lives, you have to restart the whole level, all treasure gone. Though if I remember how many times I smashed my NES controller onto the floor, this remake is true to its roots in this aspect.The game is also really short and most of the playtime can be attributed to the overall unforgiving difficulty once you play on ""Normal"", ""Hard"" or the unlockable ""Extreme"" setting. Gameplay wise, the biggest addition compared to the original is a tutorial level at the beginning.DuckTales is easy to recommend, not only for the nostalgia, but because it's a very good game for the price. Sure, the cutscenes, will annoy you and the difficulty mixed with occasional hick-ups in the controls will frustrate you from time to time, but hasn't it been like this also 2 decades ago?Next stop, Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers, WayForward?

												I actually have the original NES version of this game sitting in a shelf behind me. This was one of my favorite NES games when i was a child. At the time the cartoon was very popular over here in Sweden so there was no surprise that even the game did well.I was a bit worried at first when i saw that they were making a HD remake of a childhood memory. The first videos i saw made me go in to a nerdrage over how soulless the game seemed to be. It honestly looked like a crappy flashversion of my favorite game. But when i saw it for a good price on GMG i had to have it in my collection, just so i could say i hated it, which i diden't.This is a really really good remake of the classic game. The graphics, even if they were very different from the original, still felt really good. The controls were spot on as with the original and the music, oh my god the music. It is said that you dont mess with the classics, but the composers handled the original soundtrack with the outmost respect and made new classics of them. The new additions in gameplay also worked pretty well. They had to redesign some of the levels and for the most part it worked preetty good. The only downside is the mandatory tutorial level in the very beginning of the game. It's irritating when you are trying to beat the game for a second or third time, or when achivement hunting. But overall this ia a great game. They really gave the respect needed for such a classic game and made our old gamer hearts fill with a warm feeling of nostalgia.			"

												DucktTales: Remastered is a fairly good game that for the most part captures the awesome that was in the NES version.  There is alot of changes in this game.  The story is more fleshed out in a good way, it almost feels like a long lost Ducktales cartoon episode (with faithful voice acting included.) Its been awhile since I've played the NES DuckTales, but I swear the level design on some of the levels have changed as well, with even some added new levels at the beginning of the game and somewhat at the end.  I will say that the controls don't feel near as tight as the old verison, but not bad enough to not recommend the game.  One thing they did nail is music. MAN did they do a good job with the updated tunes, especially with the Moon stage and Boss music!  All and all if you played the NES Ducktales or have enjoyed watching Ducktales in the past, this game hits the spot!			"

												Ducktales was one of my favorite games on the Nintendo back in the day, and finally after such a long time waiting... Disney and Capcom have partnered up once again to rerelease and remaster one of the games that has been on my top 10 for a long time. Anybody who has either played the original on the NES, or wants to play it... Get this version. With updated graphics, gameplay and sound this version is sure to give you that fast pace and difficulty fix that only older games can give you.			"

												DuckTales: Remastered is an absolutely wonderful game. I was a huge fan of Disney comic books when I was a kid and I have many great memories of the adventures of Scrooge McDuck and company. WayForward did an amazing job capturing the spirit of the comic books and of course the 80s TV show. The visuals and animations are excellent and the writing and voice acting are perfect. It's such a joy to hear Alan Young in peak form reprising his role as Scrooge.DT: R isn't a long game, nor is it particularly challenging (except for the final level), but it's exceedingly well designed throughout. The gameplay is varied and the controls are refined and precise. The boss enemies in particular are very well crafted, with fun, pattern-based attacks and just the right amount of RNG to keep things interesting without being unfair. I can definitely recommend that anyone who enjoys platformers pick this game up, even if they're not familiar with the source material. DT: R is a rare gem that's perfect for young kids but also will easily keep adults entertained and delighted.			"

												The game itself is pretty damn impressive. The graphical quality, real voice actors, music, cutscenes and enjoyable gameplay is quite worth buying it. But that's where the good parts for this game end.As most of the people have stated out, there is a crash bug in this game at the very last boss of the game. It has to do with some drivers by NVIDIA, pretty much, since I did beat this game on my old laptop back when I played it when it was brand new. However, owning my own PC with NVIDIA drivers installed does seem to make this game not worth owning, unless you want to keep repeating the very first five levels of the game. So in the end, I would give this game 9/10 for the nostalgia, but leave the 1/10 because of the crash bug. Good try, should've tried to fix it, though.			"

												RecommendedShould consider for full price but definitively a must have for me if on sale. ( and i got it on sale xD )It is better in my opinion to play with a controller (trust me, much easier to play).The graphic look great and the game offer some challengers.Have some story lines for each level which is nice.ButThe pogo jump (a special jump to kill enemies or jump higher) is kinda annoying since you need to normal jump first then press the pogo button, and need to hold that button all the way down.Lack a special ""skip scene"" button, you need to ESC then ENTER each time you want to skip a story scene (well not that much of problem though, kinda about comfortable)			"

Posted: February 7, 2016
												I purchased this game alongside Mickey Mouse: Castle of Illusions during the Lunar Sale and played both the same morning so my review is for both games simultaneously. I didn't care for Duck tales. I wasn't a big fan of the show when I was a kid. (I was more of a Darkwing Duck kid) Right away I was disappointed that the backgrounds and items were not hand drawn like the sprites were. The sprites look great but they are placed overtop of very generic uninspired 3D backgrounds. Castle of Illusions, however, uses all 3D animation and it blends together wonderfully. The backgrounds feel as alive as the foregrounds. Moving Scrooge McDuck around is basic enough. Bounce on his cane to attack and occasionally swing at objects to bat them across the room. Things like climbing ropes felt strange as I could not jump from rope to rope but rather just fall and hope to catch ahold of another rope. Controlling Mickey Mouse was much more fun in Castle of Illusions. The mouse has ups and when you jump it's fun. Gameplay mechanics felt much more polished whereas Scrogge McDuck's controls were straight out of 8 bit NES era and not necessarily in a good nostalgic way. The cutscenes in Duck Tales come often and they are corny and repeat themselves unnecessarily. I found myself skipping cutscenes I hadn't even watched for the first time rather quickly into my experience. And this is the big one for me. Once you exhaust all of your lives in Duck Tales you have to go back to the very beginning of the level and find all of the items over again. Classic old school gameplay. Although when you add that mechanic you better be sure you have a strong game. When I died and went back to the beginning of the Amazon level, I didn't want to do all of that over again mainly because it wasn't that fun to do to begin with. In Castle of Illusions when Mickey was booted out of a room and made to start again I looked forward to having another go at it. That initial reaction to ""starting a level over"" in a game will always tell me whether or not I am enjoying the game.So in conclusion if you are into the Disney characters or just want a cartoon platformer and find a few Disney toons (Scrooge McDuck is basically a spin on Donald Duck) on your wishlist -- go with Castle of Illusions over Duck Tales: Remastered.

												Would be a great game if it wasn't broken. If you play on an Nvidia GPU do not expect to be able to finish this game. The game crashes every single time I reach the final boss fight. Sometimes it makes it a couple lines into the cutscene but usually just freezes the instant that the curtains appear on screen. I cannot reccomend this title unless this gamebreaking bug is fixed, which unfortunately isn't likely to happen.			"

												Ahh, DuckTales: Remastered. Just as a sidenote, I never did play the first one on the SNES. But yeah, as a Disney fan and generally wanting to play light-hearted cartoon-y games a lot, I was excited for this one. Having it gifted to me, I decided to hop straight into this and found that the presentation was fantastic. The visuals are top-notch, pretty much having been remade for this HD remake of the first game, and the music even better. With a New Game option awaiting me, I decided to go for that (and picked Easy mode, mind you!) but went back to explore the other menus later; there waiting for you to pick is a Gallery of sorts, which can also be accessed via the main game's ""world hub""/level selector. Options for game configuration are there and play time. That, and a leaderboard which was quite fun to look at (how do people get through the game that quickly?)As for the actual main game itself, I loved it despite a few small flaws. The character models look brilliant and most of the time, work really well with the backgrounds. We start with a small cutscene and an opening level in the bank where you play as Scrooge McDuck (voiced by the original VA, who just so happens to be around 80, I believe) and you save Huey, Dewey and Louie from the evil (and a bit ditzy) Beagle Boys. In the process, you get to know about the main storyline; get 5 artifacts from around the world and then you'll have lots of treasure (or something like that). Woo hoo!So what do I think of the 5 levels after this? Pretty good. All different, long and have a great boss at the end for you to tackle, all while getting to know the hilarious Launchpad, 3 boys and Webby who tag along for the ride. Although, cutscenes aren't the best (but are skippable) as they don't show the character's mouths moving when they speak. Another flaw to the game is the sometimes dodgy platforming; whether it's cheap deaths from the weird jumping mechanics or taking a bit of damage when you really feel as if it's not your fault, WayForward definitely could have improved this. It just doesn't feel as great as the Mario platformers, for example (then again, most platformers don't).So after the next 5 levels (including THE MOOOOON, of all places. But I didn't see Princess Luna, so this is set after MLP season 3 apparently, heh heh heh), you get to save the 3 boys again and try and retrieve the treasure at Mount Vesuvius where you end up defeating Magica and also competing in some weird ""escape the volcano"" level that really felt bad, as sometimes Scrooge just wouldn't grab onto the ropes and wouldn't jump properly - and that kinda let that down for me, until I realised that there are a few tricks to get it right.Pros:+ Great level variety+ Voice acting is top notch+ Art is fantastic, so is the game design+ Good difficulty at timesCons:- Cutscenes aren't the best- Sometimes dodgy platforming- Length of game isn't great, despite decent replay valueOverall, pretty good game. 8/10 for me. Would (get gifted, but otherwise) buy again.			"

												I had the original game on the old-school original Nintendo system when I was a kid and played it over and over.  It was a great game.  I was a bit apprehensive when I saw that they re-made it.  However, they did a great job with the re-make.  It's not exacly like the original but it has most of the same elements and it successfuly captures the feel (and the fun) of the original game.  I saw some people on the discussion boards griping about some glitches in the game when it first came out.  However I just now got the game (it's been out for several months now) and I'm having no problems whatsoever.  So I'm assuming the game has been updated/patched and the problems have been solved.Anyhow, my only complaint is that game seems a little short.  I've been playing for only a few hours and I'm already more than half-way through it.  But it's super-fun, so I feel it was still totally worth buying...especially since I got it on sale.  I'm having a blast playing it.  Enjoy!			"

												Was a really fun game... until I softlocked 4/4 times on the final level/boss.  I know this probably has to do with my PC specs, but it seems that a lot of other people have hit it too.  Sad :(			"

												If You Want a challenge put this gem of a game on ""Hard"" and you will see how great of a gamer you really are !Great Visuals and a great remake of the original classic back in 89 , the levels are challenging as ever and there will be plenty of Nerd Raging going on for sure as i have been :D Im only 2 levels completed so far but the reward of beating a level is a great feeling .. so far overall 9/10 ( Just Make Sure You Play This On Hard if you want your moneys worth ) :-)			"

												I like the remake. I played the first one as a kid on the NES, and beat it plenty of times as a rental. there were some parts of the level design in a couple of areas that could have been better, but overall the game is pretty good and as fun as the original. the main issue was the frequent dialogue, lol. I liked it, it just happened a little frequently. There are challenges and leaderboards for the difficulty, loot gathered, and speed runs.  so there is quite a bit of replayability for people in those areas. as a 30-something that played the original as a child, I feel that this is one of the better remakes of classic games.  it's on sale for 50% off, and may have an 80% off day during the sale, so I figured I'd post this in case anyone was on the fence about it. It's a good grab.  "

												If you absolutely adored old licensed Capcom platformers from the NES/SNES/Genesis eras, then there's not a lot to think about here, This game is for you. DuckTales: Remastered is perfect if you wanna relive those old memories with a new coat of paint, some updated tunes, and some of the kinks of progressing through the game worked out. It's the same hop and bop adventure you remember back then, only bigger and better. As for what this game may offer those not familiar with those older games or DuckTales itself, beyond the simple joys (I mean VERY simple) of hopping and bopping enemies and collecting treasures for a larger score, it may be best to wait for a sale. While DuckTales Remastered offers a solid recreation of the original game and is genuinely fun if you're up for something simple, the project just doesn't feel like WayForward went quite far enough in trying to make the project truly shine in the same ways that GRiN's Bionic Commando: Re-Armed succeeded. I won't call it lazy, because there's a clear love of the material here with the sprite work, reworked soundtrack, and tracking down all the original voice actors and actresses. At the same time, it does feel like the game had a lack of ambition, time, funds, or all of the above.			"

All together with know characters of the series including GizmoDuck, there is a lot of fun content packed into the game.If you loved the game or even if u had bad luck and missed out on this gem, then here's your chance to enjoy it !4/5 - There are a few flaws with the game and concept but most games around it's release-date had some.

												Games like this are the reason why Steam should implement a neutral option to their review system. PROS: + Story+ very accessible+ Controls (for the most part)+ GraphicsCONS: - repetitive level design- very short (anywhere from 2-3 hours)- massive difficulty spike towards the end of the game- too many cutscenes in-between gameplayIn conclusion, if you're looking to get into the platforming genre for the first time Ducktales: Remastered for the most part is a template for the basics of the genre. But if you're looking for something longer or more difficult, I strongly recommend other platformers on Steam and even some from the same developer such as the Shantae series. Only get this game on sale or if you really love DuckTales.			"

												Das Spiel sieht gut aus, die Musik ist gut, auch wenn ich das Original besser finde. Leider mag ich dieses Spiel aber nicht. Ducktales ist einer meiner Lieblings 2d Jump and Runs.Das Spiel ist eine Beleidigung. Es sieht aus wie Ducktales, es hört sich an wie Ducktales, es spielt sich aber nicht wie Ducktales. Man kann zwar immer noch den Stab der reichen Ente benutzt, allerdings hat man das Leveldesign verändert.Das wofür ducktales bekannt war, waren die vielen Geheimnisse und Abkürzungen. Diese wurden komplett gestrichen. Man findet immernoch kleinere Geheimnisse, die Abkürzungen existieren aber nicht mehr. Ein Metroid Eskes Jump and Run mit der Ducktales Lizens wurde dadurch zu einem liniares Erlebnis, das langweiliger/ banaler nicht sein könnte.♥♥♥♥ you, Wayforward, ♥♥♥♥ you, Capcom and ♥♥♥♥ you, Ducktales Remastered!

												Whether or not you've played the original game on NES, whether or not you even watched the show as a kid, this is a must-have platformer. It's more than just a fresh coat of paint, Wayforward has lived up to the subtitle ""Remastered,"" removing or improving many parts, and adding cutscenes and two brand-new stages to give plot and context to events, voiced by none other but all the original voice actors from the show!What to do? Just grab onto some Ducktales!			"

												Duck tales for the NES was one of the best games that ever came out for that system. Fast forward decades later, Capcom hasremade the game.I stress, this is a remake, and not a ""remaster"" as it says. HOWEVER, it goes completely in stride, and takes advantage of today's technology. The dialogue and voice acting is fantastic. The original is very well represented in this game, with so much extra when you do not consider thenew graphics, music, voice acting, and dialogue. I am talking about some bonus content, including a begining level not included in the original, plus a whole lot more.I recommend this game with a controller, especially an Xbox 360 controller. This game is casual, and if you played the original extensively, you will fly through this game. It is not a long game, but then again, the original wasn't either.With that said, I think it is priced fairly. I was given this game as a birthday gift, and I really had fun casting it live on Twitch, and beating the game. It really game me that retro feel, with a modern pollish, with very crisp and sharp graphics, and animations, with beautiful sound, and classic, straight forward controls.			"

												Great game to play ... I would recommend this game ... my only issue is and I don't know if it's just me but the sound sucks ... it kept skipping like a broken record ... sometimes when the sound was skipping it would lose sync with the story dialog ... it was OK for the first minute but it was sorta non-stop after that ... I wonder if the developers know about this and working on a fix because it is a great fun game except for this SOUND part of the game ...			"

												Childhood nostalgia at it's finest, very fun game that can be enjoyed even too this day. With the HD-remake, DuckTales returns us to the Amazons, the Himalayas and so on, even the moon. All together with know characters of the series including GizmoDuck, there is a lot of fun content packed into the game.If you loved the game or even if u had bad luck and missed out on this gem, then here's your chance to enjoy it !4/5 - There are a few flaws with the game and concept but most games around it's release-date had some.

												Enjoyable most of time, great animation and voice work, nostalgic additions, and faithful emulation of the gameplay that made the original Duck Tales a lot of fun. The re-tuned boss fights are 50/50, with some being more monotonous than fun and frustratingly long. Cut scenes cannot be skipped or even advanced, not even the closing credits, destroying replayability as there are many, many breaks in the actions for brief-to-long interludes of dialog. The final level is a frustrating mess requiring 8-bit era manuevering and timing that does not play well with modern analog joysticks. Instead of a fun final romp to the conclusion it's a boring, awkward mess that feels out of place. I found myself rushing to try to get through it. And once there I was treated to a nearly ten minute long credit roll I couldn't skip past.If this game gets down to $1.99 or lower I'd say go for it. Otherwise there are much, much better games for your money and time.			"

												Во-первых, стоит иметь ввиду, что у многих настольгия осталась именно по второй части. А тут мы имеем ремейк первой, которая примитивнее второй, с её магазинчиком, апгрейдами и поисками карт. Поэтому почуствовать себя эдаким перепончатолапым Индианой Джонсом не выйдет.Что понраивлось:- старый добрый геймлей: прыгаем на клюке, пинаем ящики - всё как в старые недобрые 90'ые. Даже глюки перенесли с любовью =)))- уровни немного изменили и расширили, добавили немного новых... сюжет тоже немного переработали.- музыкальные темы перезаписали, но сохранили- графика довольно приятная- изменили механику боссов - некоторые стали гораздо интереснее и сложнееЧто не понравилось:- убрали дополнительные сокровища... приходишь на место старого секрета, а там ничего кроме алмазов и пополнения здоровья- смысла в поисках секретов и зарабатывании бабла особо нет - если только открывать унылые и вряд ли кому-то нужные концепт-арты на ачивку- тупые детские диалоги, которые возникают по кажому поводу и без повода... Мало того, что просаживают темп игры, так ещё и сбрасываются только через меню- играть на клавиатуре не то чтобы прям уж очень тяжело... но, если учесть, что 75% игры проходится с зажатыми двумя кнопками, проблемы с подкючением геймпада весьма не порадовали.Ещё немного мыслей.Непонятно, на какую аудиторию расчитывали разработчики. Детям игра будет вряд ли интересна, потому что и ""Утиные истории"" для них уже не актуальны, и проектов по-лучше хватает. Если на взрослую аудиторию, на зачем было делать её НАСТОЛЬКО детской? Диалоги примитивны (о том, что они вообще не нужны уже писалось) и шутки тупы даже для детей... Сгодятся разве что совсем для трёхлетних. На настольгии игра тоже играет весьма частично. С одной стороны знакомые уровни, знакомая механика... но всё какое-то чужое (нет, не вырос, запущенная под эмулятором игра по-прежнему доставляет).Итого, брать или нет. Я рекомендую купить. Как минимум в надежде на то, что игра окупится и разработчики примутся за ремейк второй части.			"

												EDIT: after the current update i was hoping that they improved on the final climbing stage so i could finally finish it... i'm not sure if they did change something about that (or what the update changed at all), but i could finish it in one go without even losing one life. I guess they made it easier grabbing the chains or something...The game still has some flaws, but overall i think it is really some fun, if still quite difficult in the end.I give it a thumbs up now, but would not spend the full price on it.OLD:This game was some (short) fun until the end-level where they had put some hilarious obstacle course AFTER the boss fight  where you have to run against time. If that wasnt enough they added another even worse obstacle course after that! All without saving progress or stuff you collected in this level. This end is like 100% harder than the rest of the game and you have only your 2 extra lives to spend, before you have to start ALL OVER AGAIN this stupid level.Makes me wanna scream ""YOU♥♥♥♥♥♥♥DUCKTALES"" at the developers, but they dont seem to care anyway.Nice graphics and good old memories, destroyed by this duckpoo ending.Btw you can either rush through the levels or spend time collecting diamonds that you can then spend for boring sketches of ingame graphics.Oh yes, the controls are bad. The collission detection as well. Just as the good old game. ""Remastered"" are only the graphics and the additional levels (tutorial & final).Pull a Dagobert and dont spend a dime on this!DuckTales boohoo.			"

Posted: January 19, 2016
												This review was going to be about how I had never played the original Ducktales and how this game made me love losing, instead, I have to talk about the technical deficiencies of one of the best platformers I've ever played.When I first started the game, it had ludicrously bad framerate. I didn't understand at first. It looks like a 2D flash game for god sakes. I tried lowering the resolution, tried turning off the anti aliasing. Nothing.Turns out in some weird form of programming, the game is tied to your desktop. Specifically the AERO theme. I had it disabled on my copy of Windows 7 64bit, and this drastically affected the game as a result. Turning it back on was no big deal and the game ran at the framerate I expected in the first place.If only that was the end of it.The finale of the game (which is rightfully the trickiest part of the game) ends with two big middle fingers. First, the final boss will crash the game. Imagine going through that hell of a stage, seeing the finish line and having it cut short thanks to shoddy programming. The way to fix it of course if you're on a multicore is to start up task manager and setting the affinity of the game to 1 core. With that done... the game still crashes.Yes, even after all that, the game still crashes. After you defeat the boss, his death cutscene will for some reason, crash the game. I don't know why. I really don't. I had to resort to skipping the cutscene to prevent it.Imagine not only having finally beaten the boss, but for it to also crash right after, and that's still not the other middle finger.Right after that hard stage and that hard boss, you're thrown into TWO instant death scenarios.So imagine on the Hard difficulty, you defeat the final boss without getting hit once and have 3 lives left, only to lose them all to some of the cheapest, ""gotchya"" moments ever. Mega Man X3 had a similar ending and it wasn't even close to as punishing as this.So despite the game and the programming throwing every single setback they could, I still begrudgingly finished the game, cause its jumping controls are rock solid and were worth the pain. I think it says something about modern day gaming where playing a scottish duck feels more immersive than a soldier from Call of Duty or Batman in Arkham City, because what I wanted to do with my controller is actually translated on screen. I have never felt so connected with a character and how he plays in YEARS. It really doesn't take long for Scrooge to become part of your muscle memory, even for somebody who has never played the original. If there's something wrong with the way McDuck plays, I couldn't tell you, cause he felt perfect to me. He jumped how I wanted him, he pogo'd how I wanted him to. This came to ahead with some really tricky pogo jumps and having to avoid not only spikes but flying bat anemies just above you.The one thing I can tell you that felt absolutely crowbarred in despite never playing the original, were the cutscenes. These would be pretty dreadful without the original cast, but because of them, it really elevated the stilted looking material. It's not that it's bad, it's just that I wouldn't have cared if it were the Nolan North's and Terra Strong's of the world delivering the material. Scrooge sounds a little tired but that's to be expected for the actor's age, but he does nail it here and there. Launchpad sounds exactly like Launchpad and same goes for Huey, Dewey and Louie. I should say ""most"" of the original cast, because a few of the actors had people had passed away since the original cartoons had aired. I actually was shocked to find that McScrooge's nemesis, Flintheart Glomgold, was not voiced by the original actor. The only one that never felt right was Fenton/Gizmoduck. He did not at all sound like I remembered, which was even worse because ""blathering blatherskite"" is a pretty iconic phrase in both this series and Darkwing Duck, so he really stood out.The problem with the cutscenes beyond how terrible they look (which is an even bigger insult considering how great the original cartoon looked), is that to start up a level, fail, then have to start it up again is a pain. You have to skip about 3 cutscenes minimum, which requires you to hit start, hit A to skip, then repeat. It's just really annoying.At the end of the day, Wayforward continues to impress me with their mercenary work, taking a lemon of a job and turning it into lemonade. In the hands of a bad studio, this really could have gone wrong in everyway. Either in an attempt to update it too much and ruining the core gameplay, or just not doing enough work and delivering a subpar port job emulation, but it's quite clear in their rushed merc work that they couldn't deliver the type of love and attention they could for the PC port that they did in the game itself, but playing as Scrooge is undeniably fun and it's hard to not recommend this game, cause you can sense the enthusiasm for this in every little hidden treasure you find.The Pro's:+Rock solid controls+Devilishly difficult and rewarding to play+Good stage music remixes+A true loveletter to Ducktales fansThe Con's:-Prone to crashes-Concept art as an unlockable (Where's the NES version?)

												I wish that I could give this a positive review but Capcom has made it clear that they don't give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about their customers, so they refuse to address a game breaking bug that affects users with Nvidia GPUs. The only fix is an unofficial work around (skipping cinematics) that breaks the storyline and forces you to watch them on YouTube.FukTales isn't worth it. Even on sale.

												Fun and a throwback to my childhood for sure!  But sadly, it just randomly crashes.  And as the game only sets checkpoints in the Moneybin, if you spend 30 minutes figuring out an area to have it just crash at the boss is stupid and upsetting.  I can't blow on the cartridge either.  I'm a red vote because of this.			"

I died to the 1st boss 3 times, I am not the best at platformers, but decent, so it is a good challenge, not too easy at all and has selectable difficulty. They added new cutscenes and a ton of bonuses to unlock as well. I got this on sale and it was one of the best deals I got this winter, if you see it on sale pick it up, I recomend it at sale price for sure!			"

												Oh boy oh boy, it's the time of the year where I re-make bad reviews I did in the past.This game is incredibly good. Good soundtrack, greatly made.It has nice cutscenes and the overall 2.5D thing is awesome.However, it has it's bad sides.Let's begin:Somewhat kinda boring I guess map parts. I played this, it was great but sometimes it just gets boring. It's my personal opinion so you can check out the game if you disagree with me.Crappy keyboard support. Again, it's my personal opinion, however I do not know if it was my keyboard being a pile of trash or the game isn't good for keyboards at all. I would definitely recommend playing this with a controller.This review was quite short. Please give constructive criticism, if you don't think it's a good game, please give reasonable reasons why you don't like it on the comments, same applies if you think my review isn't good.			"

												Playing Ducktales: Remastered is a lot of fun.  It will remind you of the classic days of playing it on the NES.  Unfortunately the game has a bug that crashes the game during the final level.  After the final boss fight the game will freeze.  YOu can avoid this with skipping the animatic.  However, it can also freeze during the escape from the last level.  It is very annoying.  I would advise skipping this game until this problem is fixed.			"

												If you actually genuinely liked the NES game then you probably won't like this. It is nowhere near as tight (The original uses the same engine as Megaman 3). Most of the good platforming parts have been removed to compensate for how poor the engine is. They have added extra stuff to force you to backtrack which ruins the flow. There is cutscenes that cannot be turned off globally that take place about every 5 or 10 seconds that ruin the flow. If you have never played the original and like the cartoon you might like it. (Anybody who says it is exactly the same as the original hasn't played the original very much.)			"

												There's nothing mastered about this game. It is nostalgia packaged with original voice acting from the cartoon, cheap 3D art for the environment and nice looking 2D art and animation for the characters.And that's exactly the problem with this game; it can't decide wether or not it should poke at your nostalgia from the TV cartoon, or from the NES video game so it decides to go for both.Seeing that this is an actual video game, I would've prefered if they spent more thought into the actual game elements and less so with the dozens of character conversations which is forced on the player.It is fortunate that you have the ability to skip 'cinematics', you do however feel less so when you have to replay a level, and then skip the three consecutive cinematics the game just has to deliver to you in order to get back to playing the actual game. Wayforward has gone through great lengths to make sure the character controls and level design feels like the NES game, but seems to have forgotten to ask if the old game actually had good level design and avatar game feel.Controlling Scrooge McDuck does feel good and precise, but it doesn't matter much when the levels themselves are simply annoying. The character is playing the game to collect treasures, you are motivated to find more and the game has diamonds scattered everywhere.If you enter a room and theres a corner where there's nothing: there's something there, go there, jump a little and diamonds will appear. The game habitualizes the player to nervously search through every nook and cranny for diamonds all the time. At this point you might as well make them visible to begin with, and not have the player go there, then leave the spot to then have the diamond spawn and then finally go back to the spot to pick it up. It's tedious, it breaks flow.And that's essentially what the game's biggest flaw is; it doesn't understand flow. All the running around, jumping, bouncing and searching for things which the original game did well, gets obscured by useless fluff that's only there to make us remember an old TV cartoon.			"

												Nice graphics and creative remake of original levels. The music and voice acting are also very nicely done. The story is boring, and interrupts gameplay way too frequently to keep me immersed in the game experience. Perhaps the designers should've kept the game action going while voice acting happens on top. Since the characters are basically just GIFs with voice acting on top, I'm shocked you can't skip the current line of dialogue without skipping the entire cinematic. The writing is written for ages 6 - 10, so it's very hard to stay interested in what the characters are talking about. The game bosses' AI is very simple. Each boss follows a strict pattern and doesn't even take into account Scrooge's position onscreen. This makes every boss battle an exercise in simple pattern recognition. This is expected from the original NES title, but I would've liked to see a ""remastering"" of the challenge from the original game.The game feels repetitive after the second level is completed. I'd only recommend this for fans of the original show, and even then, wait for a Steam sale.			"

												What could have been a nice modern remake, turned out to be a fairly bad game, due to some poor decisions. The worst decision they made is the difficulty: easy is just a walk in the park, normal is a small nightmare (with double damage and 2 lives instead of infinite). I would have been way happier if they added some extra lives and kept the damage from easy for smaller enemies. Next up is the constant interruptions for some slow and tedious dialogue, you can skip it, but then you'll miss out on the... ehrm... story...  But is the gameplay any good? While the 6 different levels are completely different and have a nice design to them (which is supposed to be similar to the NES version), the game game suffers a bit from bad hit boxes and some details like being knocked back when you get hit (which can be annoying with 1 block platforms). But overall, besides all the mentioned problems in the review, I was OK with the levels. It's just a shame that on easy you're just blasting through them, and on hard keep restarting them.  As for the visuals, the only thing I would have liked was animated mouths (or beaks) when characters were talking. Other than that, it was like watching a very crisp cartoon (which is exactly the look it needs). The game also features some decent background music, although nothing special (except maybe the original Duck Tales theme).  In conclusion (tl;dr): This game could have been pretty good, if it weren't for the difficulty settings.			"

												24 years later and still looks amazing. Duck Tales: Remastered is a blast from the past to any owner of NES. Back when games were amazing and nice to play, WayForward Technologies helps us to relive our happiest moments in one of the most memorable games of all time. Like the title suggests, its obviously remake of original game with better graphics, and updated soundtrack.Plus to original remastered in glorious HD levels we get also 2 additional levels for story progression. While in NES version there wasn't that of a story, here we get like a lost TV episode, with original cast from the show itself. While story can be just simple to understand it shouldnt be taken too seriously because its children show, so nothing serious or be amazed with. But most important part is redesign of original 5 levels. They are all back and looking better than ever. In addition the original soundtrack also is back with some addtions which makes it much better. We are used to the fact some games are being re-released as HD but in this case we get a bit more.You can also unlock some arts and other stuff if you are interested, or even swilm in Scrooge gold vault like he does in TV show. Now all we need for total nostalgia happines is 2nd Duck tales game from NES and maybe remake of Chip n Dale just for fun. If you didn't play original NES game, take this one. Its our childhood and looks at it's finest. 9/10.- Dima Voronovich, Russian Pro reviewer.			"

												The nostalgia for this game didn't last long after dying for the 5th time at the boss of the first level. Now I remember how hard this game was back when it was released on the NES. When all the fluff  and flareis peeled away, the Remastered version is identical to its NES counterpart. The game is hard and frustrating because It lacks all of the modern video game features, such as checkpoints. I beleive this was intentional to retain as much of the original version as possible. Compared to today's video game standards, this is not always a good thing.			"

												The Beagles Boys had the crossed the line too far. They kidnapped his nephews, roughed up his money bin, and, worst of all, were having a treasure hunt without him. Scrooge McDuck would sit idly by no longer. Everyone told Scrooge that he wasn’t relevant anymore; it’s been over twenty years since Duck Tales and kids these days liked voxel zombie rogue-likes and Disney is only interested in mass-producing child stars so Hollywood can have a perpetual source of trainwrecks instead of making cartoons. Scrooge didn’t listen though, he didn’t care. All he wanted was all the swag the world had to offer him and the Beagle Boys’ heads mounted on his mantelpiece and nothing on Earth and the Moon would stop him on his blood-soaked journey. The world may have moved on without him but Scrooge will make sure that no one will ever forget that you never f*ck with a McDuck.Revised Edit: After playing more of this game I can't recommend it anymore. The final level is godawful and its like WayForward didn't even play test it. Just skip this game, its fun for a while but it pulls a Launchpad and crashes and burns so hard at the end.			"

												I got this game solely because I really liked the Gameboy version back in the days.- So far I played it all the way through within <4hrs. If you think of buying it you should consider the remarkably short playtime.- The controls are quite poor. (same for the controller support)- At a certain point the gameplay is just frustrating since the blurry graphics with thick outline simply don't fit with the pixel-precise mechanics (you can stand on an edge but pogo jumping is impossible) / Nevertheless that worked for the gameboy version when the graphics matches the pixel-precise mechanics- The cutscenes.... I don't know whose idea it was but he possibly got shot after the game was released. Although there is a possibility to skip the so-called cinematics but skipping for of them just to get from one level to another is simply annoyingI liked the gameboy version when I was a kid - so I thought buying this one here would be a good idea.... was not...Artwork is great since I like the ducktales, soundtrack is ok when played in 8-bit. As for the rest... please let professionals do the work next time - people are paying money to play this.			"

												Good graphics, great re-mixed music, more or less the same gameplay of the original NES game. The problem here is that there's not enough content to justify its price. Judging by the ending credits more people worked on this game than on a triple A best seller. Their fault. Buy it on sale.			"

												Right now i feel like i have no choice but to NOT recommend this game. Almost immediately after starting, the game continually freezes for me and even refuses to end process. This is not an isolated incident- i wish i had done some research beforehand on the game because it appears that MANY people are reporting issues with the game freezing.April 6, 2014 edit: After a complete reformat, i decided to give the game another go: Crashing is still an issue, but the game is at least playable now. I would say the game crashes around once an hour for me.			"

												Well... This is tough choice. The game is a remake of Duck Tales from my childhood. I have a fond memories of that. But Duck Tales 2013 is not polished enough. It's short, it's very easy, textures could be much better. And cutscenes are slow and boring. It would be nice game for tablet or phone. 4.99$ or smth. It can be fun, but there are so much better platformers out there. Not reccomended.			"

												I hate it to say it, I really do. But this game is NOT woth picking up for full price. Honestly I wouldn't go much higher than 5$. Why? For all the prettyness and great voice talent in the game, the game sufferes from 2 majors flaws. 1. The hitboxes for both you and anything that can damage you is horrible. You can be just slightly off from hitting a foe directly on their head and take damage. This is made worse by the amount of 1-hit deaths in the game. 2. The games controls are terrible. This ruins the game for me. Its tragic just how bad they are when you see the depth the game has to it. How are they bad? They are unresponsive. One secound you are holding the pogo button bouncing along, and for no apparent reason you stop and will most likely die or take damage. You won't always jump or move when you want to as well. This made even the fun parts of the game a nightmare. Instead of enjoying myself I found myself watching my every step. The game has so much going for it but I can't reccomend it for 15$ when it just isn't polished.			"

The first being the years of dialog which gets very old very fast and the other being the controls feel a little stiff and un responsive at times.  The dialog wouldnt bother me so much if I could only skip it, but I cant. I wouldnt recomend this game as I found it very frustrating with the large amount of cut scenes with long un needed dialog.  If you can get passed the amount of time you will be sitting at idle infront of your screen it really is a fun game, but I find myself reading a book while waiting for the cut scenes to end as the story isnt exactly grand in any way.

I probably died about 50x more in that final sequence than I did during the entire rest of the game, and never got the satisfacting of beating the game. Thanks WayForward.			"

The level designs from the original game are still as great as they ever were but every other thing in this game actively makes it worse than the original.It has this bizarre art style. Really detailed, well animated drawn sprites moving over ♥♥♥♥ing garbage simple 3d maps. It looks kind of like Paper Mario except it's actually appropriate for that game and is more skillfully done. This minor quibble is nothing compared to...THE VOICE ACTING! What the ♥♥♥♥? Scrooge's voice actor must have been mumbling 5 feet away from the microphone. Everyone else comes through crystal clear, but the main ♥♥♥♥ing character sounds like garbage. Which is kind of a problem. Because he talks a lot. Actually it might not be a problem because he says the same 5 or so unbelievably lame lines over and over for the entire game and I don't think being able to hear them clearly would actually measurably improve my experience.Oh, and get ready to mash start because this game has cutscenes piled on top of cutscenes. This is basically the textbook case on how to assassinate a classic NES game by adding all the worst♥♥♥♥♥♥from modern games to it. Play the NES version. It's still good. ♥♥♥♥ this remake.			"

												Well thank God they included a ""skip cinematic"" option in the pause menu, cause man, this game really does stop every 30 seconds for some entirely unnessecary dialog or cut scene. Every time you pick up an item, meet another character, whatever, Scrooge stops in place for about 5-10 seconds so he can talk about it, making the entire game feel like an endless tutorial level. Imagine Mario stopping to have a short conversation with Yoshi every time he shows up, and making a little joke every time you eat a mushroom. Sounds pretty annoying, right? It is. The graphics, gameplay, & music are all great... while you're actually playing in between cutscenes, it's fun just like the original NES version. I just wish they would let you enjoy it all without interupting so often, because it really does ruin an otherwise decent game.  If you really want to check it out, wait until it goes on sale. It might be worth the $6 sale price, but your $15 could be spent much better elsewhere.			"

												I am a huge fan of the old NES game but couldn't care less about the TV series. And that's my main problem with this game. The hillarious amount of cutscenes in it is so high I cannot recommend this to anyone.You have to skip at least 3 cutscenes to get started in a level you selected and even then your gameplay will be interrupted frequently during the level. All of this has no other purpose than to stretch this 2 hour game over the 3 hour mark so the way too high price point doesn't feel so bad.Just play the Amazon and by the end of the level you will have seen or skipped over 20 cutscenes. Why do we need those?			"

												Although this game seems to be well done and would be loved by any fan of the NES original(if done the right way), I cannot recommend this game. Mainly due to the following. 1. The price is a little to high for how short of a game it is.  2. This is the only game I own on steam that does not support my Logitech F310 controller (a very common controller) I refuse to play a platformer using keyboard controls and don't feel like messing with xpadder when I shouldnt' have to.3. I contacted Capcom support over 2 weeks ago and haven't gotten a response of ANY kind. Not even a ""Go eff yourself"" reply. NOTHING. I've been playing Capcom games for over 25 years, and this is how they treat their customers? lol good luck. I'm unlikely to purchase another game from them. It's a shame too.

												♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it, WayForward, you make great games, but somehow i end up infuriated. Visually it's an amazing title, the artists really translated the Ducktales cartoon style brilliantly into a game. The whole presentation is impressive. There are just two things that bug me, but those bug me a lot: First there's the cinematics. WayForward seems to love cutscenes, they tend to add loads of those to their games. Having 3 cutscenes before you even start a level is already quite a thing. Then for every level goal you have another one. Then for the mid-level-save. You can skip them, at least, but even then they are still kinda annoying, as there is a screen fade each and every time when you just want to get on with the game! Come on, it's a jump and run game!Secondly the collision detection is very, very strict, to the point of unfair. It just doesn't feel intuitive. This is one place where they should have overworked the original NES-game. I remember finishing that original, but i guess back in the days i had more patience? Maybe my skills suffered, but i couldn't get myself to finish even level one...Don't get me wrong, it's a great game. The gameplay just feels a little outdated with such a collision detection.			"

												Before I got to the last level, I was ready to give this a 6/10. So in my mind, the Metacritic user score of 66/100 isn't that far off. It's difficult to live up to nostalgia, and this game probably was facing unrealistic expectations from the beginning. The game is kind of fun, but it's not particularly challenging once you figure out where all the health pick-ups are. I enjoyed the boss fights, but the platforming elements were a little tedious.I was getting annoyed in the last level, in particular the last part (don't want to spoil the ending) because I thought it required a ridiculous level of precision. But then I finally realized that using the analog was the problem and switched to the D-pad, all was fine.Graphics-wise, the characters are beautifully drawn. Unfortunately, the same love and attention wasn't put into the scenes, where some of the things like helicopters look like they were drawn and shaded with Microsoft Word ... not even Microsoft Paint.The collectibles consist of art and music that can be unlocked through purchases using money you've gathered in each level. Unfortunately, you would need multiple playthroughs to get to the best stuff: the music and TV show art. And I didn't enjoy the game enough to play through more than once, so I was never able to access them.The unskippable cut scenes were the biggest grip that most people had. The developers added an option to skip them. I will say that the worst part of the cut scenes wasn't that they were unskippable (at the time) ... it's how utterly boring the dialogue was. Seriously, was the show ever that bad?I have to deduct a point in principle for the unskippable credits, taking the overall rating down to a 5/10. I don't generally mind unskippable credits, but 1) at least making it interesting, and 2) don't include every single person in all of Capcom! Seriously, the credits are obnoxiously long.			"

												I had my eye on DuckTales Remastered for awhile now, since I loved the NES game so much. Well it was on sale this week so I decided to pick it up and I don't regret it.It's a great nostalgic throw back to a franchise many of us 80's and 90's children grew up with. The music has been remastered wonderfully and I haven't had any problems with the controls. It's great that they managed to get (most?) of the voice actors back, that only make's it that much more special.The stages are mostly left the same, with minior changes to make it more action packed or intresting, I haven't had a problem with the stages, in my opinion it simply makes the whole experience more ""refreshing"".A complaint that seemed common with people was that the cut scenes cut away from the game and while agree that sometimes there's a little bit TOO much banter interuppting gameplay, it really hasn't been a deal breaker for me and some of the major cutscenes explaining the story and situation has been nice since the original NES game didn't really do too well of a job explaning anything, not that as kids we needed it, ha ha.To be perfectly honest, the only major grip I have is the art. The character sprites are wonderfully done, except the artists seem to neglect minor touches to the game, such as having the character's mouths move when they talk. The biggest issue I have though is that the sprites look wonderful, as if they were hand drawn and then everything else is a stagnant, ugly, pastel colored 3D rendered. The two styles class horribly and the artists who were doing the background and foreground work didn't even bother to have proper perspective when considering the sprites. In the introduction stage, doors, chairs and other background objects look to be 10 times bigger then character sprites and it's just lame and offputting. Does that ruin the game for me? No, not really, but it is a little offputting and really made me wish they would have just went that extra mile for attention to details. All in all, I'd pick it up, especally if it's on sale.			"

												This game is painful. As someone with fond memories of the original product from my childhood, all I can say of this newer experience is that the developers did too good a job copying the original game... right down to the mechanics from 1990.That just happens to be something you really, really should not do. Nobody wants to have games today like we used to in the 90's. There are no saves; The hit boxes are unforgiving as all hell; The game pulls super annyoing and unfair tricks on you all the god damn time.The only way you get through this game is by trying, and dying, a LOT. And starting from the very beginning, every single time. In a word, this game is hard. But it is not hard in the good challenging sense. It is hard in the frustratingly unfair, hair-pulling, rage-inducing sense.Also annoying: Too plentiful and slow-paced cutscenes that you have to rewatch every single time, although you can also skip them every single time.That said, it is beautiful to watch and listen to. But I know it's not something I'll be coming back to.WayForward focused on the wrong things to upgrade for 2013, and it's a shame.			"

												I loved the DuckTales cartoon in the 1980s and so I hoped I'd like this remastered version of the original NES DuckTales game. Unfortunately, the developer failed to understand the current market and decided to design the game as if it were an NES game. Essentially, a lesson in frustration.First, you can't save whenever and wherever you want. I realize many games do this today, but it's a poor design choice. All it does is increase the overall level of frustration and repetition in a game. We've had the capability to save our games when and where we wanted since 1984 (see King's Quest), yet in 2013, it's a rarity because game developers are lazy.Second, the controls are awkward and that's even using a gamepad. The pogo jump, for instance, is hit-or-miss and rarely works right when you're attempting to do it over spikes or some other deadly landmass.Third, it seems half the damn game is cutscenes. Don't get me wrong, I like a good story as I grew up on classic Sierra Online and LucasArts Adventure games, but these cutscenes are unskippable and the story involved is barely adequate, even for a game based on a cartoon. [EDIT - I've been informed that cutscenes are now skippable. I don't know if this is a recent development or not, but considering I couldn't skip them, the above paragraph is remaining. That said, this factor should no longer be held against the game if cutscenes are indeed skippable.]Now I know some people will say I'm being unfair, as this game is essentially a remake of the NES title. To them I reply: Deal with it. This isn't the same game. Yes, it's a remastered version, but it's not the same. Changes have been made in every step of development, so there's no reason why a real save game mechanism, skippable cutscenes and a decent control scheme couldn't have made it into the works. Saying the NES game was like this is a poor argument, because the NES title had hardware limitations that modern consoles and PC do not.So what's good about this game? Well, it's DuckTales (which I imagine means something to you if you bought it) and the original voice actors have come back to play the parts they did in the cartoon. In addition, for those who wanted a near-perfect replication of the NES title, this is a masterpiece.In the end, I have to say I don't recommend this game. It's not terrible (I've certainly played worse), but it's very frustrating. While I'm sure that'll bring some gamers to a near ♥♥♥♥♥♥ state, it's far more likely that same level of frustration will drive most gamers away.			"

												Musical earbugs and great TV shows aside, DuckTales is best remembered as a 1989/1990 video game developed and published by Capcom for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Gameboy. Known for its five expansive levels, Nintendo Hard difficulty, and legendary soundtrack, the game was a smash hit and received great reception at the time, such as from video game magazines Electronic Gaming Monthly and Mean Machines.Nearly 24 years later, the game returns in the form of a remaster by WayForward Technologies. A hi-def polishing of the music, environment, and sprites; as well as adding new things such as cutscenes done by the original TV voice cast, unlockable concept art, and redesigned levels made for the current generation of consoles/PCs. The game’s download size, less than a gigabyte across the board, makes it a quick and easy download to your gaming system, regardless of platform.The first recognizable addition to the remaster of DuckTales is the introduction level that takes place in Duckburg mansion, under siege by the Beagle Boys. Through this level, WayForward does a good job at explaining the backstory behind the video game as opposed to the original, which left it up to the player to formulate.The plot mediates on a race between the Ducks and the Beagles to obtain various pieces of treasure. At first; it seems logical, but then the story begins to drift and eventually form holes when the Beagle Boys were nowhere to be found on levels such as The Amazon or in the African Mines, yet plentiful on The Moon and in Transylvania. Nonetheless, the cutscenes are almost always appreciated the first time around. After that, however, it would really help to have a “press X” to skip option instead of having to go to the pause screen every time after that. DuckTales’ noted difficulty setting is one of spectacle; the ‘medium’ difficulty system is probably not what you expect, depending on how much AAA games you might play. Instead of simplifying the game to cater to a more casual audience, its difficulty is roughly the same as the original (and NES games in general); that is, each setting is arguably a step ahead of today’s games. For the medium setting, it’s three hits, and you’re dead, two deaths and the level resets (not counting pickups). There is a lot of trial and error, and the game could easily be likened to Dark Souls or Winnie The Pooh’s Home Run Derby. Despite this, the game is for the most part fair, although in some sections (such as the mine shaft section in African Mines) it can be a brutally difficult experience by not letting you go left enough, plunging you to your death even after all of that hard work you spent getting that far. The game’s treasures (both in the literal sense and the figurative sense) are scattered throughout the level, and it pays off to explore every crevice available to you in the game and then some. It is even possible to obtain an extra bar of life (or two), depending on where you search. The sound design of this game is outstanding. From the background music of The Moon and The Amazon to the climbing of ropes, to even hitting a block with your pogo stick, it all sounds spectacular. Although the age starts to show in the voice cast, they perform their lines faithfully and with the same DuckTales flair as the TV show. Despite minor flickering issues, the game plays fine on the PC and has never crashed on me. It’s what a Day 1 purchase should play like, as opposed to a Bethesda-like assortment of glitches and bugs. The enemy AI isn’t wonky and, spiders aside, all of them are easy to deal with or to get past.DuckTales is a flawed gem with a lovable cast and a forgettable story. The latter is made up by a good soundtrack and good gameplay, and experienced gamers shouldn’t be too conspicuous about this title. It’s a challenge, but a very rewarding one. In that regard, it’s a great game and definitely worth the $15 (or less) retail price.			"

												Hardcore nostalgia for this game. I had the NES version growing up. While nostalgia's great, there's a little to be said for the control handling in this PC adaptation.It loses some context sensitivity in Scrooge's office if you change the attack button to something besides the default; it will still say A on the floor spots, but you have to press your attack button (in my case, B) to first engage the art room, money bin, or supercomputer. Once you're past that initial part, the controls are normal again. A minor detail, but if you're going to ""remaster"" a game you'd better include the control and graphic adaptation not just the art, ya know?The reaction time on button pressing seems sluggish too. I use this same wireless Xbox controller for all my games and it does just fine. I seem to remember playing A Boy And His Blob (another WayForward game) and having the same issue.Otherwise, this is a great game! Same memorable voice actors from the cartoon and lots of good, solid game play. "

												So, I beat this and I think I'm pretty confident in saying that it's the best remake of a retro console game I've ever played. If you have any appreciation for the platformer/action/adventure genre, please do yourself a favor and pick this up. Wonderful, crisp, responsive controls. Collectibles everywhere and bonus features unlocked in a way that makes those collectibles not feel like a chore to find all of them, but makes you want to get as many as you can to keep buying more. Amazing soundtrack, almost as good as the original, even better in some cases (Brilliant piano arrangement of The Moon at the end). Top notch voice acting and an adorable plot that fits beautifully with the theme of the show and the game. This game is a 90s kid/retro gamer's dream. What they expect the remake of their favorite game to be. WayForward outdid themselves this time, so please, go pick it up.			"

												Much like with A Boy and His Blob, WayForward has taken another flawed classic and turned it into a modern masterpiece while somehow managing to retain everything lovable about the original. Would gladly recommend to both fans of DuckTales and retro-style platformers in general.			"

												Great game. I for one love the new look/sound of this remake. Is the gameplay a bit outdated? Sure, but i feel this was mainly intended for fans of the original game, and the show. Overall if you can find it on a sale i easily recommend it. It's just a bit too short for the full $15. But all in all i've had fun with it and seeing old characters from the cartoon again.			"

												Like the original, the music is true, the story and level design are true as well - but it is upgraded to the future with music, voice acting, boss fights, and overrall tweaks that bring DuckTales into a new generation for gamers!			"

												This remastered game takes all the great elements of the original Ducktales I for NES and embellishes it with extra level content, new puzzles, and energetic music.The intro will surprise old gamers with dialogue voiced by the original cast of Ducktales tv cartoons.The parallax backgrounds are very nicely drawn and so are the remastered enemies.Boss fights are almost completely revamped. Still the same general patterns but with a bunch of new ones and some new full-screen powers and effects are thrown in.There's some content to unlock but it's nothing that adds to the game story, just some nostalgia for fans.I saved annoyances for last as I don't feel they really impact the enjoyment of the game. Scrooge will sometimes say a line of random dialogue during gameplay, the most annoying one is when he says Mrs. Beagley is as big as a diamond, when you pick one up of course. The way the line is read is long-stetched and annoying after hearing it more than 5 times.Some character animations are lacking in animation frames. I've made sure my PC wasn't being laggy, also tried my Desktop which is well equipped for all performance intense games of 2014, and it still seems like there's lack of frames in idle animations.Small complaints that don't hinder any enjoyment of the game. I still find the animation to be very nice a fluid for the most part and most importantly, it stays true to the original's style, both in art and level design.			"

In addition to staying true to the original game, they were able to get all of the voice cast to come in and do all new dialogue for this game. Even Alan Young!

												I was having tears in my eyes when I heard that they are going to make a remake of this great game! :') Big part of my childhood, played it on my gameboy for years. And after finally getting it, I was not disappointed. They made it even better - great graphics, some added content (two whole new level and even a story) and - for me personally the best of all - great new mixes of the legendary soundtrack. If someone would have told me, I wouldn't have believed it, but they made the moon track even more awesome and the music of the last level is great, too!For nostalgics who want to travel back in their childhood a MUST GET, for everyone else also a great deal! A game from back in those times where developer put their heart in their work.10/10			"

												An exellent remake of the original NES title. The graphics are clean, crisp and colorful. A true and faithful remake of the original. Controls are spot on (see below) and the flow is good. Desipite the levels being a bit small there is still some challenge to the game. There are some issues with the controls. Sadly I could not play this with my original NES controller (NES to USB) and there are several others having issues with the controls even though it does sound like it will work with any controller, it does not. My Logictech F510 and F310 work flawlessly. Overall I'm happy with my purchase and I give it a big thumbs up to anyone wanting to relive or just re-experience the NES classic. The original still holds a place on my shelf, but the Remastered addition is truly a classic in its own right.			"

												This game is great!  I haven't played much of the original but I admire what it was--a brutally hard game with great music and visuals.  Remastered brings it into the 21st century with lots more options and an easier difficulty so you can just play through it and enjoy yourself.Don't be fooled, though--this game can still be challenging!  Tons of secrets await and for the true collector there is a huge gallery of artwork you can unlock (though it's rather pricey).The only negatives I can think of are that the cutscenes sometimes become too intrusive and even then, you can just skip them.  The voice acting is great but if the cutscenes had been dialed back, the game would be the better for it.  A definite recommendation.			"

The Double Dragon HD remake sucked hardcore, but this one is perfect thus far. The voice acting, look and feel are all there from the cartoon, and that just takes this one over the top.

												Wayforward, One of the best video game developers in the market, has done it again.This game is hands down, amazing. I'll spare you the details but this game is just filled with...everything around every corner!Not only does the game have a strong and beautiful atmosphere between the visuals and the incredible soundtrack to match, it also has a story! A dang. good. story! The story felt like I was experienceing the show beyond the show! The story never ended!What I think was smart about this game is that they didn't name ""Ducktales DX"" or ""Ducktales Remake"". This is a remastered version! It is NOT a remake of the old game and it doesn't try to be! It's a completely unique and new experience! You may see some locations or hear some music you remeber from the old days but the game isn't ALL that! The game brings so much exclusive and new content that you actually want! And it's not thrown in your face either! You can choose to do whatever you want! You can take it slow and explore everything and try to get the most loot or you can just speed through the game! Sure you rewards and such will vary but you WANT to get the best rewards!This game isn't some crappy second-rate Disney game that feautres IP's performing tasks any else could. NO. This is a new adventure and story based around the characters! You don't play it for the IP, you play it for the game! But I must say, the best part about all of this is that it is a completley new game...a...revision into the modern world so that leaves the possibility of potential sequels! (Which I hope happens!)You guys NAILED it!!! Way-2-Go Wayforward!			"

												A nice platformer originally for the NES. For someone that never owned a NES, this game does not play on my nostalgic senses, but despite my unfamiliarity with the game, it is quite enjoyable. The game is though, but not because of unfair gameplay og jagged controls. One flaw however is the lack of graphics option. I played this on a rather low-end (in terms of gaming) PC and both lag and random crashes were present, souring my experiencing with the game. But if there is one highlight with this game, then it's the music. The songs will be stuck in your head for a fair share of time, and I urge you to atleast look them up.			"

												A pleasant trip down memory lane, and as someone who experienced the magic of NES and growing gaming market in the 90s first hand, it brought a tear to my eye to see this game come back to life. However, it can't be denied that old things in new world have their new problems.Although the game's superb voice acting is a nice touch, forced custscenes during each level seemed to me as the devs were enjoying too much freedom with their new focus on ""narrative"". In most cases they interrupt the flow of the game, and it becomes a tedious chore to watch and listen to them. Imagine in Super Mario Bros., in the middle of running through a level, you have to stop and watch a cutscene. It gets old sooner than you think. The old-school sensibility is still there, and unless you're playing it on easy, you will die. A lot. And you will restart the levels after losing all your lives. A lot. I appreciate the devs kept this remake faithfully in-line with the original and captured that old games' frustration we remember, but I wouldn't be surprised if this difficulty curve becomes a turn-off for a lot of gamers today. (Checkpoint-and-quicksave-spoiled kids, this was the kind of video games that challenged our mind back in the day.) The remastered animations and music are fluid and stunningly gorgeous, and the new 2D-3D mix style of overall world design (reminiscent of Paper Mario) works beautifully well. For visual department, I could not have asked for more. The signature pogo cane action felt a little finicky and inconsistent at times compared to the original, however.In the end, I'm under an impression that WayForward and Capcom tried to win over both nostalgic old fans and newcomers by featuring charming storytelling and unforgiving platforming together, but the game ended up being confused and couldn't decide what it wanted to be. For those who have played the original, this game is a must-try for its beautiful visual improvement from 8-bit and nostalgia alone, but for those who haven't, let it be known that the only thing this remake does better than the original is the presentation and you're essentially playing the same game from the 90s. Take that what you will, but I don't think you will find the same fun you do from modern games, unless you have a bug for retro games.			"

It was like watching the show almost, which for me made me love this game alot more than the NES version. I know alot of people gave it low reviews, but it's a classic game that was remade. Don't judge it as if its a new game. Just play it and have fun. Also, the intro was absolutely beautifully done.			"

Character sprites and animation retain the spirit of their original design, while feeling fresh and new in their updated hand-drawn style.

The cutscenes can run a little long at times, but thankfully they're skippable.Highly recommended if you are a fan of the original.			"

												Easily one of 2013's biggest shocks; DTR delivers difficulty and charm that the NES original only ever dreamt of giving players.  Even if pogo-jumping through a retro platformer isn't your bag, there's no denying that this is a brilliant-looking, fluid game which benefits from a remastered soundtrack and the full cast of the original DuckTales cartoon providing voice work.  Repetitive gameplay and difficulty curve let the package down a bit, but there's no denying it's fun for a decent whack of time.			"

												Danger! High amounts of nostalgia ahead!This graphical remake of a classic platformer is clearly made with love and care by the fine people at WayForward. It looks great, controls great and sounds great. The authentic voice acting will bring a tear to anyone's eye who grew up with Ducktales.			"

												I was on the fence after reading some reviews but I'm really glad I did buy it. The music is great and kind of a hybrid of old and new. The graphics are great and very faithful to the Disney style. The 2D sprites with 3D levels feels odd at first but you get used to it quickly. The levels are much like the original game, but there's been a lot of story and dialog injected into them and there's a new one at the end...and holy crap is it difficult to beat.			"

												just a note: This is a review being done by someone who never played the original, as I came into gaming late  in the SNES era/early PS era, and am currently on my second play through.The pros of this game:The Music- It is stellar.  I wish they would come out with a soundtrack for this game.  The music for the levels are unique and suit the environment and tone of the game.  I can't say whether it is better or worse then the 8Bit rendition.  Thusfar, I've only heard the Amazon level music and the Money bin version, and I don't care for either of those, but that still leaves a few levels worth of music to go.Voice acting - Getting as many of the original voice actors from the cartoon as they could was a good call.  It made it seem like I was listening to the cartoon.Level design - Overall was fairly good.  While there was some sticky points that they could have improved on (the finale, for instance), the levels were beautifully designed, appealing to the eye, and offered just enough challenge to keep you from getting bored but not so much that the game was frustrating.  Ending aside.The Neutrals:Cut scenes - While I enjoyed watching them generally, they suffered from the fact that the characters were 2D in a 2.5D setting, and as such were limited in what they could do.  Personally, I think the game would have benefitted from cutting down the actual cut scenes to main points (as in, cutting out the ones for individual items) and animating them as 2D cartoons.Difficulties - There are multiple ones.  Nothing really all that special about it.The Cons:Lag - This may have just been an issue with my rig, but there was an odd amount of lag in the game.  While my computer generally is able to handle harder hitting games, it was bogged down by this game, which meant the game hesitated - oddly, this presented as pauses in dialogue and cut scenes, and as slower animation throughout the game, but somehow didn't hinder actual gameplay.The Gallery - While the gallery as a concept is excellent, and I love the idea of using the money you gain in the levels to buy the extras, the fact you had to unlock so much from one section to unlock the next area to buy from seemed silly.  To me, it seemed like a ploy to force you to replay the game, just to get the content you wanted - which for me was the music and background imagary.The ending gameplay - While I won't go into what the ending part actually was, I will say this:  In and of itself, the game ending was fairly good story-wise, but the execution of it was terrible when it came to gameplay.  This game had fairly even difficulty throughout, up until this segment - in which the difficulty randomly and suddenly spiked.  The overall design required a level of precision at points that made the game feel near impossible to finish, especially in comparison to the rest of the game.While the game does have its faults, it's a good game overall.  I bought the game on sale, but likely would have bought it at its full price had I found it at that.  $15 is a steal considering the amount of work that went into making this game, and the sale prices even moreso.  While I can't vouch for the nostalgia of the game, for someone who is a fan of Ducktales and the richest duck in the world, I would definately suggest at least giving this game a shot.			"

												The original was great, this one takes all the joy out of it. Every two minutes ( or less, literally sometimes just tens of seconds) your stopped so you have to listen to unskippable dilaogue, with no value (I.e. what each coin thats only used in a coin puzzle signifies, complete with then 30 seconds more, useless, dialogue with launchpad, repeat x8. Literally.) Screw up and die, and need to repeat the level, welp, now you got to listen to it al over again. Want to replay the game... same.Ontop of it the gameplays speeds been dialed back. Characters just seem to float forever.Buy shovel knight if you want some pogo action. I know you got the original voice actors, doesn't mean we need to listen to them over and over again in slow-mo. If your still unsure, watch TotalBiscuits review (with gameplay footage.) He was spot on.			"

												I appreciate that someone cared enough about Ducktales to attempt to remake it.  It was one of my favorite games as a child, and in fact I still own and cherish an NES copy.  However, this version just can't seem to get out of its own way.  The dialog is intrusive and interrupts the constant action that was present in the first game.  Games like this just don't need a deep narrative.  While I appreciate the effort in bringing in the voice actors from the TV show to do the script, it ends up wasted at best and downright annoying at worst.I played for about 45 minutes and just couldn't continue.  Seemed as if there was a cutscene every  minute or so.  Skippable by pausing and pressing a button, but I just couldn't look past it.  If anything it just made me long for (and pull out) the NES version.			"

												I beat the game, but didn't get all the achievements.This game is quite easy to play and really resembles the NES classic from years ago. That said, it also has harder modes for people who like challenges.The game is very well animated, with gorgeous visuals, and all the dialog is dubbed in english. I'm not american but I presume the voices are pretty accurate with the cartoon, since they resemble quite a lot the voices of the version I've watched here where I live. Lots of the characters make an appearance, so it's pretty nostalgic for people who watched the cartoon.It's not a very long game and doesn't require much skill to play. I presume everybody could enjoy this one.			"

												Maybe it's the nostalgia goggles that I was wearing, but 'DuckTales' was as fun and whimsical as I remembered it to be when it first came out on the NES. 'DuckTales: Remastered', with its colourful palette, is a fine example of as long as the basic game mechanics are done right, some games never go out of style. The PC game controls were slightly sticky when played on the keyboard, and it only became an issue in the last level, which was unforgiving and gave you practically no room for error.			"

												This game is a gret remake of a classic game from the golden age of platforming. The default controls may take some getting used to (especially for keyboard users) but the games graphics, sound and gameplay are all very well done. The only negative thing I can say is that the enemy placement in some places - particularly on The Moon stage - is quite cheap and cutscenes keep repeating even though i have already seen them. Other than that though this game is a must buy for any gamer from the 80's or if you;re looking for some good 'ol platforming action!			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I love the TV show and the original game so when I saw this on the steam sale I was really excited, but the game just wasn't that great. Let's start with the cut scenes, there are way too many of them. I'm sure it is a common complaint but it is very much a problem with this game. To make matters worse, the default settings don't make it very clear on how to skip them. It took me way too long to realize I had to press esc and go the menu and select the option to skip the scenes. Though, it is good that they at least give you the option to skip especially on the first play through. The controls were okay, but they weren't perfect. There were a few times where I wish the game gave me a little more control over what was going on by making the controls a little more sensitive, and I'm not a huge fan of the drop down jumping that occurs when you are on a rope or a chain. I wish the character could have done a little more other than just kind of let go of the rope and fall in a general direction. Though, this particular complaint might just be a personal preference from me being somewhat spoiled by modern platformers with really great controls. The other thing I really disliked was the way the falling platforms worked. When I jumped onto a collapsing platform it would start to shake while the character was in the air. This didn't make a lot of sense to me. The platform shouldn't begin collapsing because you are in the air above it. The mechanic should wait until your character lands on the object in question. Not only does this make more sense logically but also I can't recall many games that do this in general.Other than that, I noticed a few graphical glitches when I played the game. Occasionally a random enemy would blink out of existence and back into view. It didn't happen all that often, but it did happen a couple of times. I'm not overly concerned with it though as it didn't really affect the gameplay much and was pretty rare.The game did have some positives. The voice acting was great and I liked the artwork. The levels were pretty much what I would expect from a remastered version of a game. I do think they could have done a better job of things. While I cannot recommend this particular game, I would like to see them remaster a few other older games and work on getting better at it before maybe considering trying to make new versions of some of these old games. I think there is room for improvement, and I would hate to see this stop because of a subpar attempt.			"

												Here's my review of Duck Tales Remastered:PROS: -Fun and well controlled gameplay.-Controlls well with both gamepad and keyboard & mouse.-Maps/levels are greatly designed and just like the original as far as I've seen.-Feels a lot like the TV show.-The game is challenging, giving you a feeling of accomplishment when you finish a level.CONS:-The cutscenes can sometimes feel like they're interrupting gameplay.-Sometimes can be frustratingly difficult.-I've experienced some graphical glitches like sprites disappearing and reappearing (flashing back and forth)SUMMARY:Some people say that this game is inferior to the original on the NES and only worth it for fans of the original, I dissagree. This game is just like the original with added story as far as I've seen. I hadn't seen the show and never heard of the original until this one, and I still love playing this, so I'd say it's worth it.			"

												Ducktales Remastered is a fine reimagining of the classic NES game. The five stages from the original game are faithfully reproduced in stunning hi-res graphics, the music is a phenomenal reimagining of the original 8-bit tunes, and the addition of voice acting (by and large using the voice actors from the old Disney cartoon!) tickles the nostalgia bone on an additional level.My only real point of complaint is the addition of a final, sixth level in which the game's end boss is found and battled. The problem lies not so much with the level itself, or even with the post-final-boss Metroid-esque escape sequence which is an incredibly unforgiving gauntlet of instant-death hazards that requires both memorization and reflexes to pass. No, the problem is that losing all of your lives during that escape sequence kicks the player right back to the beginning of the final stage, forcing him or her to slog through its entirety again. It struck me as unfun padding in an otherwise tight, high-quality game.That said, DuckTales: Remastered is a great nostalgia kick for people who grew up playing the original NES game, and it is overall put together quite well. Players who did not grow up on the original, however, might be put off by its comparatively short length, but anyone looking for a fun platforming romp should enjoy the game.			"

												As someone who grew up with DuckTales and played the original NES game when it was released, this was a fun blast from the past. It retains a great deal of the nostalgia of the original, while adding an updated look without going overboard. The music is lovingly redone from its 8-bit origins, and the gameplay feels much like it did on the NES (with the exception that the controller is larger, but that's only because I played with an XBox controller). The addition of the voice cast from the cartoon, makes for a nice touch too, as it was nice to hear them again. Made me pull out my DVD collection to watch the series again, and it the process, introduce my 2 year old daughter to the cartoon (which she now asks for all the time). I know many had issue with the amount of cut scenes added, but I didn't find it too bad. After your first play through, simply turn off cutscenes through the options and you're good. It did find the game easier than I did the original, but I don't know if that was me remembering the NES original being harder from the mindset of my younger, early gamer years or that I've just grown better at gaming. Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone; fan of the original cartoon or not. It's a nice bit of nostalgia for those who are and a fun, classic-styled side-scroller for all.			"

												I never played the original NES version and passed this up when it arrived on Xbox 360, as usual a Steam sale landed it in my Steam library and once I sat down to play the game it wasn't long before I finished it.  The overall length of the game isn't long (for me that's not a negative) if you're not going for secrets and collectibles and stuff but what is there is pretty much straight forward fun.  Maintains the old school gaming feel with very pretty updated graphics.  You'll want to skip over the ""story segments"" to get to the gaming.  The last level was a little frustrating due to controls for me but nothing too bad.  A solid platformer.			"

												This game is a bare-bones port of the original ducktales. While the original was great, this have no excuse for the flaws I've seen. While they are minor, the still bug me. A lot of the time the characters are flashing and it can distract from the gameplay. Also you can quit the game, but it will still say you're playing the game and even give you cards if you're not playing. Finally, the money is kinda dumb now. It has no meaning to collecting it unless you care for the extra items. But don't let this discourage you, this game is still fun as hell and I can recommend it to any fan of the original. 7.5/10			"

A classic nostalgia trip that never stops. If you grew up in the 80s, you know about DuckTales and how awesome it was. If you're a young blood and are going, ""Ducktales? wtf is that?"" Buy this.

												DuckTales Remastered is a double fisted punch to the gut of nostalgia. If you played the NES classic or watched the cartoon, there is something here to love. The game looks beautiful, sounds great and is good old fashioned fun. Even if you never saw the show or played the old game (as in you are too young), this is a decent starting point for new fans. Check it out and then maybe buy the TV show on DVD, it's Ducktastic, or something. I don't think they had any duck based puns related to ""good"", except maybe Quackaroonie, which was more of an ""oh my god"" expression.			"

												So...chances are you either remember playing this game in the 90's (like me) or you had a look and thought oh cool!So here is a review based on both with pros and consPROS: The kid in me that once played the original-It is a great remaster of the classic and will bring back some fond memories-Still the same great platforming and same levels as the original.-Overall great game and for a fair price even at full price.CONS: The kid in me that once played the original-Something about the old 16 bit being remasted it looses some of the old school awe-inspiring charm it once had-The game has gone from being more of a game to this mix mash of game and movie. They added way too many animation scenes for the story with no way to skip. Honestly some last 3 min and longer which makes for boring play time.PROS: For a new comer-Great price tag-Great platforming game-Fun at all ages (yes even if you're 50 you'll have a blast.)-A great game to enjoy with the kids. OMG...a game to enjoy with your kids...parents...jump on this. Trust me.CONS: For a new comer-Same thing as above for the movie parts. But honestly, if you're not like me and enjoyed the hell out of the original without all the lengthy animation scenes then this wont be an issue. And being new to the game you may like it so this is only like half a con right?VERDICT: 9/10 Would cane jump Uncle Scrooge again.			"

												It's literally Ducktales... remastered, and it's one of the best remastering of a game I ever seen. Ducktales is a 1989 action platformer on the NES similar to Mario that featured Scrooge McDuck from the TV show, Duck Tales. He travels the world to collect the treasures to become the richest duck. Ducktales Remastered is pretty much Ducktales except with new HD graphics, expanded story, voice-acting from most of the original cast from the TV show, and best of all, a beautifully remastered soundtrack. Ducktales had arguably one of the best soundtracks of the 8-bit era and being able to hear a remake of Moon was simply amazing. I whole-heartedly recommend this game.			"

												A great remaster of a great game - yet first things first: it might crash for you and I mean at the last boss and it might not be fixable. You can try to open up the task manager and set it to only use one core and it might just work, especially if you skip the cutscene before and after that boss, but it might as well not work. Fortunately, for me this workaround enabled me to beat the game.So, about the game itself: it contains levels that are reimagenings of the original levels and they're really good, they're well made, the music is great, the voice acting is good. Also there's now an additional tutorial level and another level as the final level (the story has been somewhat overhauled/made clearer) and you will still recognize enemies and parts of levels if you played Ducktales on either NES or Game Boy.One of the strongest points is the boss design: some now really look massive (as they should) and they are way more interesting in terms of attack patterns.So what's negative about it? Well, the crash bug that happens for many people (as I gathered it's mostly Nvidia users) of course and even when the characters speak, that's not animated. They might move, but they don't open their mouths. That's a shame. Other than that this game is great fun, and fortunately the cutscenes (which happen a lot and carry the story) are skippable (you wouldn't want to sit there and wait some minutes on your x-th playthrough).There are multiple difficulty levels, on most you can leave the game and come back later, there's (tested on a 360 pad) controller support, achievements and it might even have Steam cloud as it tends to go to ""Synching"" after quitting, though it has no cloud symbol in my library.If you feel like gambling on wether it will crash or not orare confident in your abilities in platforming and willing to skip cutscenes in order to reach the final boss before the 2h mark (which might be a little difficult if you watch every cutscene once and don't the rush the levels) so you can use the Steam refund system if it crashesyou should give this a look, when it's on sale.If it wasn't for the crash I could recommend it without needing to think twice.

												I wanna start this review off with saying this is one of my favorite games I've ever played.  From the moment you open DuckTales, it's hard to not be happy. Right on the menu screen they hit you with a nice 8-bit remix of the DuckTales theme, reminiscent of the original game. This is just a sample of the wonderful music that is still to come from this game. All the music is very true to the originals with great improvements with the move away from 8-bit. Now the visuals. The visuals are great. Every level is filled with color and with wonderfully done backgrounds. It gives all the levels alot of life. I love the look of all the characters and the animation. It makes me feel like I'm playing a disney cartoon. And of course, the gameplay. Now this just pulls the whole game together. Never before had i thought ofusing a cane as a pogostick do crush my enemies but now I don't know how iI played platformers without it. All the controls feel very nice and responsive. The levels are simple but oh boy are they challenging. I feel as if they don't make games as difficult as they used to because some of the levels in this game took me hours and numerous tries to complete but they pay off completely once you've gotten the treasure at the end. The boss battles are creative and challenging. Once thats all said and done, my personal favorite thing to do in this game may also be the most satisfying, diving into your vault full of money again and again. I could not recommend this game more.			"

												One year for Christmas I got the newer top loading NES and one of the games I got with it was the original Ducktales. The show had been out for a while and I was a massive fan and I still remember that day-after-Christmas morning, sitting down on the floor in front of the TV, blanket wrapped around my shoulders, everyone still in bed and loading up Ducktales (after blowing into the cartridge of course.) Hearing the midi version of the Ducktales theme, it was amazing. This was my favorite cartoon and now I could CONTROL my favorite character. No matter how many new games I got, I always went back to Ducktales. Must have beaten it over 20-30 times til I got my SNES. I knew that game inside and out and could play it blindfolded.So when I saw DuckTales Remastered...I was skeptical. The show, the original game, completely different era...Could you really remake that game with the standards, ideas and selling points of modern day games? The short answer is no, you couldn't. Call of McDuck just wouldn't work but this game doesn't try to do that. It is 100% faithful to the original game but with the addition of an actual story. It's like watching a DuckTales movie except you get to play the thing.Overall, bias aside, this is as the original game was: an extremely solid topnotch platformer with great enemies, varying levels and fun to fight bosses.Not a fan of Ducktales but like platformers? Definitely a must have.Fan of Ducktales AND platformers? Why don't you own this already.Also, as an ending note, one of the best things about DuckTales the game was the music, each stage had its own though of course none will ever be as popular and well loved as the Moon theme. They faithfully brought the music back, it's so amazing to hear those tunes remastered. I love this game, it was such a huge part of my childhood and instantly hit me right in the Nostalgia Feels.In closing: I could NOT recommend this game more highly.			"

												This remake has a huge nostalgia bonus for those who have played the original title. Still, it's a very decent platformer in its own right. The balance between respecting the original game and introducing new surprises is thought out well. The gameplay remains identical, which is the most important thing.While all the character designs and animations are excellent, some of the 3D assets can look unfitting. Nevertheless, the graphics are colorful and clear. While the music is good, it sounds like it's trying to pull out a bit too many tricks at a time.As the focus has been in making an accurate remake, I think the fullest potential could not be extracted out of the resources at hand. Therefore, what I would really love to see next is an original sequel with a more open world.			"

They got most of the original voice cast from the Ducktales toon (including a now 94 year old Alan Young who voiced Scrooge!), an actual final level instead of running through Transylvania again, and awesome music out the wazoo.  :)  Definitely pick this up if you're a fan of old school platformers!

Controls were tight, art style and audio were a faithful throwback, and for the uninitiated it may spark an interest you can share with your little gamer outside the game in the old tv series (available for free to Amazon Prime subscribers). My four year old daughter loved this purchase. If you can get it on special for less than $10 all the better - I'd gladly pay a little more but the game was at best a four hour experience before watching credits roll which ultimately leaves me questioning long term replay value.

I didn't remember much of anything about the game or the show when playing, so anyone who's afraid that this game is purely nostalgia-driven can worry no longer. As for anyone who has played the original, I'm not sure how much stuff is new/old.Ducktales Remastered is a classic platformer where your main goals are to make it to the end of a stage as well as collect as much money that appears as you can (you use this to buy art and music). Your moveset consists of pogoing on your cane (which jumps higher, nulls ground hazards, and can be used to attack) and hitting things from the side with your cane. Despite these basic controls, the game does a good job to employ them in the levels.The game is fairly short, consisting of seven levels. But on my first time, the game took me several hours. The game as a whole looks beautiful. There are plenty of nooks and crannies to scramble around to collect gems, and I think the levels are well-designed overall. Each level even has different items in chests and the like depending of difficulty. The remastered music for each level is beautiful, but you can still listen to the original, 8-bit versions if you want.Throughout the entire game, there are a bunch of cutscenes. And while the animations are fairly limited in these, they compliment the original voice-actors' voices. It feels like you're playing through an interactive DuckTales episode with each new level you visit. They're definitely charming and I've caught myself rewatching a few in future playthroughs. If you DIDN'T want to watch them again, you can chose to have most of the cutscenes skipped in future playthroughs. Scrooge also says a few lines throughout the game that are also charming albeit a bit annoying after multiple times.As far as difficulty goes, the entire game seems balanced up until The End. You're given four difficulties: Easy, Medium, Hard and Extreme. Easy gives infinite lives and you take half-hearts in damage while the others have lives and you take full hearts of damage. Extreme has no saves throughout the entire game, so if you Game Over, you have to restart. I recommend starting on Hard if not Easy, since Medium was harder due to little/no life drops.Now we get to my one huge problem with the game. The game stays at a nice level of difficulty throughout most of the game (some levels have tough bits, some bosses can cause trouble, etc). However, there are two segments after the final boss that I spent nearly two hours on trying to beat alone. First, there's this really tight upwards chase scene where you're likely to screw up a lot. Every time you lose the race, you lose a life. THEN, there's a segment where you need to quickly climb up ropes to avoid rising lava. However, a lot of the rope grabs are nearly-pixel perfect, and one screw-up means fiery death. Every time you Game Over (with 3-4 lives each chance) from those two points, you need to do the whole last level and final boss AGAIN. And with how unfairly difficult they are, you'll be doing it a lot if you're not on Easy. I refuse to play Extreme for this reason alone! If you don't like the idea of Game Over-ing, I highly recommend Easy first (if you want all achievements, you need to play it anyways for those 2 health upgrades), then moving onto Hard when you're used to everything. Overall, DuckTales Remastered is a solid game that I would recommend at full price. As awful as it is, I won't let The End's unfairness spoil the rest of the game. I'm sure that, Ducktales fan or not, the game's level designs and mechanics will make any platformer fan happy while the music, art, and cutscenes will make it memorable. Achievement hunters can also rejoice, as the gameplay is severely lengthened if you go for those. It's a great game that I hope people don't skip out on because of the press's overall negative reviews.			"

												A remake of an old classic with plenty of unlockables and two extra levels.  On the downside, the game is constantly interrupted by dialogue (Scrooge is still voiced by Alan Young), and while they are skippable, a ""no cutscenes"" option would be nice to keep up the pacing and for old-school purists.  Also, the climbing controls are a pain, so expect to die a lot on the last level.  If the Nintendo Hard difficulty is too much for you, you can play it on an easier setting that takes half a heart of damage and gives you more lives.  Also, you can play with the original 8-bit music, but not graphics.			"

												Ducktales: Childhood Restored would be a more appropriate title for this gem of an experience. Replay the game that helped entertain a generation in a format driven by the voice of the Ducktales cast on an adventure to find lost relics all over the world. Level design remains unchanged though side-missions must be accomplished for many of the zones to move forward, all progressed by the aforementioned voiced cut-scenes. Reimagined boss battles help to create a living world filled with d-d-d-danger as you guide Scrooge to each treasure. As nostalgic as I am about this game, it truly does a wonderful job of bringing classic side scrolling action to a new generation of gamers while staying true to it's roots. If you loved the Capcom created Disney games of the NES, SNES, MS, or GEN; this game is a must have introduction to your collection. What other game features a wealthy beyond reason adventuring duck-man on a journeyto exotic locales? Ponytales? Cottontales? No, Ducktales!			"

YouTube™ Video: DuckTales Remastered Review 

			Views: 95		

			http://cramgaming.com - A look at Wayforward's remastering of Capcom's 1989 8-Bit video game on the NES.		

For gamers looking to spend a few hours jumping around with familiar looking characters, then DuckTales Remastered is very much an enjoyable game that looks and plays nice. However, for the asking price, it's perhaps a little two shallow in terms of overall content, and if you're a one play deal type of gamer, then two or three hours might leave you feeling short changed. On the other hand, if you're a perfectionist, then replaying the game adds much more entertainment value.Score 6/10 - Review by Robert Cram			"

												This is a review from Ducktales fan for Ducktale fans who never played the Nes versionIts really nice platformer for Ducktales fans. But there is no reason to play it if you are not familiar with the series. I bought this game 4 dollars on sale and its totally worth it, i would not pay the full price for it.Voice acting is well done and reminds of the series, the game is overall fun but a big negative comes with the last boss bug on Nvidia cards, when the game crashes as you enter. Also pogo jumping is a bit glitchy and sometimes fails to jump, or damage the enemies which is annoying, but it was like that in the Nes version. However, when you re-do a game, you dont re-do bad controls.Overall: For 4 dollars, buy it. Really nice way to spend 3-5 hours but dont spend a dime more. Its very simplistic, and sometimes repeative, which gives the game fast learning curve and feels rewarding as the game can be real pain in the tailweathers for first hour. However, dont start with Amazon level. If you manage to beat Amazon with just 3 hearts, you find the rest of the game way too easy. This happened to me			"

												This is one of those times I wish I could give a positive review, but over the course of playing, too many things nag at me.I have such a nostalgia factor with this series (loved it as a kid), and I probably will pick it up now and again to try and complete it, just for old times sakes...but it's already feeling like a chore. -The game has been out for years, and yet there isn't even a built in menu for sound/music or windowed mode. The player has to know the ""shortcuts"" offhand.-Controls are clunky, but given the game being emulated, it can be forgiven. What is annoying though are the sometimes too unclear hitboxes (did I hit that? I'm clearly not standing on it).-Hilariously bad design with quick fixes. Eg. On the Amazon level, once I beat the boss, the camera panned out to show that the boss stage ceiling was gone, and in mid pogo-jump, Scrooge went sailing out of the arena, and had to be teleported back for the cutscene to continue; clearly someone came across this bug before me.-Game breaks when I try to navigate from some parts of the office.-Main Menu has some noticeable input delays. I would hazard a guess that it's most likely from amateur timers on when to read inputs. (the game will read inputs long before the options show themselves).-Apparently there has been a game breaking bug near the end of the game, that has still not been fixed after all this time (not for my graphics card fortunately, but it's worth noting).Really just ugh... I got this on sale, because I knew I didn't want to shell out $15 for this, and I still feel bad. It could be a good game with just a little bit of polish. They were literally handed gold: Take a solid game and just update it,but somewhere along the way they just goofed it all up.There aren't 'Meh' Recommendations though on Steam, so this gets a painful 'No' from me.Blow me bagpipes!

												I didn't have the privilege of playing Duck Tales back in the day, and was having a pretty good time with this remake up until the last stage. Having to redo a level if I lost my last life on the boss was disappointing, but tolerable. After defeating the final boss (whom had an attack that was borderline unavoidable, mind you), however, I lost the remainder of my lives on a timed jumping puzzle that came immediately afterwards and was forced to play the entire final level over again. I never went back.			"

Yes, the game does look appealing, especially if you are looking to relive your childhood memories; Sadly, I must tell you not to waste your money on this game. While I would say that Ducktales is absolutely amazing, the game still crashes at the last boss without any known fix as of this day. Being a 2013 title, it's safe to say that the developers will no longer be working on this title, so you will forever be unable to finish the final boss. Do yourself a favor and walk away. An incomplete experience is not even worth half the price.			"

												The sort of game Wayforward excels at, a true throwback to NES platformers. You can beat the game in 3 hours or so, but it's going to be a long way there with all the game overs and lost lives it'll take. It's a tough game too, but there's difficulty settings for those who want a more relaxed ride. Pogo mechanics and hunting for secrets are so much fun too, plus there's a bonus difficulty to unlock if you're looking for a proper challenge. Highly recommended, like most of Wayforward's output.

												Ducktales is in many ways quite possibly one of the most perfect platformers to come out of the 80's a time when platformers were really experiencing there first ""Golden age"" and this recent remastering that was produced in 2013 pulls no punches in delivering an *Almost* perfect experience.This game was produced by Capcom and directed under the same team that brought us Megaman 2 and 3. In fact this game was actually produced between development of the two games. So if you have played and enjoyed those games this one will be perfect for you. it feels almost in fact like this could have been Megaman 2.5 offering both a difficulty curve and visual style that does feel somewhat in line with these two games.It has an *almost* perfect soundtrack that has been wonderfully reconstructed to give a more fuller and varied feel. and the controls feel very precise and elegant. this is a sleekly controlled game that just feels wonderful to play.That being said it does come with a few minor problems. Like megaman you can choose any order in which to play the levels. as  a result rather than there being a progressive level curve the levels feel somewhat sporadic in terms of how difficult levels can be...this means some levels (Particularly the amazon level) seemed border sadistic...luckily these are usually minor problems and with the newly added save function you dont lose everything if you completely game over...In all honesty; other than the fact that some of the cut scenes do go on a bit  and some minor hit detection issues which can leave you feeling that some of the deaths are a bit cheap this game overall is a masterclass in how to do 2D platforming. If it's in any of the upcoming steam sales Definately pick this up you'll more than get your money's worth and more!			"

												This game has good production values such as the graphics and excellent voice acting, but unfortunately bosses take way too long to kill.  I played on normal and easy; basically you dodge attacks until the boss is vulnerable and then you gotta hit him 20 times to win on normal.  It becomes a boring war of attrition, and if you lose you gotta redo this.  The levels have good music but honestly all this game rides on is nostalgia (such as the money bin to dive in).There aren't really any special abilities/weapons (old Scrooge McDuck pogos/whacks stuff with his cane), and the prolonged boss fights (about 11-12 hits even on easy) can make this game drag.  I would only recommend playing on easy (weaker bosses and infinite lives) as I wouldn't wish to run out of lives on my worst enemy to redo everything on the harder levels.			"

They also got all of the original voice actors from the cartoon to reprise their roles! The game itself is a 2D platform/exploration game. If you are a fan of the NES game or the cartoon you'll really enjoy this. Paid $10 bucks for it, completed in a few hours but definitely worth the price.			"

												I think the hate for the cutscenes in this game is dramatically overstated.  At first, I thought re-watching cutscenes was a chore too...until I realized you can just skip them by pausing and clicking ""Skip cinematic,"" and after you beat the game you can play without them entirely.   The hate for this game's cutscenes grew so large that I almost didn't buy it, and thought they were completely unskippable until I figured out otherwise.  The game feels a lot more complete than it ever did on NES, and the voice acting and graphics are all really well done.  I did experience a bit of slowdown on the Amazon stage, but otherwise it ran perfectly and that's probably more due to my computer than any fault with the game.Highly recommended for those who have never played DuckTales on NES, and even for those that have, I'd say it's a great game worth your time.

												As a fan of both the original DuckTales NES game and DuckTales media in general, I seem to be this game's target audience.  The gameplay is solid, unquestionably built off of the original.  The graphics are beautiful.  The 2D, hand drawn art is excellent, matching the character design faithfully, and it meshes well with the 3D backgrounds.  The voices are just as excellent as they always were thanks to the talent of the actors fans have long known and loved, although lines may feel stilted as the timing of each line's seems to have been set by the engine without much regard for the performance.  The music is good.  It doesn't quite seem to know if it wants to be an epic, synth-orchestra take on the original or if it wants to be chiptune homage, and so it doesn't seem to hit the heights of either style.  It also loses some impact when voice samples are played over it before it has had a chance to make its full impression.  The control is very fluid, much more so than the original game.  This feels good at times, but it does not always work well with the gameplay.  In the NES game, the necessity to commit to certain motions (like a jump arc) was not a problem thanks to the fact that the environments were well aligned to your control capabilities.  Here, the extra fluidity means that I cannot have as much confidence of my choices in movement.  And as such I cannot feel as though I know for sure where I should be aiming in tricky jumps, etc.  It is something I will get over with time, but that ""solid"", ""sure"" control from the original game is not quite replicated here, and it caused a great deal of frustration.But what's here is still excellent.  If you are a fan of the original game or DuckTales in general, you should consider it.			"

												No controller support beyond the xbox 360 controller ruins an otherwise fun and faithful tribute to the NES original and the series. Since the developer hasn't done anything to fix that issue, which is a really fatal flaw when it comes to the genre, I honestly cannot recommend it.			"

												My impression of this game is that the developers though they made an episode of the cartoon rather than a game.The gameplay is rather similar to the NES-version with rather simple and accurate controls, that is, when the game doesn't stop you from playing in the middle of a level by inserting some forced cutscene where they talk much slower than you read the dubbing and there is no way of skipping or speeding up the cutscenes (until you finish the game and get a new option in the options panel, but chances are you won't stick around for so long).I understand the studio paid great money to get the voice actors and want to make sure we listen to every expensive second they recorded. When the cutscenes start you can just leve the room, make a cup of coffe, drink it, come back and maybe they are finished talking so you can continue to play. It really breaks the flow of the othervice good gameplay.I consider the game broken compared to the NES-version due to the excessive use of cutscenes and therefore give it a thumbs down. Apparently the developers realized that the cutscenes were not improving the experience since they added an option to turn them off, but then removed that option for first time players. That does not sit fine with me.			"

												This game is a rollercoster of my childhood memory. As a kid, I grew up playing videogames a lot and Duck Tales is one of my favourite games. So I was really looking forward to the remake. The remake, however, does not live up to my expectation. Pros: Enhanced graphic and stuff to buy in game. Nostalgic memory. It is really nice to hear that catchy intro tune again!The non-linear stages from NES version is still good as in once was. You could choose whichever stage you like first.Cons. Quite buggy. I lost my safe THREE times. Not sure how could this happen so I decided to do a marathon to finish it on a single play. Scrooge is quite unresponsive to control sometimes. Especially the last boss battle where you would need precision.Conclusion. Buy it if you want a reminiscing moment. Don't buy it if you are new to this			"

												A homage to the people who remember the original, or the series - to many people, just the moon theme alone brings up memories. I don't mind paying $14.99 for a game that would have never hit the market unless someone was willing to develop it without visions of making insane profit.I can't argue that the game is ""short"", for it's price, but I don't view how I spent my money as a corporate investment, I had far - far more fun completing this than I had with any other game in a long, long time. As for the price, this game's concept isn't about ""completion"", it's a 2d sidescroller, and one that's meant to be replayed, I played it on every single difficulty, completing everything, as it's meant to be played - that's why it has leaderboards, that's why there's 4 difficulties, they could have easily made 5 more levels, but it would make no sense. The game was a homage to simpler times, a nostalgic reminder that despite country of residence, we share common childhood memories.To make a conclusary remark, if you don't have a sentimental value in playing this game, just don't - and I don't mean that in a rude way, but the game simply isn't meant for you, it's meant for those who hold a sentimental value in seeing a bit of their childhood remade. The music is great, and the gameplay owes a lot to it. Overall I enjoyed the game, a lot. And that's all there is to say. I got far more than I paid for, in terms of nostalgia.			"

												Played the first level 'The Amazon' (as real quackers know already ;) and was positively surprised. Although they could use more foreground and background animations a' la' Rayman 1, this is a smooth and fun game. The voice overs are cheese, but its a kid friendly game. The controls woulda been done better, but they are quick to learn. I must say the NES controlls of the originals are easier, just A and B button.. the default here is arrow keys and space to jump and Z to pogostick bounce or to launch boulders and other items. Mouse and sounddesign is solid. The soundtrack is the perfect blend of old and new. Never straying outside the original soundtrack, but with new sparkly soundbanks and instruments that stay truly identical to the original OST. I'd liked to see Capcom include the orginal NES game with this release also.. that woulda been the lolviberry on the sundae (1980's desert :>. 8.9 of 10.1 pogosticks.. would quacksentially pogo rocketjump to get this gem :*]			"

												To hell with the mixed reviews critics have been giving this game. To hell, I say! I found this reimagination of the classic NES DuckTales game to be a delightful and nostalgic adventure, invoking memories of when I played the game originally as well as memories of watching the cartoon on the Disney Afternoon.The game was given a complete visual overhaul, with HD levels and backgrounds, fully animated character sprites, and wonderful use of effects and depth. The five original levels return, able to be played in any order! You no longer need to backtrack to other levels to open new areas once you'd found a certain item, which I imagine is to ease the confusion this caused in the original. The boss battles have been completely revamped, making full use of the environment around you. In addition, there is also a brand new final level that tests your mastery of the platforming mechanics.The music for each level has been remixed, bringing the 8-bit classics up to date and giving them a much more orchestral feel. Another new feature is added storylines and cinematic sequences for each level, complete with full voice acting by most of the original cast of the television series. There's also extras and unlockables, like the in-game art gallery where you can unlock various rewards such as concept art and animation stills.The developers put a lot of thought into these features, giving the players the option to use them or lose them in order to forge their own DuckTales experience. Don't like the new cinematics? You can skip them in the pause menu. Want to hear the old 8-bit soundtrack? There's an option for that. I think that WayForward has done an excellent job with creatively blending the NES game and the cartoon together. Whether you're a diehard fan of the original or a newbie looking to try it for the first time, DuckTales: Remastered is a much-appreciated remake that is truly worth its weight in gold.			"

												Ducktales Remastered is a remade version of the classic Ducktales video game from 1989. I didn't remember much of anything about the game or the show when playing, so anyone who's afraid that this game is purely nostalgia-driven can worry no longer. As for anyone who has played the original, I'm not sure how much stuff is new/old.Ducktales Remastered is a classic platformer where your main goals are to make it to the end of a stage as well as collect as much money that appears as you can (you use this to buy art and music). Your moveset consists of pogoing on your cane (which jumps higher, nulls ground hazards, and can be used to attack) and hitting things from the side with your cane. Despite these basic controls, the game does a good job to employ them in the levels.The game is fairly short, consisting of seven levels. But on my first time, the game took me several hours. The game as a whole looks beautiful. There are plenty of nooks and crannies to scramble around to collect gems, and I think the levels are well-designed overall. Each level even has different items in chests and the like depending of difficulty. The remastered music for each level is beautiful, but you can still listen to the original, 8-bit versions if you want.Throughout the entire game, there are a bunch of cutscenes. And while the animations are fairly limited in these, they compliment the original voice-actors' voices. It feels like you're playing through an interactive DuckTales episode with each new level you visit. They're definitely charming and I've caught myself rewatching a few in future playthroughs. If you DIDN'T want to watch them again, you can chose to have most of the cutscenes skipped in future playthroughs. Scrooge also says a few lines throughout the game that are also charming albeit a bit annoying after multiple times.As far as difficulty goes, the entire game seems balanced up until The End. You're given four difficulties: Easy, Medium, Hard and Extreme. Easy gives infinite lives and you take half-hearts in damage while the others have lives and you take full hearts of damage. Extreme has no saves throughout the entire game, so if you Game Over, you have to restart. I recommend starting on Hard if not Easy, since Medium was harder due to little/no life drops.Now we get to my one huge problem with the game. The game stays at a nice level of difficulty throughout most of the game (some levels have tough bits, some bosses can cause trouble, etc). However, there are two segments after the final boss that I spent nearly two hours on trying to beat alone. First, there's this really tight upwards chase scene where you're likely to screw up a lot. Every time you lose the race, you lose a life. THEN, there's a segment where you need to quickly climb up ropes to avoid rising lava. However, a lot of the rope grabs are nearly-pixel perfect, and one screw-up means fiery death. Every time you Game Over (with 3-4 lives each chance) from those two points, you need to do the whole last level and final boss AGAIN. And with how unfairly difficult they are, you'll be doing it a lot if you're not on Easy. I refuse to play Extreme for this reason alone! If you don't like the idea of Game Over-ing, I highly recommend Easy first (if you want all achievements, you need to play it anyways for those 2 health upgrades), then moving onto Hard when you're used to everything. Overall, DuckTales Remastered is a solid game that I would recommend at full price. As awful as it is, I won't let The End's unfairness spoil the rest of the game. I'm sure that, Ducktales fan or not, the game's level designs and mechanics will make any platformer fan happy while the music, art, and cutscenes will make it memorable. Achievement hunters can also rejoice, as the gameplay is severely lengthened if you go for those. It's a great game that I hope people don't skip out on because of the press's overall negative reviews.			"

												A remake of an old classic with plenty of unlockables and two extra levels.  On the downside, the game is constantly interrupted by dialogue (Scrooge is still voiced by Alan Young), and while they are skippable, a ""no cutscenes"" option would be nice to keep up the pacing and for old-school purists.  Also, the climbing controls are a pain, so expect to die a lot on the last level.  If the Nintendo Hard difficulty is too much for you, you can play it on an easier setting that takes half a heart of damage and gives you more lives.  Also, you can play with the original 8-bit music, but not graphics.			"

												So I played the game and loved it. Then I got to the end just before Magica De Spell summons Dracula and it froze on me. Apparently I'm not the only person with this problem and it sounds like Wayforward is being held back from fixing this bug. I'm not gonna say don't buy the game because it either works for you (no crashes) or it doesn't (you will run into the forementioned bug i ran into). Yeah it sucks that I cant finish the game but whadda ya gonna do. Buy at your own risk.			"

												Ducktales is in many ways quite possibly one of the most perfect platformers to come out of the 80's a time when platformers were really experiencing there first ""Golden age"" and this recent remastering that was produced in 2013 pulls no punches in delivering an *Almost* perfect experience.This game was produced by Capcom and directed under the same team that brought us Megaman 2 and 3. In fact this game was actually produced between development of the two games. So if you have played and enjoyed those games this one will be perfect for you. it feels almost in fact like this could have been Megaman 2.5 offering both a difficulty curve and visual style that does feel somewhat in line with these two games.It has an *almost* perfect soundtrack that has been wonderfully reconstructed to give a more fuller and varied feel. and the controls feel very precise and elegant. this is a sleekly controlled game that just feels wonderful to play.That being said it does come with a few minor problems. Like megaman you can choose any order in which to play the levels. as  a result rather than there being a progressive level curve the levels feel somewhat sporadic in terms of how difficult levels can be...this means some levels (Particularly the amazon level) seemed border sadistic...luckily these are usually minor problems and with the newly added save function you dont lose everything if you completely game over...In all honesty; other than the fact that some of the cut scenes do go on a bit  and some minor hit detection issues which can leave you feeling that some of the deaths are a bit cheap this game overall is a masterclass in how to do 2D platforming. If it's in any of the upcoming steam sales Definately pick this up you'll more than get your money's worth and more!			"

												I wish I liked this game. It has beautifully remastered graphics and soundtrack but the gameplay just ruins it for me. Difficulty settings are way off. Easy is WAY too easy and normal is just rediculously hard. With lousy hitboxes, bad platforming mechanics (ropes in the last stage) the game just becomes frustrating not difficult and challenging. The cutsenes are nice and all but if you need to skip five of them before even getting to the actual stage it becomes a problem specially when you have game overed and need to play the stage again. I heard there is an option to turn these cutsenes off but I haven't found them since the options screen is almost empty with only about three things to adjust. 6/10 Save your money.			"

												One of the best remasters I have ever played, it doesn't just look like a ""HD version"" of the classic title but feels like a new game again.The soundtrack is also probably the best rework I've ever heard, simply amazing. The orchestral style doesn't take away the spirit of the original tunes, just adds even more.Gameplay is superb, the controls feel super accurate and the game is a real joy from the beginning to the end. Levels have both visual and physical variation, there's grippy carpet on the floors of Dracula's mansion in Transylvania and slippery ice in the caves on the Himalayas.So this game really caught me in, but sadly it all was over way too quickly. The final battle was won after about 4 hours, while I didn't rush at all, finding and collecting all the secrets (which aren't very hard to find though). The higher difficulty levels add more challenge by reducing the heart containers and giving extra treasures in change, but the experience is still the same after all, just a little toughier.Is this game worth its price tag, then? Absolutely yes. Even better if you grab it from sale, but this is one textbook example of a game that offers a big bang for your bucks. I would gladly pay more for extra content, since this game only lasts few hours - which isn't that bad, but playing this game simply left me want more.			"

												A great blast to the past for people who experienced the days of the old NES (who can probably play through these levels with a blindfold, since it's a perfect remake of the original Ducktales), an amazing catch-up with fans of the Ducktales cartoons (including the original voice cast!) or a great way to get introduced to the series.The only thing that would have made this game better would be a bonus unlockable for the original 8-bit game, even if just for nostalgia's sake.And bonus points for the amazing soundtrack. The Ducktales intro tune, the Transylvania and Moon levels are my personal favorites.I would recommend this to anyone with a heart for the old NES days and/or Ducktales in general.			"

												A wonderful remake of the 8-bit classic. If you're using Nvidia video hardware make sure you have the latest drivers (especially if you're running a display higher than 60Hz) so that the game runs at the correct framerate.The voice acting (by 90% of the original cast) is spot on. As far as platformers go, this is a great blend of timing, aesthetics and music. (I could loop the opening theme music and music in the credits for days.) Using a game controller is recommended.Highly recommended and a decent value at only $15 (or grab it for 33% off during a Steam sale)!			"

												This game rocks!  Tons of fun, great platformer and if you're a fan of the source material then you are in for a real treat!  They brought back the original voice actors and there is lots of cutscenes, which you can skip now if you want.  You collect money along the way and can unlock concept art and see the original art which is kind of fun.  The humor translates well and the controls are tight.  I played with an xbox controller and for this game it is definitely the way to go.  It is short if you play through in one setting.  I broke it up into one adventure per game session.  I grew up with this cartoon so this was just awesome to meet up with the old gang and go for an adventure.  Huey, Duey, & Luey even show up and quote the junior wood chucks guide!			"

												My impression of this game is that the developers though they made an episode of the cartoon rather than a game.The gameplay is rather similar to the NES-version with rather simple and accurate controls, that is, when the game doesn't stop you from playing in the middle of a level by inserting some forced cutscene where they talk much slower than you read the dubbing and there is no way of skipping or speeding up the cutscenes (until you finish the game and get a new option in the options panel, but chances are you won't stick around for so long).I understand the studio paid great money to get the voice actors and want to make sure we listen to every expensive second they recorded. When the cutscenes start you can just leve the room, make a cup of coffe, drink it, come back and maybe they are finished talking so you can continue to play. It really breaks the flow of the othervice good gameplay.I consider the game broken compared to the NES-version due to the excessive use of cutscenes and therefore give it a thumbs down. Apparently the developers realized that the cutscenes were not improving the experience since they added an option to turn them off, but then removed that option for first time players. That does not sit fine with me.			"

												Overall, the game is an awesome remake of the NES original. At full price, I think the $15.00 is a little much, but sale price around $7.00 is fine for about a 5 hour game, which you can spend more time on if you want to 100%. I'm still going to go with others and give this a thumbs down. There is a game breaking bug at the end for many users. You will make it all the way to the final boss and have the game freeze and need to restart. I did this twice before I went to the forums to find others with the same issue. The fact that the developer has not addressed this is pretty ridiculous. I was able to work around the bug using suggestions from users on the forums, but I shouldn't have to download a third party program to get a game to run correctly. Good game, but can't recommend a purchase at full price, or with the game breaking bug that so many users have.			"

I read the reviews and decided to purchase for nostalgias sake, but low and behold, I made it through the entire game without a problem until I reached the final boss. Despite many attempts the game always crashes. There is no fix. Steam will tell you to contact the developers. The developers will tell you to contact Capcom.

												One year for Christmas I got the newer top loading NES and one of the games I got with it was the original Ducktales. The show had been out for a while and I was a massive fan and I still remember that day-after-Christmas morning, sitting down on the floor in front of the TV, blanket wrapped around my shoulders, everyone still in bed and loading up Ducktales (after blowing into the cartridge of course.) Hearing the midi version of the Ducktales theme, it was amazing. This was my favorite cartoon and now I could CONTROL my favorite character. No matter how many new games I got, I always went back to Ducktales. Must have beaten it over 20-30 times til I got my SNES. I knew that game inside and out and could play it blindfolded.So when I saw DuckTales Remastered...I was skeptical. The show, the original game, completely different era...Could you really remake that game with the standards, ideas and selling points of modern day games? The short answer is no, you couldn't. Call of McDuck just wouldn't work but this game doesn't try to do that. It is 100% faithful to the original game but with the addition of an actual story. It's like watching a DuckTales movie except you get to play the thing.Overall, bias aside, this is as the original game was: an extremely solid topnotch platformer with great enemies, varying levels and fun to fight bosses.Not a fan of Ducktales but like platformers? Definitely a must have.Fan of Ducktales AND platformers? Why don't you own this already.Also, as an ending note, one of the best things about DuckTales the game was the music, each stage had its own though of course none will ever be as popular and well loved as the Moon theme. They faithfully brought the music back, it's so amazing to hear those tunes remastered. I love this game, it was such a huge part of my childhood and instantly hit me right in the Nostalgia Feels.In closing: I could NOT recommend this game more highly.			"

												Way Forward managed to modernise a NES classic and did it well, but however there are minor issues such as the control(mainly the pogo attack not always working when it was needed) but it was nice to been given either the NES method to pogo or a more simple method to do the pogo, nice touch bringing back as much of the voicecast as possible, everyone sounded great(concidering that both Alan Young and June Foray are in their 90's) through i have to agree that the with cutscenes once ya seen em, ya seen em' and wish for a more simple way to skip em'(plus they kinda slowdown the levels)The soundtrack for the most part is well done and respectful to the NES original well cept for Transilvania, dub step, really? yes i'm gonna say that the star of the soundtrack is The Moon, but i do love the redo of The Amazon theme also, plus it's nice to also have the option to play the game with the NES chiptunes ^^All in all Ducktales Remastered is only a fraction of being a great retro remake, with only minor issues getting in the way, do i buy this? i hear folk ask me my response is simply yes cause dispite some nitpicks this is one of the better retro remakes to have popped out in the last couple of years and frankly i'm all for retro remakes done right/right(ish)My final score for this game is a 7/10			"

												DuckTales: Remastered is a nice revisit to the games we played as children. Updated enough to make it interesting even if you have played the classic, but enough of the old is kept to keep it familiar.Visually the game has a nice look and the cartoony style fits the game like a glove. Everything is crisp and colorful, just like it should be. Audio is also spot on and the remixes of the old 8-bit tunes suit the new look. The old musics are also available if you want to feel nostalgic.The game does have some pacing issues with the added story parts. Especially the Amazon level suffers from too many cutscenes which cut the flow of the game. Fortunately these can be skipped and quick cutscenes option is a blessing.			"

												This remastered version of the original NES title from Capcom is absolutely awesome, the title music sparking afterschool memories scored a win from the get go. The graphics are great and the controls are responsive with the gameplay quite addicting. Collect those gems, get the cash and fill the money bin. Speaking of the famous McDuck money bin, it makes an appearence. You can swim in the money bin as an extra option in the main menu. I totally reccomend this game. If you like old school platformers like mario, Ducktales or Disney, then this game is for you. Very cheap for a quality title from a Capcom, a quality publisher.			"

												It's a platformer where you play as a greedy old duck and hop around with your pogo stick- I mean cane. Your cane is your weapon, isn't that fantastic? You play as a greedy old duck, and jump all over enemies with your cane. The cartoony style of the character models, and the cartoony yet 3D levels are all part of the charm of this game. If that doesn't appeal to you, well, I guess you'll have to look elsewhere.If you're really good at platformers, it's probably best to turn the difficulty up. Though, even on the lowest difficulty, there is one point that seems near hopeless, but that's because it's timed and requires percision. Yeah... Good luck with that. But hey, maybe you'll do better than me.			"

												I didn't have the privilege of playing Duck Tales back in the day, and was having a pretty good time with this remake up until the last stage. Having to redo a level if I lost my last life on the boss was disappointing, but tolerable. After defeating the final boss (whom had an attack that was borderline unavoidable, mind you), however, I lost the remainder of my lives on a timed jumping puzzle that came immediately afterwards and was forced to play the entire final level over again. I never went back.			"

												This is one of those times I wish I could give a positive review, but over the course of playing, too many things nag at me.I have such a nostalgia factor with this series (loved it as a kid), and I probably will pick it up now and again to try and complete it, just for old times sakes...but it's already feeling like a chore. -The game has been out for years, and yet there isn't even a built in menu for sound/music or windowed mode. The player has to know the ""shortcuts"" offhand.-Controls are clunky, but given the game being emulated, it can be forgiven. What is annoying though are the sometimes too unclear hitboxes (did I hit that? I'm clearly not standing on it).-Hilariously bad design with quick fixes. Eg. On the Amazon level, once I beat the boss, the camera panned out to show that the boss stage ceiling was gone, and in mid pogo-jump, Scrooge went sailing out of the arena, and had to be teleported back for the cutscene to continue; clearly someone came across this bug before me.-Game breaks when I try to navigate from some parts of the office.-Main Menu has some noticeable input delays. I would hazard a guess that it's most likely from amateur timers on when to read inputs. (the game will read inputs long before the options show themselves).-Apparently there has been a game breaking bug near the end of the game, that has still not been fixed after all this time (not for my graphics card fortunately, but it's worth noting).Really just ugh... I got this on sale, because I knew I didn't want to shell out $15 for this, and I still feel bad. It could be a good game with just a little bit of polish. They were literally handed gold: Take a solid game and just update it,but somewhere along the way they just goofed it all up.There aren't 'Meh' Recommendations though on Steam, so this gets a painful 'No' from me.Blow me bagpipes!

												DuckTales Remastered is a double fisted punch to the gut of nostalgia. If you played the NES classic or watched the cartoon, there is something here to love. The game looks beautiful, sounds great and is good old fashioned fun. Even if you never saw the show or played the old game (as in you are too young), this is a decent starting point for new fans. Check it out and then maybe buy the TV show on DVD, it's Ducktastic, or something. I don't think they had any duck based puns related to ""good"", except maybe Quackaroonie, which was more of an ""oh my god"" expression.			"

												Good remastered version of the original NES classic. Graphics and audio are nice, and it plays well, but sometimes the controls can be a bit weird and may cause some frustration. There are plenty of cut scenes, which are mostly fun to watch, but after a few times they may become a little intrusive, especially because you have to go through them over and over again if you have to restart / replay a level. That said, I don't regret the purchase and I'd suggest it to anyone who never played the original game.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I love the TV show and the original game so when I saw this on the steam sale I was really excited, but the game just wasn't that great. Let's start with the cut scenes, there are way too many of them. I'm sure it is a common complaint but it is very much a problem with this game. To make matters worse, the default settings don't make it very clear on how to skip them. It took me way too long to realize I had to press esc and go the menu and select the option to skip the scenes. Though, it is good that they at least give you the option to skip especially on the first play through. The controls were okay, but they weren't perfect. There were a few times where I wish the game gave me a little more control over what was going on by making the controls a little more sensitive, and I'm not a huge fan of the drop down jumping that occurs when you are on a rope or a chain. I wish the character could have done a little more other than just kind of let go of the rope and fall in a general direction. Though, this particular complaint might just be a personal preference from me being somewhat spoiled by modern platformers with really great controls. The other thing I really disliked was the way the falling platforms worked. When I jumped onto a collapsing platform it would start to shake while the character was in the air. This didn't make a lot of sense to me. The platform shouldn't begin collapsing because you are in the air above it. The mechanic should wait until your character lands on the object in question. Not only does this make more sense logically but also I can't recall many games that do this in general.Other than that, I noticed a few graphical glitches when I played the game. Occasionally a random enemy would blink out of existence and back into view. It didn't happen all that often, but it did happen a couple of times. I'm not overly concerned with it though as it didn't really affect the gameplay much and was pretty rare.The game did have some positives. The voice acting was great and I liked the artwork. The levels were pretty much what I would expect from a remastered version of a game. I do think they could have done a better job of things. While I cannot recommend this particular game, I would like to see them remaster a few other older games and work on getting better at it before maybe considering trying to make new versions of some of these old games. I think there is room for improvement, and I would hate to see this stop because of a subpar attempt.			"

												So, I beat this and I think I'm pretty confident in saying that it's the best remake of a retro console game I've ever played. If you have any appreciation for the platformer/action/adventure genre, please do yourself a favor and pick this up. Wonderful, crisp, responsive controls. Collectibles everywhere and bonus features unlocked in a way that makes those collectibles not feel like a chore to find all of them, but makes you want to get as many as you can to keep buying more. Amazing soundtrack, almost as good as the original, even better in some cases (Brilliant piano arrangement of The Moon at the end). Top notch voice acting and an adorable plot that fits beautifully with the theme of the show and the game. This game is a 90s kid/retro gamer's dream. What they expect the remake of their favorite game to be. WayForward outdid themselves this time, so please, go pick it up.			"

												This remastered game takes all the great elements of the original Ducktales I for NES and embellishes it with extra level content, new puzzles, and energetic music.The intro will surprise old gamers with dialogue voiced by the original cast of Ducktales tv cartoons.The parallax backgrounds are very nicely drawn and so are the remastered enemies.Boss fights are almost completely revamped. Still the same general patterns but with a bunch of new ones and some new full-screen powers and effects are thrown in.There's some content to unlock but it's nothing that adds to the game story, just some nostalgia for fans.I saved annoyances for last as I don't feel they really impact the enjoyment of the game. Scrooge will sometimes say a line of random dialogue during gameplay, the most annoying one is when he says Mrs. Beagley is as big as a diamond, when you pick one up of course. The way the line is read is long-stetched and annoying after hearing it more than 5 times.Some character animations are lacking in animation frames. I've made sure my PC wasn't being laggy, also tried my Desktop which is well equipped for all performance intense games of 2014, and it still seems like there's lack of frames in idle animations.Small complaints that don't hinder any enjoyment of the game. I still find the animation to be very nice a fluid for the most part and most importantly, it stays true to the original's style, both in art and level design.			"

I was rather happy that the voice acting was done by the VA cast of the animated TV series, the music was a great take on the original  NES soundtrack, though I wish they would have given the option to switch between the modern soundtrack & the classic soundtrack.The only gripe I have with this game is that it's a tad bit easier than the original game. But yes, by all means get this game (and if you ever get the chance get a hold of the NES game as well if you've never played it before.)			"

												As someone who grew up with DuckTales and played the original NES game when it was released, this was a fun blast from the past. It retains a great deal of the nostalgia of the original, while adding an updated look without going overboard. The music is lovingly redone from its 8-bit origins, and the gameplay feels much like it did on the NES (with the exception that the controller is larger, but that's only because I played with an XBox controller). The addition of the voice cast from the cartoon, makes for a nice touch too, as it was nice to hear them again. Made me pull out my DVD collection to watch the series again, and it the process, introduce my 2 year old daughter to the cartoon (which she now asks for all the time). I know many had issue with the amount of cut scenes added, but I didn't find it too bad. After your first play through, simply turn off cutscenes through the options and you're good. It did find the game easier than I did the original, but I don't know if that was me remembering the NES original being harder from the mindset of my younger, early gamer years or that I've just grown better at gaming. Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone; fan of the original cartoon or not. It's a nice bit of nostalgia for those who are and a fun, classic-styled side-scroller for all.			"

												Easily one of 2013's biggest shocks; DTR delivers difficulty and charm that the NES original only ever dreamt of giving players.  Even if pogo-jumping through a retro platformer isn't your bag, there's no denying that this is a brilliant-looking, fluid game which benefits from a remastered soundtrack and the full cast of the original DuckTales cartoon providing voice work.  Repetitive gameplay and difficulty curve let the package down a bit, but there's no denying it's fun for a decent whack of time.			"

												Played the first level 'The Amazon' (as real quackers know already ;) and was positively surprised. Although they could use more foreground and background animations a' la' Rayman 1, this is a smooth and fun game. The voice overs are cheese, but its a kid friendly game. The controls woulda been done better, but they are quick to learn. I must say the NES controlls of the originals are easier, just A and B button.. the default here is arrow keys and space to jump and Z to pogostick bounce or to launch boulders and other items. Mouse and sounddesign is solid. The soundtrack is the perfect blend of old and new. Never straying outside the original soundtrack, but with new sparkly soundbanks and instruments that stay truly identical to the original OST. I'd liked to see Capcom include the orginal NES game with this release also.. that woulda been the lolviberry on the sundae (1980's desert :>. 8.9 of 10.1 pogosticks.. would quacksentially pogo rocketjump to get this gem :*]			"

												Prepare to be injected with an overdose of nostalgia. DuckTales Remastered, will carry you away back to your childhood. The Classic Capcom intro sent goosebumps down my spine and everything after it was not disappointing. Some minor gripes here and there. There are hints of dubstep in some of the musical scores. Which can be overlooked, but really? Transylvania needs dubstep? The game is a lot of fun and it holds up to the NES version in difficulty. You can spend hard earned money to unlock concept arts, character art and so on. If your someone who needs to unlock everything then there is plenty to do here. I hope more remakes come out. Chip & Dale and Darkwing Duck would be excellent choices. Above all I highly recommend this game to new and old gamers. You can't go wrong with solving mysteries or the possibility of rewriting history. I give DuckTales: Remastered a 5/5.For more reviews check out J&J Game http://brutalgamereviewers.blogspot.com/2013/12/ducktales-remastered.html "

												This remake has a huge nostalgia bonus for those who have played the original title. Still, it's a very decent platformer in its own right. The balance between respecting the original game and introducing new surprises is thought out well. The gameplay remains identical, which is the most important thing.While all the character designs and animations are excellent, some of the 3D assets can look unfitting. Nevertheless, the graphics are colorful and clear. While the music is good, it sounds like it's trying to pull out a bit too many tricks at a time.As the focus has been in making an accurate remake, I think the fullest potential could not be extracted out of the resources at hand. Therefore, what I would really love to see next is an original sequel with a more open world.			"

												Considering I remember quite a bit of the original NES game, I can say that this game is definitely a legitimate remastering, and if anything made some improvements here and there!The only real bad thing I can say about it is that there are plenty of cutscenes that pop up and can interrupt play, but it's thankfully minor.  They got most of the original voice cast from the Ducktales toon (including a now 94 year old Alan Young who voiced Scrooge!), an actual final level instead of running through Transylvania again, and awesome music out the wazoo.  :)  Definitely pick this up if you're a fan of old school platformers!

												While well drawn and animated the remastering of this game seems to have fallen flat. Perhaps it was the nostalgia of my youth but I seem to remember the game being longer and well... more difficult. That being said my skills as a player have improved vastly since I was 8, so no doubt that was a factor.for a nostalgia trip though it definitely hits  the spot, all the visuals are there and enhanced, the gameplay itself is solid, if a little repetitive. There are also plenty of unlockable collectibles for those of you inclined to go after such things.Infuriatingly there isn't an option to either turn off or turn down the music and sound effects, or if there is I didn't see it. It just seems like such a strange thing to be missing and that irked me somewhat.Anyway, yes I'd recommend this but I would never pay full price, ifyou can get it on an offer around say £5 then its worth it, any more than that and I would say its a waste of money.

This game is just like the original with added story as far as I've seen. I hadn't seen the show and never heard of the original until this one, and I still love playing this, so I'd say it's worth it.			"

												I've never played the original Ducktales, so I don't know how this version would compair to the previous one. This game has it's issues: way too many cutscenes during gameplay, clunky controls, and large hit-boxes. However, these problems don't break gameplay. Besides being a great 2.5D adventure game, it's a great trip down memory lane. I grew up watching Ducktales, and I loved encountering some of the characters that I had long forgotten about, like Bubba Duck. When I finished the game, I felt sad; not that the game ended, but by the realization of just how important good family programing is. Not many games has a dude traveling the world collecting millions of dollars worth of treasure, only to give it all up for the saftey of his nephews.			"

												The production values are top-notch with voice acting reminiscent of the show and art that looks just as good in motion as it does standing still. The difficulty, however...It's almost as if they're ashamed at how hard they made the game, so health pick-ups are plentiful. Extra lives are few and far between, so stocking them up is impossible. You have three shots at beating a stage or it's back to the hub. I can barely stand playing this game for half an hour since the chance at success feels so small. I recommend this game, but with a hearty warning to be ready for failure. If you find cutscenes annoying, you might want to find another retro platformer to whet your appetite.			"

												Ok, so normally one should of course always try to be as objective as possible when reviewing a game, naming all its strenghths and flaws and comparing them to what else it out there... but to hell with it here. If you are and old gaming geezer (30+) like me and have played games since the 8bit age, then it is impossible to review this game without a thick layer of nostalgia clouding your vision. So to make it short, this game is absolutely amazing! Every bit oozes the dedication and love the developers have put in. From the moment the game starts up, I just could not help myself and just had to keep grinning. The superb uplifting soundtrack, the re-balanced difficulty (which makes it possible to enjoy the game without the frustration of the original), the lovely hand-drawn figures of Scrooge, Gyro, etc. and the great voice acting makes for a perfrect retro-experience which will spellbind you from the beginning to the end.

I loved taking out enemies with a pogo cane/stick when I was a kid and I still do. It just doesn't get old. There is some variety added to the gameplay like the bosses' patterns being changed. The mix of handdrawn 2D sprites and semi-3D backgrounds are great. The game is colorful, nicely animated, and just gorgeous all around. If I had to point out one flaw, it's the cutscenes. They're entertaining to watch, but they happen too often and interrupt the game. Other than that, it's a great remake and even at full price it's a steal when you consider that the original game cost about $50 when it was released.			"

												To hell with the mixed reviews critics have been giving this game. To hell, I say! I found this reimagination of the classic NES DuckTales game to be a delightful and nostalgic adventure, invoking memories of when I played the game originally as well as memories of watching the cartoon on the Disney Afternoon.The game was given a complete visual overhaul, with HD levels and backgrounds, fully animated character sprites, and wonderful use of effects and depth. The five original levels return, able to be played in any order! You no longer need to backtrack to other levels to open new areas once you'd found a certain item, which I imagine is to ease the confusion this caused in the original. The boss battles have been completely revamped, making full use of the environment around you. In addition, there is also a brand new final level that tests your mastery of the platforming mechanics.The music for each level has been remixed, bringing the 8-bit classics up to date and giving them a much more orchestral feel. Another new feature is added storylines and cinematic sequences for each level, complete with full voice acting by most of the original cast of the television series. There's also extras and unlockables, like the in-game art gallery where you can unlock various rewards such as concept art and animation stills.The developers put a lot of thought into these features, giving the players the option to use them or lose them in order to forge their own DuckTales experience. Don't like the new cinematics? You can skip them in the pause menu. Want to hear the old 8-bit soundtrack? There's an option for that. I think that WayForward has done an excellent job with creatively blending the NES game and the cartoon together. Whether you're a diehard fan of the original or a newbie looking to try it for the first time, DuckTales: Remastered is a much-appreciated remake that is truly worth its weight in gold.			"

												Ducktales Remastered is a remade version of the classic Ducktales video game from 1989. I didn't remember much of anything about the game or the show when playing, so anyone who's afraid that this game is purely nostalgia-driven can worry no longer. As for anyone who has played the original, I'm not sure how much stuff is new/old.Ducktales Remastered is a classic platformer where your main goals are to make it to the end of a stage as well as collect as much money that appears as you can (you use this to buy art and music). Your moveset consists of pogoing on your cane (which jumps higher, nulls ground hazards, and can be used to attack) and hitting things from the side with your cane. Despite these basic controls, the game does a good job to employ them in the levels.The game is fairly short, consisting of seven levels. But on my first time, the game took me several hours. The game as a whole looks beautiful. There are plenty of nooks and crannies to scramble around to collect gems, and I think the levels are well-designed overall. Each level even has different items in chests and the like depending of difficulty. The remastered music for each level is beautiful, but you can still listen to the original, 8-bit versions if you want.Throughout the entire game, there are a bunch of cutscenes. And while the animations are fairly limited in these, they compliment the original voice-actors' voices. It feels like you're playing through an interactive DuckTales episode with each new level you visit. They're definitely charming and I've caught myself rewatching a few in future playthroughs. If you DIDN'T want to watch them again, you can chose to have most of the cutscenes skipped in future playthroughs. Scrooge also says a few lines throughout the game that are also charming albeit a bit annoying after multiple times.As far as difficulty goes, the entire game seems balanced up until The End. You're given four difficulties: Easy, Medium, Hard and Extreme. Easy gives infinite lives and you take half-hearts in damage while the others have lives and you take full hearts of damage. Extreme has no saves throughout the entire game, so if you Game Over, you have to restart. I recommend starting on Hard if not Easy, since Medium was harder due to little/no life drops.Now we get to my one huge problem with the game. The game stays at a nice level of difficulty throughout most of the game (some levels have tough bits, some bosses can cause trouble, etc). However, there are two segments after the final boss that I spent nearly two hours on trying to beat alone. First, there's this really tight upwards chase scene where you're likely to screw up a lot. Every time you lose the race, you lose a life. THEN, there's a segment where you need to quickly climb up ropes to avoid rising lava. However, a lot of the rope grabs are nearly-pixel perfect, and one screw-up means fiery death. Every time you Game Over (with 3-4 lives each chance) from those two points, you need to do the whole last level and final boss AGAIN. And with how unfairly difficult they are, you'll be doing it a lot if you're not on Easy. I refuse to play Extreme for this reason alone! If you don't like the idea of Game Over-ing, I highly recommend Easy first (if you want all achievements, you need to play it anyways for those 2 health upgrades), then moving onto Hard when you're used to everything. Overall, DuckTales Remastered is a solid game that I would recommend at full price. As awful as it is, I won't let The End's unfairness spoil the rest of the game. I'm sure that, Ducktales fan or not, the game's level designs and mechanics will make any platformer fan happy while the music, art, and cutscenes will make it memorable. Achievement hunters can also rejoice, as the gameplay is severely lengthened if you go for those. It's a great game that I hope people don't skip out on because of the press's overall negative reviews.			"

												A remake of an old classic with plenty of unlockables and two extra levels.  On the downside, the game is constantly interrupted by dialogue (Scrooge is still voiced by Alan Young), and while they are skippable, a ""no cutscenes"" option would be nice to keep up the pacing and for old-school purists.  Also, the climbing controls are a pain, so expect to die a lot on the last level.  If the Nintendo Hard difficulty is too much for you, you can play it on an easier setting that takes half a heart of damage and gives you more lives.  Also, you can play with the original 8-bit music, but not graphics.			"

												I was all but ready to give Ducktales: Remastered a positive review, despite what had been the occasional shonky control error, the obsolete inclusion of a lives system, and the cutscenes beginning to wear thin, because... Well, it's Ducktales, isn't it, in every way that matters. The spirit is there, and it evokes it brilliantly, taking what the NES game had presented to us before and updating it visually into something incredibly pleasing on a key aesthetic level.And then the final level happened. The occasional control issue only gets worse when the game demands more from you, and so what should have been a triumphant finale to a decent enough game became frustratingly hard, through no fault of my own (not that I'd say I'm great at games, it's just that the issues were definitely on the game's part in this instance. That, followed by an awkward final boss and an extra platforming section where that lack of responsiveness stops you getting through a fiddly, precision-demanding bit of timed jumping.Theres ways it could have been better, something like removing the lives system, or even just having a checkpointed continue option upon game over, but to demand that a player go through every problematic moment over and over just to get to whatever stumbling block they last came to. There's an argument to be made that changes such as these weren't made to preserve the original game's intent, but when you call your game a remastering you may as well go all out, yeah?			"

												At writing this interview I have only completed the first couple of levels. The gameplay is actually pretty difficult, particular for some of the boss fights. Timing is everything, but if you remember the old Ducktales then this may not come as a surprise for you. However, everything about this has been overhauled, and it's actuall quite refreshing to see (and hear) some of the old Ducktales gang back in action for this remastering. Capcom didn't pull any punches for this, and while I've had my issues with them in the past, this does a good job of making up for it. I enjoy this game immensely. It even has some replay value, though if you're going to tackle hard, be prepared for some crying. Tears of frustration and all that.			"

Controls were tight, art style and audio were a faithful throwback, and for the uninitiated it may spark an interest you can share with your little gamer outside the game in the old tv series (available for free to Amazon Prime subscribers). My four year old daughter loved this purchase. If you can get it on special for less than $10 all the better - I'd gladly pay a little more but the game was at best a four hour experience before watching credits roll which ultimately leaves me questioning long term replay value.

												A fantastic remake of a beloved 8-bit game. WayForward took what was a fairly simplistic, straightfoward platform game, and transformed it into a handful of mini-episodes of the DuckTales cartoon. It feels all the more authentic thanks to a fleshed-out script and full voice acting from many members of the original cast. Do the frequent cut scenes slow down the action considerably? Yeah. Is the game a little more shallow than you perhaps remember it being? Yes. But for me, these flaws were easily overlooked when I realized I was listening to Alan Young and June Foray (both of whom are in their nineties) performing the voices of Scrooge McDuck and Magica DeSpell again. It's the best nostalgia trip I've had in years.It's not just the voices, though; the whole production is sublimely well done. The original idea to make Scrooge's cane a combination pogo stick/golf club was inspired, and the controls and feel of the NES game are replicated perfectly here even with the gorgeous new hand-drawn artwork. The developer retooled and modernized a few areas of the game, added in a new level here and a new challenge there, remixed all the original music, and topped everything off with reimagined boss fights that are both challenging and beautiful in 1080p. Hats off to you, WayForward... you're among the best in this business.			"

												I'm an avid fan of the DuckTales cartoon, but never played the original game, therefore my perspective comes from a non-nostolgic point of view.The game manages to capture some of the same charm as I fell in love with in the cartoon, while it's limit is due to the confines of a platformer... Meaning, it doesn't have the same level of story as you'd find in an RPG or Adventure game. Each location/stage is decently sized, and enough hidden gems to make discoveries enjoyable. The difficulty is an odd mix, as the concepts of what to do seem quite easy, it often is a little harder to execute for the average gamer.  I believe that type of difficulty is a reflection of the 8-bit platformers of yesteryear, where they all were fairly difficult but that's what made the game rewarding.Despite the game's moderate difficulty at times, it never left me frustrated enough to take away enjoyment. With this concept, the game also has a map to help guide you through seeking the items required to pass the levels. This helps give directlion and prevents the ""what piece am I missing? I've searched everywhere!"" feeling that many games leave you with.  The controls are quite simplistic, yet work quite effectively. It is smooth and even, allowing you to execute the moves and strategies you aim for. The game also contains many  unlocks and goals to give plenty of replay value to the game, and make one strive to ""unlock everything"", which can give depth of purpose to a platformer as well.The absolute best aspects of the game is the ovreall art- from the beautifully animated and true to the show characters, to the voice acting (including some of the original cast from the show), to the music and sound effects, as well as the dialog. It's really a gem!  The way the characters move and respond to the environment is great, making the characters have life instead of being mobile inanimate object. The sound effects and music help feed the environment and adventure, bringing an iconic feel yet remaining its own. And the interjections of story with the voice acting and dialog is fantastic! It happens frequently enough to bring it closer to the feel of the cartoon, caputring each character as they were originally portrayed. Each character talks like, sounds like, and acts in the same ways I would expect them to.Summary: This game is very enjoyable and worth purchasing! The gameplay doesn't meet the same caliber of story that a modern adventure game would, but this game is a remake of a platformer, not a ""new"" game. It has the same rustic charm as games made during the orignal era, and captures the feel that any DuckTales fan would enjoy. Hopefully this game will spur some renewed interest in the series for the next generation, as this is a solid and enjoyable representation of what I'd expect from a Ducktales platformer.			"

												This game right here, this is a masterpiece reincarnated in beautiful HD. I am one of those guys who played Ducktales for the NES back in the day, at least as early as 2002,  When I first found it in my brothers box of old games and shizz. It was fun and all that, though I could never manage to beat any level.Then I heard that Capcpom was going to remake this game, I almost shát my pants because I wanted to play this game so bad because the cartridge was broken. Boo-hoo.The story is pretty straight-forward, Scrooge finds this map which shows locations of some treasures. At least you get a backstory to why Scrooge is travelling around the world, unlike the NES version.The gameplay is superb, you'd better play this game with a gamepad. You hold (X360 controller) X to use the cane as a pogo stick and just, yeah bounce, of course.The music is pretty good, when you boot up the game it starts with the NES version of the theme song then converts into a remade version, it's catchy as all hell.Then you have the music from the stages, the best one is the moon theme.The voice acting is also pretty good. Not much more to say there.The graphics is charming, it's cartoony, what did you expect from a Ducktales game?I enjoy this game extremely much, it's not too easy and can actually be rather hard at times, even for experienced platformers.10/10			"

												Ducktales Remastered is a fine reimagining of the classic NES game. The five stages from the original game are faithfully reproduced in stunning hi-res graphics, the music is a phenomenal reimagining of the original 8-bit tunes, and the addition of voice acting (by and large using the voice actors from the old Disney cartoon!) tickles the nostalgia bone on an additional level.My only real point of complaint is the addition of a final, sixth level in which the game's end boss is found and battled. The problem lies not so much with the level itself, or even with the post-final-boss Metroid-esque escape sequence which is an incredibly unforgiving gauntlet of instant-death hazards that requires both memorization and reflexes to pass. No, the problem is that losing all of your lives during that escape sequence kicks the player right back to the beginning of the final stage, forcing him or her to slog through its entirety again. It struck me as unfun padding in an otherwise tight, high-quality game.That said, DuckTales: Remastered is a great nostalgia kick for people who grew up playing the original NES game, and it is overall put together quite well. Players who did not grow up on the original, however, might be put off by its comparatively short length, but anyone looking for a fun platforming romp should enjoy the game.			"

												Wayforward's attempt to capture the Ducktales magic is a total success, bless me bagpipes!Being born in the 80s, The Disney afternoon and shows like Ducktales were a big part of my childhood. I played a lot of the capcom Disney games back then, back during a time when a show/movie tie in game had an actual chance of being something good instead of the most cheaply made thing possible to sap money from kids who didn't know better. I played them all; Darkwing Duck, Chip n' Dale, and of course both Ducktales for the NES. These games manged to deliver great fun even when they didn't have a lot to work with. So when a remake was finally announced almost 25 years after the original, I was tense and wondering just how well it would be handled, thankfully my fears were for the most part, needless.Remastered takes the settings of the original NES game, which its levels were all loosely based on actual Ducktales episodes, and fills in all that was missing from the NES age of limitations. The art is cartoonish and very beautiful. While the 3d on cell shading seems jarring at first, it ends up working very well to make you feel like you are playing in an actual episode. To add to this effect they have added an overall plot. It was hinted at there was an overarching plot in the original but its limitations really didn't let it say much, its now fully backed by dialogue and the insertion of a intro and final stage, the final stage being unique now instead of just revisiting Transylvania. The original 5 stages have been fleshed out to feel like you are playing 5 episodes of the show that are loosely connected into a mini arch like was a common thing to do in the show. Many of the cast makes their various appearances depending on the stage like the nephews, Gyro, Launchpad, Fentin and others, all voiced very well to deliver a great experience. The music in the game is faithful remasters of the original, the only one that is a tad weak is the Transylvania because it gets a bit dub-steppy but in all the music is excellent, and as an added bonus the original 8bit themes are unlockables, including 8bit versions of the new stages.The only complaint with the game is not one I share but I will note it for those that it may bug. The voices are not by their original actors from the show. It is worth noting that while this bugs purists its not exactly fair to hold it against them as many of the original actors are actually dead or too old to call upon to get the voices. Don't let this minor issue hold an entire game away from you that's great, give this a go. And in a personal opinion, I hope to see more well done remakes like this, Darkwing Duck being at the top of my list with possibly the Ducktales 2 gameplay being next in line.			"

												I actually never played the original when I was a kid but I was expecting a lot based on the nostalgia of others. It was ok at best. Too much talking and not enough platforming.			"

												At writing this interview I have only completed the first couple of levels. The gameplay is actually pretty difficult, particular for some of the boss fights. Timing is everything, but if you remember the old Ducktales then this may not come as a surprise for you. However, everything about this has been overhauled, and it's actuall quite refreshing to see (and hear) some of the old Ducktales gang back in action for this remastering. Capcom didn't pull any punches for this, and while I've had my issues with them in the past, this does a good job of making up for it. I enjoy this game immensely. It even has some replay value, though if you're going to tackle hard, be prepared for some crying. Tears of frustration and all that.			"

												Ducktales remastered is a remake of the classic NES game. I’ve never played the original NES game, so even without the nostalgia glasses, I still think Ducktales remastered is a wonderful game with some minor flaws.The game features a 2.5d look with hand drawn sprites and backgrounds and they look amazing. The redone themes are catchy, memorable, and kickass. They also brought back the original actors to voice the characters. The controls are tight and responsive. There is plenty to unlock with the gems you collect from character art, music, and even sketches from the show.Some of my minor gripes with the game are the cut scenes are fairly frequent and take you out of the experience. Every time you find an item there’s a cut scene. While you can skip them you have to do so manually, there is no option to skip all cut scenes.Ducktales also isn’t for everyone. It features the classic NES difficulty if you lose all your lives you have to replay the level from the start. I found the game to be challenging but fair. The game only became frustrating at the very end where you have race to the top.Overall Ducktales is a great and challenging platforming game that still holds up well after two decades.  "

												If you have any love for the TV show or the NES/Gameboy, this will sit right for you. This game isn't the most innovative platformer (compared to today's standards), but it's classic ""pogo-stick"" gimmick still holds up! If you like classic platformers, you'll love this. If you love Ducktales, you'll adore it. 10/10 woohoo.			"

												A very well done remastering of a NES classic. Difficulty seems easier than it was in the original, even on hardest level. I have to give this one a thumbs up just because of the nostalgia. The only cons I found is the overabundance of cutscenes, but they can be skipped at will, and the really short playtime. Lack of replayability is going to keep me from playing through again sadly, but was a fun trip!			"

												I bought this game because there was an cheap offer in steam. I thought that it might be a good game but actually this game was excellent, better than I excepted. This somehow reminded me games from my childhood like Commander Keen, Megaman, Rescue rangers etc. This game had the most important thing from those games - the actual nice to play -feeling. It was hard enough on easy level but not too hard to make you too annoyed (unlike Megamans on Nintendo).Easily recommened if you like this kind of games.			"

												Ducktales Remastered is a fantastic remake of the first Ducktales game that was for the Nintendo Entertainment System back in 1989. The new music sounds great, the gameplay is just as good as it ever was (not to mention you can change the pogo settings to whichever you're more comfortable with), and the cutscenes really captured the spirit of the show, especially since most of the old voice actors reprised their roles.The difficulty selection is a nice feature for those who either want to just breeze through the game without too much of a problem or jump right into the harder modes that the original NES game was known for. Not to mention that any money that you collect throughout your adventures can be used to purchase things in the gallery such as game artwork, music of the game's soundtrack, to even art from the TV show! Or you can just swim in your earnings in the Money Bin. That works too. Plus, after beating the game at least once, you can play the game with the 8-bit soundtrack, which includes the NES soundtrack and 8-bit versions of the new music added in this game. Though, I'm kinda disappointed that they didn't make an 8-bit version of the Final Boss theme, but oh well.Overall, Ducktales is definitely a game that I recommend to those looking for a good side-scrolling platformer, those who are Disney/Capcom/WayForward fans, & those who grew up with Ducktales, whether it'd be the show and/or the video games. In any case, I'm going to wait for the day that they'll make another Remastered game based on another hit show from the Disney Afternoon, but only time will tell when that day will come.			"

												Do you like old school platformers?Do you like 80's and 90's Disney cartoons?Do you like fun?If you answered ""yes"" to any of these questions, this game is for you. I would reccomend it heartily at the $5 price range for anyone and at regular price for anyone who loved the original game or is a big DuckTales fan.			"

												I logged something in the neighborhood of 100 hours on this game when I was about 4 or 5. After hearing about the Remastered version I excitedly waited for the release.Having recently acquired the game, I can say that this is a perfect remake of the game. It updates the visuals in a great way while retaining the character of the game itself. This was truly from a golden era in Capcom's history.The addition of varied difficulties is of immense value, I can now play this game with the other children in my family and they have the chance to actually beat a level that I never did (did I mention that 100 hours I spent playing was always without finishing a level?).I'm so happy to have this game in my Steam library, and I think if you were a fan of the NES version you would be too.

												Great graphics, well done update, overall fantastic nostalgia... just don't start on The Amazon.  The game can get a little repetitive in the event you run out of lives, but that's what old school games were like (nowadays this is just a dated gaming model which reduces some level of enjoyment).  Still a wonderful trip down memory lane and a solid remastering.			"

												This game is a bare-bones port of the original ducktales. While the original was great, this have no excuse for the flaws I've seen. While they are minor, the still bug me. A lot of the time the characters are flashing and it can distract from the gameplay. Also you can quit the game, but it will still say you're playing the game and even give you cards if you're not playing. Finally, the money is kinda dumb now. It has no meaning to collecting it unless you care for the extra items. But don't let this discourage you, this game is still fun as hell and I can recommend it to any fan of the original. 7.5/10			"

												If you have ever watched the old Duck Tales animated series back on Disney Afternoon (remember that?) or if you ever played the Duck Tales NES game by CapCom, you will immediately be transported back. This is a love letter to the old series as much as it is an homage to and remake of the game. There's either something inherent in these characters that Carl Barks brought to life so many years ago in his comics and graphic novels that just sucks a person by their inner 10 year old. Do yourself a favor and play the game. The platforming mechanics are as polished now as they were then. The game is well worth your time.			"

Needless the say, a ton of nostalgia went into my love for this game.The gameplay is so basic, but so difficult. The music just keeps you going. 1UPs are satisfying to get, and actually useful. Levels are great and well designed. Bosses are great and satisfying to defeat.Overall just a fantastic game! Finally beat it and can't get enough of it.			"

												If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Wayforward got it right.  Keep what made the original such a memorable classic (essentially the whole game!), and throw a fresh coat of paint on it.The presentation and voicework is great - it has the feel of a Ducktales episode.  However, even though this game has tons of personality, only get the game if it's discounted - the $15 price tag is too high. Unless you want to get all the achievements, you can beat the game in one or two sittings as the length the game is rather short. "

												Nicely remastered - doesn't feel forced with the familiar cartoon style. It is a bit of a short/simple (you can see there's lots of work put into it though) game considering it costs 14€ but I don't personally feel cheated because there's difficulty levels for everyone (even for the most demanding). I managed to rage on the Easy level though so if you are not too into platformers you might wanna prepare yourself for mild frustrations. Also there are cut scenes that might seem a little childish to some but you can skip them which is a excellent feature in that case. Overall the game runs excellent on this older computer of mine. If I have to think anything negative it would be the lack of volume control in-game but you can easily lower it manually from your computer.			"

												This is a great update to a classic game. Graphically, the fresh paint makes this one of the most beautiful games released this year (2013). The sound design spot on with the original actors reprising their rolls from the TV show, and the music is very catchy. The controls are a bit wonkey but invest in an Xbox controller and it should feel much better. I'm trying to find a negative in this but come up short. I would probably say the major down side is that you will be humming the Ducktales theme song for day afterwards, I know I have.			"

												If you have ever watched the old Duck Tales animated series back on Disney Afternoon (remember that?) or if you ever played the Duck Tales NES game by CapCom, you will immediately be transported back. This is a love letter to the old series as much as it is an homage to and remake of the game. There's either something inherent in these characters that Carl Barks brought to life so many years ago in his comics and graphic novels that just sucks a person by their inner 10 year old. Do yourself a favor and play the game. The platforming mechanics are as polished now as they were then. The game is well worth your time.			"

												Pretty much perfect. It took the old NES Ducktales game and made it feel like an actual cartoon episode. That's a good thing.This isn't one of those remakes that turns down the difficulty 99 notches either. If anything, it's more difficult than the original.I hesitated playing this because I didn't like the 3D effects mixed with the regular 2D animation, but you get used to it pretty quickly and it's easy to accept once you start playing.It's not a 100% copy-paste remake either. There are all sorts of touches that make it feel like a new experience. One example: in the original game, you'd meet a statue that would force you to pay money to progress in the game. You meet this statue again, let's just say.Only real quibble I have is sometimes Scrooge says little phrases like ""up I go!"" when you climb a rope, and these get repeated a lot. This should be an instant buy if you watched the show and played the original NES game. It's fully worth letting your nostalgia buttons be pushed.			"

												DuckTales: Remastered is a love letter to 80s era platforming games and the original cartoon that so many of us remember fondly. Possibly the most amazing thing about this game is that the full cast from the original show have returned to reprise their roles, which may surprise some considering Alan Young is only a few years shy of 100! This combined with the amazing score of the game, reorchestrated and faithful to the original , is enough to make anybody grin like a madmanSimply put; DuckTales: Remastered is an awesome tribute to fans of the original show and game. You could even say, that this game, isAbosolutely Quackers.			"

												One of my favorite games that I've played in a long time. It brings nostalgia to fans of the orginal DuckTales, and for the fans of the TV show. (which is really good btw) It let's you have the feeling of downright old school gaming, and it's absolutely brilliant!Yeah the game is a tad short, but a very fun game listening to the orginal voice cast of the show, and never-over-the-top voice acting either (Voice Actor for Scrooge McDuck is 94 years old when he voice acted this game, and he barely sounds a year older after the show ended) But over all, It's fun, amazing to look at, and play. Give it a shot.			"

												This game was great. Short, and sweet. They did an amazing job remastering the original Ducktales. My only problem with this is that, they didn't add any audio adjustments. I find this annoying because the music is too loud, its kickass music, but too loud. Another thing was the controls. Definitely something you play with a controller. The mouse/keyboard controls are absolutely terrible. I would recommend this to anyone into the ducktales, but have a controller with you.			"

												A great remake of a classic game.  The updated visuals and the top notch voice acting bring this game up to date.  However the game does fall flat in a few areas (level design being the biggest one).  While the devs did an original level, I wish they would've added more original content and updated the level design.  The unlockables are quite nice and I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a good platformer, especially if you loved the cartoon back in the day.  Would recommend buying at full price but waiting for a sale isn't a bad idea either.  8/10 overall.			"

												Good remastered version of the original NES classic. Graphics and audio are nice, and it plays well, but sometimes the controls can be a bit weird and may cause some frustration. There are plenty of cut scenes, which are mostly fun to watch, but after a few times they may become a little intrusive, especially because you have to go through them over and over again if you have to restart / replay a level. That said, I don't regret the purchase and I'd suggest it to anyone who never played the original game.			"

												While this is an OK remake there three things that get annoying:1)  Control - Is not bad but if you 360 or another controller be sure to use the Dpad NOT the analog stick it doesn't regsiter ""up"" very well grabbing onto ropes or chains2)  Cutscenes - TOO many of them!  I love how they try to bring back my childhood by adding storyline to the game vs its original NES counter part but man is it over done.  I did like they brought back the original voice actors to do it that was a bonus.  Not to mention if you have to start over, you have to watch them again again and again.3)  Boss battles -  Most bosses keep their originality but they change stuff up which, imo, hurts a remake.  If you are going to make a remake, keep the originality of it.  Don't break it by changing it completely.4)  Price -  For $15?  That's a bit steep.  I got this on sale for $5 during summer sale.  The game is only about 5 hours long overall.  If you get it for a discount, that's my recommendation.			"

												At writing this interview I have only completed the first couple of levels. The gameplay is actually pretty difficult, particular for some of the boss fights. Timing is everything, but if you remember the old Ducktales then this may not come as a surprise for you. However, everything about this has been overhauled, and it's actuall quite refreshing to see (and hear) some of the old Ducktales gang back in action for this remastering. Capcom didn't pull any punches for this, and while I've had my issues with them in the past, this does a good job of making up for it. I enjoy this game immensely. It even has some replay value, though if you're going to tackle hard, be prepared for some crying. Tears of frustration and all that.			"

I'll spare you the details but this game is just filled with...everything around every corner!Not only does the game have a strong and beautiful atmosphere between the visuals and the incredible soundtrack to match, it also has a story! A dang. good. story! The story felt like I was experienceing the show beyond the show! The story never ended!What I think was smart about this game is that they didn't name ""Ducktales DX"" or ""Ducktales Remake"". This is a remastered version! It is NOT a remake of the old game and it doesn't try to be! It's a completely unique and new experience! You may see some locations or hear some music you remeber from the old days but the game isn't ALL that! The game brings so much exclusive and new content that you actually want! And it's not thrown in your face either! You can choose to do whatever you want! You can take it slow and explore everything and try to get the most loot or you can just speed through the game! Sure you rewards and such will vary but you WANT to get the best rewards!This game isn't some crappy second-rate Disney game that feautres IP's performing tasks any else could. NO. This is a new adventure and story based around the characters! You don't play it for the IP, you play it for the game! But I must say, the best part about all of this is that it is a completley new game...a...revision into the modern world so that leaves the possibility of potential sequels!

												Wayforward's attempt to capture the Ducktales magic is a total success, bless me bagpipes!Being born in the 80s, The Disney afternoon and shows like Ducktales were a big part of my childhood. I played a lot of the capcom Disney games back then, back during a time when a show/movie tie in game had an actual chance of being something good instead of the most cheaply made thing possible to sap money from kids who didn't know better. I played them all; Darkwing Duck, Chip n' Dale, and of course both Ducktales for the NES. These games manged to deliver great fun even when they didn't have a lot to work with. So when a remake was finally announced almost 25 years after the original, I was tense and wondering just how well it would be handled, thankfully my fears were for the most part, needless.Remastered takes the settings of the original NES game, which its levels were all loosely based on actual Ducktales episodes, and fills in all that was missing from the NES age of limitations. The art is cartoonish and very beautiful. While the 3d on cell shading seems jarring at first, it ends up working very well to make you feel like you are playing in an actual episode. To add to this effect they have added an overall plot. It was hinted at there was an overarching plot in the original but its limitations really didn't let it say much, its now fully backed by dialogue and the insertion of a intro and final stage, the final stage being unique now instead of just revisiting Transylvania. The original 5 stages have been fleshed out to feel like you are playing 5 episodes of the show that are loosely connected into a mini arch like was a common thing to do in the show. Many of the cast makes their various appearances depending on the stage like the nephews, Gyro, Launchpad, Fentin and others, all voiced very well to deliver a great experience. The music in the game is faithful remasters of the original, the only one that is a tad weak is the Transylvania because it gets a bit dub-steppy but in all the music is excellent, and as an added bonus the original 8bit themes are unlockables, including 8bit versions of the new stages.The only complaint with the game is not one I share but I will note it for those that it may bug. The voices are not by their original actors from the show. It is worth noting that while this bugs purists its not exactly fair to hold it against them as many of the original actors are actually dead or too old to call upon to get the voices. Don't let this minor issue hold an entire game away from you that's great, give this a go. And in a personal opinion, I hope to see more well done remakes like this, Darkwing Duck being at the top of my list with possibly the Ducktales 2 gameplay being next in line.			"

												This is a fantastic game. The voice actors and the scenes opening and closing stages help bring the spirit of the show back to it, and the game wonderfully brings context to the stuff the NES original had you do. I definitely recommend this game, it's really fun whether you've played the NES game it's based on or not.			"

												I've never played the original Ducktales, so I don't know how this version would compair to the previous one. This game has it's issues: way too many cutscenes during gameplay, clunky controls, and large hit-boxes. However, these problems don't break gameplay. Besides being a great 2.5D adventure game, it's a great trip down memory lane. I grew up watching Ducktales, and I loved encountering some of the characters that I had long forgotten about, like Bubba Duck. When I finished the game, I felt sad; not that the game ended, but by the realization of just how important good family programing is. Not many games has a dude traveling the world collecting millions of dollars worth of treasure, only to give it all up for the saftey of his nephews.			"

												The production values are top-notch with voice acting reminiscent of the show and art that looks just as good in motion as it does standing still. The difficulty, however...It's almost as if they're ashamed at how hard they made the game, so health pick-ups are plentiful. Extra lives are few and far between, so stocking them up is impossible. You have three shots at beating a stage or it's back to the hub. I can barely stand playing this game for half an hour since the chance at success feels so small. I recommend this game, but with a hearty warning to be ready for failure. If you find cutscenes annoying, you might want to find another retro platformer to whet your appetite.			"

												So yeah, it's basically Ducktales from NES, only prettier. It's go everything Ducktales had, all the same stages, the secret stage and everything, as well as extra difficulty modes (or maybe the NES one had this, I don't remember, it's been a while). If you liked Ducktales, or never played it, then yes, I would recommend getting this game.Fair warning though, there is a lot of lag and slowdown in this game. I thought it might just be my system, but it seems to be an issue with the program itself. It doesn't really affect gameplay, but the cutscenes are bad.My biggest complaint about this game, though, is that I think they didn't get Fenton's VA back, and the person who does it doesn't sound right to me.

												This game...Is an absolute masterpiece. It respects it's elder one that was released back in 1989 and gives it a nice new outlook.I my mind  this even beats up the previous one. Its a lot harder and yet as addicting as the one back in 1989. Definitely an easy way to approach the series at ease to all those who can't stand the NES graphics.So if you have played the old one as a kid this will surely give you an instant ""nostalgic boner."" However there is one major flaw... It contains many, many, many cutscenes. I can't address this enough, the amount of cutscenes makes even Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns Of The Patriots look more videogameish than a movie. Okay, I may be a bit overexaggerating with that one. Thank god the pause menu has a ""Skip Cutscene"" option in it.Once again, buy it. You surely will not regret it.			"

												A classic, remade. Graphics - about what you'd expect for a remake of a 2D Disney game. I'd have liked an 8-bit mode, but what're ya gonna do.Music - I dare someone to listen to the Moon theme and tell me it isn't gold. Both the original 8-bit theme and a modern remix of the tracks are in the game and you can choose between them at the menu - no DLC required.Gameplay - Standard platformer meets pogo stick - bounce around on guys like it's 1989. Cutscenes are skippable and you can turn them off via a menu option but it doesn't stick. Difficulty - Youse guys are pansies. There's an easy mode for you if you don't want to be penalized for jumping down a pit like a buffoon. If you're just clearing out your backlog then go ahead. But if you want to actually get better at platforming play on Hard or Extreme. They're frustrating but it actually feels rewarding to beat a level as opposed to a pointless waste of time.			"

												The original was great, this one takes all the joy out of it. Every two minutes ( or less, literally sometimes just tens of seconds) your stopped so you have to listen to unskippable dilaogue, with no value (I.e. what each coin thats only used in a coin puzzle signifies, complete with then 30 seconds more, useless, dialogue with launchpad, repeat x8. Literally.) Screw up and die, and need to repeat the level, welp, now you got to listen to it al over again. Want to replay the game... same.Ontop of it the gameplays speeds been dialed back. Characters just seem to float forever.Buy shovel knight if you want some pogo action. I know you got the original voice actors, doesn't mean we need to listen to them over and over again in slow-mo.

												A nice platformer originally for the NES. For someone that never owned a NES, this game does not play on my nostalgic senses, but despite my unfamiliarity with the game, it is quite enjoyable. The game is though, but not because of unfair gameplay og jagged controls. One flaw however is the lack of graphics option. I played this on a rather low-end (in terms of gaming) PC and both lag and random crashes were present, souring my experiencing with the game. But if there is one highlight with this game, then it's the music. The songs will be stuck in your head for a fair share of time, and I urge you to atleast look them up.			"

												Wayforward has knocked it out of the park with this one. A beautiful remake of a classic NES game. Most of the voice actors from Ducktales came back for this, and the small cutscenes throughtout the levels really bring this to a new level. Everything just feels right. The controls are very faithful to the original NES version. The music is incredible! The art and voices and the bit of story woven into the game make this feel like an authentic episode of the TV show.I highly recommend this game to any and all platforming fans. I also heartily recommend playing on Hard for a very authentic NES-difficulty experience. Normal and Easy players get access to a Metroidvania-style map system and take less damage. And if you do beat it on Hard, do try the Extreme Difficulty.However, keep in mind that this is a remastering of the original game. Outside of a nicely-done tutorial level in the Money Bin and the expanded final level, there's not a lot ""new"" going on. This is the NES game. Remastered. GameSpot and a few other critic websites out there seem to hold this against the game. Go figure.			"

												This is a review from Ducktales fan for Ducktale fans who never played the Nes versionIts really nice platformer for Ducktales fans. But there is no reason to play it if you are not familiar with the series. I bought this game 4 dollars on sale and its totally worth it, i would not pay the full price for it.Voice acting is well done and reminds of the series, the game is overall fun but a big negative comes with the last boss bug on Nvidia cards, when the game crashes as you enter. Also pogo jumping is a bit glitchy and sometimes fails to jump, or damage the enemies which is annoying, but it was like that in the Nes version. However, when you re-do a game, you dont re-do bad controls.Overall: For 4 dollars, buy it. Really nice way to spend 3-5 hours but dont spend a dime more. Its very simplistic, and sometimes repeative, which gives the game fast learning curve and feels rewarding as the game can be real pain in the tailweathers for first hour. However, dont start with Amazon level. If you manage to beat Amazon with just 3 hearts, you find the rest of the game way too easy. This happened to me			"

Hell, I'd be happy if they at least stay true to the predicessor...Sorry, getting off topic here. Anywho, I like the animation and sprite work, very reminiscent of Wario Land: Shake It! Also, gameplay's pretty good, tight controls, learning curb (A rather shallow one for a Capcom game, but hey) and the addition of 3D graphics into a traditionally-animated environment (Or at least LOOKS traditional.

												As a remake of one of my favourite NES games; I'll try not to let my nostalgia get in the way of the review.Back in the early 90's I was playing my brand new used NES (I was poor, okay?)  and I got 5 games with it: Hydlide (*stomach intensifies*), Fist of the North Star (*rustles in chair*), Faxanadu (*wonders why nobody remembers that game*), TMNT: The Video Game (*pukes*) and DuckTales.Those other games sucked. They REALLY sucked. But I was 6 years old, and I had no idea that the N64 even existed yet. TMNT was the first NES game I ever played, and boy was that a mistake. I should have popped in DuckTales, because oooooh boy, that game was AWESOME. The music, the intricate gameplay, the CHOICES. 4 whole choices in a video game??? Never had I seen such magical culmination of technology and design in one sitting aside from watching Reboot. But what is the remake like? Take everything I loved about DuckTales on the NES, add voice acting, more levels, very close resemblance to the show's art style, good humour, a low price, and EVEN BETTER MUSIC. SmoothMcGroove is in this. F-U -Ceekaying, MELODY JESUS himself, Smooth McGroove. The music is absolutly what I had hoped it would be, and the moon theme blew my expectations. Just look up the Moon Theme Remix by Plasma3Music, you will not be disappointed. They even... oh no...

Watch behind you!There's a stranger out to findWhat to do, just grab on to someDuckTales! Woo-oo!As soon as I think of those golden lyrics, I melt inside. I didn't even watch the show growing up, and didn't even see a single episode until it was on some Disney re-run channel in the early 2000's. And let me tell you... NOBODY sings a TV theme song quite like Jeff Pescetto. And that song is back - clearer, louder, prouder than ever, with some added instrumentals as well.As for gameplay, you get what you pay for. It's a remake, so innovation can only go so far. They try some new things, like a new level, and just like the original NES game, you can choose which order to do them in, just like in Megaman 2, for those of you who haven't played the original. It's  a 2D platformer where you play as Scrooge McDuck from the DuckTales / Mickey Mouse universe - introduced to cinema *I believe* in the Christmas Special ""A Christmas Carol"", though to my knowledge his actual first appearence overall was in a late 1940's Dell Comic book. Your main WMD is your cane - you can use it as a pogo stick to jump much higher, and if you land on enemies, they get the traditional Goomba treatment - 1-hit kill for almost all enemies, excluding bosses and a few special cases like mid-level mini bosses. Visually, there is a lot to admire, and well worth taking a stroll through the unlock section where you can browse an assortment of concept art, sketches, BGM files, and a few other things in exchange for the tons of money and gems you get by playing and exploring levels.There are a few areas I would have liked to see improved upon or added to the game, such as a more immersive way to find money and gems, like hidden loto centers, mini games, and optional side-quests. This would have panned out the game duration easily from 4-5 hours to 6-9 for the initial run. There is some replayability, but not a huge array of it, as the levels do not change when you re-do them after you finish the original 4 plus the 3 end-game missions. This is somewhat disappointing, as you need to go back and replay your favourite levels to get more money to buy the truckloads of unlockables. For fans of DuckTales, Scrooge McDuck, Smooth McGroove or 2D platformers in general, this is a decent title at a fair price. $15 isn't bad when you consider 343 Studios charges $70 for a 4-hour Halo campaign that you don't even get to play as the Chief in. Very subtle, fair purchase for just about anybody born before 1996.That is, if you spell ""subtle"" like this:

												I wanna start this review off with saying this is one of my favorite games I've ever played.  From the moment you open DuckTales, it's hard to not be happy. Right on the menu screen they hit you with a nice 8-bit remix of the DuckTales theme, reminiscent of the original game. This is just a sample of the wonderful music that is still to come from this game. All the music is very true to the originals with great improvements with the move away from 8-bit. Now the visuals. The visuals are great. Every level is filled with color and with wonderfully done backgrounds. It gives all the levels alot of life. I love the look of all the characters and the animation. It makes me feel like I'm playing a disney cartoon. And of course, the gameplay. Now this just pulls the whole game together. Never before had i thought ofusing a cane as a pogostick do crush my enemies but now I don't know how iI played platformers without it. All the controls feel very nice and responsive. The levels are simple but oh boy are they challenging. I feel as if they don't make games as difficult as they used to because some of the levels in this game took me hours and numerous tries to complete but they pay off completely once you've gotten the treasure at the end. The boss battles are creative and challenging. Once thats all said and done, my personal favorite thing to do in this game may also be the most satisfying, diving into your vault full of money again and again. I could not recommend this game more.			"

												I never played the original NES version and passed this up when it arrived on Xbox 360, as usual a Steam sale landed it in my Steam library and once I sat down to play the game it wasn't long before I finished it.  The overall length of the game isn't long (for me that's not a negative) if you're not going for secrets and collectibles and stuff but what is there is pretty much straight forward fun.  Maintains the old school gaming feel with very pretty updated graphics.  You'll want to skip over the ""story segments"" to get to the gaming.  The last level was a little frustrating due to controls for me but nothing too bad.  A solid platformer.			"

												A very well done remastering of a NES classic. Difficulty seems easier than it was in the original, even on hardest level. I have to give this one a thumbs up just because of the nostalgia. The only cons I found is the overabundance of cutscenes, but they can be skipped at will, and the really short playtime. Lack of replayability is going to keep me from playing through again sadly, but was a fun trip!			"

												I can't comment much about the ""Remastered"" portion as I never played the original, but this is really fun and well polished for what it's worth.  The controls are pretty simple and straightforward, and the sound and visuals are really nice.Having said that, I found this game to be extremely difficult near the end.  This is not an easy game by any stretch of the imagination, but the very last level, specifically the ending boss fight and post events, is extremely frustrating.  I do think it penalizes the player a bit too harsh for messing up during this stretch of gameplay, but by no means is it a deal-breaker.For a platformer, this is definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a challenging, old-school throwback.

												*update*It's Capcom Weekend, and I saw this game on sale again. The bug is still not fixed. Today I almost had it beat on Hard, guess what, it crashed during the final boss(I had the recommended fix on btw.). There is also an extreme dificulty that allows no continues/saving. So if you want to risk playing all levels till the end(I'd guess approx 30-45+min gameplay) and having the game freeze in the end go ahead. If this was a small trying Company trying their best and this was somekind of prerelease alpha I'd say just buy it anyway. But this is Capcom a giant Veteran of gaming. They just don't care. I paid real money for this, and in retrospect, I wouldn't even pay for it in monopoly dollars.I won't review the game itself, because it's been done many time already just google it. The most Important to note is, that this game is horribl buggy. To sum it up you have a very high probability of the game freezing/crashing during the final boss. For me it froze up once after I finished the boss wich is even more frustrating. The forums are full of angry customers.  Apparently noone who wrote capcom got any answers, so no one knows what causes it, and there will likely never be a fix.. I myself am using Intel and Nvidia hardware, and as far as I know those are some pretty established companys in the Hardware buisiness(since many claim it's caused by inferior/exotic hardware).Since you don't get support from capcom or steam, your probably better off buying it anywhere else.

												DuckTales: Remastered is a game I went into with no experience of the previous NES classic, I was aware of the original but aside from brief mentions to it in episodes of AVGN and other unorthodox gamers, I never got to appreciate the NES original. Therefore, my view on this game is entirely based on my experience with this version alone.'DT:R' is a very hard game to review in my opinion, as it certainly felt like a classic NES side-scroller with some strong gameplay, bosses and challenges very reminiscent of the NES days - however, I found the controls (for the Xbox controller at least), to be somewhat frustrating. The controls aren't particularly responsive and can lead to very unfair deaths and lost lives (an example being on thorny ground, when you pogo over it but accidentally slip up and lose a life, then cannot jump properly until you lose immunity, hence meaning you lose another life). It's moments like these which really ruined 'DT:R' for me personally.The cutscenes are quite a drag. Fans of the TV show may really enjoy them as I'm certain they are very true representations of the actual characters, however for me, the humour is for the most-part very cringey and I feel like the cutscenes really do interrupt the gameplay. This is a nitpick, but another thing which bothers me is the fact that the cutscenes 1. do not have a clear 'skip' button, you have to select 'start' then 'skip cinematic', 2. are strangely animated, despite looking great, the lack of mouth movement and over-usage of only a number of animations really bothered me as sometimes Scrooge would look grumpy for no apparent reason.The design for the levels really lets down the game in my opinion. The constantly respawning enemies and the ropes really bothered me whilst playing. The ropes are your means of climbing, however can sometimes be unresponsive and work very differently to ropes/vines in other games such as Rayman Advance. However, the levels do look great for the most part, even if the first level has some very repetitive backgrounds that you wish they could do more with. The characters look magnificent and all are immediately recognisable to their TV counterparts. Likewise, the design of the hub where you choose levels also works really well, with endearing cutscenes every single time that are enjoyable to watch, until you've had to watch hem more than once.'DT:R' is a challenge by no doubts, as were many games in the NES library. However, I found that the difficulty came from trying to handle the controls, rather than the actual challenges that were presented to me (aside from the ghosts that you cant kill, screw them). The bosses are challenging and will take you several attempts, however, once again I blame the number of attempts I took when killing the Amazon boss entirely on the odd controls. Overall, 'DuckTales: Remastered' is a game I would only recommend 100% if it is nostalgic for you. Whilst I would recommend 'DT:R' to anyone who enjoys side-scrollers and challenges, this game seems to cater more towards those who were either fans of the original NES game or the TV show itself. DuckTales: Remastered is by no means a bad game, but I don't know whether I would call it a good game either - enjoyable, yes, but the controls and level design let it down big time for me personally.Overall: 2/4 "

												It definitely plays like an old NES game, albeit with shiny new graphics and music.  The game's not a port; rather, it's more of a reimagined version of the original game.  This new one has a new intro stage, new end stage, and gives a bit of a wider variety of objectives to accomplish in each stage.  Maps appear in easy and normal mode to help you with the objectives, but they're absent in hard and extreme modes.I'm actually astonished they got all the original survivng voice actors to reprise their roles.  Especially the VA for Scrooge McDuck.  That man's like over ninety years old!  What devotion!Really, if you like Shovel Knight, I think you'd like this game.  Shovel Knight draws inspiration from the original, as well as from Mega Man (both Ducktales and Mega Man were developed by Capcom).			"

												This is an interesting one. It is both a great game, and a pretty bad port.First, let's acknowledge the idea that no one is buying this that did not, at some point, slap the original game into their Nintendo. For being a completely redone Homage to that game, this is stunning. The ""remastered"" part of the title simply refers to ""Everything"". I don't really have to go into this, everyone and their mother has already done that in Actual Reviews.The problem I have with this is it's one of those ""get it working on Steam and that's it"" ports. The game still has giant Xbox Button Prompts, and it's forever stuck in 720p.Fun Fact, the game gets all funky if you try to set the resolution at anything other than 1280*720. I actually spent more time trying to find the right resolution to make everything legible, than it took me to get to the Stage Select .If you have the capability to get this on an Xbox, do it. It's made for that in mind. Otherwise, you'd better be getting this at a Super Steam Sale, or as a gift. It's not worth it otherwise.			"

												If you played this title on the NES and enjoyed it. Add this to your library. If you enjoy simple platforming handed and the Duck Takes universe, pick it up. The art is beautifully updated and looks better than the cartoon from which this game draws it's namesake. I enjoyed both nostalgia and the mechanics of early metroidvania level designs. The low  point for me was the final platforming level. Duck Tales introduces a timed event pushing you to complete the area quickly. This resulted in the decimation of Uncle Scrooge in my hands. Until the end level there has been no other timed events or complexity of obstacles to overcome. I died here more often then any other point in the game, My daughter watched for a while, laughed and scorned me, growing bored and wandering off. Literally more frustrating to me than Mile High Club in COD4. Once beaten the simple plot wraps and you will find yourself singing the theme song of our beloved Duck Tales family.-typos and errors I am sure. Written from bed on a phone.			"

												Is it the best game ever made? Course not..But it's a *damn good* rework of one of the greatest retro games there was.. I have fond memories of the original DuckTales and this brought it back. Made with love, awesome sound and level design. I had a blast playing through it. It's not long, but worth it.. If you get it for a good price, go for it!			"

												*update*It's Capcom Weekend, and I saw this game on sale again. The bug is still not fixed. Today I almost had it beat on Hard, guess what, it crashed during the final boss(I had the recommended fix on btw.). There is also an extreme dificulty that allows no continues/saving. So if you want to risk playing all levels till the end(I'd guess approx 30-45+min gameplay) and having the game freeze in the end go ahead. If this was a small trying Company trying their best and this was somekind of prerelease alpha I'd say just buy it anyway. But this is Capcom a giant Veteran of gaming. They just don't care. I paid real money for this, and in retrospect, I wouldn't even pay for it in monopoly dollars.I won't review the game itself, because it's been done many time already just google it. The most Important to note is, that this game is horribl buggy. To sum it up you have a very high probability of the game freezing/crashing during the final boss. For me it froze up once after I finished the boss wich is even more frustrating. The forums are full of angry customers.  Apparently noone who wrote capcom got any answers, so no one knows what causes it, and there will likely never be a fix.. I myself am using Intel and Nvidia hardware, and as far as I know those are some pretty established companys in the Hardware buisiness(since many claim it's caused by inferior/exotic hardware).Since you don't get support from capcom or steam, your probably better off buying it anywhere else.

												I'm very sorry people are having issues with the game. Since the problems do not stem from the game itself, I highly recommend playing it, either on the NES console, if you have one, or after nvidia fixes their driver problems. This game is a  timeless classic. The music, animations, game play... If you love 2d side scrollers, and aren't from the NES generation, you missed out. The remastered version was done extremely well. For you older gamers, the updated graphics and music do justice to the original. My oldest neice recently sat down, and watched the first season of the series, and loved it. I can't wait for her to be old enough to handle a controller, or keyboard. If you have young kids, who either aren't into first person shooters, sports games, etc. or are just looking for a kid friendly game, This one is it.			"

												It's literally Ducktales... remastered, and it's one of the best remastering of a game I ever seen. Ducktales is a 1989 action platformer on the NES similar to Mario that featured Scrooge McDuck from the TV show, Duck Tales. He travels the world to collect the treasures to become the richest duck. Ducktales Remastered is pretty much Ducktales except with new HD graphics, expanded story, voice-acting from most of the original cast from the TV show, and best of all, a beautifully remastered soundtrack. Ducktales had arguably one of the best soundtracks of the 8-bit era and being able to hear a remake of Moon was simply amazing. I whole-heartedly recommend this game.			"

												So...chances are you either remember playing this game in the 90's (like me) or you had a look and thought oh cool!So here is a review based on both with pros and consPROS: The kid in me that once played the original-It is a great remaster of the classic and will bring back some fond memories-Still the same great platforming and same levels as the original.-Overall great game and for a fair price even at full price.CONS: The kid in me that once played the original-Something about the old 16 bit being remasted it looses some of the old school awe-inspiring charm it once had-The game has gone from being more of a game to this mix mash of game and movie. They added way too many animation scenes for the story with no way to skip. Honestly some last 3 min and longer which makes for boring play time.PROS: For a new comer-Great price tag-Great platforming game-Fun at all ages (yes even if you're 50 you'll have a blast.)-A great game to enjoy with the kids. OMG...a game to enjoy with your kids...parents...jump on this. Trust me.CONS: For a new comer-Same thing as above for the movie parts. But honestly, if you're not like me and enjoyed the hell out of the original without all the lengthy animation scenes then this wont be an issue. And being new to the game you may like it so this is only like half a con right?VERDICT: 9/10 Would cane jump Uncle Scrooge again.			"

												A great remaster of a great game - yet first things first: it might crash for you and I mean at the last boss and it might not be fixable. You can try to open up the task manager and set it to only use one core and it might just work, especially if you skip the cutscene before and after that boss, but it might as well not work. Fortunately, for me this workaround enabled me to beat the game.So, about the game itself: it contains levels that are reimagenings of the original levels and they're really good, they're well made, the music is great, the voice acting is good. Also there's now an additional tutorial level and another level as the final level (the story has been somewhat overhauled/made clearer) and you will still recognize enemies and parts of levels if you played Ducktales on either NES or Game Boy.One of the strongest points is the boss design: some now really look massive (as they should) and they are way more interesting in terms of attack patterns.So what's negative about it? Well, the crash bug that happens for many people (as I gathered it's mostly Nvidia users) of course and even when the characters speak, that's not animated. They might move, but they don't open their mouths. That's a shame. Other than that this game is great fun, and fortunately the cutscenes (which happen a lot and carry the story) are skippable (you wouldn't want to sit there and wait some minutes on your x-th playthrough).There are multiple difficulty levels, on most you can leave the game and come back later, there's (tested on a 360 pad) controller support, achievements and it might even have Steam cloud as it tends to go to ""Synching"" after quitting, though it has no cloud symbol in my library.If you feel like gambling on wether it will crash or not orare confident in your abilities in platforming and willing to skip cutscenes in order to reach the final boss before the 2h mark (which might be a little difficult if you watch every cutscene once and don't the rush the levels) so you can use the Steam refund system if it crashesyou should give this a look, when it's on sale.If it wasn't for the crash I could recommend it without needing to think twice.

												DuckTales is one of the most iconic 8-bit games with massive replayability, fantastic music and a wild variety of levels to explore (with hidden areas and treasure). Anybody who's heard of the NES has heard of DuckTales (along with Mega Man and other classics) and to this day it is the best licensed Disney game ever made. Based on the animated series of the same name it wowed fans and gamers (and fans who were gamers) like few others had.But time moved on and in this new century younger gamers might not be willing to try the original since 8-bit is so old-fashioned, no? Wayforward Studios though (all fans of the original and the animated series) tried their hand at this remake you can obtain here on Steam. In a nutshell, it is perhaps *the* best remake of a game that I have ever played. Like with the original, the controls are tight, the music (though remixed) is still ear-candy and the new additions (levels, voice actors from the animated series, graphical updates etc.) blend incredibly well into the original game's feel.Sure, some small issues are there (the new final level is kind of a big leap in difficulty among other things),  but there is no possible way to deny that DuckTales Remastered is a fantastic addition to your games library. If you like Mega Man, Shovel Knight and other platforming titles with a bit more to offer than rinse & repeat then this the a game for you. If you grew up with DuckTales (re-runs across the world to this day) then you'll love it. With multiple unlockable objects, tracks and what not there's a good challenge in it as well.Enough of my yakking, get the game. If its on sale, buy another copy for a friend.			"

												When I first tried to play this, I told myself ""for once, I'm going to start a game on the hardest difficulty right away, I love Ducktales and it'll be easy to persevere""- what a ridiculous mistake that was! I bought the game in 2013 and it took me until Dec2016 to finish the game because Hard is so freaking tough.On Easy (default), every hit deducts half a heart (of your 3-7 heart total), and when you run out of hearts, you start at the beginning of your current sub-zone or the beginning of the level. On Hard, every hit is a full heart, and you get 2 lives, so after taking 6 hits (without healing in between), you are back in the Money Bin. Not the start of the zone or the level, you are just straight-up done. Game is hard as balls on Hard, you have been warned.On Easy it's a fantastic platformer that gets everything right (some hitboxes are kinda questionable, but that's ok), and the harder difficulties should present enough challenge for most players (Hard is definitely doable, but I always died to the boss, not knowing the fights, and then...money bin).Nice graphics and a great soundtrack, they did a stellar job with this game.

It's clear that a lot of effort and love went into this remake, and if you're somebody who's in a position to appreciate that it's worth the asking price. However, if you're just a fan of classic games in general I wouldn't recommend it above, say, Shovel Knight. At $15 I'd pass unless the IP gives you warm fuzzies.			"

												Musical earbugs and great TV shows aside, DuckTales is best remembered as a 1989/1990 video game developed and published by Capcom for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Gameboy. Known for its five expansive levels, Nintendo Hard difficulty, and legendary soundtrack, the game was a smash hit and received great reception at the time, such as from video game magazines Electronic Gaming Monthly and Mean Machines.Nearly 24 years later, the game returns in the form of a remaster by WayForward Technologies. A hi-def polishing of the music, environment, and sprites; as well as adding new things such as cutscenes done by the original TV voice cast, unlockable concept art, and redesigned levels made for the current generation of consoles/PCs. The game’s download size, less than a gigabyte across the board, makes it a quick and easy download to your gaming system, regardless of platform.The first recognizable addition to the remaster of DuckTales is the introduction level that takes place in Duckburg mansion, under siege by the Beagle Boys. Through this level, WayForward does a good job at explaining the backstory behind the video game as opposed to the original, which left it up to the player to formulate.The plot mediates on a race between the Ducks and the Beagles to obtain various pieces of treasure. At first; it seems logical, but then the story begins to drift and eventually form holes when the Beagle Boys were nowhere to be found on levels such as The Amazon or in the African Mines, yet plentiful on The Moon and in Transylvania. Nonetheless, the cutscenes are almost always appreciated the first time around. After that, however, it would really help to have a “press X” to skip option instead of having to go to the pause screen every time after that. DuckTales’ noted difficulty setting is one of spectacle; the ‘medium’ difficulty system is probably not what you expect, depending on how much AAA games you might play. Instead of simplifying the game to cater to a more casual audience, its difficulty is roughly the same as the original (and NES games in general); that is, each setting is arguably a step ahead of today’s games. For the medium setting, it’s three hits, and you’re dead, two deaths and the level resets (not counting pickups). There is a lot of trial and error, and the game could easily be likened to Dark Souls or Winnie The Pooh’s Home Run Derby. Despite this, the game is for the most part fair, although in some sections (such as the mine shaft section in African Mines) it can be a brutally difficult experience by not letting you go left enough, plunging you to your death even after all of that hard work you spent getting that far. The game’s treasures (both in the literal sense and the figurative sense) are scattered throughout the level, and it pays off to explore every crevice available to you in the game and then some. It is even possible to obtain an extra bar of life (or two), depending on where you search. The sound design of this game is outstanding. From the background music of The Moon and The Amazon to the climbing of ropes, to even hitting a block with your pogo stick, it all sounds spectacular. Although the age starts to show in the voice cast, they perform their lines faithfully and with the same DuckTales flair as the TV show. Despite minor flickering issues, the game plays fine on the PC and has never crashed on me. It’s what a Day 1 purchase should play like, as opposed to a Bethesda-like assortment of glitches and bugs. The enemy AI isn’t wonky and, spiders aside, all of them are easy to deal with or to get past.DuckTales is a flawed gem with a lovable cast and a forgettable story. The latter is made up by a good soundtrack and good gameplay, and experienced gamers shouldn’t be too conspicuous about this title. It’s a challenge, but a very rewarding one. In that regard, it’s a great game and definitely worth the $15 (or less) retail price.			"

Possibly the most amazing thing about this game is that the full cast from the original show have returned to reprise their roles, which may surprise some considering Alan Young is only a few years shy of 100! This combined with the amazing score of the game, reorchestrated and faithful to the original , is enough to make anybody grin like a madmanSimply put; DuckTales: Remastered is an awesome tribute to fans of the original show and game.

												If you have a small gamer in the house you could definitely do worse than this trip down memory lane. Controls were tight, art style and audio were a faithful throwback, and for the uninitiated it may spark an interest you can share with your little gamer outside the game in the old tv series (available for free to Amazon Prime subscribers). My four year old daughter loved this purchase. If you can get it on special for less than $10 all the better - I'd gladly pay a little more but the game was at best a four hour experience before watching credits roll which ultimately leaves me questioning long term replay value.

												Just like I remembered from being a kid.  I do recommend finding a controller to play as the the keyboard option hurts.  I certainly appreciate that you can stop play and come back later rather than trying to do the whole game in 1 sitting.Worth a play if you want some old Nintendo classic memories!			"

												I never played the original version but this is a nice little game, which people could learn from if they are intersted in making side scrolling platformers.  It's not a long game but that's because it doesn't arbitrarily make you ""grind"" levels to progress.  You get a feel for the controls and available moves early on and then your free to do the levels in which ever order you want.  Each level introduces some new play mechanic or game mode, which keeps things from becoming too repetitive.  If you have any nostalgia for the show, the old nes game or are curious what a quality remake of an old game should look like, you can't go wrong with this.			"

												Played the first level 'The Amazon' (as real quackers know already ;) and was positively surprised. Although they could use more foreground and background animations a' la' Rayman 1, this is a smooth and fun game. The voice overs are cheese, but its a kid friendly game. The controls woulda been done better, but they are quick to learn. I must say the NES controlls of the originals are easier, just A and B button.. the default here is arrow keys and space to jump and Z to pogostick bounce or to launch boulders and other items. Mouse and sounddesign is solid. The soundtrack is the perfect blend of old and new. Never straying outside the original soundtrack, but with new sparkly soundbanks and instruments that stay truly identical to the original OST. I'd liked to see Capcom include the orginal NES game with this release also.. that woulda been the lolviberry on the sundae (1980's desert :>. 8.9 of 10.1 pogosticks.. would quacksentially pogo rocketjump to get this gem :*]			"

												Prepare to be injected with an overdose of nostalgia. DuckTales Remastered, will carry you away back to your childhood. The Classic Capcom intro sent goosebumps down my spine and everything after it was not disappointing. Some minor gripes here and there. There are hints of dubstep in some of the musical scores. Which can be overlooked, but really? Transylvania needs dubstep? The game is a lot of fun and it holds up to the NES version in difficulty. You can spend hard earned money to unlock concept arts, character art and so on. If your someone who needs to unlock everything then there is plenty to do here. I hope more remakes come out. Chip & Dale and Darkwing Duck would be excellent choices. Above all I highly recommend this game to new and old gamers. You can't go wrong with solving mysteries or the possibility of rewriting history. I give DuckTales: Remastered a 5/5.For more reviews check out J&J Game http://brutalgamereviewers.blogspot.com/2013/12/ducktales-remastered.html "

												When I was little (like, on 1st or 2nd grade), I loved the Ducktales game. I can't really remember where I played the NES original, but I personally owned the game boy port. I used to play the game a lot back then and when this remaster was announced, I immediately pre-ordered it. To be honest, I think this might be the first game I ever pre-ordered in Steam.The game is just simply great. It is exactly like the original, but with upgraded beautiful graphics and music (of which I must say holy quackers the remastered moon theme must be one of the best pieces of video game music I've ever heard!).If you love old platformer games, but want them in today's graphics instead of the old 8-bit style, I can't recommend this game enough.Also, it might be a bit late to say this, but rest in peace Alan Young. You will be missed.			"

												I didn't have the privilege of playing Duck Tales back in the day, and was having a pretty good time with this remake up until the last stage. Having to redo a level if I lost my last life on the boss was disappointing, but tolerable. After defeating the final boss (whom had an attack that was borderline unavoidable, mind you), however, I lost the remainder of my lives on a timed jumping puzzle that came immediately afterwards and was forced to play the entire final level over again. I never went back.			"

												As a remake of one of my favourite NES games; I'll try not to let my nostalgia get in the way of the review.Back in the early 90's I was playing my brand new used NES (I was poor, okay?)  and I got 5 games with it: Hydlide (*stomach intensifies*), Fist of the North Star (*rustles in chair*), Faxanadu (*wonders why nobody remembers that game*), TMNT: The Video Game (*pukes*) and DuckTales.Those other games sucked. They REALLY sucked. But I was 6 years old, and I had no idea that the N64 even existed yet. TMNT was the first NES game I ever played, and boy was that a mistake. I should have popped in DuckTales, because oooooh boy, that game was AWESOME. The music, the intricate gameplay, the CHOICES. 4 whole choices in a video game??? Never had I seen such magical culmination of technology and design in one sitting aside from watching Reboot. But what is the remake like? Take everything I loved about DuckTales on the NES, add voice acting, more levels, very close resemblance to the show's art style, good humour, a low price, and EVEN BETTER MUSIC. SmoothMcGroove is in this. F-U -Ceekaying, MELODY JESUS himself, Smooth McGroove. The music is absolutly what I had hoped it would be, and the moon theme blew my expectations. Just look up the Moon Theme Remix by Plasma3Music, you will not be disappointed. They even... oh no... NOT AGAIN!!!!!Life is like a hurricane - here in - DuckburgRace cars, lasers, aeroplanes, it's a - duck-blur!Might solve a mystery...Or rewrite history![Chorus]DuckTales!

Watch behind you!There's a stranger out to findWhat to do, just grab on to someDuckTales! Woo-oo!As soon as I think of those golden lyrics, I melt inside. I didn't even watch the show growing up, and didn't even see a single episode until it was on some Disney re-run channel in the early 2000's. And let me tell you... NOBODY sings a TV theme song quite like Jeff Pescetto. And that song is back - clearer, louder, prouder than ever, with some added instrumentals as well.As for gameplay, you get what you pay for. It's a remake, so innovation can only go so far. They try some new things, like a new level, and just like the original NES game, you can choose which order to do them in, just like in Megaman 2, for those of you who haven't played the original. It's  a 2D platformer where you play as Scrooge McDuck from the DuckTales / Mickey Mouse universe - introduced to cinema *I believe* in the Christmas Special ""A Christmas Carol"", though to my knowledge his actual first appearence overall was in a late 1940's Dell Comic book. Your main WMD is your cane - you can use it as a pogo stick to jump much higher, and if you land on enemies, they get the traditional Goomba treatment - 1-hit kill for almost all enemies, excluding bosses and a few special cases like mid-level mini bosses. Visually, there is a lot to admire, and well worth taking a stroll through the unlock section where you can browse an assortment of concept art, sketches, BGM files, and a few other things in exchange for the tons of money and gems you get by playing and exploring levels.There are a few areas I would have liked to see improved upon or added to the game, such as a more immersive way to find money and gems, like hidden loto centers, mini games, and optional side-quests. This would have panned out the game duration easily from 4-5 hours to 6-9 for the initial run. There is some replayability, but not a huge array of it, as the levels do not change when you re-do them after you finish the original 4 plus the 3 end-game missions. This is somewhat disappointing, as you need to go back and replay your favourite levels to get more money to buy the truckloads of unlockables. For fans of DuckTales, Scrooge McDuck, Smooth McGroove or 2D platformers in general, this is a decent title at a fair price. $15 isn't bad when you consider 343 Studios charges $70 for a 4-hour Halo campaign that you don't even get to play as the Chief in. Very subtle, fair purchase for just about anybody born before 1996.That is, if you spell ""subtle"" like this:

												This is a review from Ducktales fan for Ducktale fans who never played the Nes versionIts really nice platformer for Ducktales fans. But there is no reason to play it if you are not familiar with the series. I bought this game 4 dollars on sale and its totally worth it, i would not pay the full price for it.Voice acting is well done and reminds of the series, the game is overall fun but a big negative comes with the last boss bug on Nvidia cards, when the game crashes as you enter. Also pogo jumping is a bit glitchy and sometimes fails to jump, or damage the enemies which is annoying, but it was like that in the Nes version. However, when you re-do a game, you dont re-do bad controls.Overall: For 4 dollars, buy it. Really nice way to spend 3-5 hours but dont spend a dime more. Its very simplistic, and sometimes repeative, which gives the game fast learning curve and feels rewarding as the game can be real pain in the tailweathers for first hour. However, dont start with Amazon level. If you manage to beat Amazon with just 3 hearts, you find the rest of the game way too easy. This happened to me			"

												This is one of those times I wish I could give a positive review, but over the course of playing, too many things nag at me.I have such a nostalgia factor with this series (loved it as a kid), and I probably will pick it up now and again to try and complete it, just for old times sakes...but it's already feeling like a chore. -The game has been out for years, and yet there isn't even a built in menu for sound/music or windowed mode. The player has to know the ""shortcuts"" offhand.-Controls are clunky, but given the game being emulated, it can be forgiven. What is annoying though are the sometimes too unclear hitboxes (did I hit that? I'm clearly not standing on it).-Hilariously bad design with quick fixes. Eg. On the Amazon level, once I beat the boss, the camera panned out to show that the boss stage ceiling was gone, and in mid pogo-jump, Scrooge went sailing out of the arena, and had to be teleported back for the cutscene to continue; clearly someone came across this bug before me.-Game breaks when I try to navigate from some parts of the office.-Main Menu has some noticeable input delays. I would hazard a guess that it's most likely from amateur timers on when to read inputs. (the game will read inputs long before the options show themselves).-Apparently there has been a game breaking bug near the end of the game, that has still not been fixed after all this time (not for my graphics card fortunately, but it's worth noting).Really just ugh... I got this on sale, because I knew I didn't want to shell out $15 for this, and I still feel bad. It could be a good game with just a little bit of polish. They were literally handed gold: Take a solid game and just update it,but somewhere along the way they just goofed it all up.There aren't 'Meh' Recommendations though on Steam, so this gets a painful 'No' from me.Blow me bagpipes!

												[8/10] Really good plateformer like ol'times!Ducktales Remastered is the remade and improved version of an all times NES plateformer classic based on the Disney TV show of the same name.And, well... it ... is ... GOOD!Really, it's great!Everything is there, from the well balanced difficulty to the catchy musical score and the excellent maniability, this game gives you all.The graphics are really eye candy, the animations are smooth as they can be and the dialogues (fully voiced) are really well played and stick perfectly with the personalities of each of the characters.I love it.Yes, in its kind, it's almost a perfect for me.So why not giving it a full 10/10 A+ grade with chocolate chips on top?Because of the random crashes.Some people experienced them throughout the game, breaking their fun to pieces, and I only did at the very end, during the final boss fight. 4 of 5 times I tried it, the game crashed and i had to open Windows Task Manager to kill the process, as it did not stop and the music was still running.To tell you the truth, this bug (on Sept. 26 2016) prevented me to beat the story, and it frustrates me oh so much!Apart of that dark spot on it's majesty, this soft is excellent and I highly recommend it for ol'timers from the early 80's as well as the younger players who love a good ""jump on monsters and collect treasures""!P.S. : I'm not making any publicity for him, but Doug Walker (Nostalgia Critic) made a intelligent review of the TV show, and I recommend you to go see it on Youtube.

												Is it the best game ever made? Course not..But it's a *damn good* rework of one of the greatest retro games there was.. I have fond memories of the original DuckTales and this brought it back. Made with love, awesome sound and level design. I had a blast playing through it. It's not long, but worth it.. If you get it for a good price, go for it!			"

												*update*It's Capcom Weekend, and I saw this game on sale again. The bug is still not fixed. Today I almost had it beat on Hard, guess what, it crashed during the final boss(I had the recommended fix on btw.). There is also an extreme dificulty that allows no continues/saving. So if you want to risk playing all levels till the end(I'd guess approx 30-45+min gameplay) and having the game freeze in the end go ahead. If this was a small trying Company trying their best and this was somekind of prerelease alpha I'd say just buy it anyway. But this is Capcom a giant Veteran of gaming. They just don't care. I paid real money for this, and in retrospect, I wouldn't even pay for it in monopoly dollars.I won't review the game itself, because it's been done many time already just google it. The most Important to note is, that this game is horribl buggy. To sum it up you have a very high probability of the game freezing/crashing during the final boss. For me it froze up once after I finished the boss wich is even more frustrating. The forums are full of angry customers.  Apparently noone who wrote capcom got any answers, so no one knows what causes it, and there will likely never be a fix.. I myself am using Intel and Nvidia hardware, and as far as I know those are some pretty established companys in the Hardware buisiness(since many claim it's caused by inferior/exotic hardware).Since you don't get support from capcom or steam, your probably better off buying it anywhere else.

												I dont know what everyone is talking about regarding ""the game crashes at the last boss""....maybe their systems are outdated garbage, who knows? I managed to beat the game on Extreme difficulty with not a single crash (check my profile for the trophy) so I dont know what to tell you. Either way, I loved this game- I was a big fan of it on the NES, and this remake does it great justice. Hand-painted animated sprites mixed with good looking 3-d backgrounds, great score, old-school difficulty, and possibly best of all, the original voice actors from the TV show (except Gizmoduck, whose VA died before the game...Ducktales Remastered is also the last project that the VA for Scrooge did before his death as well). Definitely worth a go, but maybe wait til a sale, just in case the Crash Boogeyman decides to get you.			"

												It's literally Ducktales... remastered, and it's one of the best remastering of a game I ever seen. Ducktales is a 1989 action platformer on the NES similar to Mario that featured Scrooge McDuck from the TV show, Duck Tales. He travels the world to collect the treasures to become the richest duck. Ducktales Remastered is pretty much Ducktales except with new HD graphics, expanded story, voice-acting from most of the original cast from the TV show, and best of all, a beautifully remastered soundtrack. Ducktales had arguably one of the best soundtracks of the 8-bit era and being able to hear a remake of Moon was simply amazing. I whole-heartedly recommend this game.			"

												I'm very sorry people are having issues with the game. Since the problems do not stem from the game itself, I highly recommend playing it, either on the NES console, if you have one, or after nvidia fixes their driver problems. This game is a  timeless classic. The music, animations, game play... If you love 2d side scrollers, and aren't from the NES generation, you missed out. The remastered version was done extremely well. For you older gamers, the updated graphics and music do justice to the original. My oldest neice recently sat down, and watched the first season of the series, and loved it. I can't wait for her to be old enough to handle a controller, or keyboard. If you have young kids, who either aren't into first person shooters, sports games, etc. or are just looking for a kid friendly game, This one is it.			"

												As a fan of the original show and with a reboot in the works, I HAD to get this one in my library sooner or later. If they picked up where the movie left off, that'd be great! Hell, I'd be happy if they at least stay true to the predicessor...Sorry, getting off topic here. Anywho, I like the animation and sprite work, very reminiscent of Wario Land: Shake It! Also, gameplay's pretty good, tight controls, learning curb (A rather shallow one for a Capcom game, but hey) and the addition of 3D graphics into a traditionally-animated environment (Or at least LOOKS traditional. While I've never played the original game, I definately recommend it for those who DID, fans of the show or at least anybody that enjoys a good platformer.			"

												So...chances are you either remember playing this game in the 90's (like me) or you had a look and thought oh cool!So here is a review based on both with pros and consPROS: The kid in me that once played the original-It is a great remaster of the classic and will bring back some fond memories-Still the same great platforming and same levels as the original.-Overall great game and for a fair price even at full price.CONS: The kid in me that once played the original-Something about the old 16 bit being remasted it looses some of the old school awe-inspiring charm it once had-The game has gone from being more of a game to this mix mash of game and movie. They added way too many animation scenes for the story with no way to skip. Honestly some last 3 min and longer which makes for boring play time.PROS: For a new comer-Great price tag-Great platforming game-Fun at all ages (yes even if you're 50 you'll have a blast.)-A great game to enjoy with the kids. OMG...a game to enjoy with your kids...parents...jump on this. Trust me.CONS: For a new comer-Same thing as above for the movie parts. But honestly, if you're not like me and enjoyed the hell out of the original without all the lengthy animation scenes then this wont be an issue. And being new to the game you may like it so this is only like half a con right?VERDICT: 9/10 Would cane jump Uncle Scrooge again.			"

												A great remaster of a great game - yet first things first: it might crash for you and I mean at the last boss and it might not be fixable. You can try to open up the task manager and set it to only use one core and it might just work, especially if you skip the cutscene before and after that boss, but it might as well not work. Fortunately, for me this workaround enabled me to beat the game.So, about the game itself: it contains levels that are reimagenings of the original levels and they're really good, they're well made, the music is great, the voice acting is good. Also there's now an additional tutorial level and another level as the final level (the story has been somewhat overhauled/made clearer) and you will still recognize enemies and parts of levels if you played Ducktales on either NES or Game Boy.One of the strongest points is the boss design: some now really look massive (as they should) and they are way more interesting in terms of attack patterns.So what's negative about it? Well, the crash bug that happens for many people (as I gathered it's mostly Nvidia users) of course and even when the characters speak, that's not animated. They might move, but they don't open their mouths. That's a shame. Other than that this game is great fun, and fortunately the cutscenes (which happen a lot and carry the story) are skippable (you wouldn't want to sit there and wait some minutes on your x-th playthrough).There are multiple difficulty levels, on most you can leave the game and come back later, there's (tested on a 360 pad) controller support, achievements and it might even have Steam cloud as it tends to go to ""Synching"" after quitting, though it has no cloud symbol in my library.If you feel like gambling on wether it will crash or not orare confident in your abilities in platforming and willing to skip cutscenes in order to reach the final boss before the 2h mark (which might be a little difficult if you watch every cutscene once and don't the rush the levels) so you can use the Steam refund system if it crashesyou should give this a look, when it's on sale.If it wasn't for the crash I could recommend it without needing to think twice.

												Nostalgia is what this game is all about.  The NES game gets a facelift, great voice acting, music and artwork.  Unfortunately, even after a few updates, there are still some substantial bugs.  Sprite flicker can get bad to the point of unplayable at times... other times its basically non-existant.  I haven't figured out any rhyme or reason to when/why the sprite flicker occurs.  I have had one crash but nothing since then.  PC keyboard controls are kind of clunky.  Might be better with a controller but I haven't tried.Overall, 3 out of 5, goes to 5 out of 5 when/if they ever resolve all the bugs.			"

												Ok, so normally one should of course always try to be as objective as possible when reviewing a game, naming all its strenghths and flaws and comparing them to what else it out there... but to hell with it here. If you are and old gaming geezer (30+) like me and have played games since the 8bit age, then it is impossible to review this game without a thick layer of nostalgia clouding your vision. So to make it short, this game is absolutely amazing! Every bit oozes the dedication and love the developers have put in. From the moment the game starts up, I just could not help myself and just had to keep grinning. The superb uplifting soundtrack, the re-balanced difficulty (which makes it possible to enjoy the game without the frustration of the original), the lovely hand-drawn figures of Scrooge, Gyro, etc. and the great voice acting makes for a perfrect retro-experience which will spellbind you from the beginning to the end. I think I had more fun with the 5 hours of this game than with any 5 hours of a AAA title.Just. Can't. Stop. Grinning. :-D			"

												I say yes I would recommend this game, however, only to those who have seen the show. Mostly because, yeah, I watched the show buit not fully, so I didn't get a lot of stufff in the game like Scrooge's first dime and why Magica wanted it (and who Magica even was). The humor in the game is a lot like the show and that is good but there wasn't enough to actually make me laugh. The graphics, however, were great and looked like you were watching the show because they looked (mostly) as they do in the show and almost all the orignal cast is back. I know this was based on the orignal game but I would've liked to play as some of the othe characters other than Scrooge. Like, fly Launchpad's plane during the bombing part or something? Also that it didn't really make sense in the story to have the kids out of the game, because they didn't do that in the show, in fact they rarely even listened and would've followed Scrooge. Sure they kinda did that in the Himliahs but I kinda wanted more character interaction. But thats just a nitpick. There are minor glitches in the game, and the controls aren't the greatest in the world. I personally played witha xbox 360 controller and ran the game on Windows 10 and I never had a huge issue with glitches. The worse I got was that I felt annoyed in the boss battle that I had to hit the bat in the excat spot in order to hit him but most of the time I would miss the bat, miss the second bat, or not get high to reach the boss. The gliches became more noticable the later I got in the game, expect for one, and it was the ropes/chains. For whatever reason, Scrooge would never grab on, this became insanly annoying in the finale of the game where you are racing Magica and getting out of the volcano(?). Where if you don't move quickly, you lose/die. I had to repeat these sections about 10-15 times because of this.The story itself feels like you are watching the show, and its awesome, however, it doesn't flow as well as I would've liked? But it's fine. The only one I felt was a bit lazy was the mole one. But that was just because I felt that the enemies' design was lazy and that level itself was really short. Other than that, I liked how it ended, I won't spoil it, but it reminded me of the first arc of DuckTales that I loved as a kid. I also love that you can go swim inside you vault full of money, but I don't like that even through I re-beat the levels I never get the treasures back in the vault. I do recommend this game, a lot, I'm just being really nitpicky. The music is awesome, the backgrounds are gorgous and playing this game has me in the mood to finally watch the entireity of DuckTales and has me hyped for the new show coming next year and I like it so much that I plan on getting the rest of the achivements (since there isn't a lot of them). I can tell that a lot of work was put into this game and that the people who made it loved the show and the last game and now I hope they make remakes of other Disney video games.			"

												What can I say about the glorious nostalgia  that is this game.  Take  what is  widely considered one of the best games on the NES update the graphics and sound and add a few other treats.  I  do not consider my self a retro gamer but i do make a few exceptions for beloved titles from when i was a wee  button masher.  This is one of them.  If you wantt to know what a perfect well balanced and well programed NES game was like this is it. Good  for bother experianced Gamers and  gentle enough for  the ones that dont quite have the skills but want to see the story unfold "

												This game was epic, short, but epic! Many cartoon fans and gamer fan can both get some fun outta this, there are some challenging puzzels, and you have the option to play with or without a map, (playing without the map increases difficulty!)Original voice actors return for this, which gives it that extra special feel to it, no animated cutscenes, just sprite cutscenes, which isn't bad, I would of like to see some high quality 2D disney animated cutscenes though.The sprites are hand drawn and look beautiful, and run very smooth.Overall this game is joy, you might finish it in a day or 2, but it is so worth buying!9 out 10 stars!

												The all-time Nes classic, now with a HD coat of paint and a story mode you don't have to read the manual to get.The... well, Nintendo hard difficulty isn't for everybody, but if you enjoyed the original or the cartoon, then there's a lot to love here. It says a lot about how gracefully this has aged,  that the only thing that this game changed outside visuals and sound was an optional, slightly easier control-sheme.A true platforming classic, well worth breaking your controller all over again for. Short, but with a lot of replayability.			"

												DuckTales Remastered is a faithful remake of one of the best NES games. This game plays just as well as the original with the same pogo stick, cane slamming action only a grumpy old duck can provide. The new remastered music captures the spirit of the original score. The graphics are fitting for the cartoon that the game is based off of. The voice work can be hit or miss, but it is fun to hear Alan Young one last time as Scrooge McDuck. The only major downside to this game is the cutscenes that will pause the gameplay and force the player to hear a story.If you were a fan of the original NES game, this is a great purchase.			"

												A very good remastering of an excellent game and well worth getting if you want a simple fun platformer. The character art is beautiful, the music is pleasant and a lot of work was put in to please fans of the show. My only complaint is the rapid spike in difficulty when you reach the last boss and the events that follow after it with dangling chain jumping occasionally being a fiddly process.			"

												I say yes I would recommend this game, however, only to those who have seen the show. Mostly because, yeah, I watched the show buit not fully, so I didn't get a lot of stufff in the game like Scrooge's first dime and why Magica wanted it (and who Magica even was). The humor in the game is a lot like the show and that is good but there wasn't enough to actually make me laugh. The graphics, however, were great and looked like you were watching the show because they looked (mostly) as they do in the show and almost all the orignal cast is back. I know this was based on the orignal game but I would've liked to play as some of the othe characters other than Scrooge. Like, fly Launchpad's plane during the bombing part or something? Also that it didn't really make sense in the story to have the kids out of the game, because they didn't do that in the show, in fact they rarely even listened and would've followed Scrooge. Sure they kinda did that in the Himliahs but I kinda wanted more character interaction. But thats just a nitpick. There are minor glitches in the game, and the controls aren't the greatest in the world. I personally played witha xbox 360 controller and ran the game on Windows 10 and I never had a huge issue with glitches. The worse I got was that I felt annoyed in the boss battle that I had to hit the bat in the excat spot in order to hit him but most of the time I would miss the bat, miss the second bat, or not get high to reach the boss. The gliches became more noticable the later I got in the game, expect for one, and it was the ropes/chains. For whatever reason, Scrooge would never grab on, this became insanly annoying in the finale of the game where you are racing Magica and getting out of the volcano(?). Where if you don't move quickly, you lose/die. I had to repeat these sections about 10-15 times because of this.The story itself feels like you are watching the show, and its awesome, however, it doesn't flow as well as I would've liked? But it's fine. The only one I felt was a bit lazy was the mole one. But that was just because I felt that the enemies' design was lazy and that level itself was really short. Other than that, I liked how it ended, I won't spoil it, but it reminded me of the first arc of DuckTales that I loved as a kid. I also love that you can go swim inside you vault full of money, but I don't like that even through I re-beat the levels I never get the treasures back in the vault. I do recommend this game, a lot, I'm just being really nitpicky. The music is awesome, the backgrounds are gorgous and playing this game has me in the mood to finally watch the entireity of DuckTales and has me hyped for the new show coming next year and I like it so much that I plan on getting the rest of the achivements (since there isn't a lot of them). I can tell that a lot of work was put into this game and that the people who made it loved the show and the last game and now I hope they make remakes of other Disney video games.			"

												DuckTales Remastered is a remake of the original DuckTales NES/Famicom game. The game completely redesigns the game by redoing the graphics to make them look similar to the original show, a remade OST by the wonderful Jake ""Virt"" Kaufman, and adding a new final level. As said on my profile, I'm a giant Disney fan, and this game made me explode into different pavilion icons from Epcot. This game is amazing.Also, apparently there's a bug that causes the game to crash before the final boss, but I haven't experienced it.			"

												Ducktales remastered is a fantastic platformer with great gameplay mechnanics.  The mix between beautiful 2d animation and 3d textures is very unique and adds a lot to what is already a fantastic game.  The game is surprisingly challenging, if you die you have to start the level all over again and these levels are not short!  The remastered soundtrack is fantastic and sets the mood for each of the destinations you visit during your journey.  My only gripe is there is a glitch at the end of the game that I encountered after killing the final boss where my game would freeze.  Luckily I found a fix that worked for me and all I had to do was skip the cutscene immediatley after delivering the final blow to the final boss.  But besides that minor issue the game played just fine on my pc and I highly recommend this game to any platforming fans, ducktales fans, Disney fans, or honestly anyone.			"

												A dutifully crafted remake of one of the best NES games of all time. It says a lot about a game when I purposefully drag out my 360 controller from the cobwebbed depths from which it has slumbered. The controls are crisp, and faithful to the original down to the ""hard pogo"" which use to get you into some spicy situations with hit detection back in the day. A tutorial level has been added, but it actually fits the game perfectly, and isn't ham-fisted, nor does it treat you like you have 4 functioning brain cells. The voice actors have all returned and do an outsatnding job, The music has to be heard to be beleived. finding the secrets is just as rewarding and satisfying as the original. I'm going to play this in bursts so I can savor every byte of it. The feels this game brought me so far, are invaluable. I would have paid 60 dollars for this easily. At certain points i forgot I wasn't playing the original.  10/10 - A must buy.			"

												Now this is how a remake should be done - by bringing it forward with the enhancements, but keeping the core gameplay and nostalgia intact. The way that WayForward treated this classic with all the respect and care it deserves makes one hope that they decide to revive other old classics in the same careful, tactful way they've shown here.

												Ah Ducktales Remastered. I'll admit this game had me unsure at first because I was already aware of some of its flaws but then again, its beautifully-rendered 2.5D graphics and the music tracks especially the Moon Theme drew me in and it was what convinced me to finally buy this game during a sale.OK so what's great about it? The graphics are amazing as I've said. The animators worked so hard to recreate the Disney characters and they succeeded. They look like they leapt straight out of the cartoon and into the game. The music...good God it's beautiful. The Moon theme is great but the Mount Vesuvius theme ain't no slouch either. It's a new track and despite it being like this industrial dubstep/EDM sound, it strangely works. The gameplay itself is simple and straightforward but that doesn't mean it's easy. This is a remaster of an NES classic after all and that means a lot of platforming. Overshoot or undershoot your attacks or jumps and you lose health or die. Basically, it gives a decent challenge (for the most part).Now what's bad? Notice the ""for the most part"" above referring to the game's challenge? Well this has more to do with the game design. The levels prior to the final level are fairly the same difficulty but the last level is like going from a 0 to a 100 in less than a second. I understand challenge but challenge should be given gradually to the player not just thrown around like a slap to the face. Another notable flaw I'm sure you already probably know of is the constant cutscenes throughout the level. It just disrupts the game too often. I wouldn't mind if they were before or after a level but the levels instead have a ton of cutscenes in between and it really kills the mood. Now if you say ""Just skip the cutscene!"" which you could but if you're following the game's story (like me), then cutscenes are necessary. Maybe if they cut them down some then it could have worked.Overall, the game is still highly suggested. It may have the two prior flaws but it is still highly enjoyable. Plus, there are a lot of extras to get including the music, TV show concept art, video game concept art, the approved art sprites for the game and so much more. Again, it's not perfect but with what I got, I was still satisfied. It just felt so good to play Ducktales again after so long. If you can get past the two prior flaws, this will be a great game to add to your library especially if you grew up with the show. 3/4 stars.			"
